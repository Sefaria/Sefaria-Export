Jerusalem Talmud Niddah



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Shammai says, every woman’s timing is exact<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A menstruating woman is impure and imparts original impurity to anything she sits on (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:19-23" href="/Leviticus.15.19-23"><i>Lev</i>. 15:19–23</a>). While impurity of food is not mentioned in these verses, it is taken for granted that if she imparts impurity to implements that do not easily become impure, certainly she imparts impurity to food which easily becomes impure. The impurity is defined (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:19" href="/Leviticus.15.19">v. 19</a>) by “blood is flowing from her flesh”. Shammai holds that a woman notices exactly when her period starts; therefore any food she touches after the onset of her period is impure but anything she had touched before is pure.</i>; Hillel says, from checking to checking<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hillel holds that blood dropscan separate from the uterine wall without necessarily flowing out of the vagina. For him, all food a woman touched between the last time she checked herself thoroughly and the noticed onset of her period are retroactively declared possibly impure.</i>, even if that is a long time. But the Sages say following neither of them but for checking to checking to be reduced by 24 hours, and from 24 hours to be reduced by checking<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For them, a woman with a regular period does not have to worry about retroactive impurity (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.1.1.1">Mishnah 2</a>). If she has no regular period, she is expected to check herself from time to time but the retroactive impurity cannot extend to more than 24 hours; the interval of impurity is the smaller of 24 hours and the time from the last thorough check.</i>.<br>Every woman with a regular period<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Latin <i>svetum</i>, corresponding to Hebrew אורח “regularity”; cf. E. and H. Guggenheimer, Notes on the Talmudic Vocabulary 8–11, <i>Lešonenu</i> 37 (1973), 105–112.</i> follows her exact timing; and if one has intercourse with cloths<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">After intercourse (according to Rashi: before and after intercourse) she wipes herself with a clean cloth which can be inspected the next morning. The connection of the word עדים to the biblical <i>hapax</i> in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 64:5" href="/Isaiah.64.5"><i>Is</i>. 64:5</a> is due to Qimhi; according to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 64:5" href="/Isaiah.64.5">Rashi (<i>Is</i>. 64:5</a>), the biblical word is an Aramaism and means “to be discarded”. In <i>Niddah</i>, Rashi seems to to read עֵד “a witness”.</i>, this counts as checking and is reduced by 24 hours and by checking.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Shammai says, every woman’s timing is exact,” etc. What means, “their timing is exact”? They do not retroactively impart impurity to food prepared in purity. “But the Sages say following neither of them,” not following Shammai who imposed no restriction, and not like Hillel who went overboard. “But for checking to checking it is reduced by 24 hours, and from 24 hours is reduced by checking.” How is checking to checking reduced by 24 hours? If she checked herself on Tuesday and saw blood on Thursday, [her food] is impure only from the same time on Wednesday. How is 24 hours reduced by checking? If she checked herself out in the morning and saw in the afternoon, it is impure only starting from the morning<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A slightly longer version is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 4b" href="/Niddah.4b">Babli, 4b</a>, and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.1.1">Tosefta 1:1–2</a>.</i>.
There<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 7:2.</i>, we have stated: “A [dead] crawling animal<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Eight animals, reptiles, rats, and moles are enumerated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:29-38" href="/Leviticus.11.29-38"><i>Lev</i>. 11:29–38</a>. In death, they are original sources of severe impurity.</i> found in a dead-end alley<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A dead-end alley bordered on both sides by walls, either the back walls of houses or the walls of courtyards. One enters the houses of the alley through the courtyards. While the dead-end alley is public domain, it is not subject to all the rules of public domains since it is used only by its inhabitants and their visitors. It can be turned into a private domain as far as the rules of the Sabbath are concerned (this is the topic of Tractate <i>Erubin</i>). It is a private domain for the rules of impurity, meaning that a doubt of impurity has to treated as presumptive impurity; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 1:2:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.1.2.5"><i>Soṭah</i> 1:2, Note 88</a>.</i> causes impurity retroactively<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah continues: “up to the time it was swept (with a broom).” If any food was transported through the alley, one assumes that the bearer touched the dead crawling thing, became impure, and transferred that impurity to the food he was carrying. One assumes that sweeping the alley with a broom cleans it, but one fears that the animal died very soon after the alley was swept. Therefore, it seems that impurity in a dead-end alley follows Hillel’s rules.</i>. Rebbi Immi asked, does this Mishnah not disagree with Shammai? Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It would seem that one has to read: R. Yasa, R. Immi’s companion.</i> said, this is true, it does not follow Shammai, but even Hillel it does not follow. Does Hillel not agree that a dead-end alley which was swept or inundated by a rainstorm<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, nobody checked but one assumes that the rain swept everything away. This case appears neither in the Mishnah nor in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 6:8" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.6.8">Tosephta (6:12</a>).</i> is pure? Shammai says, since this woman regularly urinates<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">She would notice any blood at that time.</i>, she is like a dead-end alley which was swept or inundated by a rainstorm and is pure<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Shammai’s position is the most rational one. It presumes that the Mishnah speaks of an alley which is swept regularly (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 56" href="/Niddah.56">Babli 56a/b</a>). In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 3a" href="/Niddah.3a">Babli, 3a</a>, Hillel denies that a woman will check herself for blood when urinating.</i>.
So far if she checked and found herself dry<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">No discharge whatsoever.</i>. If she checked and found herself pure<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">She found a discharge from her body but it was of a kind declared pure in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.2.7.1">Mishnah 2:6</a>. The existence of pure genital discharges is Pharisaic doctrine, absolutely denied by all Sadducee sources known to us; cf. the Damascus Document CD 5:7, Mishnah 4:2.</i>? Rebbi Immi in the name of Rav, Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Jehudah: If she checked and found herself pure she is forbidden to her husband until her [blood’s] source dries up<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is the standard Babylonian doctrine, culminating in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 66a" href="/Niddah.66a">Babli (66a</a>) in R. Ze‘ira’s doctrine, which accepts the Sadducee doctrine that all discharges are impure and, in order to avoid the consequences of this doctrine which are unacceptable in Pharisaic practice, treats every menstrual discharge as a continuing non-menstrual discharge (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:25-30" href="/Leviticus.15.25-30"><i>Lev</i>. 15:25–30</a>), which requires an additional seven days before purity may be achieved. Babylonian practice accepts the distinction between pure and impure discharges only for the rules of impurity, which were irrelevant in Babylonia, but not for those of marital relations.</i>. One Rebbi Tobi said in the name of Rebbi Abbahu, she is forbidden to her house for 24 hours. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, when I<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A Babylonian immigrating into Palestine.</i> immigrated here, I heard from all rabbis that she is immediately permitted to her husband<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the determination of the character of blood as pure or impure is in the domain of competence of a rabbi, it follows that the woman who claims her blood to be pure has to show her blood to a rabbi. It is not to be assumed that any woman did that unless her household was run on the rules of ritual purity, i. e., a family of Cohanim or of “fellows” (cf. Introduction to Tractate <i>Demay</i>).</i>. They wanted to say that for him who says, she is permitted to her husband, this is a check which diminishes from 24 hours<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">All the food she prepares remains pure.</i>, but for him who says, she is forbidden to her husband, it is not counted as a check which diminishes from 24 hours<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">If she later has an impure discharge, the food becomes retroactively impure.</i>. But even for him who says, she is forbidden to her husband, it is counted as a check which diminishes from 24 hours<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">There is no reason to make the status of the check depend on its outcome.</i>. Why is she forbidden to her husband? Because she is used to pure blood, she might get used to impure blood<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Once she is used to the looks of the pure discharge, she might decide herself about the quality of her discharge and wrongly qualify impure for pure. The prohibition of marital relations in this case is purely rabbinical; it has no biblical source.</i>.
If she checked herself and found it a doubtful case<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If it cannot be decided whether the discharge is pure or impure. (This is the explanation of R. Moses Margalit. It is somewhat difficult to accept since (a) in matters of biblical prohibitions a doubt has to be resolved in a restrictive way and (b) this is a matter of impurity in a private domain and has to be declared impure; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 1:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.1.1.3">Note 9</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 1:2:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.1.2.5"><i>Soṭah</i> 1:2 Note 88</a>. Therefore, it seems more likely that it cannot be determined whether there was any discharge.)</i>. It is obvious that it is not counted as a check to diminish from 24 hours<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">If later this was followed by a genuine discharge, the previous doubt was resolved and food retroactively became impure for 24 hours.</i>. Itself<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The blood according to R. Moses Margalit, or alternatively the cloth used for the check.</i>, would it be impure because of doubt? Let us hear from the following: “A sexless<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.1.2">Tosephta 1:3</a>. The sexless has neither penis nor vagina, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.6.1"><i>Yebamot</i>8:6, Note 226</a>. He could be a male with an ingrown penis. It is difficult to see how he could have a female genital discharge.</i> or a hermaphrodite<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">He has penis, testicles, breasts and vagina; if he has a discharge, its status is in doubt since if he is a male, the vaginal discharge is irrelevant. Cf. <i>Yebamot</i> 8:6, Notes 224,225,236,237,242.</i> who had a discharge follow their exact timing.” What do you infer from this? Rebbi Yose said, a sexless or a hermaphrodite represent a doubt, 24 hours represent a doubt, and a doubt is not superimposed on a doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli, this is called סְפֵק סְפֵיקָא “a doubt superimposed on a doubt” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 75a" href="/Kiddushin.75a"><i>Qiddušin</i> 75a</a>); a prohibition in such a case would be disregarded. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.4"><i>Ketubot</i> 1:1 Note 23</a>, <i>Yebamot</i> 16:1, last line.</i>. So here, whether she had a discharge<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">R. Moses Margalit would translate: “The nature of her discharge is in doubt”.</i> represents a doubt, 24 hours represent a doubt, and a doubt is not superimposed on a doubt.

One may assume that the Yerushalmi refers to a similar text and that Rav Ḥisda the Babylonian’s question really refers to this, that under normal circumstances the impurity of a menstruating woman without regular period should act retroactively on food prepared in purity outside of Jerusalem.</i> that she missed for three periods and then had a period.

But it must be food prepared in the purity of sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Profane food, eaten by people who insist that they adhere to strict standards of purity. While most of these, called “fellows”, observed the standards of heave (which recognizes three degrees of derivative impurity, cf.

A minority opinion admits three degrees, but certainly not four. This may be a polemic against followers of sects similar to that of Qumran, whose MMT text seems to prescribe the purity of sacrifices for all members of the group of the select few.</i>? Explain it if it was prepared in the purity of purifying water<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The water to which ashes from the red cow were added and which purified from the impurity of the dead.

It was stated: For the 24 hours which were stated, one suspends but one does not burn<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If heave was declared “impure” because a woman had handled it within 24 hours of her menstrual impurity, it cannot be burned as impure heave since the declaration was purely precautionary; the woman might have been impure when touching the heave.

It has to be left unused until it spoils, is no longer food, and automatically loses its sanctified status.</i>. Rebbi Ze‘ira enjoyed this [because] he found stated<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 9:5" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.9.5">Tosephta 9:6</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 9:4" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.9.4">5</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 6a" href="/Niddah.6a">Babli 6a</a>, both in slightly different formulation.</i>: “A woman who detects a stain<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">She detects a blood stain on her garment.

If a clay vessel has a cover fastened to it, it also cannot become impure by the impurity of the dead. But if either a (male or female) sufferer from gonorrhea or a menstruating woman indirectly moves a clay vessel, for example moving a wooden plank (in itself impervious to impurity) on which there is a closed clay vessel, that vessel and its contents become impure.</i> and does not make clay vessels impure.

That means, what she certainly touched in the public domain is impure.
Rebbi Yudan asked: She checked her garment in the morning and found it pure, in the afternoon and found a stain on it. It is obvious that her garment is retroactively impure only after the time of her checking. Is her body impure for retroactive 24 hours? Does one not declare her body to be impure only because of her garment? Her garment is retroactively impure only after the time of her checking; her body should retroactively be impure for 24 hours<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The 24 hour rule is never mentioned in connection with stains.</i>?
“And if one has intercourse with cloths, this counts as checking.” How is that? If she checked herself in the morning, had intercourse with a cloth at noontime, and saw [blood] in the afternoon, she is impure only from after the time of intercourse. Levi said, the Mishnah speaks of a cloth used after intercourse, but for a cloth used before intercourse she would be impatient for her mate and not check thorougly. Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Ze‘ira, the Mishnah speaks of a cloth used before intercourse, but a cloth used after intercourse is faded because of semen<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 5a" href="/Niddah.5a">Babli, 5a</a>, requires both checks.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How is her timing exact<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The woman with a regular period, who may prepare pure food until close to the time of her period.</i>? If she was sitting on a bed occupied with pure food, if she left [the bed] and saw blood, she is impure but all the food is pure. Even though they said, she is retroactively impure for 24 hours<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The woman without an established period.</i>, she counts only from the moment she saw. Rebbi Eliezer says, the timings of four kinds of women are exact: a virgin<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the next Mishnah, this is a young girl who never had a period, independent of any sexual activities she might have had.</i>, and a pregnant woman, and a nursing one, and a post-menopausal. Rebbi Joshua said, I heard only about the virgin, but practice follows Rebbi Eliezer.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Rebbi Joshua said, I heard only about the virgin, but practice follows Rebbi Eliezer.” One does not say, somebody who did not see the new moon should come and testify<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">To testify that he saw the new moon, to proclaim a new month.</i>, but one says, if somebody saw the new moon, he should come and testify<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In the language of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 2:2" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.2.2">Mishnah (<i>Idiut</i> 2:2</a>): “‘We did not see’ is no proof;” neither is ‘we did not hear’.</i>.

Where do we hold? If Rebbi Eliezer heard from one [authority] but Rebbi Joshua from two, practice should follow Rebbi Joshua whether [Rebbi Eliezer] was alive or dead.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> What is a virgin? Any female who never saw blood, even if she was married. Pregnant, once the fetus is recognizable. Nursing, until she weans her child<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">24 months after birth, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 4:3:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.4.3.3"><i>Soṭah</i> 4:4, Note 57</a>.</i>. If she gave her child to a wet-nurse or weaned him, Rebbi Meïr says she causes retroactive impurity for 24 hours but the Sages say, her timing is exact<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The entire 24 months.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “What is a virgin? Any one,” etc. So is the Mishnah: Any one who never did menstruate; they spoke of one virginal for blood, not one virginal for sexual relations. Sometimes she is virginal for blood and not virginal for sexual relations, sometimes she is virginal for sexual relations and not virginal for blood. She is virginal for blood if she started to menstruate before marrying; she is virginal for sexual relations if she married before menstruating.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash <i>Samuel</i> 26:2; Tosephta <i>Ševiʻit</i> 3:10, in a different order which is followed also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 8b" href="/Niddah.8b">Babli <i>Niddah</i> 8b</a>. This <i>baraita</i> somehow negates the Mishnah which transfers to name of “virgin” to the pre-menstrual girl.</i>: “There are three virgins: a human virgin, a virgin sycamore, and virgin soil. A human virgin, who never had intercourse. A virgin sycamore, which never was cut<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Sycamores were planted not for their fruits but to produce logs for buildings. The sycamore can be cut and from the stump a new (and larger) tree will grow; cf. <i>Ševiʻit</i> 4:5, Note 71.</i>. Virgin soil, which never was ploughed<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Really: on which never any grooves had been made, referring to the furrows.</i>; Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, which has no groove<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">If no signs of agricultural activity are visible on the soil. In Babylonia the צ of חֶרֶץ (which in Babylonian and modern Hebrew would be חָרִיץ) was heard as ס, resulting in חֶרֶס, חֶרֶשׂ “potsherd”. Therefore, the Babylonian texts (and Midrash <i>Samuel</i>) declare as virgin any soil on which no potsherds are found (which would prove human activity at the place).</i><sub>’</sub><sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Here ends the first Geniza fragment of this Tractate.</i>.”
“Even if she was married,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Mishnah which enumerates the women whose impurity is not retroactive, in particular the girl having a baby without ever having menstruated.</i>” even if pregnant, even if nursing, and even if she was bleeding all seven [days] for a boy or all fourteen for a girl<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:25" href="/Leviticus.15.25"><i>Lev.</i> 15:25</a> creates a special category, <i>zavah</i>, for a woman whose discharge of blood is prolonged “many days after her menstrual period”, who is subject to more complicated rules of cleansing. Since “days” must mean a minimum of two days, “many days” must mean at least three days (by the hermeneutic principle of definiteness, cf. H. Guggenheimer, Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition, in: <i>Confrontations with Judaism</i>, Ph. Longworth, ed., Blond, London 1966, pp. 174–175). Now it is stated here that bleeding after childbirth cannot induce a status of <i>zavah</i> since (1) the time span of 7 days after the birth of a boy and 14 after that of a girl are defined as “menstrual impurity” and (2) this is followed by a <i>period of purity</i> of 33 days (for a boy) or 66 (for a girl) in which no discharge has any implication for impurity (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 12:4-5" href="/Leviticus.12.4-5"><i>Lev.</i>12:4–5</a>). Therefore, the only way a birth is followed by a status of <i>zavah</i> would be if the bloody discharges persist all through the period of purity.</i>. Does she have a charm in her hand<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">This is a little pedantic about the formulation of the text, from which one might infer that the pregnancy already determines the length of the period of impurity. The text is then elaborated to indicate that this period is determined only at the time of delivery.</i>? After [the birth of] a boy seven [days], after a girl fourteen, but only if she stopped during her period of purity. As it was stated: If she stopped during her period of purity and had no discharge, but later she had a discharge; this case came before the Sages who said that her timing was exact<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The status of the “blood virgin” is not changed by pregnancy and all the bleeding necessarily connected with giving birth.</i>. In Rav’s opinion, who says that all is one source but the Torah purified it, it is understandable<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the discussion of the condition that the discharges stop sometime during the period of purity. Rav holds that the blood lost during childbirth and the menstrual blood are of equal character, the period of purity is a biblical decree whose reason is unknown but a continuation of the discharge beyond this period shows that menstrual blood is flowing for “many days”. (Everybody agrees that prolonged flow before the actual delivery creates a status of <i>zavah.</i>) Therefore, a retention of the status of “blood virgin” necessitates the cessation of discharge during the period of purity (or even earlier). Rav’s opinion is detailed in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 35b:1" href="/Niddah.35b.1">Babli, 1 la, 35b</a>.</i>. In Rebbi Yannai’s opinion, who says that all is one source but it changes, it is in order<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion is not reported in the Babli. The only difference to Rav’s opinion is theoretical, that the biblical decree of the period of purity has a biological explanation.</i>. In Levi’s opinion, who says that there are two sources, should not her timing be exact even if she does not stop during her period of purity<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">His opinion is also discussed in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 11a" href="/Niddah.11a">Babli, 11a</a> and 35b. He holds that the blood lost in childbirth is different in nature from menstrual blood. Then it is difficult to see why menstrual virginity should depend on a cessation of childbirth discharges during the period of purity.</i>? Rebbi Mana said, the reason of Levi is that since she became used to pure blood, she might become used to impure blood<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Levi also subscribes to the cessation rule, but only as one of purely rabbinic character. Since she is used to discharges, she does not react to a menstrual discharge with the speed necessary to avoid retroactive contamination.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Levi can explain what we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 1:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.1.4.1">Mishnah 1:5</a>.</i>: “Rebbi Yose said, the timing of a pregnant or a nursing woman who had stopped for three periods is exact.” On that it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 1:6" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.1.6">Tosephta 1:10</a>: “R. Yose and R. Simeon say that the timing of a pregnant or a nursing woman is not exact unless there passed three periods (without menstruation); the days of her pregnancy and those of her nursing are added together.” It is clear that pregnancy and nursing cannot be counted together if the blood lost in childbirth is of menstrual character. Therefore, the Tosephta and the similar <i>baraita</i> quoted in the text are intelligible for Levi, not for Rav.</i>: The days of her pregnancy and her nursing add up to three periods. Can he think that there is only one source?
<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the Halakhah, the text parallels <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:11" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.11"><i>Yebamot</i> 4:11, Notes 130–155</a>.</i> How long is it until a pregnancy is recognized? Symmachos said in the name of Rebbi Meïr: After three months. Even though it is no proof, there is a hint: “It was after about three months, etc.” Rebbi Yudan said, even for a phantom pregnancy, “we were pregnant, we were sick, as if we gave birth to wind,” “get pregnant with dry grass, give birth to straw”, etc. Rebbi Ze‘ira, Rebbi Abba bar Zuṭra said, Rebbi Ḥanina in the name of the Great Rebbi Ḥiyya: Even most of the first, most of the last, and the middle one complete. Assi said, a full 90 days. Samuel said, they in their fulness. A case came before the rabbis there; we do not know if thirteen of the first and seventeen of the last or seventeen of the first and thirteen of the last, and five complete ones in the middle; they wanted to touch the child because of a doubt of bastardy. Rav Naḥman bar Jacob told them, such a case came before Abba bar Abba and he declared it acceptable. Does Abba bar Abba disagree with his son Samuel? Rebbi Abba said, there is a difference between recognizing a pregnancy and giving birth. A pregnancy is recognized after full months, a birth can happen after fractional months. There, we have stated: “How long can labor be? Rebbi Meïr said, even 40 to 50 days. Rebbi Jehudah said, her month is sufficient. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon say, no labor lasts longer than two weeks.” Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Abba: This implies that a woman gives birth after fractional months. Since otherwise one should have stated “thirty days”. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Samuel: This implies that a woman gives birth after full months. Since we have stated: “Her month is sufficient.”
Rebbi Yudan asked: Does this hold until she gives birth? No, even if she had a miscarriage.
Rebbi Mana said, I heard in the name of Samuel that there is no difference between recognizing a pregnancy and giving birth, but I do not remember from whom I heard this. Rebbi Abba bar Cohen said before Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Jeremiah said this. Rebbi Ḥizqyah said to him, Rebbi Jeremiah did not say this; Rebbi Yose was offended by him. He said to him: Even Joshua who was bound to Moses would not have said so, but you said so! He checked himself and said, it is true that he said that but as a person who quotes something and questions it; does Abba bar Abba disagree with his son Samuel? Rebbi Berekhiah in the name of Samuel: A woman gives birth only either after 271, 272, 273, or 274 days. Rebbi Mana said to him, from whom did the rabbi hear this? He said to him, from Rebbi Abba. The position of Rebbi Abba seems inverted. There, he says, there is a difference between recognizing a pregnancy and giving birth, and here, he says so? Rebbi Abba bar Zuṭra in the name of Samuel: Everything which is “many” is 273.
Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi was sitting before Rav who saw him disturbed. He said to him, what is the matter? He said to him, my female donkey is pregnant and will give birth; then I have to get her to copulate before she is out of heat. He said to him, when did the male mount her? He said, on day X. He calculated and said, she still has some time until then. It was stated so: A quick one does not need less than the days of the moon and one who is late is not later than the days of the sun. The words of Rebbi Joshua disagree, since Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, the cattle herd of Antoninus passed by and those of the house of Rebbi took bulls from them to copulate. Some cows gave birth soon and some of them later. Here it is about an impure animal, there about a pure animal. But is it not written, “do you know the time the mountain goats will give birth, watch the birthing of gazelles,” “count months, make them complete, you will know the time of their giving birth.” He told him: A pure wild animal is like a domestic impure animal.

Since “days” must mean a minimum of two days, “many days” must mean at least three days (by the hermeneutic principle of definiteness, cf. H. Guggenheimer, Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition, in: <i>Confrontations with Judaism</i>, Ph. Longworth, ed., Blond, London 1966, pp. 174–175). Now it is stated here that bleeding after childbirth cannot induce a status of <i>zavah</i> since (1) the time span of 7 days after the birth of a boy and 14 after that of a girl are defined as “menstrual impurity” and (2) this is followed by a <i>period of purity</i> of 33 days (for a boy) or 66 (for a girl) in which no discharge has any implication for impurity (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 12:4-5" href="/Leviticus.12.4-5"><i>Lev.</i>12:4–5</a>).

Samuel said, a night and a day form a period, and part of a period is as if it were the entire period<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the case of a girl who was married after she reached puberty. In Mishnah 10:1, it is stated that the House of Shammai permit only the first intercourse which deflowers her, because the blood she loses as a consequence is considered as if it were menstrual blood. In the Mishnah and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 9:6" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.9.6">Tosephta 9:8</a>, the House of Hillel is reported to permit intercourse the entire first night. In the Tosephta (quoted in the Babli, 65a), Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says “one gives her a full period, half a day and the night”, meaning the first night and the following morning. In the <i>baraita</i> known to Samuel, the statement simply must have been “one gives her a full period,” and he explains that a full period is night and day but that part of the day (until midday) is already counted as the entire day and after that, for the remainder of the wedding week, the bride is forbidden to the husband as if she were menstruating.</i>. “If she ceased and then bled again, she is impure”<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 9:6" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.9.6">Tosephta 9:7</a> it is explained that if a girl had not reached puberty when she was married, the wound from deflowering had healed, and she was able to have intercourse without bleeding, if then she bleeds for any reason she is impure as menstruating. That is the meaning of the small excerpt quoted here.</i>. If the look of the blood changed, she is impure. Rebbi Ze‘ira said, if it did not change because of intercourse<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">The first part of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Niddah 9:6" href="/Tosefta_Niddah.9.6">Tosephta 9:8</a> states: “If the look of the blood was changed she is impure as menstruating.” R. Ze‘ira disputes this reading and holds that if the blood is mingled with semen, it is obvious that she is injured by the intercourse; she remains pure until for the first time she bleeds not in connection with intercourse.</i>. But if it changed because of intercourse, she is pure. Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah says so, “a virgin whose blood is pure.” That implies, if it changed because of intercourse, she is pure. Since if you said, if it changed because of intercourse she is impure, let her have intercourse with a cloth, maybe it would change because of intercourse and she would be impure<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">The argument goes as follows: The Mishnah here states that a pre-puberty girl does not have to check herself when she works on pure food, and she does not have to check herself when she sleeps with her husband. If she could be impure by bleeding during intercourse, she should be prevented from working with pure food unless she checked herself after each intercourse. Since she is not prevented, if follows that she cannot be held to be menstruating unless either she reached puberty or she once bled in a way not connected with intercourse.</i>!
“Twice she has to check herself,” etc. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Bun said, corresponding to the two times in which the day changes for creatures<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">From darkness to light and from light to darkness. The rule is purely one of convention, not intrinsic to the situation.</i>.
Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia: In every situation in which the Sages said that her husband would be obligated for a sacrifice, pure food became impure; her husband would be exempt from a sacrifice, pure food remains pure; her husband would have to bring a sacrifice for a doubt, pure food is in limbo<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 60b" href="/Niddah.60b">Babli 60b</a> (and later in this paragraph in the Yerushalmi) this is attributed to Bar Pada or Pedaiah. Rashi explains the text:<br>A woman was occupied with pure food and noticed she was bleeding; since if that were to happen during intercourse her husband would have to bring a purification sacrifice (for a sin committed inadvertently), we assume that the blood was already there when she was touching the pure food, the food is certainly impure and has to be burned. But if only a short time after she was finished with the food she noticed it, since if she did notice blood a short time <i>after</i> intercourse her husband would have to bring an expiation sacrifice (not knowing whether a sin has been committed, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 2:6:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.2.6.4"><i>Bikkurim</i> 2:9 Note 162</a>), the food can neither be used nor burned. If the woman detected the blood after a longer interval, the husband is in the clear and the food is pure.</i>. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac asked: If an old man and a child walk in a dining room, does the old man not enter first? But the child can come and make a fool of him<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">This simile is slightly pornographic. The dining hall is the woman’s womb, the old man the penis, and the child menstrual blood. Even though the penis closes the entrance, the blood can sneak out before the penis leaves. The implication is that even in the case in which the husband only would be obligated for the expiation sacrifice, the food should be declared impure and be burned.</i>. Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Yudan: I say, it was here but the intercourse stopped it from leaving; but there, what hindered it to leave<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">The argument in the preceding simile does not apply; a woman working in the kitchen is not to be compared to a woman during intercourse. In the first case, blood will flow out immediately under the action of gravity; in the second case she is lying down and her vagina is closed by the man’s penis.</i>? The Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.1.2.1">Mishnah 1:3</a>. This refers to a case which, when occurring immediately after intercourse, would obligate the husband for an expiation sacrifice. Nevertheless, the food remains pure if the woman has a regular, predictable, period. (In the Babli, R. Hoshaia is reported to oppose the opinion ascribed to him in the present paragraph and to hold that in all cases other that direct touch by an impure person, pure food is held in limbo. This also is denied by the  Mishnah quoted.)</i> disagrees with Rebbi Hoshaiah: “If she left [the bed] and saw blood, she is impure but all the food is pure.” The Mishnah disagrees with Bar Pedaiah<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 60b" href="/Niddah.60b">Babli 60b</a> (and later in this paragraph in the Yerushalmi) this is attributed to Bar Pada or Pedaiah.

Not that if she would bleed, the food should not retroactively become impure<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Jehudah’s opinion can only be explained in the case that he requires a verification to avoid retroactive impurity even where the husband would be free from any obligation of sacrifice if there remains the possibility of retroactive impurity.

Rebbi Ezra said before Rebbi Mana: Explain it for a woman who has no regular period<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Following Mishnah 1.</i>. He said to him, so says my teacher Rebbi Yose: All that is described here is about a woman who has a regular period. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the Mishnah rises<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah has two parts; R.

Then it is also clear that if for any reason whatsoever the continuation of the regular period is in doubt, there can be no computation. The explanation given by R. Abba earlier in this paragraph is shown to be invalid since the woman is certain to have become impure by the time of her regular period and, therefore, has no presumption of purity. The only way to admit R. Joḥanan’s statement is one based on the computation of pure days when there is no known change in the wife’s regular period.</i>.

The argument is that in both verses the plural is used; an indefinite plural always means 2 (cf. H.

Meïr agrees that green discharge is not menstrual blood and therefore not impure in itself, but as a body fluid it will have the power to prepare dry food for impurity. R.

Therefore, all others, even if they are darker than the standards, are pure. The town of Rav Jehudah followed Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish but Rav Jehudah himself followed Rebbi Joḥanan.

Rebbi Ḥelbo told them: So says Rav Huna in the name of Rav: Black which penetrates<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">The blood colors any textile but the stain never reflects light.</i> is pure, that which polishes is impure.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If a woman miscarried a sole or a placenta,” etc. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Jehudah: There only is a sole because it was weighed down by a living [fetus]; it comes out not with a living but with a dead [child]<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">If one of a pair of twins kills its sibling in the womb, he himself will die in the womb.</i>. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya objected: did we not state, “if a woman miscarried a sole or a placenta, she should observe for male and female birth”? That means, it is a child<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">It is stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Keritot 1:3" href="/Mishnah_Keritot.1.3">Mishnah <i>Keritut</i>1:3</a> that a woman having a miscarriage of a sole or a placenta is obligated to bring a sacrifice (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 12:6-8" href="/Leviticus.12.6-8"><i>Lev.</i> 12:6–8</a>) which is eaten by the Temple priests. This implies that this miscarriage is a complete birth in the sense of the biblical text. But Rav Jehudah seems to imply that these miscarriages are always accompanied by a regular stillbirth, which requires a sacrifice by the simple wording of the text. It seems that the Mishnah in <i>Keritut</i> is superfluous. The Mishnah here can be justified as informing on the periods of impurity and purity which are changed from those induced by the stillbirth.</i>!

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The daughters of Samaritans are menstruating from their cribs<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It can happen that a newborn baby girl, under the influence of the activated sex hormones of the mother, shows a slight vaginal discharge. According to pharisaic tradition, such a baby girl has to be purified by immersion in a <i>miqweh.</i> The Samaritans, a Sadducee sect, apply the rules of menstruation only to girls from their puberty on. Therefore, a prepuberty Samaritan girl might be impure by Pharisaic standards.</i>, and Samaritan men make impure bottoms like uppers<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is a technical term not easily translated. The sufferer from gonorrhea makes any textile on his couch severely impure; that textile has the ability to make humans and vessels impure. A garment worn by the sufferer from gonorrhea is also impure, but it makes only food and drink impure. The textile on the couch of a man who slept with a menstruating woman (the <i>bottom</i>) is impure in the impurity of a garment of the sufferer from gonorrhea (the <i>upper</i>)<i>.</i></i> because they sleep with menstruating woman since they sit for every blood<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Samaritans, like all Sadducees, are extremely careful not to sleep with menstruating women. They are treated here as “sleepers with menstruating women” because they consider any vaginal discharge as menstrual; they do not recognize the different shades of blood at the core of pharisaic doctrine (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 2:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.2.6.1">Mishnah 2:5</a>). If a woman has a discharge, she starts counting 7 days and then cleanses herself in a <i>miqweh.</i> But in pharisaic theory, she could have a pure discharge on the first day and an impure on the second or third; then the seventh day of her count would be only the sixth or fifth for a pharisaic woman. Therefore, a Samaritan woman might tell her husband that she was pure when in pharisaic theory she was still impure. (A pharisaic woman only has the choice either of showing her blood to a rabbi or to start counting from the last day of her period.)<br>The compliment was returned by the Sadducees who accused the Pharisees to “make the Temple impure because they do not separate themselves [from their wives] following the Torah and sleep with one who sees the blood of her discharge” (CD V:6).</i>. But one is not guilty about them for entering the Temple and one does not burn heave because of them since their impurity is one of doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is very unlikely that a Samaritan girl or man really be impure when he or she say that they are pure, one cannot act on their impurity except of not using heave touched by a Samaritan.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The daughters of Samaritans are menstruating from their cribs,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Also quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 65b" href="/Niddah.65b">Babli, 65b</a>.</i> Menstrual blood is dirty, virginal blood is not dirty. Menstrual blood is red, virginal blood is not red. Menstrual blood is from the womb, virginal blood is not from the womb but from the side.

Halakhah 2

Les Sadducéennes, qui se rattachent aux usages de leurs ancêtres, sont égales aux Samaritaines. Si clics se distinguent d’eux et observent formellement les usages des Israélites, on les considère do même.

Halakhah 3

Le sang vu par une païenne et l’écoulement sanguin pur d’une femme lépreuse restent purs, selon l‘école de Schammaï ; d'après l’écolo do Hillci, il équivaut à la salive de celle femme (est impur), ou à son urine. Le sang d'une accouchée qui n’a pas encore pris le bain de purification, selon l’école de Schammaï, équivaut à sa salive ou à son urine (impure) ; selon l'école de Hillel, il rend impur soit humide, soit sec. Ils reconnaissent tous que si la femme accoucho pendant qu’elle csL atteinte d’un flux de gonorrhée, elle rend impur ce qui est humide ou sec.

Halakhah 4

Si une femme a des pertes accompagnées de douleurs avant l’accouchement, et s’il y a rémission de ces douleurs pendant 24 heures entières avant l’accouchement, on doit admettre que la perle ne venait pas de l’accouchement, quoique la perte n'ait pas cessé; s’il n’y a pas de rémission de douleurs pendant 24 heures, les douleurs et la perte doivent être considérées comme déterminées par l'accouchement, 

Halakhah 5

quand même elles auraient commencé 40 ou 50 jours avant l’accouchement ; c'est l'opinion de R. Meir. R. Juda dit qu'on ne peut attribuer à l’accouchement que les douleurs et la perto qui arrivent le 9° mois ; R. Yossé et R. Simon réduisent le terme à 2 semaines.

Halakhah 6

Si une femme a des douleurs avant que soit passé le 80" jour après la naissance de sa fille, tout sang qu'elle verra sera pur jusqu'à la naissance d’un enfant. R. Eliézer le déclare impur. On objecta à R. Eliézer : si traitant avec sévérité le sang vu pendant le repos, l’on est moins sévère pour le sang vu durant les douleurs ; à plus forte raison on devra l’être si l’on est peu sévère pour le sang vu pendant le repos. C'est bien assez, répliqua-t-il, que ce qui est déduit d’une règle soit égal au principe. Or, on l’a allégé (déclaré pur) d’après l’impureté du flux, mais l’impureté par menstrues subsiste.

Halakhah 7

Pendant les onze jours d’intervalle entre une période et l’autre, la femme est dans un état présumé pur. Si elle a omis de s’examiner, soit par mégardc, soit par violence, ou volontairement, elle reste pure. Mais si le moment de ses époques arrive et quelle néglige de regarder, elle est supposée impure. R. Meir dit : si elle se trouvait dans une cachette lorsque arrive le moment de ses époques et que, par suite, elle n’ait pas pu s’examiner, elle reste pure, car la peur est une cause d’arrêt du sang. Pendant les 7 jours qu’observent le gonorrhéen ou la gonorrhéenne, ou pendant le moment que la femme attend d'un jour à l’autre, la présomption est qu’ils sont impurs.
