Jerusalem Talmud Gittin



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Somebody who brings a bill of divorce from overseas<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Overseas” stands for all places who do not have a rabbinic authority ordained by the Patriarchate in the Land of Israel or the two Academies acting on the authority of the Prince of the Diaspora in Babylonia. If one cannot be sure that all fine points of the rules of bills of divorce were followed, the court must have the possibility of examining the messenger about the details of the writing and signing of the document.</i> must be able to say: “It was written and signed before me.” Rabban Gamliel says, even somebody who brings from Reqam<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Two places “Reqam” are mentioned as border towns in Transjordan in the description of the borders of the Land of Israel; cf. <i>Ševi‘it</i> 6:1, Notes 47, 51.</i> and Ḥeger<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This place has not been identified; it is conjectured to be on the Southern border of the Land of Israel.</i>; Rebbi Eliezer says, even from Kefar Ludim to Lydda<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which were close to one another but in different court districts.</i>; but the Sages say that the only one who has to be able to say that it was written and signed before him is one who brings from overseas or to overseas. One who brings from one province<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">While in Biblical Hebrew מדינה means “province”, in Talmudic usage the word often has the late hieroglyphic, and Arabic, meaning of “capital”.</i> to another overseas has to say that it was written and signed before him; Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, even from one district to the next.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Somebody who brings a bill of divorce from overseas,” etc. This is difficult. If somebody brings a gift document from overseas,would you require him to say, it was written and signed<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The form נחתם is that of most Mishnah mss. and of the Babli. The form נתחתם in the Mishnah is that of several Palestinian Mishnah mss.</i> before me? Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, there is a difference because they are not conversant with the fine points of bills of divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 2" href="/Gittin.2">Babli, 2a/2b</a>, it is pointed out that a bill of divorce has to be written for the woman to be divorced since the verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>): “He shall write <i>for her</i>”. While the text of the bill must mention the names of husband and wife, it cannot be ascertained from the text whether the scribe was instructed to write the text specifically for that woman; there must be a live witness available who can be examined about this point. A second opinion notes that the signatures of the witnesses themselves would need confirmation.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, that is a leniency lest she sit abandoned<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 3a" href="/Gittin.3a">Babli, 3a</a>, this is an anonymous (unanimous) opinion. As explained in the sequel, if the husband could come later and claim the the bill of divorce was fake, no woman could ever remarry on a bill of divorce written far away for fear that her children from a second husband could retroactively be declared to be bastards; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.1.1">Mishnah <i>Yebamot</i> 10:1</a>.</i>. Is that a leniency? It is only a restriction, for if he does not say to her, it was written and signed before me, you do not permit her to remarry. Rebbi Yose said, the difficulty which you impose upon her at the beginning, that he is required to say, it was written and signed before me, makes it easy for her at the end. For if [the husband] would come and protest, his protest would be void. Rebbi Mana wanted to say, a protest other than the text of the bill<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">E. g., if the husband claims that he had attached a condition to the bill not provided for in the bill and that the condition was not satisfied. Since the condition was not presented to the court which oversaw the delivery of the document, it cannot be considered.</i>. But is a protest about the text of the bill a protest which has no validity<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">He claims that the entire bill is fake or that there is an intrinsic defect which makes the entire document invalid.</i>? Even for a protest which has validity, said Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun, since you say that the reason for the difficulty which you impose upon her at the beginning, that he is required to say, it was signed before me, is to make it easy for her at the end, that if [the husband] would come and protest, his protest would be void; this means that there is no difference whether it is a protest not about the text of the bill or about the body of the bill, a protest which has no validity, or a protest which does have validity<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since there was a witness who was cross-examined about the validity of the bill, the husband cannot be admitted to testify since when he claims to be still the husband of his divorcee he declares himself a relative by marriage who is barred from acting as a witness for or against his wife.</i>! But should you worry that maybe be gave the bill to disqualified witnesses to sign<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The messenger who delivers the bill might not know that the witnesses either were relatives of one of the parties or convicted felons; their signatures would invalidate the document.</i>? Rebbi Abun said, he is not suspect to damage her before Heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For if both the local court and the wife act in good faith, Heaven will absolve her but he has sinned. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 15:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.15.4.3"><i>Yebamot</i> 15:4, Notes 92–93</a>.</i>. Before the court he is suspect to damage her. But since he knows that if he comes and protests his protest is void, he will choose qualified witnesses to sign.
If [the bill of divorce] contained documentation of a gift and [the messenger] said, it was written and signed before me, is [the husband’s] protest about the gift void since it is void about the divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The question presupposes that one follows R. Joḥanan’s opinion in the preceding paragraph. The messenger who delivers the bill of divorce is a single witness who cannot validate a monetary claim. But since by tradition he has the power to validate a bill of divorce and the delivery of the bill implies authorization of the divorcee to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, it follows that in matters of bills of divorce the single messenger has the power to validate money claims as long as they are included in or dependent upon the bill of divorce.</i>? Or, since his protest is void [only] about the divorce, is it valid about the gift<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since annulment of the special gift from the husband to his divorcee will not hinder her from remarrying, there seems to be no special reason why a single witness should make a money claim definitive.</i>? We have stated later: “Bills of divorce for wives and documents of manumission are equal in the rules of carrying and bringing.” If [the document of manumission] contained documentation of a gift and [the messenger] said, it was written and signed before me, is [the master’s] protest about the gift void since it is void about the manumission? Or since his protest is void [only] about the manumission, is it valid about the gift<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If the document of manumission was accepted by the local court at the point of delivery, the slave upon immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> became a full Jew. A Jew cannot be enslaved by a fellow Jew (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:42" href="/Leviticus.25.42"><i>Lev</i>. 25:42</a>). The reason why the master’s protest is void has nothing to do with monetary claims; there seems to be no reason why the master cannot disclaim the gift.</i>? If somebody signed all his property over to his slave<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This seems to have been a common occurrence in Roman society.</i>, you say that the gift is the document of manumission<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The essence of freedom is that a person is master of himself; the gift document transfers mastership of the slave to himself.</i>. How do you treat this? Is it a document of manumission and his protest is void or is it a gift and his protest is valid? This can be compared to the following: <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The following is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 11:5:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.11.5.2"><i>Ketubot</i> 11:5</a>, explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:3:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.3.2-3">Notes 97–102</a>, and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Makkot 1:7:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Makkot.1.7.3"><i>Makkot</i> 1:16</a>. The variant readings are given in <i>Ketubot</i>. The messenger who delivers the document of manumission, which in this case is a document about money matters, is believed as if he were a group of two in regard of the manumission but is disqualified for the money part. All the questions asked up to this point can be answered if one decides whether to follow R. Joḥanan or R. Simeon ben Laqish.</i> If somebody signed all his property over to two persons in one document and the testimony of the witnesses was valid for one but invalid for the other. Rebbi Ila in the name of Rebbi Immi<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ketubot</i>: R. Yasa. Since rabbis Yasa (Assi) and Immi (Ammi) form a permanent pair in the Babli, there is no real difference in the attributions.</i>: Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish disagreed; one said, since it is invalid for one it is invalid for the other, but the other said, it is valid for one and invalid for the other. Rebbi Mana did not specify; Rebbi Abin specified: Rebbi Joḥanan said, since it is invalid for one it is invalid for the other; but Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, it is valid for one and invalid for the other. Rebbi Eleazar said, a Mishnah supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “Since testimony of two [witnesses] is invalid if one of them turns out to be related or disqualified, so also of three [witnesses] it is invalid if one of them turns out to be related or disqualified”. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Rebbi Ḥanina the colleague of the rabbis and the rabbis disagree. One says, the argument of Rebbi Eleazar is correct, but the other says, Rebbi Eleazar is not correct. For him who says, the argument of Rebbi Eleazar is correct, it is a testimony about one person; as testimony it is totally invalid if it is partially invalid. For him who says, the argument of Rebbi Eleazar is not correct, it is as if two groups of witnesses came, valid for one and disqualified for the other.
Only if he says, it was written before me during the day and signed during the day<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">“The day” means the day written as date in the document. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.2.1">Mishnah 2:2</a> notes that a pre-dated bill of divorce is invalid like all pre-dated documents. The bill may have been written in the night and signed the following day since the rabbinic day is counted from sundown to sundown; it cannot have been written during daytime and signed the following night since that would make it pre-dated.</i>; only if he says, it was written before me especially for her and signed expressly for her<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The messenger must have heard the husband tell the scribe to write a bill of divorce for his wife, mentioning her by name. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 3a" href="/Gittin.3a">Babli agrees, 3a</a>.</i>. It was asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: Does he have to know the names of the witnesses at the moment of their signing? He said to them, did the Gentiles Luciani sign it<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If the names sound Roman, it does not mean anything. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 11b" href="/Gittin.11b">Babli, 11b</a>, R. Joḥanan notes that if a Gentile name is known to be used by Jews, the matter does not have to be investigated. Examples given in the Babli are Λύκος “wolf”, a frequent substitute for Benjamin (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 49:27" href="/Genesis.49.27"><i>Gen</i>. 49:27</a>), and Λίς “lion” (in epic poetry, cf. Semitic ליש), a substitute for Jehudah (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 49:9" href="/Genesis.49.9"><i>Gen</i>. 49:9</a>). Cf. E. and H. Guggenheimer, <i>Jewish Family Names and their Origins: An Etymological Dictionary</i> (Ktav, 1992; German edition <i>Etymologisches Wörterbuch der jüdischen Familiennamen</i>, Saur 1996), Introduction: Sobriquets, Animal Names.</i>? And you say so? A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “All bills of divorce coming from overseas are valid even if their names sound Gentile since Jews outside the Land of Israel bear Gentile names.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 11b" href="/Gittin.11b">Babli 11b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 6:4" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).6.4">Tosephta 6:4</a>.</i>” He said only, outside the Land; therefore not in the Land of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It should not be assumed that Jewish people with Gentile names cannot sign a bill of divorce in the Land of Israel; there are a number of rabbis with Gentile names such as Eudaimon, Pappos, Antigonos. But in case such a name appears, an inquiry has to be made about the identity of the witness, wheras in documents coming from outside the Land, all names are accepted without inquiry.</i>. What about this? Rebbi Bevai in the name of Rebbi Issi: unless he writes, at a Jewish place<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Greek Ὶουδαϊκός, -ή, -όν “Jewish”. If the names of the witnesses are Gentile, some indication of this being a purely Jewish document is needed since all documents executed in a Gentile court are valid except bills of divorce.</i>. If there is no Jewish place, in the synagogue. If there is no synagogue, he assembles there ten people<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">All of whom have to sign as witnesses even if most of them are related to the couple, if only two of the witnesses are acceptable in law; it is to be assumed that not all of their names will be characteristically Gentile. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 7:11" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).7.11">Tosephta 7:11</a>; M. A. Friedman, <i>Jewish Marriage in Palestine</i>, Vol. 1, p. 489.</i>. Rebbi Abun said, it would be better to certify the signatures<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">After the document was duly signed, the local court could append a certification that the witnesses were known to the court and in good standing. Such a certification would have to be accepted by every rabbinic court anywhere (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.3.1">Mishnah 1:3</a>).</i> than to assemble there ten people. What about this? Even in a Jewish store<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The document must mention the place where it was written. One might add that it was written in a Jewish store to emphasize the Jewish character of the document, implicitly validating the Gentile-sounding signatures.</i>.
If he did not say: “it was written and signed before me”? Should not an Amora have asked this question? He said to him<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It is unclear to whom this refers; the text seems defective.</i>, that is what Rabin ben Rav said: If he brought a bill of divorce, gave it to her, but did not tell her: “It was written and signed before me”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Is the bill of divorce invalid in this case? In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 5b" href="/Gittin.5b">Babli, 5b</a>, Rabin bar Rav Ḥisda brought a bill of divorce before R. Joḥanan, who instructed him to deliver the bill in the presence of two witnesses and to make the required declaration. The question here can be interpreted to mean that Rabin asked whether the formality was really necessary in view of the fact, reported in the next paragraph, that R. Joshua ben Levi, of the generation of R. Joḥanan’s teachers, did not require the declaration. In the Babli, which is edited according to strict historical principles, R. Joshua ben Levi is mentioned before R. Joḥanan.</i>? There came a case before Rebbi Joḥanan, who said to him<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The messenger who had delivered the bill of divorce without making the required declaration.</i>, take it from her and say in front of two [witnesses]: “It was written and signed before me.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">It is understood that the Mishnah requires the declaration to be made either in the presence of two witnesses or at the local court. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 2:1" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).2.1">Tosephta 2:1</a> permits the declaration to be made “even after three years” if the bill of divorce can be returned to the messenger.</i>” Does Rebbi Joḥanan follow Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar, since Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar said<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 6:1" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).6.1">Tosephta 6:1</a>; a different version <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 78a" href="/Gittin.78a">Babli 78a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 84b" href="/Gittin.84b">84b</a>. The statement refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 8:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.8.2.1">Mishnah 8:2</a>: “If he said to her, take this bond, or she took it out from his belt, and when she read it she realized that it was her bill of divorce, it is not a bill of divorce unless he says to her: This is your bill of divorce.” The reason is that <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a> requires that in a divorce the husband deliver the bill into the wife’s hand. The question arises whether the required declaration is valid after the bill is already in the wife’s hand. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 78a" href="/Gittin.78a">Babli 78a</a>, Rebbi is quoted as holding that the bill is invalid unless given as a bill of divorce; R. Simeon ben Eleazar permits the husband to reclaim the bill from his wife and deliver it a second time accompanied by the required declaration. In the Tosephta, Rebbi is reported not to require the declaration, R. Simeon ben Eleazar requires that the declaration accompany the delivery. The language of the Tosephta is that of the Yerushalmi; it is not clear whether R. Simeon ben Eleazar permits taking the document back.</i>, it is no bill of divorce unless he tells her at the moment of delivery that it is her bill of divorce? Can the position of Rebbi Joḥanan be derived from Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar? Would Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar agree that if he told her at the moment of delivery that it was her bill of divorce it would not be a bill of divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The answer to this rhetorical question clearly is no; the only condition imposed by R. Simeon ben Eleazar is that the wife be informed of the nature of the document at the moment of delivery.</i>? But here, even if he tells her at the moment of delivery that it is her bill of divorce, it is no bill of divorce unless he tells her in front of two [witnesses]: “It was written and signed before me.” But Rebbi Joḥanan might hold that a woman cannot be believed if she says, I received a bill of divorce from my husband’s agents<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, the delivery of the document characterized as a bill of divorce must be made before two witnesses in good standing. It seems that in his case, the document was delivered in private; the main reason of R. Joḥanan was not the recitation of the formula but the delivery in front of witnesses.</i>. But we did state<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.6.1">Mishnah 2:7</a>. If the husband delivers the document to her on condition that it should not become effective until she presents it to the court which has to preside over the payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, she can bring it herself and declare before the court that “it was written and signed before me.”</i>: “The wife herself can bring her bill of divorce.” Would you not have to be afraid that she might have received the bill from a representative of the husband<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Why should she be believed if she brings the document from abroad when she is not believed if the document is delivered to her in private? It is implied here that the act which makes the document valid is its <i>signing</i> by two reliable witnesses, not its <i>delivery</i>.</i>? How is it? The reason of Rebbi Joḥanan is to make her known as divorcee in front of two [witnesses]<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that the requirement of the declaration mentioned in the Mishnah is prescriptive but its omission does not invalidate the divorce.</i>.
A case came before Rebbi Joshua ben Levi<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 5b" href="/Gittin.5b">Babli, 5b</a>, it was R. Simeon bar Abba, a recognized scholar, who brought the document.</i>. He said to him, it is unnecessary. The opinion of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi seems inverted. There, Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, there is a difference because they are not conversant with the fine points of bills of divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 2" href="/Gittin.2">Babli, 2a/2b</a>, it is pointed out that a bill of divorce has to be written for the woman to be divorced since the verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>): “He shall write <i>for her</i>”.

A second opinion notes that the signatures of the witnesses themselves would need confirmation.</i>, but here, he says so? The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: What you said was in earlier times when no Fellows<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Here, “Fellow” does not have the technical meaning of “person who observes the rules of food purity” but means “person learned in the law.”</i> were found outside the Land, but now that there are Fellows found outside the Land, they are competent<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli, this is R. Joshua ben Levi’s explanation given to R. Simeon bar Abba the Babylonian.</i>. But did we not state, “and one who brings there<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In the Mishnah, the duty to declare that the document was written in the presence of the messenger is extended to bills of divorce written in the Land and delivered abroad.</i>”? And even if you say that no Fellows are found outside the Land, are we not found in the Land of Israel? In order not to make a distinction in the bills of divorce from outside the Land<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">There otherwise would be no reason to require a declaration for bills originating in the Land.</i>. But then one who brings from overseas should not have to say: “It was written before me and signed before me.” Not to make a distinction in the bills of divorce in the Land of Israel. What about it? One is restrictive in a simple case because of the complicated one and one is not permissive in the complicated because of the easy one<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">It is preferable to require a declaration for documents originating in Palestine (the easy case) rather than to eliminate the declaration for documents originating outside the Land (the complicated case).</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Simeon bar Abba: This<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The statement that the declaration was unnecessary.</i> of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, if it was done. But from the start even Rebbi Joshua ben Levi agrees<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In that, R. Joshua ben Levi agrees with R. Joḥanan. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 5b" href="/Gittin.5b">Babli, 5b</a>, disagrees since in its version R. Simeon bar Abba asked R. Joshua ben Levi whether he had to make the declaration when delivering the bill of divorce.</i>.
Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav, Rebbi Ze‘ira in the name of Abba bar Ḥana: Two who brought a bill of divorce do not have to declare: It was written before us and signed before us<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 5a" href="/Gittin.5a">Babli, 5a</a>, this opinion is attributed to Rav Huna, Rav’s student.</i>.

He himself who brought the bill of divorce does not have to deliver the bill in the presence of two [witnesses]<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli, a fundamental question is whether a bill of divorce is validated by the signatories of the bill or the witnesses to the delivery. The first opinion is attributed in the Babli to R. Meïr; it is generally accepted in the Yerushalmi. The second opinion is R. Eleazar’s in both Talmudim (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 9:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.9.3.1">Mishnah 9:4</a>). The Babli considers R. Eleazar the dominant author in matters of divorce; the Yerushalmi considers his a minority opinion. Accordingly, the Yerushalmi permits private delivery from husband to wife. Nevertheless, since marriage is a public affair, the divorcee cannot remarry unless her divorce is made public. The husband therefore has to publicly declare her a divorcee after his private delivery.</i> in order to declare her a divorcee in the presence of two. “If he gave her the bill<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In the presence of witnesses.</i>, took it from her, and threw it into the sea or into a river<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Where it cannot be retrieved.</i>.

He said to him, since she was declared a divorcee in the presence of two [witnesses], he cannot be believed to disqualify her<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since there are two witnesses to the delivery, the divorce could be put in doubt only by a proof that the witnesses are false. In the interpretation of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 55a" href="/Gittin.55a">Babli, 55a</a>, the divorce is valid if the witnesses knew that the document was a bill of divorce, but the wife did not. It is possible to read the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:6:2-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.6.2-6">Yerushalmi 5:5</a> in the same sense.</i>.

Rebbi Ze‘ira said, that if [the husband] came and protested, his protest would be invalid.

Rebbi was in Acco when he saw them eating clean bread; he asked them, how did you knead [the dough]? They said to him, a student came here and instructed us that egg water does not prepare.

It happened that a student gave instructions about practice in front of his teacher Rebbi Eliezer. The latter said to his wife Imma Shalom: That one will not live out his week.

He said to them, so it should come over me that I did not know! From that moment on he did no longer give instructions.
Rebbi was in Acco when he saw a man on the rock. He said to him, “are you not the son of the Cohen X, was your father not a Cohen?” He said to him, “the eyes of my father were high, but he married a woman unfit for him and profaned this man.”

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody brings a bill of divorce from overseas,” etc. One understands “it was written before me” but not “it was signed before me”, but “it was signed before me” but not “it was written before me”? Is not a bill of divorce validated by its signatures? That must follow Rebbi Jehudah, for Rebbi Jehudah invalidates forms<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.3.2.1">Mishnah 3:2</a>, the anonymous majority permit the routine production of forms of bills of divorce where everything is written in advance and only the names of husband and wife, the date, and the statement of divorce are then inserted for the particular couple involved in the divorce; but R. Jehudah holds that the requirement that “he write for her” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>) can only be fulfilled if the bill was written specifically for that wife from the first letter to the last.</i>. Following Rebbi Jehudah outside the Land as for one who divorces in the Land of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 3:2:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.3.2.2-4">Halakhah 3:2</a>, practice is declared as following R. Jehudah.</i>. Are there forms of bills of divorce outside the Land for divorces outside the Land? It is necessary for him to know that it is a bill of divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since the agent is to be interviewed about the writing of the bill, it is obvious that he could not answer if the bill was a form in which only the names of husband and wife and the time were inserted. Even the anonymous majority of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.3.1">Mishnah 3</a>:2 must agree that forms are possible only in the Land.</i> and that he be appointed as an agent; he would not know that it was a bill of divorce unless it was written completely before him. Rebbi Ḥanin stated: It is permitted that he enter and leave<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In all matters of supervision, it is possible for the supervisor to leave the place occasionally as long as he can return at any moment and the person to be supervised, in this case the scribe, does not know in advance when the supervisor will return. The same <i>baraita</i> is accepted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 6a" href="/Gittin.6a">Babli, 6a</a>.</i>.
Rebbi Yose asked: If he said, “it was written and signed before me, but it was in the sole possession of the husband between writing and signing”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the meantime, the husband could have substituted an invalid document for the valid one which was written in the presence of the agent.</i>? Let us hear from the following: “If one said ‘it was written before me’ and another ‘it was signed before me’, it is invalid.” That is, because one said, “it was written before me” and another, “it was signed before me”; this implies<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the case is not mentioned in the Mishnah; neither here nor in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.1.1">Mishnah 1:1</a> is there any mention that the document has to be seen by the agent between writing and signing.</i> that if one said, “it was written and signed before me, but it was in the sole possession of the husband between writing and signing”, it is valid. Rav Ḥisda asked: half of an institution and half as biblical decree<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The requirement that the bill be written specifically for that wife is biblical, the requirement that the agent be present at writing and signing is purely rabbinical. It was stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.1.2">Halakhah 1:1 (Note 14</a>) that the husband is not suspected of doing anything which would make the divorce recognized by the court when it is invalid in the eyes of Heaven (since then he would commit a sin without hurting his ex-wife). Therefore, the answer given to R. Yose’s question is reasonable.</i>? If he said, “it was written and signed before me, but it was in the sole possession of the husband between writing and signing”? Let us hear from the following: “If one said ‘it was written before me’ and another ‘it was signed before me’, it is invalid.” That is, because one said “it was written before me” and another “it was signed before me”; this implies that if one said, “it was written and signed before me, but it was in the sole possession of the husband for an hour,” it is valid.
Rebbi Eleazar said, Rebbi Abun asked: If he said “it was written and one witness signed before me,” and two<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Two other witnesses.</i> testify about the signature of the second witness. Rebbi Immi the Babylonian said, nothing can be more valid than this. Rebbi Abba did not say<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">R. Abin’s question was trivial.</i> so but: If he said “it was written and one witness signed before me, and I am the second witness.” He is like a party interested in his testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">He becomes party and can no longer be a witness. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 15b" href="/Gittin.15b">Babli, 15b</a>, the reason is given that a bill of divorce can be validated either as a document, by the independent testimony about the signature of the witnesses, or by the special rule of divorces which allows an agent to declare that it was written and signed before him, but not by a combination of both because then the witness would validate himself.</i>.
If there were four signatures and he said, “it was written and signed by two witnesses before me; I do not know anything about the other two.” That is the disagreement of Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, who disagreed: If he said to ten people, sign the bill of divorce, and some signed on that day and some the next day. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, it is valid, for the remainder are only because of the condition<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The first two witnesses validate the document as a bill of divorce The others only sign because he made a condition that the bill be valid only with ten signatures, to make a public statement that he would no longer be responsible for his wife’s debts.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said it is invalid unless all sign on the same day<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">One cannot split the conditions; all ten signatures are needed to validate and, therefore, must be affixed on the date specified in the document. Otherwise the document would be invalid as predated.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 18b" href="/Gittin.18b">Babli, 18b</a>, the attributions are switched. This means that the Babli, which always prefers R. Joḥanan to R. Simeon ben Laqish, follows what is declared here to be R. Simeon ben Laqish’s opinion. The Yerushalmi does not decide between the opinions.</i>.
Rebbi Immi said, where do they disagree? If the document is presented by him personally. But if it is presented by another person, even the rabbis will agree that it is valid<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the clause in the Mishnah where two people say that the bill was written in their presence and a third person testifies that it was signed in his presence. R. Immi holds that the rabbis declare the bill invalid if it is presented by the single person who saw the signing, whose testimony is incomplete, whereas R. Jehudah accepts the bill as valid if two people testify to any state of the writing of the bill. But if the bill was delivered by one of the witnesses to the writing, then he and the witness to the signing are two and the rabbis will agree that two messengers who bring a bill of divorce do not have to declare that it was written and signed before them.</i>. Rebbi Ḥananiah agrees with Rebbi Immi. Rebbi Ze‘ira said, where do they disagree? If the document is presented by another person. But if it is presented by him personally, even Rebbi Jehudah will agree that it is invalid<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Ze‘ira, R. Jehudah agrees that the bill is invalid if writing and signing are attested to by different persons. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 17a" href="/Gittin.17a">Babli, 17a</a>, both opinions are recorded in the name of R. Immi, held at different times.</i>. Rebbi Ze‘ira objected to Rebbi Immi: If the document is presented by him personally, does Rebbi Jehudah declare it valid even in the first case<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In the Mishnah, the bill is unanimously declared invalid if writing and signing are attested to by different persons. One has to assume that R. Jehudah agrees.</i>? Rebbi Immi brought his father-in-law Rebbi Jonah who stated for him: If one said “it was written before me” and another “it was signed before me”, it is invalid, but Rebbi Jehudah declares it valid<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>baraita</i> shows that R. Jehudah accepts the bill if different people testify to writing and signing, showing that R. Ze‘ira’s objection is unjustified.</i>. Rebbi Abin said, the formulation of a <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ze‘ira: <i>In that case</i>, Rebbi Jehudah declares it valid<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 2:2" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).2.2">Tosephta 2:2</a>; only in one case does R. Jehudah accept the bill as genuine.</i>. But it is difficult following Rebbi Ze‘ira: If the document is presented by another person, that is when they do not treat the messenger as two. When do they treat him as two? When he testifies to both writing and signing<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since in that case, any later protest by the husband is disregarded (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.1.2">Chapter 1, Note 9</a>), it must be that the messenger who testifies to both writing and signing of the bill has the status of two witnesses whose testimony cannot be attacked.</i>.
Rebbi Yasa said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If it is presented by him personally<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the last clause of the Mishnah, where one witness has seen the writing and two the signing. The singular implies that the person presenting the bill of divorce is alone; he is the person attesting to the writing.</i>. Rebbi Ze‘ira was looking at him<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Disapprovingly.</i>. He asked, why are you looking at me? Even if it is presented by another person<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">He changed his mind and accepts that two witnesses to the signature make any other witnesses superfluous.</i>. It meansthat Rebbi Yasa before he changed his mind followed Rebbi Immi<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In the preceding paragraph.</i>. Rebbi Mana said, even after he changed his mind it can be explained following him. There is a difference between two witnesses to the writing and two witnesses to the signing. Signing before two [witnesses] is empowered<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Any document is confirmed by two signatures if the latter can be notarized in court.</i>, writing before two is not empowered<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Except for bills of divorce, the circumstances of writing a document are irrelevant.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If it was written during daytime and signed during daytime,” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is invalid because of the usufruct<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that the husband’s right to the yield of his wife’s property ends with the signing of the bill of divorce, not with its delivery.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody transports a bill of divorce overseas and falls sick, he assembles a court to send it and declares before them: “it was written and signed before me.” The later messenger does not have to say: “it was written and signed before me,” but he says: “I am an agent of the court.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that if the original bill of divorce was certified by a court, no messenger has to say that it was written and signed before him but that he is a court appointee, or, in modern terms, that a bill of divorce certified by a competent court can even be sent by mail to the court which has jurisdiction over the wife.</i>

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">A farmer gave a loan to potential recipients of his heave and tithes with the understanding that they do not have to repay the loan but that the farmer will separate both heaves for the account of the Cohen, sell the heaves to another Cohen, and credit the receipt to the Cohen’s account with him, reducing the amount owed. Similarly, he will separate first tithe on the Levite’s account and tithe of the poor for the poor man, deduct the fair value of the produce from his account and eat the tithes himself with his family, since tithes are permitted food for anybody.</i> lent money to a Cohen, a Levite, or a poor person to separate on their account, he can proceed on the assumption that they are alive and does not worry whether the Cohen or Levite died or the poor person became rich<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Once the poor person becomes disqualified for public assistance, he has to inform the farmer.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody lent money to a Cohen,” etc. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: This follows Rebbi Yose; as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Bekhorot 2:8" href="/Mishnah_Bekhorot.2.8">Mishnah <i>Bekhorot</i> 2:8</a>. The Mishnah speaks of a rancher whose ewe gave birth to twin lambs, one of which is a firstling but it is not known which. A firstling has to be given to a Cohen (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 15:19" href="/Deuteronomy.15.19"><i>Deut</i>. 15:19</a>); it may not be shorn (or, if a calf, used for work). The rancher can fulfill his monetary obligation by giving one of the two lambs to the Cohen; the other lamb has to be put out to graze until it develops a defect; then it can be eaten by its owner (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 15:21-22" href="/Deuteronomy.15.21-22"><i>Deut</i>. 15:21–22</a>). If it was known which lamb was a firstling, that one would have to be given to the Cohen and if the other lamb were slaughtered, some parts would have to be given to a Cohen (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:3" href="/Deuteronomy.18.3"><i>Deut</i>. 18:3</a>). But in the case under consideration, R. Yose holds that no gifts to the Cohen are due since potentially the lamb was the Cohen’s and a Cohen who slaughters does not have to give away anything. He equates potential possession and real possession. The application to the Mishnah here is that the Cohen can dispose of the heave as if he had received it.<br>R. Meїr holds that the gifts are due since they would be due if it was known which one was the firstling.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 30a" href="/Gittin.30a">Babli, 30a</a>, this is Ulla’s opinion.</i>: “Rebbi Yose says, anything whose replacement is in the Cohen’s hand is freed from the gifts, but Rebbi Meїr obligates.” Did Rebbi Yose not speak only if it did exist? But here, he still needs to sow<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Since nobody can acquire anything nonexistent (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:5:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.5.3"><i>Ketubot</i> 5:5, Note 113</a>), R. Yose’s argument cannot be applied to our case.</i>! Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The Mishnah speaks of acquaintances of Cohanim or Levites<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">The expression is Biblical (<i>2K</i>. 12:6,8); it refers to people who regularly give all their priestly gifts or tithes to the same Cohen or Levite. Then heave and tithes have the status of annuities and cannot be said to be nonexistent.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 30a" href="/Gittin.30a">Babli, 30a</a>, this is Rav’s opinion. Samuel requires that heave or tithes be actually given to a third party Cohen or Levite, acting as recipient for the debtor, who then returns the produce to the farmer. That opinion has no parallel in the Yerushalmi.</i>. But did we not state “a poor person”? Does a poor person have acquaintances<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">The tithe of the poor has to be given to the first poor person who applies.</i>? There came a case before Rebbi Immi: A Cohen or Levite who owed money to an Israel and told him<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">After the loan was given, the debtor then asked to be excused from repayment using the method outlined in the Mishnah.</i>, separate from my part for my account. He said to him, did we not state: “If somebody lent money to a Cohen, a Levite, or a poor person to separate on their account.” When the loan was given under these conditions. Therefore, not if it was not a condition of the loan! Rebbi Ze‘ira said, even if it was not a condition of the loan. Rebbi Ze‘ira’s force is from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 7:15" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).7.15">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 7:15</a>. The Levite cannot tell the Israel to arrange with other farmers that they pay him to give tithes for them and deduct the sum from the Levite’s debt, since no Levite can dispose of another Levite’s tithes.</i>: “Similarly, a Levite who owed money to an Israel and said to him, separate on my account; only he should not collect and separate because no Levite makes a Levite.” He only said, he should not separate<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Missing in the text: Other people’s tithes.</i>, but from his own he may separate.
There is no “he does not worry,” since he has to worry lest the poor became rich. It was stated so<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that the text is slightly corrupt; the translation follows the text of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 3:1" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).3.1">Tosephta 3:1</a>: הַמַּלְוֶה מָעוֹת אֶת הֶעָנִי וְהֶעֱשִׁיר אֵין מַפְרִישִׁין עָלָיו. שֶׁאֵין מַפְרִישִׁין עַל הָאָבוּד.  This is also the Yerushalmi text quoted in many medieval authors, cf. <i>Tosefta ki-Fshuta Giṭṭin</i> p. 824, Note 16. The last clause means that if the poor person temporarily became rich (i. e., was ineligible for public welfare as defined in <i>Peah</i> 9:9) and then poor again, the lender cannot use the tithe of the poor of the time of ineligibility but must give it away to another poor person since that tithe was lost for the borrower. The Yerushalmi text considers poor and rich as different persons residing in the same body since they fall in different legal categories.</i>: “If somebody lends money to a poor and rich person he cannot separate for him, for one does not separate for what was lost.”
Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Uqba in the name of Rebbi Yose in the name<sup class="footnote-marker">139a</sup><i class="footnote">This probably should read “son of”.</i> of Rebbi Ḥanina: The Mishnah speaks of the heirs in priesthood and Levitic status<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The creditor has to renew the contract if the heirs are priests or Levites. This excludes the poor from this rule, as well as cases in which a Cohen or Levite has only daughters married to Israel husbands.</i>. But concerning the poor, the poor has no inheritance. Bar Qappara stated: No person is immune from this<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Poverty.</i>; if not he then his son, if not his son then his grandson. This<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">“This” is not Bar Qappara’s homily but the Tosephta stated earlier and repeated later, that the poor debtor who became rich cannot continue the arrangement but must pay off the debt. This means that if the circumstances change, the debtor can change the terms to terms less favorable to him.</i> means, he can change the terms. Can the creditor change the terms? Let us hear from the following: “If somebody lends money to a first rich and then poor person he cannot separate for him, for one does not separate for what was lost and the poor acquired what is in his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The last sentence is also in the Tosephta, Note 139, quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 30b" href="/Gittin.30b">Babli, 30b</a>. If the poor remains rich, the creditor has no way to recoup his money.</i>” This implies that the creditor cannot change the terms<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 3:1" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).3.1">Tosephta, 3:1</a>, this is an explicit statement. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 30a" href="/Gittin.30a">Babli, 30a</a>, both the statement that the debtor can change the arrangement but the creditor cannot are attributed to the late Amora Rav Papa; both Talmudim are unaware of the Tosephta.</i>.
Does this<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">The statement that after the Cohen’s death the creditor has to renew the agreement with his heirs.</i> not disagree with Rav? Since Rav said, an heir is like a holder of encumbered property. Just as a loan given before witnesses cannot be collected from encumbered property<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">In rabbinic practice, mortgages are not written on specified parcels but are liens on all real estate the debtor owned at the time the loan was given. If such real estate is later sold, the lien of the mortgage holder is not removed; if the debtor cannot pay, the creditor can foreclose from the buyer. A loan arrangement made orally before witnesses is not a mortgage; the loan can be foreclosed neither from any buyer nor from debtor’s property subject to another person’s lien. If the loan cannot be foreclosed, there seems to be no reason why the creditor can ask anything from the heirs.</i>, so it cannot be collected from heirs. He explains it for a documented loan<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">A mortgage.</i>. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: A loan given before witnesses can be collected from heirs, on condition that they inherited real estate<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">He agrees that a loan cannot be foreclosed from encumbered property, but if the debtor has unencumbered property, free of any lien, it can be foreclosed on the testimony of the witnesses. Therefore, as long as the heirs inherit any real estate (in the language of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 30b" href="/Gittin.30b">Babli, 30b</a>, at least the area covered by a needle), the oral loan remains in force and the creditor has reason to approach the heirs.</i>. As<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">This is an illustration of the Mishnah, not of the preceding rules.</i> those from the house of Rav Neḥemiah, who lent money to the public<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">They advanced money to the public welfare fund, to be repaid from future collections. The question was raised whether money collected for the relief of the poor can be diverted to repay the capitalists. The answer is positive since the committee overseeing charity always will have clients on whose behalf they took the money in the first place and on whose behalf they may repay.</i>. The case came before the rabbis who said, the public is neither all rich nor all poor.

It is now stated that the sale of the slave in form of a fictitious chattel mortgage (when the owner of the slave has no intention to repay the sum he received) is of questionable character; it would be valid if the owner had the intention of repaying the loan and taking back his slave since, as antichresis shows, the (temporary) transfer of possessions without transfer of ownership is perfectly legal.

You should not say, [the Temple] is a creditor and should collect from average quality land.

If he dedicated 90 minas but his debt was 100 minas, [the redeemer] adds another denar and redeems these properties on condition to pay the debt to the creditor.” In order to combine two conflicting principles, viz., that vows cannot be used to escape obligations towards third parties, and that Temple obligations override all others, it is decreed that the Temple has to put the dedicated properties up for sale but collects only for the amount by which the value of the properties exceeds the obligation, with the third party buyer accepting the obligation to pay off the liens on the property.

Meïri’s text read טרפו “his forclosure document,” Rashba’s read תרפו “his sales document.” This is Rashba’s anwer:<br>“It is my opinion that our text is defective and it should be as follows: Reuben robbed a field from Simeon and sold it to Levi, <i>then Reuben bought it from Simeon</i> but before he could write the sales contract, he died. That is the case about which Samuel asked Rav in (Babli) <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> (15b), viz., if it turns out that the field was not his, but he went and bought it from the original owners, what are the rules? He told him, the first (the robber) sold to the second (the buyer) any present and future rights to the parcel.… And this is the explanation of this text according to my understanding: Reuben had robbed a field from Simeon and sold it to Levi who did not realize that it was robbed. Afterwards, Reuben bought the parcel from Simeon, but Simeon had not yet written the sales contract when Reuben died: who is the owner? Rav Huna and Ḥiyya bar Rav: One says if the document was first, if the sale was completed before he died, the sale was final and Reuben did not transfer [the field] to Levi; this shows that Reuben did not intend to leave the field in Levi’s hands, ostensibly to leave it to his heirs. He does not spell this out since the sales document was not yet written. The other one said, there is no difference between written and not written, he wants the field to be Levi’s since he did not dispose of the field in a will. (The same Rav Huna and Ḥiyya bar Rav disagree in the Babli <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> (16a) about the time available to the robber to act to protect his credit.) Rebbi Mana has a different explanation: He says that in any case the field belongs to Reuben, following Rami bar Ḥama (in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 16a" href="/Bava_Metzia.16a">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 16a</a>) who said that Levi’s contract was not worth the paper it was written on. But Rebbi Yose bar Abun is of the opposite opinion, since Levi can tell him, is the field not now before you that you can turn the sale into a valid one. This follows Rava (in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 16a" href="/Bava_Metzia.16a">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 16a</a>) who told Rami bar Ḥama that Levi acquired the property by the trust he put in Reuben.<br>But following your reading, since you read טרפו with ט, it is possible that this refers to a foreclosure document which Levi obtained against the robber after he had lost the field to Simeon, and that is the same disagreement we find there (in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 16a" href="/Bava_Metzia.16a">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 16a</a>); how long does a person have credit, Rav says until the start of court proceedings, Ḥiyya bar Rav says, until the foreclosure document was signed, and Rav Papa said, until the public sale.”</i>? Rav Huna and Ḥiyya the son of Rav: One said, if he wrote the foreclosure document, it is Reuben’s, if not, it is Levi’s. The other one said, whether he wrote or did not write, it belongs to Levi.

In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 53b" href="/Gittin.53b">Babli, 53b</a>, the same argument is made by Rav Papa.</i>: “If somebody judged, absolved the guilty and obligated the innocent, declared the pure impure and the impure pure.” For Rav Jeremiah said in the name of Rav: If he touched it with his hand<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The obligation to pay in this case is not by the declaration that something is impure, but by the act of the incompetent judge who handles the material in question when he declares it impure.

Since the prior argument showed that causing impurity is causing damage under the laws of torts, the person causing unintentional impurity should have to pay.

That he should tell. And Rebbi Joḥanan said, it should have been logical that even unintentionally he should have been obligated. Why did they say that he is free<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, it is obvious that “free” and “obligated” have to be interchanged.

The obligation to pay is not derived from the laws of torts but is a regulation “for the public good” in line with the other rules of this chapter.</i>? Because of a fine. The strength of Rebbi Joḥanan comes from this: “If someone causes anything to become impure, or <i>dema‘</i>, or libation wine, if it was unintentional he is free, intentional he is obligated,” and Rebbi Joḥanan said, he pays a fine. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “A person who puts a yoke on another’s cow is free in human law but guilty in Heaven’s law.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">In the times of the Temple, a red (probably meaning reddish-brown) cow without any black hair was worth millions (as material for the purification from the impurity of the dead, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19" href="/Numbers.19"><i>Num</i>. 19</a>) provided it never was used for work and never wore a yoke. Putting a yoke on such a cow for the shortest of times robs its owner of an enormous sum of money but, since the damage is not visible, it is not claimable in a human court.

The libation and the later mixing are two different acts. Even if there is only a libation, not followed by mixing with other wine, the libation can only be performed after the wine was poured into a vessel and the vessel lifted. Since we are speaking of wine belonging to a person other than the perpetrator, the latter becomes liable for all damages by lifting the vessel, some time before he commits the capital crime. It is clear, therefore, that the Yerushalmi view of the double punishment clause does not allow for splitting one action into separate parts.</i>?

His testimony seems reasonable for a hearing woman of sound mind, that she is divorced with or without her acquiescence.

But is it not testimony “that is an example”<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text from <i>Yebamot</i>. The text here, “his father is the same”, does not make any sense; it indicates that the text in <i>Yebamot</i> is original.</i>; does one add to a testimony?

(A similar Mishnah, <i>Niddah</i> 5:4, speaking of a girl 3 years and 1 day old, could be used as counter-argument since such a girl, if married off by her father, is married even if mentally handicapped.)</i>” Rebbi Ḥananiah said, since Rebbi Joḥanan said, for her attractiveness, that means, even if she does not know how to keep her [valuables given for] preliminary marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joḥanan could have said that a minor can eat heave because she has understanding, to emphasize the difference between the minor and the deaf-mute. Since he chose to represent the ruling as rabbinical, to help marrying off underage girls, it follows that he does not require the girl to understand the situation. If the girl is given in marriage by her father, she is married by biblical rule, is part of the priestly clan, and eats heave by biblical law. If she was an orphan married off by her mother or brothers, if she actually lives with her husband she is part of her husband’s household and was acquired by his gift of valuables (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:11" href="/Leviticus.22.11"><i>Lev.</i> 22:11</a>).</i>.

Halakhah 7

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There was no law of <i>siqarii</i><sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">סִיקָרִיקִין or סִקָרִיקוֹן (in the Halakhah and everywhere in the Babli) is usually interpreted to refer both to <i>sicarii</i> (members of organized crime bands armed with a <i>sica</i>, “curved dagger”, and the rules promulgated to deal with these.<br>A. Gulak [<i>Siqariqon</i>, Tarbiz 5 (1934) pp. 23–27] objects to the derivation of <i>siqariqon</i> from <i>sicarii</i> since it is inconceivable that Rebbi’s court, in the early years of the third Century C.E. had to deal with the aftermath of the first revolt against the Romans, in the first half of the first Century. He proposes to see in the word a compression of σὺν κήρυκι to *συγκηρυκι “by herold” referring to the public sale of properties confiscated by the government which always was done by publicly announced auction. {While the Babli clearly connects the law of <i>siqariqon</i> with the first revolt against the Romans, the Yerushalmi squarely refers it to the revolt of Bar Kokhba. We know of no general confiscation of Jewish land after the first revolt; after the second there was at least the seizure of all Jewish property in and around Jerusalem. Since both Talmudim emphasize the cordial relations of Rebbi with the administration of the Severan dynasty and Rebbi clearly addressed a current problem, it seems rather that the law refers to a problem arising from a breakdown of internal security. Talmudic law certainly authorizes buying of property confiscated for nonpayment of taxes. Gulak’s interpretation is difficult to square with <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 1:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.1.7.2">Mishnah <i>Bikkurim</i> 1:2</a>.}<br>A forced sale is intrinsically invalid since the seller can hope that in the future, when law and order are re-established, he may have a chance to appeal to a court and regain his property. But if a band of known <i>sicarii</i> give a property owner the choice of selling his land for a pittance or be killed together with his family, one may assume that he willingly gives the land to stay alive. In that situation, the land becomes the <i>siqarii</i>’s not only in possession but also in ownership, and may be sold by the current owner to any buyer. It is a matter of judgment of the court as to which situation does apply.</i> in Judea for those killed in the war<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">“The war” refers to the revolt of Bar Kokhba and its aftermath, as shown by the parallel in <i>Ketubot</i> to the first sentences in the Halakhah. S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta kiFshutah Giṭṭin</i> p. 844) has noted that the reading “R. Joshua” in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.7.1">Mishnah 7</a> is clearly a scribal error since Rav, a student of Rebbi, states both in the Yerushalmi (Note 205) and the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 58b-59a" href="/Gittin.58b-59a">Babli (58b/59a</a>) that he himself was a member of the court relaxing the <i>siqariqon</i> rules. Also, the Halakhah never refers to R. Joshua or any of his contemporaries. Therefore, one has to read in the Mishnah, with all sources other than the Mishnah in the Yerushalmi, “Rebbi assembled a court” in the first quarter of the third Century, to deal with the problem of organized crime in his own day. Together with the rules about kidnappings, this shows that the forces of the Roman Empire (at least starting with the Severan dynasty) were barely able to guarantee the external, but not the internal, security of the Empire.<br>The Mishnah states that land taken from Jews during the war can be bought by anybody who has the means, without regard to any prior owner. (In this case, <i>sicarii</i> is a code name for Roman soldiers.) The Babli connects the Mishnah to a long string of tales about the first war against the Romans; this should not be taken as indication that the Mishnah refers to that war.</i>. After those killed in the war there was a law of <i>siqarii</i>. How is this? If one bought from a <i>siqarius</i> and afterwards from the original owner, his acquisition is void<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">It was decided that the original owner retains claim to title even though he probably sold the land to save his life. Therefore, a potential buyer must first buy the right to title before buying the land.</i>; from the original owner and afterwards from the <i>siqarius</i>, his acquisition is valid. If one bought from a husband and afterwards from the wife, his acquisition is void<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">The husband is not the owner of his wife’s (paraphernalia) properties, but their administrator. While the details of the sale must be contracted by the husband, prior consent of the wife is needed; otherwise, the husband is not authorized to deal and anything he agrees to is illegal.</i>; from the wife and afterwards from the husband, his acquisition is valid. This is the earlier Mishnah; a later court said that he who buys from a <i>siqarius</i><sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Without needing prior consent. This is a regulation “for the public good”, to retain as much of the Land as possible in Jewish hands.</i> gives a quarter to the original owner.<br>When is this? If they have no means to buy, but if they have the means to buy, they precede everybody else<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">If the original owner has the cash available, he can pay the full price to the buyer and take back his title to the land.</i>. Rebbi (Joshua) assembled a court who voted that if it was in the <i>siqarius</i>’s hand for twelve months, any who wants to buy shall buy<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">After 12 months, the original owner lost his right to regain the land.</i> and give a quarter to the original owner.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “There was no law of <i>siqariqon</i> in Judea” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence and part of the next is also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:5:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.5.2"><i>Ketubot</i> 1:5 (Notes 196–199</a>).

Since one refers to the war of Bar Kokhba and the Hadrianic decrees in its aftermath, it is clear that the situation during and after the war was worse than before the war. One does not speak of a forced sale but of the rights of the heirs of a person who was killed and his land taken by Roman soldiers or civilians. It is clear that there was no sale. Since the greater part of the Jewish population of Judea was either killed in the war or deported as slaves, it made no sense for the organizers of the survivors to take notice of prior ownership. One has to assume that “Judea” means the Judean hills, to exclude the settlements in the plain centered around Lydda.</i>.” But are those killed before the war not like those killed after the war?

Lieberman in his commentary to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 3:11" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).3.11">Tosephta 3:11</a>.}</i>.” Rebbi Judah ben Pazi said, after twelve months one announces on four consecutive Sabbaths<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">After twelve months, there will be public anouncements that the twelve months’ grace period for the property (either one taken by organized crime or foreclosed for non-payment of the tax) has expired without action by the former owner.</i>.

So far, if there were two contracts<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the part of the Mishnah in which husband and wife sell from the wife’s real estate. It is clear that the Mishnah text underlying the Yerushalmi is not the Mishnah of the ms. (which frequently represents a different tradition) but that of the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Mishnah (Napoli) and the Vienna ms. of the Tosephta: “If one bought from a wife and afterwards from her husband, his acquisition is void; from the husband and afterwards from his wife, his acquisition is valid.” S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta ki-Fshutah Giṭṭin</i> p. 847) considers this reading as “incomprehensible” and, against his declared intention, does base his text on the Vienna ms. in this case. But it seems that the text can be well understood, since all depends on the legal status of the property, whether it is mortmain or paraphernalia (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 7:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.7.1.1"><i>Yebamot</i> 7:1, Note 1</a>). Mortmain is the husband’s property; at the dissolution of the marriage the wife is entitled to receive it or its value back; during the marriage all she has is a mortgage lien on her husband’s properties. Therefore, if she sells mortmain properties, she sells what she does not have; this is invalid. But if the husband sells, she has a right of regress on the property if it should turn out that the estate is insufficient to cover her <i>ketubah</i> claim. A buyer may want to buy insurance against such a possibility by paying the wife for her final assent to the sale. If she receives a consideration for her signature, she cannot claim later that she only signed to please her husband. The Mishnah speaks of paraphernalia property, which is the wife’s and of which the husband only has rights of administration.</i>. If there was one contract<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, the buyer might not pay separately for the wife’s signature.</i>? Rebbi Ze‘ira and Rebbi Ila both say, certainly the sale is invalid; i. e., if he bought from the wife and then bought from the husband. Rebbi Ḥanina and Rebbi Bevon both said, certainly the sale is valid; i. e., if he bought from the husband and then bought from the wife. But is not all the wife’s property administered by the husband? For the yield<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Of the paraphernalia property.</i>.
Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: So it is: If he sold to a first person and she signed, to a second and a third and she signed, she can collect from the last<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">She signed on the sales contract after her husband and claims that she did so to please her husband, not as a commercial transaction.

If it is insufficient, she collects from the one before the last. If this is insufficient, she collects from the one before the penultimate. On this, Rav said: For property which she brought him in her <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dos aestimata</i>, the value of which is written in the <i>ketubah</i> document and which establishes a mortgage on all the husband’s properties.</i>.

The Babli conjectures that a possible reason for Rav’s statement is that if the wife refuses to accept the bill from the husband’s agent but appoints her agent to receive the bill, she does this only to hinder the husband’s agent to fulfill his mission to deliver the bill to her. In that case, the wife would be entitled to appoint her agent if her appointment precedes her husband’s. Another conjectured reason is that there is a very remote possibility that things can go wrong if the bill is not actually delivered from hand to hand but deposited on her (or her agent’s) property.

Can you say in regard to a gift that a person can appoint an agent for anything that is not his? In addition, from what Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan said, if somebody said to give a gift to another and he wants to retract, he may retract. Rebbi Yose stood near Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi and said to him, is that a just “yes”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:36" href="/Leviticus.19.36"><i>Lev</i>. 19:36</a>: “Your <i>hîn</i> shall be just”. The הִין is a liquid measure (half a <i>se’ah</i>). But since biblical כֵּן “yes” became rabbinic הֵן, the verse is interpreted to mean that in money matters any “yes” has to be honest. The formal argument is that the verse already mentioned the <i>ephah</i> as correct measure; therefore the smaller <i>hîn</i> requires symbolic interpretation. [This learned pun is in the name of R.

But if a woman appoints an agent, who goes and requests a bill of divorce from her husband and receives the bill without being appointed the husband’s agent of delivery, it is a perfectly valid divorce the moment the agent takes possession of the bill. (According to Rav Huna, this situation is preferable to one in which the agent also becomes the husband’s agent, unless the husband explicitly invalidates the wife’s commission.)</i>. But if [the other] said: Give a bill of divorce to his wife, and [the husband] said, here is my wife’s bill of divorce, or her daughter’s, or her sister’s, and he went and gave it to her, it is a divorce.

A woman appointed an agent to accept her bill of divorce from the husband’s agents. The case came before Rav, who said, if he wants to retract he cannot retract. Rav’s opinion has switched!

Since the husband was present during the entire proceedings, he must have agreed with his wife’s appointing her own attorney and there could be no reason to invalidate the proceedings.

Yose will agree that a court can cause the bill to be written if the husband in so many words appoints three persons <i>as a court</i>; he does not accept R. Meïr’s position that the appointment of at least three joint agents automatically constitutes them as a court; he does not admit that a person can appoint others (in any number, but not a formal court) to act as agents to have a document written for him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 66b" href="/Gittin.66b">Babli 66b</a>).</i>, from the next sentence: “If he said to three persons;” and Rav Ḥisda said, the reason of Rebbi Meïr is that we find everywhere that others write and the court signs, also here others write and the court affixes their signatures.

R. Jehudah requires that the married High Priest preliminarily marry another woman lest his wife die in the week before the Day of Atonement and prevent him from serving. He cannot definitively marry another woman since he alone among all Jews is required to be monogamous (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:13" href="/Leviticus.21.13"><i>Lev</i>. 21:13</a>).

The Mishnah enumerates 13 chests which were maintained at the Temple gate for the public to deposit its contributions. One of the chests was labelled for “nests”, the pairs of birds required as a purification sacrifice (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 12:8" href="/Leviticus.12.8"><i>Lev</i>. 12:8</a>) before a woman after childbirth could partake of family sacrifices. The women would deposit the money in the chest and every day the priests would offer the corresponding number of pairs of birds to purify the women. R. Jehudah holds that there was no such automatic arrangement in the Temple but that every woman after childbirth had to provide the pair of birds and personally hand them to a Cohen. His problem was that one of the birds was a holocaust but the other a purification offering and purification offerings might be presented only for living persons. If a woman died between the time she deposited the money in the chest and the next morning when the money was counted and the number of birds determined, then not only her purification offering would be invalid (it could not be offered, nor could it be released; it had to be kept in isolation until it died) but it would invalidate all other offerings of the same day (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 55b-56b" href="/Yoma.55b-56b">Babli <i>Yoma</i> 55b/56b</a>).

Chapter 8



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody throws a bill of divorce to his wife while she is in her own house or her own courtyard, she is divorced<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a> requires the bill of divorce to be delivered “into her hand”. Legally, “hand” means “possession” (as in Latin and many other languages). Since anything lying in somebody’s real estate is in his possession, delivery of the bill into the wife’s real estate is legal delivery.</i>. If he threw it to her inside his house or his courtyard, even if he was together with her in a bed, she is not divorced<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If the wife is in his real estate, only delivery into her hand or her personal belongings (the folds of her garment or her wool basket) is legal delivery.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody throws a bill of divorce to his wife,” etc. “He shall write,” “he shall deliver into her hand.” Not only into her hand; from where also into her garden or into her courtyard? The verse says “he shall deliver, he shall deliver.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A shortened version of this argument is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 77b" href="/Gittin.77b">Babli, 77b</a>. The argument follows R. Aqiba, who derives rules from every word which could be considered not absolutely necessary. Since “he shall deliver” is mentioned both in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a> and 24:3, he concludes that any legal delivery is acceptable.</i> Is this following Rebbi Ismael? It is following Rebbi Aqiba. It was stated in the name of Rebbi Ismael<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Ismael holds that “the Torah speaks in everybody’s language.” Therefore, if “hand” is to be interpreted as “possession”, a verse has to be found in which this sense is documented. This is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 21:26" href="/Numbers.21.26"><i>Num</i>. 21:26</a> which notes that Siḥon the Amorite “took all the land from the Moabite king’s hand”. Since land cannot be grasped in one’s hand, “hand” must mean “possession”. (A hint of this argument is in <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 269. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 56b" href="/Bava_Metzia.56b">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 56b</a>, following only R. Aqiba, accepts the interpretation of “hand” as “possession” only in extraordinary cases.)</i>, “he took all his land from his hand, up to the Arnon.” Did he take it out of his hand? What means “from his hand”? From his possession.

In any case, it is impossible to say that (in the absence of a contract of separation of properties) the wife’s properties were in her actual possession during her marriage.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If he said to her, “take this bond,” or she found it behind his back, she read it and it turned out to be her bill of divorce, it is no bill of divorce until he says to her “this is your bill of divorce”. If he put it into her hand while she was asleep, after she awoke she read it and it turned out to be her bill of divorce, it is no bill of divorce until he says to her “this is your bill of divorce”. If she was standing in the public domain when he threw it to her and it landed close to her it is a bill of divorce, close to him it is no bill of divorce, half and half she is divorced and not divorced.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If he said to her, ‘take this bond,’ ” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan says, this follows Rebbi Eleazar ben Simeon, since Rebbi Eleazar ben Simeon says it never is a bill of divorce unless he says at the moment of delivery: “this is your bill of divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 78a" href="/Gittin.78a">Babli (78a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 6:1" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).6.1">Tosephta 6:1</a>), quotes a disagreement between Rebbi, who accepts the husband’s declaration even after delivery of the bill, and R. Eleazar ben Simeon, who requires a repeat delivery if the declaration was not made at the moment of delivery. In <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 269, the opinion of R.

Rebbi Zeïra objected before Rebbi Yasa: But did we not state: The same applies to marriage? He answered him, divorce documents and marriage contracts have the same rules. But did we not state: The same applies to debt? He said to him, because if he said to him: Throw it into the sea and your debt will be forgiven, it would be forgiven. But if that is true, even if it fell down close to the debtor, the debtor should have the benefit! But we have stated, if it falls down close to the debtor, the debtor is still obligated. For he said to him, throw it so that it will enter my domain, but it did not yet enter his domain. Rebbi Abbahu said, all those objections that Rebbi Zeïra raised before Rebbi Yasa, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish raised before Rebbi Joḥanan. Did he accept them from him? He solved them with those same solutions.

Therefore, if a document was moved from one domain to another (as from the husband’s courtyard to the wife’s roof) and burned while still flying, it was delivered as a bill of divorce but not moved by the laws of the Sabbath.

Aqiba declares him guilty but the Sages declare him not prosecutable.” It is then explained that throwing from the public to a private domain is prosecutable only if the object came to rest. On that it is noted that Rebbi does not require it to come to rest (only to be received within the walls), but R. Abba bar Huna in the name of Rav said that “Rebbi did only find him guilty if the private domain was roofed.” It is noted there that R. Joḥanan objected to the latter statement, which explains that no answer is given to the question raised.</i> What is the difference between bills of divorce and the Sabbath? Rebbi Abba said, about the Sabbath it is written: “You shall not do any work;” it may make itself automatically<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">As long as it was not intended that the object should come to rest by the force of the thrower (but it was moved along by some mechanical contraption not directly controlled by the thrower), no violation of the Sabbath occured.

In a sealed document, the place of the signatures on the verso of the main part is the certification.</i>” But did we not state: “That is the formula of a document”?<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Huna’s text is required for all documents, whether open or sealed.</i> Rebbi Mana said, that is the formula of a knotted document.

However, a sealed document whose three certifying signatures are not in the back of the text containing the name of the debtor and the exact nature of his obligation is invalid; an open document is valid if only it contains all the necessary information and two signatures.

A simple document [is witnessed] by two persons. If common usage is to have three, one makes it with three. A knotted document is signed on its back. If common usage is to sign it inside and out, one signs it inside and out.
The condition of validity is stated here and was stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Both in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 8:10:2-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.8.10.2-6"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 8:12</a> and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 10:1:2-10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.10.1.2-10"><i>Baba batra</i> 10:1</a> one finds rules about sealed documents. These rules do not overlap. The rules about the bald document are not found in <i>Baba batra</i>, the requirement of three witnesses is not in <i>Giṭṭin</i>. One would have expected an argument why the rules of one tractate, dealing with divorce documents, also apply to the other, dealing with deeds of real estate and mortgages. For some reason, this seemed obvious to the editors of the Yerushalmi.</i>. It was necessary to state it there. If it had been stated here but not there, we would have said that here it is invalid because of the restrictions connected with adultery but there, since no restrictions connected with adultery are involved, it would be valid. Or if it had been stated there but not here, we would have said that there it is invalid since one comes to collect money based on that document but here, where one does not collect money, it would be valid. Therefore, it was necessary both to state it here and to state it there.

To one who told his wife, “this is your bill of divorce on condition that you sleep with Mr. X.” At the start, he is forbidden to have sexual relations with her. If he transgressed and slept with her, the divorce was retroactively validated<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Even according to the Babli which holds that any expression “on condition that” means “from today, on condition that”, Mr. X is barred from marrying the divorcee as long as he had not slept with her since she is not yet divorced and, therefore, unable to contract any marriage. Therefore, when he goes to bed with the divorcee, it is an adulterous act. But at the moment of penetration, the condition of the divorce is satisfied and the aspect of adultery has disappeared. This is just the opposite of the situation which caused discomfort to R. Shammai. (Rashba, <i>Novellae</i> <i>ad</i> 84a.)</i>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If he wrote two bills of divorce side by side and two Hebrew-writing witnesses signed from one column to the next, and two Greek-writing witnesses signed from one column to the next, the one whose witnesses are read with it is valid.

When the witnesses came to sign, they used the space under both columns. Then only the bill whose witnesses sign directly under it is valid since for the other bill the first witness is at least two lines too far away to be counted. The additional complication is that the Hebrew text starts at the right but the Greek text on the left. For example:<br>               bill                                    bill<br>                                                יצחק בן אברהם<br>                                                משה בן עמרם<br>Ενως υἱὸς Σηθ<br>Σημ υἰὸς Νωε<br>In this case, if the first two signatures apply to the bill on the right hand side, that bill is valid.

If each bill carries two signatures, one to be read from the right, the other from the left:<br>               bill                                    bill<br>                                                יצחק בן אברהם<br>Ενως υἱὸς Σηθ<br>                                                משה בן עמרם<br>Σημ υἰὸς Νωε<br>no bill can be read with its signatures and both are invalid.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If it became public knowledge in town that she was preliminarily married, she is preliminarily married<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">If she had been unmarried, she cannot marry another man without receiving a divorce from the one to whom she is betrothed in the eyes of the public.</i>; divorced, she is divorced<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">And could not marry a Cohen even if previously unmarried.</i>, except if there was an excuse.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The House of Shammai say, a person should not divorce his wife unless he found her immoral, as it was said<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>.</i>: “For he found with her a matter of nakedness<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">If the husband had proof of her infidelity, he would by law be obligated to divorce her (cf. <i>Soṭah</i> 1:1, Notes 13,14).
