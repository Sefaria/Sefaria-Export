One who is half slave and half free works for his master one day, and for himself one day, according to the School of Hillel. The School of Shammai says, " You have fixed it for his [the slave's] master, but you have not fixed it for [the slave] himself. He cannot marry a maidservant, and he cannot marry a free woman. Should he be idle? And was the world created for something other than reproduction? As it is said 'He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited.' Rather, for Tikkun haOlam [the betterment of the world] they force his master and make him completely free, and he writes a note [to pay his master] half his value." The School of Hillel retracted [their statement] and taught according to the words of the School of Shammai.

Halakhah 3

The same is true of betrothal, and the same is true of a debt. If one's creditor said to him, "Throw me [the payment of] the debt due to me," and he threw it to him: [if it fell] closer to the lender, the borrower is exempt; closer to the borrower, the borrower is [still] liable; halfway [between the two], they split it. If [a wife] was standing on the roof, and [her husband] threw [a bill of divorce] to her, once it reaches the airspace of the roof, she is divorced. If he is above and she is below and he threw [the bill of divorce down] to her, once it leaves the [airspace] of the roof she is divorced. [At that point,] were it to be erased or burned, she is [still] divorced.
Reish Lakish said in the name of Abba Kohen Bardela: A man acquires a lost object within four cubits. What is the reason? (Chronicles I 22:14) "Now, behold, in my straits I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto."
Rabbi Jonah said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: A question: How can this be valid [=what case are we dealing with]? If it is within his four cubits, then he is wealthy [not in 'straits']. And if it is outside of his cubits, can a man donate to the temple something that is not his? We can validate this case, where he dedicates it as he gets it.
Rabbi Abun said: What is 'in my straits'? There is no wealth before He Who Spoke and the World Existed. Another explanation: 'in my straits' - that he would fast and dedicate his feast to Heaven.
Rav Yaakov bar Idi responded before Reish Lakish: but do we not teach: "He saw the lost object, and fell upon it, and another came and took it, he that took it has acquired it. The answer is that he did not say "My four cubits will acquire it for me". But do we not teach: "If he fell upon it [the Pe'ah], or spread his cloak upon it - we remove him from it"? This is also where he didn't say "My four cubits will acquire it for me". But did Rabbi Hiyya not teach: "Two that were wrestling upon an omer [of grain to take possession of it], and another came and took it - he that took it has acquired it. This is also where they didn't say "My four cubits will acquire it for me".
Rabbi Yissa said in the name of Rabbi Yohanan: This [=acquiring it through one's four cubits] is only talking about Gittin, which is not the case for gifts. Rabbi Yohanan and Reish Lakish both included other cases. Rabbi Yohanan included other cases, for if he acquires a lost object without aid of someone else's intent, in his four cubits, a gift, which he receives from someone else's intent, how much more so! Reish Lakish included other cases, for if a gift, which cannot be acquired through his four cubits, can be acquired through someone else's intent, a lost object, which he can acquire through his four cubits, how much more so!
Rabbi Zeira responded before Rabbi Yissa: But do we not teach: "And such is the case with Kiddushin". He responded: Gittin is Kiddushin. But do we not teach: "And such is the case with a debt". He responded: If he stipulates, throw it into the water and it shall be forgiven [the debt], it is forgiven. But if you say that, even if it is closer to the borrower it should be forgiven! and it says: "Closer to the borrower, he still owes the lender".  [No, ] it is as if he said: throw it to his area, and it has not yet entered. Rabbi Abin said: All of the questions that Rabbi Zeira asked Rabbi Yissa, Reish Lakish asked Rabbi Yohanan. And they gave the same answers.
Rabbi Abin said in the name of Hizkiyah: [splitting of the gett] means splitting the cost of the scribe [to write a new one].
Rabbi Elazar said:
