<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Fifteen [categories of] women free their co-wives”, etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Ṣaw Parashah</i> 2(9–10); another version of 2(10) in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 39b" href="/Yevamot.39b">Babli <i>Yebamot</i> 39b</a>. The basis of the argument is the 12th exegetical rule of R. Ismael [Introduction to <i>Sifra</i> (2)]: If anything was in some set and was removed from it for another purpose, you cannot return it to that set unless the verse returns it explicitly. See <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bereishit Rabbah 85:6" href="/Bereishit_Rabbah.85.6"><i>Midraš</i> <i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i> 85(6</a>) for a formulation of 2(10) referring more directly to the rule. (For an introduction to these rules, see H. Guggenheimer, <i>Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition</i>, in: Confrontations with Judaism, Ph. Longworth, ed., London 1966, pp. 171–196; <i>Über ein bemerkenswertes logisches System aus der Antike</i>, Methodos 1951, pp. 150–161.) What exactly was permitted, became forbidden, and is now commanded is a matter of interpretation in the next paragraphs.</i> It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:9" href="/Leviticus.6.9"><i>Lev</i>. 6:9</a>, speaking of the leftovers of cereal offerings in the Tabernacle.

The verse states “unleavened it should be eaten” as commandment. Similarly, “her levir shall come upon her” as a commandment. Since she was permitted and then forbidden, when she became permitted again should one think she returned to her prior permission<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A rhetorical question; this is impossible by rule 12.</i>? The verse states “her levir shall come upon her” as commandment.
Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Amora. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 40a" href="/Yevamot.40a">Babli, <i>Yebamot</i> 40a</a>, the parallel arguments, in inverse order, are attributed to Rava, a preeminent authority. He is known sometimes to represent Yerushalmi positions, cf. צבי דוֹר, תוֹרת ארץ ישׂראל 1971. בבבל, דביר, תל אביב</i> explains the <i>baraita</i>: “Unleavened it must be eaten”. Since it was permitted before it was dedicated, if one wants to eat it, he eats, not to eat, he does not eat. When he dedicated it became forbidden. When the fistful<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A fistful of the offering with all the incense, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:8" href="/Leviticus.6.8"><i>Lev</i>. 6:8</a>, brought to the altar to be burned.

If he wants to eat it, he eats, not to eat, he does not eat<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This is also Rava’s argument in the Babli. The Babli corrects the statement since the obligation to eat the remainders of the offering is repeated several times in <i>Ex</i>. and <i>Lev</i>.</i>? The verse states “unleavened it must be eaten” as commandment. Similarly, “her levir shall come upon her” as a commandment. Since she was permitted before she was married to his brother, if he wanted to bring her into his house<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As his bride.</i>, he could bring her, not to bring her into his house, he would not bring her. When she was married to his brother she became forbidden. When his brother died childless she became permitted again. Should one think she returned to her prior permission, if he wanted to bring her into his house, he could bring her, not to bring her into his house, he would not bring her? The verse states “her levir shall come upon her” as commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He <i>has</i> to marry her whether he likes her or not.</i>.
Rebbi Huna<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli (<i>l</i>. <i>c</i>. 39b) this is the opinion of Rav Isaac ben Eudaimon, a minor figure. Here also, the author R. Huna of this paragraph does not have the authority of R. Yose of the preceding paragraph.</i> explains the <i>baraita</i>: “Unleavened it must be eaten”. Since it was permitted before it was dedicated, if one wants to eat it leavened, he eats it, unleavened, he eats it. <sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The argument of the preceding paragraph has to be inserted here. Since the corrector of the ms. did not insert anything here, it probably was not in the ms. before the copyist; the lacuna can be replaced by three dots.</i> The verse states “unleavened it should be eaten” as commandment. Similarly, “her brother-in-law shall come upon her” as commandment. Since she was permitted before she was married to his brother, if he wanted to bring her into his house because of her shapeliness, he could bring her, because of her money, he could bring her. When she was married to his brother she became forbidden. When his brother died childless she became permitted again. Should one think she returned to her prior permission, if he wanted to bring her into his house because of her shapeliness, he could bring her, because of her money, he could bring her? The verse states “her levir shall come upon her” as commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">She remains forbidden if the levir has any intention other than to fulfill the commandment. This means that in practice the brother has to refrain from marrying the sister-in-law to avoid enjoying her sexually.</i>.
It turns out that Rebbi Ḥuna follows Abba Shaul, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A different formulation, stressing the opposition of the anonymous majority, in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 39b" href="/Yevamot.39b">Babli 39b</a>.</i>: “Abba Shaul says, one who brings his sister-in-law into his house because of beauty or another reason<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Other than fulfilling the biblical commandment.</i> commits intercourse of prostitution and the child is close to be a bastard<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Who is forbidden to marry a Jewish partner, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 23:3" href="/Deuteronomy.23.3"><i>Deut</i>. 23:3</a>.</i>.”
Does Abba Shaul hold with Rebbi Aqiba? Since Rebbi Aqiba said, there exists a bastard from a sister-in-law! What Rebbi Aqiba said refers to a sister-in-law who whored<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">R. Aqiba holds that any child born of any forbidden union is a bastard; the majority opinion is that bastards are created only by incestuous relations that either are capital crimes or sanctioned by extirpation (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:15:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.15.2-4">Halakhot 4:15</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 11:1:2-13" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.11.1.2-13">11:1</a>). Since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut</i>. 25:5</a>) “the wife of the deceased may not belong to any outside unrelated man” he holds that any marriage of a widow not released from levirate duty to another man is invalid and her relationship is one of whoring.<br>A parallel, but more differentiated, statement is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 92a" href="/Yevamot.92a">Babli 92a</a>.</i>. What Abba Shaul said refers to his sister-in-law<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In a completely legal situation.</i>. It comes like Rebbi Yose ben Ḥalaphta<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Tanna, who is a much more important authority than the older Abba Shaul. The formulation as a story implies that R. Yose followed Abba Shaul as a matter of personal piety but did not impose his discipline on others.</i> since Rebbi Yose ben Ḥalaphta contracted a levirate marriage with his brother’s wife. He ploughed five times and planted five saplings and had intercourse using a bedsheet<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">He avoided direct contact with his levirate wife following Abba Shaul. In a regular marriage, such behavior permits the wife to force a divorce (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 48a" href="/Ketubot.48a">Babli <i>Ketubot</i> 48a</a>). The story contradicts <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.4.1">Mishnah 4:4</a> which states that once married, the sister-in-law becomes a wife <i>in all respects</i>, including the husband’s duty to satisfy her sexual needs. Tosaphot (Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 118b) discuss the Yerushalmi versions but they read that R. Yose contracted levirate marriages <i>with the widows of his brothers</i> implying that he married five widows, had with each of them only the one biblically required intercourse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut</i>. 25:5</a>) and then divorced them. This custom was followed by some Jewish Berber groups in the Atlas mountains to modern times. (R. Moses Margalit restricts the avoidance of direct contact to the first intercourse in fulfillment of the biblical command. R. David Fraenckel concludes that R. Yose rejects <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.4.1">Mishnah 4:4</a> except that he agrees that the wife acquired in levirate can be divorced by the rules applying to any other wife.)<br>The parallel in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 118b" href="/Shabbat.118b">Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 118b</a>, formulated as personal statement of R. Yose does not mention either the sheet or levirate marriage, and appears in a completely different context.</i>. These are they: Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Only the first two are renowned; R. Ismael ben R. Yose was the teacher of R. Yehudah the Prince.</i>, Rebbi Menaḥem ben Rebbi Yose, and Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Eudaimon ben Rebbi Yose.
It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 18:16" href="/Leviticus.18.16"><i>Lev</i>. 18:16</a>.</i>: “The genitals of your brother’s wife you may not uncover.” One understands both his paternal and his maternal brothers’ wives, both the wife of a brother who lived concurrently with him or onewho did not live concurrently with him, whether he had children or did not have children<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is discussed in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 55a" href="/Yevamot.55a">Babli, 55a</a>, independently from the verse quoted next. Therefore, the Babli engages in a series of arguments to indicate that “brother” in this verse has a wider meaning than “brothers” in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut</i>. 25:5</a>; among them a reference to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 18:9" href="/Leviticus.18.9"><i>Lev</i>. 18:9</a>, where “sister” is expressly defined as at least a halfsister from any side. [A tannaitic source, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 11 8" href="/Sifra,_Kedoshim,_Chapter_11.8"><i>Sifra Qedošim Pereq</i> 11(8</a>), restricts the meaning of “brother” in this verse to that in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut</i>. 25:5</a>. Cf. R. Abraham ben David’s commentary ad loc.] The Yerushalmi has no need for an additional argument since this paragraph is still a continuation of the first one in this Halakhah, an application of the 12th exegetical rule (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.1.1.2">Note 13</a>), only that the argument is inverted. Since we know that if something was permitted, forbidden, and permitted again, the set of second permissions must be a proper subset of that of first permissions, it is necessary that the restrictions applied to the meaning of “brother” in the second set cannot apply to the prohibition. {The Babli avoids using rules 7–13 of R. Ismael and never has systematic comparisons between arguments following R. Ismael and those following R. Aqiba.}</i>. She became permitted, excluded from this set, by levirate. Should I think unconditionally? It is said here<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut.</i> 25:5</a>.</i>: “When brothers live together”; and it is said there<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 42:13" href="/Genesis.42.13"><i>Gen</i>. 42:13</a>. להלן is a Babylonism; in true Galilean style it would be תמן. The parallel argument is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 17b" href="/Yevamot.17b">Babli 17b</a>; because the constructive framework of the Yerushalmi is missing in the Babli, the latter has a lengthy discussion why the definition of “brother” for levirate is narrower than that for incest prohibitions.</i>: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers.” Since the “brothers” mentioned there are paternal brothers, so the “brothers” mentioned here must be paternal brothers.
<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut</i>. 25:5</a>. The parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 17b" href="/Yevamot.17b">Babli, 17b</a>, follows <i>Sifry</i> <i>Deut</i>. #288 in inferring from “together” not only to exclude the wife of a predeceased brother but also the wife of the maternal halfbrother who in a patriarchal world would not live in their clan.</i>“Together”, this excludes the wife of his brother who did not live in his world. “And one of them died”, of those who lived.

Was not the brother’s wife in the set of all incest prohibitions and was removed from this set by the levirate?

Rebbi Bun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Ze‘ira: Does a widow need <i>ḥalîṣah</i>? He said to him, is it possible to say that her <i>qiddushin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">A Jewish marriage is performed in two stages. The first, <i>qiddushin</i>, requires the groom to hand over to the bride an object of value (today, a gold ring) or a written promise of marriage and to declare before two witnesses that the woman is betrothed to him. From that moment on they are married as far as penal law is concerned. In antiquity, the prospective bride (who probably was in her early teens) did not prepare any trousseau. Hence, after <i>qiddushin</i> she was given adequate time to prepare and then was married to live with her husband in a second public ceremony, <i>nissuïn,</i> the execution of the <i>ketubah</i> document, in which the groom mortgages all his possessions and earnings for the upkeep of his wife and the care of his children, followed by the public recitation of seven benedictions (in the presence of 10 adult males). From that moment on, the couple is required to live in intimacy. Today, the two ceremonies are separated only by the reading of the <i>ketubah</i> and, sometimes, by a rabbi’s sermon. The period between <i>qiddushin</i> and <i>nissuïn</i> is one in which the groom is legally married, but as he is forbidden marital relations with his wife, as yet has no financial responsibility. After <i>nissuïn,</i> since the wife has a claim on his property enforceable in court, he receives administration of her estate. The “preliminary marriage” contracted by <i>qiddushin</i>, in Greek speaking communities called πρωτογαμία (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 6:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.1.6"><i>Demay</i> 6, Note 19</a>), can be dissolved only by a valid bill of divorce.</i> are legally recognized<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Incestual <i>qiddushin</i> (where the relationship is punished by extirpation by the Heavenly court or as a capital crime by the earthly court) are null and void. Forbidden marriages for which no particular penalties are indicated, such as marriages of priests with unsuitable women or marriages of bastards, are sinful but valid. Since the marriage of a High Priest with a widow would be valid, it is clear that a levirate union would be sinful but valid and, therefore, the widow needs <i>ḥalîṣah.</i></i> and you say she may not need <i>ḥalîṣah</i>? He answered him: But <i>qiddushin</i> of a she-ram<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">A woman lacking secondary feminine sex characteristics held to be infertile.</i> are legally recognized and one says that she does not need <i>ḥalîṣah</i>!

He said to him, it is evident that this person has no brain in his head. And why? He said to him, because of Rebbi Jehudah, because Rebbi Jehudah forbids the one who was raped or seduced by his father. Does Rebbi Jehudah not agree that if [the halfbrother] gave her <i>qiddushin,</i> the preliminary marriage is legally recognized?

It is generally agreed that when a levir freed his brother’s widow from the levirate by the ceremony of <i>ḥalîṣah</i>, she is forbidden to him and all other brothers. The majority opinion is that she is forbidden not as his brother’s wife since that prohibition was eliminated when levirate became possible but because it is written in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut</i>. 25:5</a> אֲשֶׁר לֹא־יִבְנֶה אֶת־בֶּית אָחִיו which is interpreted not as “who <i>would</i> not build his brother’s house but as “who <i>will</i> not build”; if he refused once he will not build in the future. If the brother who performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> nevertheless afterwards marries his sister-in-law, that marriage is recognized since no special penalties are attached to this prohibition.

Samuel holds that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is simply the removal of an impediment for the widow to remarry and does not create new marriage restrictions.</i> The words of the rabbis mean that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is freeing. Simeon bar Abba asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: What is the difference between having <i>ḥalîṣah</i> and divorcing<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Since in relation to a Cohen the woman freed by <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is at least rabbinically treated as a divorcee.</i>?

He is guilty about the co-wife since he was never cleared to have her freely. What is the difference for one of the brothers between the woman who got <i>ḥalîṣah</i> and the co-wife? He turned around and said, you do not know under which head to declare him guilty, whether as wife of the one performing <i>ḥalîṣah</i> or wife of the deceased.

Rebbi Yudan asked: Following him who says that everybody agrees about the co-wife that he is guilty, if somebody from the market gave <i>qiddushin</i> to one of them and then the levir came and performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with her or had intercourse with her, did the <i>qiddushin</i> become invalid? If he performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with her companion but then had intercourse with her, were <i>qiddushin</i> validated retroactively?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> In which way<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In which way does the wife of his brother who did not live in his world free her co-wife?, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.1.1.1">Mishnah 1:1</a>.</i> “the wife of his brother who did not live in his world”?

Therefore, the act is not called <i>qiddushin</i> but מאמר “bespeaking”: she is reserved for the brother claiming her; all other brothers are excluded from levirate with her. “Bespeaking” is not preliminary marriage since it is voided not by a bill of divorce but by <i>ḥalîṣah</i>(but it needs a rabbinic bill of divorce).<br>The other woman is not freed as co-wife but, rabbinically, one does not admit levirate since she is almost a co-wife.</i>, the second performs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> but not levirate.

What is the argument of Rebbi Simeon? “Her levir shall come upon her”, that is cohabitation. “And take her as wife for himself”, that is “bespeaking”.

If “bespeaking” is not needed, it cannot be a biblical requirement and “take her as wife for himself” does not refer to “bespeaking” but that “she is his wife in every respect” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.4.1">Mishnah 4:4</a>).</i>.
Rebbi Eleazar ben Arakh says, “bespeaking” acquires a sister-in-law completely.

Just as <i>qiddushin</i> acquire completely, so “bespeaking” acquires a sister-in-law completely.

Both the rabbis and Rebbi Simeon agree to the following<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Two different reasonings lead to the same practical result.</i>.

Rebbi Ze‘ira in the name of Rav Sheshet: There<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In Babylonia. No similar statement is found in the Babli.

This is a question of acquiring not by “bespeaking” but by candidacy. This is difficult. If candidacy acquires, both are permitted. If candidacy does not acquire, the first one is forbidden but the second permitted. Maybe candidacy for Rebbi Simeon is like “bespeaking” for the rabbis. Just as the rabbis say, “bespeaking” acquires but leaves a remainder, so Rebbi Simeon says, candidacy acquires but leaves a remainder. This is difficult. That aspect which is acquired by candidacy implies a prohibition of an equal part of the co-wife, that part which is not acquired by candidacy implies permission of an equal aspect of the co-wife! Shammai<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Shammai, the late Amora.</i> said, is this kind of argument applicable to incest prohibitions? What does he mean?

When we came up here, we heard what Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, since Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: His daughter from a woman he raped was married to a paternal halfbrother; she<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">לו read as לה, as in Tosephta, Chap. 2.

The Babli is no help; the Venice text (20b) asserts that R. Joḥanan and R.

Rebbi Shammai switches the [names] of this tradition. The position of Rebbi Shammai is reasonable since everywhere Rebbi Eleazar seeks support from the great Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Ḥiyya stated for women forbidden by a commandment or because of sanctity, if he had <i>ḥalîṣah</i> or intercourse with her, the co-widow was freed<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Statement not found in Tosephta.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A rabbi who forbade a woman to her husband because of a vow”, etc. “A rabbi who forbade a woman to her husband because of a vow cannot marry her.” I would say, that was his intention from the start. “If she repudiated or performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> before him he may marry her since he acts as a court”, because two will not usually sin for the benefit of a third.

“ “And all who had wives who [subsequently] died may marry them.” It only says “who died”; therefore, not if they were divorced. “And to all who were married to others and were divorced or widowed, they can be married”, since usually nobody sins for an uncertain future. “All are permitted to their sons or brothers,” since usually nobody sins for the benefit of either his son ot his brother.

If those married to the sisters died<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">One possible explanation is that they died childless at the same time; then each of the sisters is a candidate for levirate for either one of the surviving brothers, i. e., each is a sister of a sister-in-law and potentially forbidden.</i>, [the sisters] have <i>ḥalîṣah</i> but not levirate. If [the remaining brothers] jumped the gun and married, they must divorce them. Rebbi Eliezer said, the House of Shammai say, they shall keep them<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to him the House of Shammai must hold that candidacy has no other legal consequences (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 3:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.3.1.4">Note 19</a>). Therefore, if they married the sisters against the rules, no biblical precept has been violated. In contrast, cf. Halakhah 5.</i>, but the House of Hillel say, they have to divorce.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Four brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters,” etc. If there were four brothers, two of whom are married to unrelatedwomen, would they not be subject to levirate? There is a difference, since here there is the prohibition of sisters. In that case, they should not need <i>ḥalîṣah</i> from them! Rebbi Mattaniah said, it is because of candidacy and the prohibition of sisters is not clear<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear whether the fact that the sisters become candidates for levirate at the same time makes them forbidden; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 2:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.2.1.6">Chapter 2, Notes 27–29</a>.</i>.

He had in her an interest of candidacy. When she died, the candidacy was eliminated. And here, when he died, the candidacy was eliminated. Rebbi Abun understood it from what follows: “And her sister as long as she is alive, but the brothers are permitted.” Is her sister’s position relative to the brothers not as if<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Relative to the brother chosen to perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i>.</i> she herself had died?
“Forbidden to her are his father, his father’s father, his son and his son’s son, his brother and his brother’s son.” Does this imply that secondary prohibitions are imposed on the one performing <i>ḥalîṣah</i>?

But the son’s and the brother’s sons are secondary prohibitions. This is also the conclusion of the Babli which, however, restricts secondary prohibitions arising from <i>ḥalîṣah</i> strictly to those enumerated in the Mishnah.</i>.
So is the Mishnah: “The relative of a co-wife of a person who had <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with him is permitted to him, but the co-wife of a relative of a person who had <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with him is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text of the Mishnah.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rabban Gamliel says, there is no bill of divorce after a bill of divorce, no “bespeaking” after “bespeaking”, no copulation after copulation, and no <i>ḥalîṣah</i> after <i>ḥalîṣah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">If the childless brother left two widows and either brother gave a bill of divorce to both of them, or two brothers each gave a bill of divorce to one of them, the second bill of divorce has no legal value; the giver of the bill may marry any of the relatives of the sister-in-law who received the invalid document.<br>While a bill of divorce has no standing in levirate proceedings, it is an old rabbinic tradition that the delivery of a bill of divorce by one of the brothers prohibits all the widows from marrying any of the brothers as if it were a bill of <i>ḥalîṣah</i>. For the freeing of the widows, <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is still needed.<br>Similarly, if one of the brothers “bespoke” one of the widows, any later “bespeaking” of any other widow is null and void.<br>The parallel statement for <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is obvious since by biblical standards the act prohibits all widows for all brothers for all times.</i>. But the Sages say, there is a bill of divorce after a bill of divorce and “bespeaking” after “bespeaking”, but nothing after copulation or after <i>ḥalîṣah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages hold that no act which is only rabbinically valid has the power to eliminate biblical requirements; only levirate or <i>ḥalîṣah</i> can be final.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Her levir shall come upon her”, that is cohabitation. “And take her as a wife for himself”, that is “bespeaking”. I might think that just as cohabitation is final so “bespeaking” is final; the verse says “her levir shall come upon her.” This directs the entire paragraph towards levirate. Cohabitation is final, “bespeaking” is not final. Then what is “bespeaking” good for? To forbid her to the brothers.
Rebbi Simeon says, “bespeaking” either acquires or does not acquire. What is the argument of Rebbi Simeon? “Her levir shall come upon her”, that is cohabitation. “And take her for himself”, that is “bespeaking”. Just as cohabitation is final so “bespeaking” is final. Or “her levir shall come upon her”, then she has been acquired by him and “bespeaking” was of no use to her.
Rebbi Eleazar ben Arakh says, “bespeaking” acquires a sister-in-law completely. What is the argument of Rebbi Eleazar ben Arakh? “And take her as wife for himself”, the same expression is used as for <i>qiddushin</i> of a woman<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In both cases, the divorce document is meaningless and there is no relationship between the levir and the third widow. Cf. Tosephta 7:5 and Note 99.</i>. Just as <i>qiddushin</i> acquire completely, so “bespeaking” acquires a sister-in-law completely. What is the formula for “bespeaking” a sister-in-law? “You are betrothed to me by money or money’s worth.”
Since the rabbis say, “bespeaking” acquires but not completely, so they say, a bill of divorce frees but not completely. <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The arguments of this paragraph (except the last one) are repeated in a few short lines in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 14a" href="/Kiddushin.14a">Babli <i>Qiddushin</i> 14a</a>.</i> Should not a bill of divorce completely free a sister-in-law by an argument <i>de minore ad majus?</i> Since <i>ḥalîṣah</i> does not free a wife<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To marry another man.</i> but a bill of divorce does, is it not logical that a sister-in-law, who is freed by <i>ḥalîṣah</i>, should be freed by a bill of divorce? The verse says, “she shall pull off.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Pulling off the levir’s shoe; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:9" href="/Deuteronomy.25.9"><i>Deut.</i> 25:9</a>. The Babli points to another part of the same verse, “<i>so</i> it should be done”, so and not otherwise.</i>” By pulling off she is freed; she is not freed by a bill of divorce. So it should free anything! It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:5" href="/Deuteronomy.25.5"><i>Deut.</i> 25:5</a>.</i>: “She shall not belong … to a strange man.” Where do we hold? If he came upon her, she is his wife. If he performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with her, she should go and marry an outsider. So we must hold that he gave her a bill of divorce. Also Ḥizqiah stated thus: From where that the sister-in-law is forbidden to himself and his brothers if he gave her a bill of divorce? For him, I read “whom he had sent away<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:4" href="/Deuteronomy.24.4"><i>Deut.</i> 24:4</a>, speaking about the divorced wife.</i>”. For the brothers, I read “whom he had sent away”. Then should not <i>ḥalîṣah</i> free a wife by an argument <i>de minore ad majus?</i> Since a bill of divorce does not free a sister-in-law but <i>ḥalîṣah</i> does, is it not logical that a wife, who is freed by a bill of divorce, should be freed by <i>ḥalîṣah</i>? The verse says, “<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut.</i> 24:1</a>.</i> he shall write her a bill of divorce.” By a bill of divorce she is freed; she is not freed by <i>ḥalîṣah.</i> So [<i>ḥalîṣah</i>] should free partially! There, it is written, “she shall not belong … to a strange man.” Here, what do you have<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">There is no verse indicating any action of <i>ḥalîṣah</i> on the status of a married woman.</i>?
Since Rebbi Simeon says, “bespeaking” either acquires or does not acquire, does he say similarly that a bill of divorce frees or does not free? Let us hear from the following: Rebbi Simeon says, there is nothing after copulation if it is primary<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Mishnah and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 5:8:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.5.8.2">Halakhah 7</a>.</i>. Therefore, if it is secondary, there is something afterwards. That must deal with copulation after a bill of divorce. For if it were copulation after “bespeaking”, what could you say? If “bespeaking” acquired, there is nothing after that. If “bespeaking” did not acquire, intercourse will acquire and there is nothing after that. So we must speak about copulation after a bill of divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If he gave a bill of divorce to one of the widows and afterwards had intercourse with the second, the second is his wife and the first, who is forbidden to him, needs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> in addition to her bill of divorce.</i>. This implies that a bill of divorce frees partially<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He is certain that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is required after the bill of divorce; it is not a matter of doubt.</i>.
Does Rabban Gamliel follow Rebbi Simeon to say that “bespeaking” either acquires or does not acquire? And here, against Rebbi Simeon that a bill of divorce frees or does not free? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Yevamot (Lieberman) 7:3" href="/Tosefta_Yevamot_(Lieberman).7.3">Tosephta 7:3</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 51a" href="/Yevamot.51a">Babli 51a</a>.</i>: “Rabban Gamliel agrees with the Sages that there may be a bill of divorce after ‘bespeaking’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If there were two widows, and he “bespoke” the first and gave a bill of divorce to the second, the first and the relatives of both of them are now forbidden to him.</i> and ‘bespeaking’ after a bill of divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If he gave a bill of divorce to the first and “bespoke” the second, the second also needs a bill of divorce.</i>, a bill of divorce after intercourse and ‘bespeaking’, and ‘bespeaking’ after intercourse and a bill of divorce.” How can there be a bill of divorce after intercourse and “bespeaking”?

This implies that “bespeaking” acquires partially. If you would say that “bespeaking” either acquires or does not acquire then, as you take it, if “bespeaking” acquired, there can be nothing after that.

How can there be “bespeaking” after intercourse and a bill of divorce? If there were three sisters-in-law. He gave a bill of divorce to one, had intercourse with another, and “bespoke” the third. This implies that a bill of divorce frees partially. If you would say that a bill of divorce either frees or does not free then, as you take it, if a bill of divorce frees, there can be nothing after that. If a bill of divorce does not free, intercourse should acquire and there should be nothing after that<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In both cases, the divorce document is meaningless and there is no relationship between the levir and the third widow.

This implies that a bill of divorce frees partially<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This makes the intercourse with the second widow partially incestuous.</i>. Does Rabban Gamliel follow Rebbi Simeon? There is no “bespeaking” after “bespeaking” a sister-in-law following Rebbi Simeon. But the argument of one is different from the argument of the other. The argument of Rabban Gamliel: any part which a “bespeaking” of the the second could acquire in the future, the first already had acquired<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since the form of the legal action of “bespeaking” is not dependent on the person who acts.</i>. Any part which a bill of divorce from the second [brother] could free in the future, the bill of divorce of the first already had freed. The reasoning of Rebbi Simeon: If the first [brother] acquired, so did the second<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The second brother cannot acquire anything since he was preempted by the first.</i>. If the first [brother] did not acquire, neither did the second.

Is there a possibility of a bill of divorce after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking” or of “bespeaking” after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking” for Rabban Gamliel? What is a bill of divorce after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking”? If there were two sisters-in-law, he “bespoke” one of them and gave her a bill of divorce; then he gave a bill of divorce to the second. If you say that a bill of divorce frees, anything “bespeaking” had acquired is subject to the bill of divorce; there is no bill of divorce after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The second divorce is invalid and the levir may marry any relative of the second widow.</i>. If you say that a bill of divorce does not free, for anything “bespeaking” had acquired there is no bill of divorce; there is a bill of divorce after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Both widows and their relatives are forbidden to the levir.</i>. What is “bespeaking” after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking”? If there were two sisters-in-law, he “bespoke” one of them and gave her a bill of divorce; then he “bespoke” the second. If you say that a bill of divorce frees more than anything “bespeaking” had acquired, it is as if there were no “bespeaking” and there may be “bespeaking” after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is a theory not found elsewhere, that a divorce after (rabbinic) “bespeaking” should annul the consequences of “bespeaking” both for him, that all co-wives of the bespoken are no longer forbidden, and seemingly also for the other brothers,that the widows become permitted again for the “bespeaking” by another brother.<br>Since practice does not follow Rabban Gamliel, no answer is given. For the Sages, the answer is given in the next Halakhah.</i>. But if you say that a bill of divorce does not free more than he had acquired by “bespeaking”, there is “bespeaking” but no “bespeaking” after a bill of divorce for “bespeaking”.
In the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, can there be invalid intercourse after invalid intercourse<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For example, the intercourse with the second of three widows discussed above.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">How are the rules of <i>ḥalîṣah</i> handled? This Mishnah is not a continuation of the previous one.</i>?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A private priest should not marry a she-ram<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Who visibly is sterile.</i> unless he has a wife and children.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A private priest should not marry a she-ram,” etc. Does that mean that an Israel without wife and children may marry her? Still he is forbidden.

He who said, he is disqualified both through human or Heaven’s action, from where does he infer it? Rebbi Mana said, from here: “No one with a damaged testicle may marry,” ever. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, he still infers it from a bastard. “A bastard may not marry,” “no one with a damaged testicle may marry.” Just as a bastard is created by Heaven’s action, so the one injured in a testicle is created by Heaven’s action. Is the bastard created by Heaven’s action? His formation is by Heaven’s action. They wanted to say that he who said, through human action he is disqualified, through Heaven’s action he is qualified, follows Rebbi Ismael the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa; he who said, he is disqualified both through human or Heaven’s action, [follows] the rabbis.

If it is punctured, from the inside he is disqualified, from the outside he is qualified. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Jehudah, “inside” [means] from the corona towards the body; “outside” [means] from the corona away from the body.

The strength of Rebbi Yose comes from the statement of Rebbi Ḥilqiah, Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: One did state this only for an Israel with an injured testicle, but not a Cohen, since, as you say there, if he is certainly a Cohen it is disabling if he married a convert<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">According to R.

Let us hear from the following, as Rebbi Immi said, Rebbi Jacob from Gebal stated before Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Isaac bar Tevele in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Rebbi Jehudah stated that a male bastard should not marry a female bastard so that bastards should disappear from the world<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:11:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.11.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddushin</i> 3:13</a>, R.

Rebbi Hoshaia turned around and said, a positive commandment for an Israel cannot be compared to a positive commandment for Cohanim.

Rebbi Zakkai stated before Rebbi Joḥanan: The daughter of an Ammonite convert is enabled, the daughter of an Ammonite woman convert is disabled. Rebbi Joḥanan told him: Babylonian, you crossed three rivers on your way and got lost! But both the daughter of an Ammonite convert and the daughter of an Ammonite woman convert are enabled<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that R. Zakkai only had heard the statement that the daughter of a male Ammonite convert was enabled to be married into the priesthood and concluded that the insistence on a male would imply the quite unreasonable implication that the daughter of a female Ammonite would be disabled. R. Joḥanan points out that the statement on the daughter of a male Ammonite convert is needed for itself if the mother is an Israelite woman. Since the marriage of the parents is forbidden, the mother becomes desecrated for the priesthood. It is noteworthy that the disability does not extend to the daughter.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 77b" href="/Yevamot.77b">Babli, 77b</a>, one version of the statement of R.

Rebbi Yosa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The statement is needed only if her mother was from Israel. That you should not say, since her mother was desecrated, so the daughter is desecrated. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, she is enabled even for the High Priest. What is the reason? “In his peoples<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:14" href="/Leviticus.21.14"><i>Lev.</i> 21:14</a>, speaking of the High Priest, “only a virgin from among his people he may take as a wife.” In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 77b" href="/Yevamot.77b">Babli, 77b</a>, R.

A people divided into two peoples, the males are forbidden but their females permitted. Rebbi Ḥaggai in the name of Rebbi Pedat: Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish did not say so, but the daughter of an Ammonite convert is disabled since she comes from a disabled drop<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 77a" href="/Yevamot.77a">Babli 77a</a>, a different reason ascribed to him.</i>.

But if they married when converted, the child inherits the disabilities of both parents. Therefore, the daughter, who does not inherit any disability from her father, has the status of a second generation Egyptian from her mother (in the opinion of the rabbis who reject R. Simeon’s argument.)<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 78a" href="/Yevamot.78a">Babli, 78a</a>, formulates this explicitly: Among Gentiles, the status of the father is determining. If they converted, the more disabled is determining.</i>. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of [Rebbi] Aḥa: A <i>baraita</i> states this: From where can you say that if one of any of the families of the earth cohabited with a Canaanite woman and she gave birth to a son, that you may buy him as a slave?

In v. 44 it is stated that slaves may be bought (only) from the surrounding peoples, since Canaanites are not to be tolerated in the Land. It is then stated that a child fathered in the Land can be tolerated if his father was not a Canaanite; the argument is parallel to that of the <i>baraita</i> quoted earlier. The same statement is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 78a" href="/Yevamot.78a">Babli, 78a</a>.</i>” not from those who dwell in your land.

“They said to him: If it is practice, we shall accept this; if it is a logical argument, there is a counter-argument.” What could they have argued? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina: Are not his grandchildren forbidden for three generations, both male and female<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 18:17" href="/Leviticus.18.17"><i>Lev</i>. 18:17</a>, incest with direct descendents is forbidden for three generations, equally for males and females.

Abbahu are answered in the negative; incest prohibitions which concern capital crimes cannot be used as counter arguments in an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> involving simple prohibitions (regarding Ammonites and Moabites) or prohibitions derived from a positive commandment (regarding Edomites and Egyptians) but they may be used in applications of rules 3 and 4 of R.

Rebbi Abbahu said that Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish questioned, does one argue a matter concerning bastardy in a matter not concerning bastardy?

Rebbi Samuel ben Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, it turns out that Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon follows the argument of Rebbi Meїr. As Rebbi Meїr said, a <i>gezerah šawah</i> is as if written in a verse, so Rebbi [Eleazar] ben Rebbi Simeon says, a <i>gezerah šawah</i> is as if written in a verse.

They asked Rebbi Eliezer, what is the status of the eleventh generation of a bastard?

What is Rebbi Eliezer’s reason since he does not seem to follow Rebbi Ḥanina?

But to teach you that even the evil that the Holy One, praise to Him, brings to the world, He brings in wisdom. “His word He did not remove,” why all this? “He overcomes the house of evildoers and accomplices of workers of iniquity.” That parallels what Rebbi Levi said in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: “In the place where the ascent offering has its throat cut before the Eternal, the purification sacrifice has its throat cut,” in order not to publicize the sinners.

The House of Shammai puts the age limit at 18 and R. Eliezer at 18 for the female and 20 for the male. From his silence about levirate one concludes that he agrees that the congenital castrate cannot perform either <i>ḥalîṣah</i> or levirate, in contradiction to his statement here in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.4.1">Mishnah 4</a>.<br>The answer, given in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 80a" href="/Yevamot.80a">Babli 80a</a> by the Amora R. Eleazar, is that R. Eliezer only refers to the declaration of adulthood for the sun-castrate and the she-ram; for all other persons adulthood starts with the development of pubic hair.</i>.
Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: These are the words of Rebbi Eliezer, Rebbi Aqiba, and Rebbi Joshua. But the words of the Sages are that neither the castrate by human action nor the congenital castrate is able to perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i> nor does one perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i> for his wife<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 80b" href="/Yevamot.80b">Babli, 80b</a>, disagrees and holds that <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.5.1">Mishnah 5</a> explains <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.4.1">Mishnah 4</a> and refers only to the congenital castrate who parallels the she-ram, following R. Aqiba.</i>. He cannot perform levirate, nor does one marry his wife in levirate. That is the Mishnah: “The castrate who performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> for his sister-in-law did not disable her; if he copulated with her, he disabled her because it is incestuous.” The hermaphrodite who performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> for his sister-in-law did not disable her; if he copulated with her, he disabled her because it is incestuous<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Yevamot (Lieberman) 2:6" href="/Tosefta_Yevamot_(Lieberman).2.6">Tosephta, 2:6</a> and 11:2, equates all rules of the hermaphrodite with those of the congenital castrate. It seems that this tradition (ascribed to Rebbis Yose and Simeon in the next Mishnah) considers the hermaphrodite as a congenitally infertile male.</i>. “Similarly, if the brothers performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> for a she-ram, they did not disable her; if they copulated with her, they disabled her because it is incestuous.”

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A congenital castrate priest,” etc. It was stated: He enables her to eat breast and thigh<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">The part of breast and right front thigh from a well-being offering which has to be given to the Cohen and is eaten by him and his family; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:34" href="/Leviticus.7.34"><i>Lev.</i> 7:34</a>. In the interpretation of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 81a" href="/Yevamot.81a">Babli, 81a</a>, “breast and thigh” stands for all gifts to the Cohen which are biblical; “heave” is today’s heave which is only a rabbinical obligation.

According to the Babli, the entire discussion is about the hermaphrodite Cohen, not the one born without testicles. It seems from the second paragraph following that the Yerushalmi also has to be read in this sense.</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, there are several arguments <i>de minore ad majus</i> in this matter. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina asked, what means “there are several arguments <i>de minore ad majus</i> in this matter”? He said to him, open your mouth and receive. Rebbi Mana said, he made fun of him.

R. Abraham ben David in his commentary to <i>Sifra</i> gives two possible explanations. (1) Before the sin of the Golden Calf, first-borns exercised the priestly functions. (2) In the obligatory sacrifices of Passover and animal tithes, the Cohen gets nothing. (In profane slaughter he should get some other parts, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:3" href="/Deuteronomy.18.3"><i>Deut.</i> 18:3</a>. During the stay in the desert, profane slaughter was forbidden, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 17:3-4" href="/Leviticus.17.3-4"><i>Lev.</i> 17:3–4</a>). Since this shows that there is nothing intrinsic in the nature of a sacrifice which requires a part to be given to the Cohen, the Cohen’s parts are in some sense robbed from the Israel and given to the Cohen.</i>? Breast and thigh were within the reach of Israel but when they became guilty these were taken from them and given to the priests.

Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said the argument is about the daughter of an Israel married to a Cohen<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">The problem is not that of a handicapped Cohen but arises anytime a perfectly normal Cohen marries outsides his clan. There is no mention of such a problem anywhere else in the Talmudim.</i>: Rebbi Joḥanan said, he enables her for heave but not for breast and thigh.

Is there nobody who disagrees with Rebbi Jehudah?

But if a woman went overseas and her husband married her single sister on the erroneous news of his wife’s death, since he does not disable the sister for anybody by his invalid marriage he does not disable himself to return to his wife.</i>.” And Rebbi Abba said, Rav Hamnuna and Rebbi Ze‘ira both say that this refers to the beginning of the chapter. This means that Rebbi Yose does not disagree about the other matters<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The only disagreement of R. Yose with the Tanna of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.1.1">Mishnah 1</a> is that he holds that the wife can collect her <i>ketubah</i> from her first husband.</i>.
What does Rebbi Eleazar say about <i>ketubah</i>? If you say that he is entitled to things that come to him in prohibition, then <i>ketubah</i> that came to him in permission certainly<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">If the first husband has the right to his wife’s earnings as long as he did not divorce her, then certainly he is obligated to pay the <i>ketubah</i> whose obligation he accepted voluntarily when she was permitted to him.</i>!
It is reasonable to say that Rebbi Eleazar agrees with Rebbi Yose but Rebbi Yose does not agree with Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 91a" href="/Yevamot.91a">Babli, 91a</a>, this is the opinion of Rav Huna and is disputed by R. Joḥanan. In Rav Huna’s interpretation, for R. Eleazar the first husband can get his wife’s earnings only on the basis of the marital contract which is the <i>ketubah</i>; R. Yose will hold that the husband gets nothing to induce him to grant a speedy divorce.</i>; Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Eleazar agree with Rebbi Simeon but Rebbi Simeon does not agree with Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 91a" href="/Yevamot.91a">Babli, 91a</a>, this is the opinion of R.

Simeon is considered (as shown by the next sentence), that if the first husband dies childless before he could divorce his wife, the action of a brother in levirate or <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with her is invalid as marriage act but effective to free the co-wives. The reason given in the Babli is that R. Simeon holds that no rabbinic decree exists in this case after the death of the first husband.<br>The Babli holds that the composition principle in this Mishnah is that direction of agreement is always the same, either the later agree with the former (Rav Huna) or the former agree with the later (R. Joḥanan). This explains the slight deviation in the Mishnah from the chronological principle (R. Simeon is slightly older than R. Eleazar ben Shamua). The Yerushalmi rejects such schematism.</i>.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is no “free” here but “obligated”<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that the woman acted in good faith in both cases and that, therefore, her adultery was unintentional in both cases and can be expiated by a purification sacrifice. This is the position of Ze‘iri in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 92a" href="/Yevamot.92a">Babli, 92a</a>.</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai objected before Rebbi Yose: should it not be an act of instruction? When they instructed that it is permitted to sleep with an [otherwise] married woman<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody knows that adultery is biblically prohibited and that it is not in the power of the court to permit it.</i>.

Therefore, a technical ruling is needed to define which fat of cattle, sheep, or goats qualifies as חלב. If the court rules that certain fat that was considered forbidden is now permitted, a lay person who follows their ruling is excused; the sin is the court’s. But if the layman uses the permission of fat to eat of the permitted fat when it still contains blood, he is guilty since the ruling never included permission to eat “unkoshered” fat. Similarly, a permission to remarry does not include permission of promiscuity whose prohibition has biblical roots that have nothing to do with adultery.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 92a" href="/Yevamot.92a">Babli concurs, 92a</a>.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If a man’s wife went overseas,”, etc. It is written: “If a man slept with <i>her</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:13" href="/Numbers.5.13"><i>Num</i>. 5:13</a>; written in the paragraph about the wife suspected of unfaithfulness, from where one infers that an adulterous wife is forbidden to her husband. It is implied here that an action of the husband has no influence on her status (but in the paragraph after the next it is pointed out that the husband’s action may forbid him to her). <i>Sifry Num</i>. 7 (an involved argument in the style of the paragraph after the next), a short parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 95a" href="/Yevamot.95a">Babli, 95a</a>.</i>” her sleeping prohibits her, the sleeping of another woman does not prohibit her. There, it also says “replacing your husband,” that excludes rape cases<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">She is forbidden only if her paramour replaces the husband, i. e., if she sleeps with him voluntarily.</i>.
Rebbi Mattaniah said, they made a fence about situations that occur frequently but not about rare situations<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">He explains why the husband is not forbidden to the two sisters following the principles of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.1.1">Mishnah 1</a>. It was shown in the preceding Halakhah that most of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.1.1">Mishnah 1</a> is purely rabbinical and has the status of “a fence around the law”. The problem with this argument is that the rule which is relevant here, that the woman is forbidden to both men, is biblical (<i>Sifry Num</i>. 19).</i>. A man frequently travels overseas; it is infrequent that a woman travels overseas.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">A short version of the discussion started here is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 95a" href="/Yevamot.95a">Babli 95a</a>; the very succinct source is in <i>Sifra Qedošim Pereq</i> 9(15)-(18).</i>: Rebbi Jehudah said, the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel agree that one who copulates with his mother-in-law disables his wife. Where did they disagree? If he copulates with his wife’s sister; where the House of Shammai say, he disabled her<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Treating the man’s transgression as equal in consequence to the woman’s. In their opinion, the husband is forced to divorce his wife and pay her all that is due in a divorce which is his fault.</i>, but the House of Hillel say, he did not disable her. The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The reason of Rebbi Jehudah: “In fire they should burn him and them<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 20:14" href="/Leviticus.20.14"><i>Lev</i>. 20:14</a>.</i>.” Where do we hold? If it is about burning, only one of them is burned<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Sifra</i>, the prohibition (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 18:17" href="/Leviticus.18.17"><i>Lev</i>. 18:17</a>) is that of incestuous intercourse; the prescription of the punishment (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 20:14" href="/Leviticus.20.14"><i>Lev</i>. 20:14</a>) deals only with the case that a man marries a woman and her mother. The problem is that if one of them is married to him, he cannot possibly marry the other since any act of incestuous betrothal or final marriage is invalid and legally nonexistent. Therefore, while intercourse with mother and daughter is incestuous and forbidden, it is a capital crime only if the man is married to one of them at the time he sleeps with the other. The innocent wife did not commit any crime and, therefore, cannot be punished. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 11:1:10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.11.1.10">Chapter 11, Note 46</a>.</i>. So if it cannot be relevant for burning, let it be relevant for prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sifra</i>, as in the Yerushalmi, this is R. Aqiba’s position. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 95a" href="/Yevamot.95a">Babli, 95a</a>, this is an amoraic interpretation of R. Simeon ben Laqish reported by R. Ammi.</i>. So far following Rebbi Aqiba; following Rebbi Ismael? Rebbi Ismael stated: “In fire they should burn him and them,” him and the second one<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sifra</i>, “one of them.” He reads the unusual word אתהן (substituting for אותן) as abbreviation of <b>את</b> אחת <b>מהן</b>.</i>. And the House of Shammai was arguing: Since in a case where a slightly prohibited person copulated with a slightly prohibited person the cause of the prohibition became forbidden, if a strongly prohibited person copulated with a strongly prohibited person, it is only logical that the cause of the prohibition is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">This difficult argument is quoted anonymously in <i>Sifry Num</i>. 7 as argument that her husband’s adulterous relationship with her mother does not prohibit the wife, and explained in detail in <i>Num. Rabba Naśo</i> 9(35) (most probably a Provençal text): “Since in a case where a slightly prohibited person copulated with a slightly prohibited person, <i>this refers to adultery since her prohibition is not permanent</i> (her husband could divorce her), the cause of the prohibition (<i>the husband</i>) became forbidden (<i>he has to divorce his wife</i>), if a strongly prohibited person copulated with a strongly prohibited person, <i>this refers to a man sleeping with his mother-in-law whose prohibition is permanent</i>, it is only logical that the cause of the prohibition (<i>the wife</i>) should forbidden”, the verse says “with <i>her</i>” (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.6.2">Note 134</a>).<br>A simple and short version is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 12" href="/Numbers.12"><i>Sifre Zuṭa, Midrash Haggadol Num</i>. 12, ed. Rabbinowitz p. 51</a>.</i>. Which rule is slight? Rebbi Joḥanan said, the beginning of the chapter<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.1.1">Mishnah 1</a>, the case of careless adultery.</i>. But this is very strong<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">There is no stronger sexual prohibition than that of adultery, the only one mentioned in the Ten Commandments.</i>!

The reason given is the expression (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:4" href="/Deuteronomy.24.4"><i>Deut</i>. 24:4</a>) “after she had been defiled” which for the anonymous majority means that a wife divorced for adultery is permanently forbidden to her ex-husband.</i>.

Because of the House of Shammai, because of Rebbi Simeon. As it was stated, Rebbi Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 95a" href="/Yevamot.95a">Babli, 95a</a>, “R. Yose”. The difference in names is important; between R. Yose and R. Jehudah, practice always follows R. Yose (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:11:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.11.6">Chapter 4, Note 169</a>) whereas between R. Simeon and R.

The following argument is closely reproduced in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 95a" href="/Yevamot.95a">Babli, 95a</a>.</i> said, the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel did not disagree that one who copulates with his wife’s sister disables his wife. Where did they disagree? If he copulates with his mother-in-law; where the House of Shammai say, he disabled her, but the House of Hillel say, he did not disable her. The House of Hillel were arguing: A man is permitted all women, a woman is permitted all men<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Except close relatives, if they are unmarried.</i>. When he becomes betrothed to her, he forbids her and she forbids him. The prohibition through which he forbids her is greater than the prohibition through which she forbids him, since he forbids her to go to marry any other man but she forbids him only her relatives. And is that not an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>? If she, whose prohibition is greater, transgressed the prohibition in error, is not forbidden even to the one permitted to her<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">If a married woman sleeps with a man she is tricked into thinking is her husband and she is in error, she is not punishable and not forbidden to her husband (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 4:4:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.4.4.2-3"><i>Soṭah</i> 4:5</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 56b" href="/Yevamot.56b">Babli <i>Yebamot</i>56b</a>).

It is difficult to understand why practice has to be declared in the Babli since between R. Yose and R. Jehudah it should be clear that practice follows R. Yose.

There came a case before Rebbi Mana and he removed her from him<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">The man was convicted of incest with his mother-in-law and R.

<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">This text is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.3">Halakhah 3, Notes 76–78</a>.</i> Rebbi Abba: Rav Hamnuna and Rebbi Ze‘ira both say that this refers to the beginning of the chapter. What does Rebbi Yose say about the other matters? Let us hear from the following: “Rebbi Yose said, anything which disables for others disables for himself; anything which does not disable for others does not disable for himself.” And Rebbi Abba said, Rav Hamnuna and Rebbi Ze‘ira both say that this refers to the beginning of the chapter.
“Rebbi Yose says, anything which disables,” etc. Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: If his wife’s sister was married, since he disables her for others, he disables her for himself. But his wife’s unmarried sister which he does not disable for others, he does not disable for himself<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yose in the Mishnah refers to the preceding Mishnah. If the wife and the sister’s husband went overseas and her husband and sister received erroneous notice that the wife and her brother-in-law both had died, the widowed husband and wife’s sister married, and then the two who were believed to have died returned, since the husband by his relations with the wife’s sister forbade her to her husband, he also forbade his own wife to himself. But if the wife’s sister was unmarried, his wife returns to him.</i>. As Rebbi Hila said in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, she needs a bill of divorce from him<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">They explain the mechanism by which the wife becomes forbidden to him even though R. Yose agrees to the deduction in the preceding Halakhah that intercourse with the wife’s sister does not disable the wife. In the first case, the wife’s sister must receive a divorce document from him; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 10:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.10.1.2">Note 18</a>. But then the wife becomes the sister of his divorcee and is automatically forbidden to him.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 95b" href="/Yevamot.95b">Babli, 95b</a>, this is only a conjectural explanation of R. Yose’s intention.</i>.
“If they said to him “your wife died,” etc. How can that be<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">How may a man marry five partially related women from one family? Man A has a daughter a1 and a stepdaughter a2 from an earlier marriage. Woman B has a daughter b1 and a stepdaughter b2 from an earlier marriage. They marry and have a daughter c. If an outsider C marries first b2, on her death he may marry her paternal halfsister b1. Then he may marry c, b1’s maternal halfsister, afterwards c’s paternal halfsister a1 and then a1’s maternal halfsister a2.<br>As known, the Yerushalmi is very weak in the grammar of gender; it uses the masculine as nonspecific universal.</i>? A man has a daughter and a stepdaughter, a woman has a daughter and a stepdaughter. They married and had a daughter. It starts with the woman’s stepdaughter.

For R. Simeon, intercourse of a minor either acquires by biblical standards or it does not acquire at all, but we do not know which assertion holds (Halakhah 3:5). If it acquires, then the sister-in-law is the first levir’s wife and the action of a minor has no legal consequence; if it does not acquire for the first it did not acquire for the second, both are legally minors and their actions as minors cannot influence the status of the widow when the levirs become grownups.<br>The same argument holds for R.

Rebbi Simeon says, he takes in levirate the one he likes and performs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with the other<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Simeon, the first one either was the wife of the deceased or she was not.

The second certainly can be married in levirate. But only one of the co-widows can be married. In this case, the other is not free since maybe the first one was not a wife.</i>.

And as you said, they made the intercourse of a child of nine years and one day like “bespeaking” of an adult, they made the <i>ḥalîṣah</i> of a child of nine years and one day like a bill of divorce of an adult. But the rabbis said, the <i>ḥalîṣah</i> of a child of nine years and one day is nothing. And why did they make the intercourse of a child of nine years and one day like “bespeaking” of an adult? Because the intercourse of an adult acquires whether intentional or not intentional. The <i>ḥalîṣah</i> of a child of nine years and one day was made like a bill of divorce by an adult.

Rebbi Yose said, a Mishnah said so: “If [a male] nine years and one day old copulated with his sister-in-law and after he became an adult married another woman and died, if he never had intercourse with the first after he became an adult, the second [wife] either performs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> or levirate, the first performs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> but not levirate.

Rebbi Ḥanania the son of Rebbi Hillel said, he laces it so that she will be able to untie it with one hand. How is it done?

Rebbi Eleazar answered: “His sister-in-law shall come to the gate<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse requires the widow to take the initiative, the appropriate court is the one at the levir’s residence.

He asked him, what if she spat blood. He said, if it contains some fluid of spittle it is valid. How does the handless [woman] perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i>? He said, with her teeth. What is that which is written: “Truly, I shall tell you what is traced in writing, it is true.” If it is true, why is it traced, and if traced, why is it true?

A case came before Rebbi Huna and he followed Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. When he heard that Rebbi Joḥanan disagreed, he changed his opinion and forced a second <i>ḥalîṣah.</i> A case came before Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. He told him, my son, this woman does not want to be married in levirate; therefore perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i> and remove your candidacy from her, then she will marry you in a regular marriage. After the <i>ḥalîṣah</i>, he said to him: Even if Moses and Samuel came, they could not permit her.

There are Tannaim who state that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is shameful; there are Tannaim who state that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is praiseworthy. Rav Ḥisda said, he who says that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is shameful follows the early Mishnah, that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is praiseworthy follows the late Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Bekhorot 1:7" href="/Mishnah_Bekhorot.1.7">Mishnah <i>Bekhorot</i> 1:7</a>: “The obligation of levirate has precedence over <i>ḥalîṣah.</i> That was in earlier times, when people had the intent to fulfill the commandment, but now, when people do not have the intent to fulfill the commandment (but to enjoy the marriage) they said, the obligation of <i>ḥalîṣah</i> has precedence over levirate.”</i>. Rebbi Yose said, you might even say, in both cases one follows the early Mishnah, or in both cases one follows the late Mishnah. He who says that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is shameful, since he damaged one thing in the Torah he shall come and take his damage: “his house shall be called in Israel the house of the one stripped of shoe.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:9" href="/Deuteronomy.25.9"><i>Deut.</i> 25:9</a>.</i>” He who says that <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is praiseworthy, it mentions here “calling” and it is said there: “My name will be called about them<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 48:16" href="/Genesis.48.16"><i>Gen.</i> 48:16</a>.

Chapter 13



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The House of Shammai say, one makes only betrothed girls repudiate<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">An underage girl can be married off by her father (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:16" href="/Deuteronomy.22.16"><i>Deut.</i> 22:16</a>). If the father is dead, the girl can be married off by her mother or her brothers under rabbinic rules. Since that marriage is not valid under biblical rules, if the girl dislikes the marriage she can walk out of it by a simple declaration, without formalities (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.1.2.1">Chapter 1, Note 118</a>). The House of Shammai restrict this possibility to the betrothed girl. They hold that a consummated marriage can be dissolved only by a bill of divorce, irrespective of how the marriage was contracted.<br>The active formulation, that one makes a girl repudiate, means that under certain circumstances, explained later in the Mishnah, one tells the girl to repudiate.</i>. The House of Hillel say, betrothed or married. The House of Shammai say, the husband, but the House of Hillel say, the husband or the levir<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The House of Shammai and Sadducees restrict levirate to the widowed betrothed girl (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 1:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.1.6.2">Chapter 1, Note 192</a>). They consider candidacy for levirate as binding as marriage.</i>. The House of Shammai say, in his presence, but the House of Hillel say, in his presence or in his absence. The House of Shammai say, in a court of law, but the House of Hillel say, in a court or outside a court. The House of Hillel said to the House of Shammai: An underage girl may repudiate even four or five times<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A girl married off by her father becomes an adult by the consummation of marriage. But a girl married off by mother or brothers is not married by biblical standards and, therefore, does not become an adult until she reaches her twelfth year.</i>. The House of Shammai said to them: The daughters of Israel are not abandoned property<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">That she can sleep with any man she chooses and then leave him without formality.</i>! But she repudiates, waits until she is of age, or repudiates and is married<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since the House of Shammai do not permit repudiation by married girls, she may remarry as a minor if betrothal and marriage come together.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The House of Shammai say, one permits repudiation,” etc. There<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 6:1" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.6.1">Mishnah <i>Idiut</i> 6:1</a>. In most Mishnah sources, the tradent is R. Jehudah ben Baba.</i>, we have stated: “Rebbi Jehudah bar Abba testified to five statements: That one makes underage girls repudiate, … ” Does one disagree with testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Tractate <i>Idiut</i> is a collection of confirmed testimonies an attempt is made to reconstruct a history of early practice. These are recognized as authoritative.</i>? One disagrees about the essence of the testimony. So was the essence of the testimony: “The House of Shammai say, one makes only betrothed girls repudiate, but the House of Hillel say, betrothed or married”. It is difficult following the House of Hillel! Her marriage permitted her<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The husband’s sexual relations with her are meritorious as married sex and not sinful promiscuity.</i>, he has the right to what she finds and earns<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In exchange for the obligations the husband accepted by executing the <i>ketubah</i>, he by rabbinic convention acquires the right to the future earnings of his wife.</i>, to dissolve her vows<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The biblical prerogative of the husband (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:9" href="/Numbers.30.9"><i>Num.</i> 30:9</a>).</i>, and she is his wife in every respect. And you say so? They gave you of your own. By right, her marriage should not be a marriage. They<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The anonymous authors of the institutions of rabbinic Judaism, known as “the men of the great assembly”.</i> said that her marriage is a marriage and they said that she may repudiate him and leave.
What is the reason of the House of Shammai? If you say so, you make all intercourse he had with her intercourse of harlotry<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">An outside event would turn legitimate behavior retroactively into sin. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 107a" href="/Yevamot.107a">Babli, 107a</a>, in a first explanation formulates that nobody would marry a fatherless underage girl since he does not want to run the risk involved.</i>. Rebbi Abin said, it turns out that the House of Shammai hold with Rebbi Eleazar as Rebbi Eleazar said, intercourse of an unmarried man with an unmarried woman not with the intent of marriage is intercourse of harlotry<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 6:5:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.6.5.4">Chapter 6, Note 108</a>. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 107a" href="/Yevamot.107a">Babli, 107a</a>, the House of Hillel hold that intercourse in a formal marriage can never be sinful.</i>. That means, for the House of Shammai her repudiation is nothing if she transgressed and repudiated after marriage. If she entered the bridal chamber but had no intercourse yet, what is her status? As betrothed or as married? If she is betrothed in Judea where he is familiar with her<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Where betrothed couples were permitted unchaperoned meetings. It is assumed that they slept together; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.5.1">Mishnah <i>Ketubot</i> 1:5</a>.</i>, what is her status? As betrothed or as married<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The questions are not answered since practice does not follow the House of Shammai. The Babli holds that in all these cases, the House of Shammai would treat her as married.</i>?
If she had been in a situation that she could not repudiate, may she go and repudiate? Let us hear from the following: An underage girl who was married off by her father<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is marriage by biblical standards and can be dissolved only by death or a bill of divorce.</i> but then was divorced<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">She does not return to her father’s authority, she is “an orphan during her father’s lifetime”. Nevertheless, she cannot contract as an adult as long as she is underage. This means any marriage she contracts now, even if arranged by her father, is only rabbinic and subject to repudiation before she reaches the age of 12.</i>, if she went and married by herself she nevertheless can repudiate.
What is the reason of the House of Shammai<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Why do the House of Shammai forbid repudiation of the levir and the House of Hillel permit it?</i>? The husband she may repudiate since she married him with her consent. The levir to whom she was given by an act of God she cannot repudiate. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? If she can repudiate the principal, so much more the levir! <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This text is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 2:4:10-6:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.2.4.10-6.3">Chapter 1, Halakhah 2, Notes 121–139</a>, with small variations, mostly in spelling.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan said, she may repudiate the levir to invalidate the claim of the dead brother and to permit the co-wife to her father and the daughter-in-law to her father-in-law. Rav and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish both say, she may not repudiate the levir to invalidate the claim of the dead brother and to permit the co-wife to her father and the daughter-in- law to her father-in-law. Do Rav and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish follow the house of Shammai, since the House of Shammai say “the husband”? Where do we hold? If she says, I can stand neither the marriage with your brother nor with you, everybody agrees that she invalidates. If she says, I can stand marriage with you but not with your brother? Rav and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish both say, she says I cannot stand marriage with you but marriage with your brother I want. The Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “And all of these, if they died, or repudiated, or were divorced, or found to be she-rams, their co-wives are permitted.” Was she not divorced from him? Similarly, she repudiated him. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: If they repudiated or were divorced in the husband’s lifetime, their co-wives are permitted. After the husband’s death their co-wives perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i> but not levirate.
Rebbi Yudan, the father of Rebbi Mattaniah said: Explain it when they died and did not repudiate since there is a Mishnah: “If a woman could repudiate but did not do so and died, her co-wife performs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> but cannot be married in levirate.” Rebbi Eudaimon said, you may even say if she still lives; explain it if there is no levir besides her father.
Rebbi Jonah said, after <i>qiddušin</i>. Rebbi Yose said, even after final marriage. In the second repetition, Rebbi Yose changed his mind. Rebbi Phineas said to him, did the rabbi not teach us “after final marriage”? He answered him, is that fixed in you with a nail?
Rebbi Ze‘ira said before Rebbi Mana, did not Rebbi Yose say correctly before he changed his mind? Once a man’s daughter is married without being a she-ram, her co-wife is forbidden. If in addition she is a she-ram, does her co-wife become permitted? He said to him, the she-ram is as if non-existent. If there are two sisters-in-law, one a she-ram and one not a she-ram, if the levir comes and performs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> or has intercourse with the first, did he free her companion of anything? That shows that the she- ram is as if non-existent.
“His daughter”. How can his daughter repudiate, is she not married by Torah standards, “my daughter I gave to this man”? Rebbi Huna in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Explain it by a minor, who was married off by her father and divorced, who is like an orphan while her father is alive.
Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥinnena, in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: This means that a minor cannot give birth; because otherwise she could wait until she grew up, repudiate her husband, and permit her co-wife to her son-in-law. The daughter-in-law of Rebbi Ismael repudiated while her son was on her shoulder.
Rav Hamnuna in the name of Assi: The Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The House of Hillel who approve of repudiation of the levir apply this even to the case when there is more than one.</i> speaks about a sister-in-law who has two levirs. If one of them “bespoke” her, she may repudiate his “bespeaking” and marry on the market place<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 107b" href="/Yevamot.107b">Babli, 107b</a>, Rav Assi is reported that if she repudiates one of two levirs, she may even be married by the rejected levir himself since the Hose of Hillel will agree that the candidacy (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 2:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.2.5.1">Chapter 2, Note 9</a>) imposed by an act of God cannot be repudiated. What is reported here is in Babli the opinion of Rav, that a repudiation of the levir implies repudiation of the original marriage and elimination of the levirate.</i>. Why can she not repudiate his “bespeaking” and marry his brother? Explain it, if she says, I cannot stand you<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, neither you nor your deceased brother.</i>. Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Yosina in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">R. Hila is mentioned in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 107b" href="/Yevamot.107b">Babli, 107b</a>, as Ulla who holds that repudiation eliminates candidacy. R.

If one of them “bespoke” her, she may repudiate his “bespeaking” and marry his brother<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The same position taken by R. Hoshaia in the Babli.</i>. Why can she not repudiate his “bespeaking” and marry on the market place?

Hoshaia in the Babli; the only candidacy that is not subject to repudiation is one based on the biblical validity of the previous marriage.</i>.
“<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted also in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 107b" href="/Yevamot.107b">Babli, 107b</a>.</i> The House of Hillel said to the House of Shammai: It happened with the wife of the cameldriver Pison that the Sages repudiated for her in her absence<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli: “That his wife repudiated him in his absence”.

Since he measured crookedly, the Sages measured crookedly for him<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Babli explained that he was dishonest in administering her property.</i>.” This is difficult. Because a man behaves incorrectly, does one permit his incest prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since the House of Shammai hold that a married woman cannot repudiate, they seem to lift the prohibition of adultery from Pison’s wife. The Babli does not have this problem since it holds that “everybody who marries, marries under rabbinic rules” and that, therefore, a rabbinic court is empowered to annul a marriage as punishment for a severe infraction of the rules (e. g., <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 90a" href="/Yevamot.90a">Babli 90a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 110a" href="/Yevamot.110a">110a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 33a" href="/Gittin.33a"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 33a</a>). There is no such claim in the Yerushalmi.</i>? Rab Ḥisda said, that means that, if she transgresses and repudiated after marriage, the House of Shammai recognize her act of repudiation<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This disproves the earlier assertion to the contrary.</i>.
Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi: It happened that a girl went to wash at the river when they said to her, your betrothed is passing by. She said, let my mother go and marry him! When the case came before the Sages, they said that there is no repudiation stronger than that. Rebbi Ḥanina said, It happened that a girl went to buy flax from the flax dealer when they said to her, your betrothed is passing by. She said, let my mother go and marry him! When the case came before the Sages, they said that there is no repudiation stronger than that. It was stated in the name of Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Yevamot (Lieberman) 13:1" href="/Tosefta_Yevamot_(Lieberman).13.1">Tosephta 13:1</a>; a similar text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 108a" href="/Yevamot.108a">Babli 108a</a>.</i>: “Even if she went to buy something at the store and said, I cannot endure my husband X, there is no repudiation stronger than this.
Does a court convene for repudiation<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the requirement of the House of Shammai that the court be a party to any repudiation.</i>?

Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya: A rumor spreads for a married woman but not for a betrothed one. A woman might hide herself and say, I was not betrothed, but she will not be able to hide herself and say, I did not marry<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">R. Abba reads the statement of the House of Shammai not as a requirement but as a counsel given to the husband to publicize the marriage in order to make his claim to her widely known. (While betrothal needs only two witnesses, a standard marriage ceremony needs at least ten invitees. They will make the fact of the marriage widely known.)</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Which underage girl needs to repudiate? Anyone whom mother or brothers married off with her knowledge<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">She has been informed that she is going to live with that man as his wife.</i>. If they married her off without her knowledge<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">If either she was not informed that she was a wife or she was too young to understand the implications, she may walk out without any formality. The minimum age for a girl to be married is three years and one day (Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 5:4).</i> she does not have to repudiate. Rebbi Ḥanina ben Antigonos says, any girl who is unable to watch over her marriage gift does not have to repudiate<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If she is apt to give her marriage ring away as any other piece of jewelry, she is not married.</i>. Rebbi Eliezer says, in all legal respects, the underage girl is like one seduced<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Since the underage cannot legally enter a contract, her marriage has no legal consequences until she comes of age.</i>: The daughter of an Israel married to a Cohen may not eat heave; the daughter of a Cohen married to an Israel may eat heave.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Which underage girl needs to repudiate,” etc? What means “with her knowledge”? One makes for her a canopy, dresses her in jewelry<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Greek κοσμίδια “jewelry”.</i> and leads the man to her.
Do they disagree with Rebbi Ḥananiah ben Antigonos? From what Rebbi Joḥanan said, which is the underage girl that needs a bill of divorce? Anyone who is given her bill of divorce together with something else and she produces it after some time<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since a bill of divorce is needed if the girl is able to take care of that bill (which she needs as proof that she is unmarried and can enter a second marriage) irrespective of her maturity when she was married first, it proves that the majority does not require more than that she was made aware that she was being married and reasonably could understand what that meant.</i>.

It was stated in the name of Rebbi Meïr: His heave is never heave unless he grew two pubic hairs. Rebbi Abin, Cahana in the name of the Rebbi Hila (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:32" href="/Numbers.18.32"><i>Num.</i>18:32</a>): “You should not carry guilt because of it.” He who may carry guilt can give heave, he who cannot carry guilt cannot give heave. They objected: But a Gentile cannot incur guilt, and he may give heave! Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Hila (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:27" href="/Numbers.18.27"><i>Num.</i> 18:27</a>): “Your heave will be credited to you”, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:26" href="/Numbers.18.26">v. 26</a>) “and you shall lift”. Anybody for whom “thought” is written may give heave. But anybody for whom “thought” is not written cannot give heave. They objected: But “thought” is not written for Gentiles, and he may give heave! Rebbi Hoshaia stated: Gentiles have no “thought” whether for preparation or for heave.
Rebbi Aḥa bar Ḥinena in the name of Cahana: Following the opinion that someone who cannot give heave cannot dedicate to the Temple. Why did he not say: following the opinion that he can give heave, can he dedicate to the Temple? Because of Rebbi Jehudah, for Rebbi Jehudah says he can give heave but cannot dedicate. Rebbi Joḥanan says, even following the opinion that he cannot give heave, he can dedicate. What can he dedicate? Holocaust and well-being offerings. He cannot bring a sin sacrifice for fat because he is not obligated to a sin sacrifice for fat. He cannot bring a sin sacrifice for blood because he is not obligated to a sin sacrifice for blood. May he bring a sacrifice relating to gonorrhea and skin disease? Since it is obligatory can’t he bring it, or since he becomes impure by these can he bring it? If it is obvious for you that he brings, can he become an agent for these? Since he may become impure by these, may he become an agent, or since he cannot become an agent for anything else, can’t he become an agent for these? Rebbi Yudan objected: His produce is <i>ṭevel</i> from the Torah but he can<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Terumot</i>: “He cannot”. He can, following R. Jehudah; he cannot, following the majority.</i> free his <i>ṭevel</i> by Torah law! But here, even though he may become impure by them, he cannot become an agent. May he bring First Fruits following Rebbi Jehudah, for Rebbi Jehudah says that First Fruits have the status of territorial consecrated things? He may not bring following the rabbis who say they have the status of things consecrated to the Temple. May he bring a sacrifice of pilgrimage? Since it is obligatory can’t he bring it, or since he may change its name to well-being offering, may he bring it? May he bring a Passover sacrifice? Since it is obligatory can’t he bring it, or since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia, a person may bring a Passover sacrifice any day of the year when he changes its name to well-being offering, may he bring it? May he bring tithes of cereals<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Terumot</i>: “Of animals”. The text following shows that the <i>Terumot</i> text is correct at this place.</i>? If he holds with Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:28" href="/Numbers.18.28"><i>Num.</i>18:28</a>): “From all your tithes,” that all tithes were bracketed together, then since he cannot bring tithes of grain he cannot bring tithes of animals. May he make substitutions? If Rebbi Meïr is of the opinion that all tithes were bracketed together, then since he cannot bring tithes of grain he cannot bring tithes of animals; since he cannot bring tithes of animals he cannot make substitutions. One may hold with Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon says that tithes of animals teach you for all sacrifices about substitutions. That means, since he cannot bring tithes of grain he cannot bring tithes of animals; since he cannot bring tithes of animals he cannot make substitutions; since he cannot make substitutions for these he cannot make substitutions for any sacrifices. Is one guilty sacrificing for him outside the Temple? Cahana said, one cannot be guilty sacrificing for him outside the Temple. Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish both say, one is guilty sacrificing for him outside the Temple. The statement of Cahana disagrees with Rebbi Jehudah, since Rebbi Jehudah frees his <i>ṭevel</i> as biblical law. And you say so? We can say he [Cahana] is following him who says they accepted tithes voluntarily.
Rebbi Yoḥanan had a difficulty with the words of Rebbi Joshua. Is her marriage valid by biblical standards? The dissolution of her vows must be by biblical standards<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">This again proves that in the statement of R. Joshua early in the Halakhah, he must agree that the underage girl may walk out of the marriage by simple repudiation. This means that even according to him, the marriage of a minor is only valid by rabbinic standards. But since the annulment of the wife’s vows by the husband is a biblical law, it is difficult to see how a rabbinic marriage could confer biblical powers on the husband.</i>! And you say so! Rebbi Ze‘ira said, there is no dissolution of vows here, because of what Rebbi Joḥanan had against the words of Rebbi Joshua. Rebbi Nissa asked: Would it be the same for prohibitions<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody privatly forbade himself certain things or enjoyments. These “vows and oaths of prohibition to deprive oneself” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:14" href="/Numbers.30.14"><i>Num.</i> 30:14</a>) are exactly what the husband may hinder his wife to bind herself to.</i>? Rebbi Joḥanan said, one does not whip for prohibitions<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 1:1:2-9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.1.1.2-9"><i>Nazir</i> 1:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:2-3:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.2-3.7"><i>Nedarim</i> 1:1</a>. Since the prohibition is purely by words, it is a “prohibition not implying an action”, for whose infringement no sacrifice of purification is needed or possible. But then there is no criminal act involved and the court will not get involved. It is well possible that R. Joshua holds that the powers of the husband to eliminate such a minor prohibition extends to rabbinic marriages. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 46b" href="/Niddah.46b">Babli <i>Niddah</i> 46b</a>.</i>. Would that be as we stated there: “Before that time, even though they said, we know for Whom we made a vow or to Whom we dedicated, their vows are no vows and their dedications no dedications. After that time, even though they said, we do not know for Whom we made a vow or to Whom we dedicated, their vows are vows and their dedications dedications<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 5:6. The vows of a girl up to 11 years and a boy up to 12 years are null and void. The vows of a girl over 12 years and a boy over 13 years are valid. In the year in between the validity depends on the ability of the person making the vow to understand what he is doing.</i>.” What is the status of that Mishnah? For Cahana it is in dispute<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Who said earlier that he who cannot give heave cannot dedicate. For him, R. Jehudah will not agree to the lower time limit set by the Mishnah.</i>, for Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish it is everybody’s opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous paragraphs they had denied the link between ability to tithe and ability to make dedications and vows.</i>.

Halakhah 8

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody was married to two underage orphan girls and died, intercourse or <i>ḥalîṣah</i> of one of them frees her co-wife. The same holds for two deaf-mutes. An underaged girl and a deaf-mute: Intercourse of neither of them frees her co-wife.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the last case in the Mishnah, an underage girl and a deaf-mute. It is again supposed that the underage girl was not married off by her father and the deaf-mute was already deaf-mute at the moment of marriage. In contrast to the Babli, the Yerushalmi does not try to determine the actual difference in the rabbinic status of the two marriages. The first part of the paragraph is exactly parallel to the preceding Halakhah, Notes 91–98.</i> Is the degree of acquisition of one equal to that of the other? What does he do? Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi in the name of Rav: He marries the deaf-mute and divorces her; the underage girl has to wait until she can perform <i>ḥalîṣah.</i>” Why can she not perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i> immediately? She cannot because of Rebbi Meїr, since Rebbi Meїr said that one does not perform levirate or <i>ḥalîṣah</i> with an underage girl, since she might be found to be a she-ram. If he sleeps with the underage girl, he has to divorce her, and the deaf-mute is permanently forbidden. If he transgressed and had intercourse with the deaf-mute, he divorces her and she became permitted.” This follows what Rebbi Hila said, in order to fix her status. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Hila: What means, “in order to fix her status”? As you say there, he should perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i> for the aspect that was acquired in her and marry her co-wife; could he not perform <i>ḥalîṣah</i> for the aspect that was acquired in the underage girl and marry the deaf-mute<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the discussion in Halakhah 6 and supports the reading of Naḥmanides in Note 81. It is suggested there that in case of partial validity of a marriage there could be a partial <i>ḥalîṣah</i> which permits the co-wife for levirate; in our case there would be a solution which takes care of the deaf-mute without requiring the levir to commit a sin. {This also supports the position of Nahmanides that the Yerushalmi in Halakhah 6 choses R. Eleazar over R. Shammai.}</i>? He said to him, so says Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: We never find two sisters-in-law of whom one performs <i>ḥalîṣah</i> and one is married in levirate.

Rebbi Jehudah says, she is never believed unless she comes crying with torn clothes. They said to him, in any case she can remarry.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The House of Hillel say, we heard only about one who came from the grain harvest<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah is shortened in the Yerushalmi. In the Babli and the independent Mishnah mss. the text reads: “The House of Hillel say, we heard only about one who came from the harvest,<i>in the same district</i>, <i>and as it happened</i>. The House of Shammai said to them, it makes no difference whether she comes from the grain harvest, or from the olive harvest, <i>or from the grape harvest, or from another district</i>. The Sages spoke about the grain harvest only because what happened. The House of Hillel reversed themselves and taught following the House of Shammai.” It seems that the rule that the woman is permitted to testify on her own behalf was promulgated first in a case when the husband died of a heat stroke on the field and was immediately buried in place. {The cause of death was accepted as reasonable and the details of her testimony were subject to possible verification.} The House of Hillel restricts the precedent to exactly the circumstances of the first case.</i>. The House of Shammai said to them, it makes no difference whether she comes from the grain harvest, or from the olive harvest, or from overseas.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The House of Shammai say, she should remarry,” etc. May the daughters claim upkeep based on her word<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained later in the Halakhah, the standard text of the <i>ketubah</i> requires that “the sons will inherit and the daughters will be supported”. Since her testimony activates the <i>ketubah</i>, the daughters should be able to claim support (and a dowry in case they marry). But since the claim of the daughters is made dependent on that of the sons, and the sons cannot claim the inheritance on basis of her testimony, the daughters should be unable to claim support. The question is not answered (which <i>in praxi</i> means that the daughters cannot collect.) The problem is not treated in the Babli.</i>?

Rebbi Jehudah insists on interpreting the contract text. <sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 4:11" href="/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).4.11">Tosephta <i>Ketubot</i> 4:11</a>; a similar text <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Metzora, Section 4 16" href="/Sifra,_Metzora,_Section_4.16"><i>Sifra Meṣora‘ Parašah</i> 4(16</a>). The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 104a" href="/Bava_Metzia.104a">Babli, <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 104a</a>, presents a problem. The text of the <i>editio princeps</i> formulates the statement that he is responsible for “any other obligations that come to you from earlier times” as part of the <i>ketubah</i> document; this is R. Jehudah’s reason to require that the husband pay for all obligatory sacrifices due from his wife, even if the obligation predates the marriage. Rashi <i>ad loc</i>. changes the text to conform to the <i>Sifra</i> text; the changed text is that of the Munich ms. and all other Ashkenazic surviving mss.</i> It was stated in the name of Rebbi Jehudah: A person brings for his wife any sacrifice she is obligated for<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Nega‘im</i> 14:12. The majority hold that the husband has to pay only for his children and slaves. R.

But he does not have to pay for her voluntary sacrifices.</i>, even if she ate suet or desecrated the Sabbath. Also, Rebbi Jehudah says, once he divorces her, he is no longer obligated for her, for she writes to him<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In the receipt she gives for full payment of her <i>ketubah</i>.</i> “any other obligations that come to you from earlier times.”
Rebbi Yose insists on interpreting the contract text. Rebbi Yose explained: In a place where one treats the <i>ketubah</i> as a loan<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>ketubah</i> is treated as a mortgage on the groom’s real estate from the moment it is signed and due at the dissolution of the marriage, it relegates all mortgages executed during the marriage to secondary status. Any real estate sold by the husband after he signed the <i>ketubah</i> is potentially subject to foreclosure by the wife if there is not enough real estate left in the husband’s possession to satisfy her claim. Therefore, care must be taken in establishing the value of the <i>ketubah</i> in order to protect the innocent buyer. The value of the <i>ketubah</i> is the sum of three parts. (1) The basic sum of 200 <i>zuz</i> (defined in Mishnah <i>Peah</i> 8:8 as an amount which disqualifies its owner from public charity), (2) the voluntary amount added by the groom to that sum, and (3) the value of the dowry. It is stated here that the value of the dowry may be collected by foreclosure only if its value is correctly stated in the <i>ketubah</i> document. In places where the value of the dowry is routinely doubled, the document cannot be used against third parties for more than half the stated value.<br>A parallel text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 104b" href="/Bava_Metzia.104b">Babli <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 104b</a> and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 4:13" href="/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).4.13">Tosephta <i>Ketubot</i> 4:13</a>; in the latter text (all sources) in the name of R.

Rebbi Eleazar [the caper grower] said, nobody is permitted to buy domesticated or wild animals or birds unless he has food prepared for them<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ketubot</i>, this is also declared to be the interpretation of a document but the document is not indicated.</i>. Rebbi Joshua ben Qorḥa insists on interpreting the contract text, since Rebbi Joshua ben Qorḥa said, a person lending money to another person should not take pledges from him for more than the value of the loan since he writes for him: “It will be paid by the property that came to my hand that I shall acquire corresponding to this [sum].”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ketubot</i>, the text is slightly different: “He who takes a pledge from his debtor shall take it only in court; he may not enter the debtor’s house to take the pledge.” The parallels in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 104a" href="/Bava_Metzia.104a">Babli <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 104a</a> and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 4:12" href="/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).4.12">Tosephta <i>Ketubot</i> 4:12</a> follow the text given here. The text in <i>Ketubot</i> seems to require that the value of the pledge should be determined by an official of the court.

Rav Huna insists on interpreting the contract text. Rav Huna explained: “The sons shall inherit but the daughters must be fed<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 4:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.4.6.1">Mishnah <i>Ketubot</i> 4:6</a>.</i>.” Since the sons inherit movables<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Since the entire inheritance goes to the sons, it seems logical that the daughters should have a lien on the entire inheritance.</i>, the daughters also are fed from movables. Samuel said, the daughters are not fed from movables.

Since the divorce, once approved by a competent court, cannot be reversed, the second marriage will always be legitimate in the eyes of the public and the children will be legitimate and able to marry in the congregation.

“If one witness says,” etc. “If one witness says that he died and she remarried, then another comes and says that he is not dead, she shall not leave.” Because he said that after she had remarried.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> [(He robbed one of five people). Rebbi Abun said, the Mishnah deals with the case that she was betrothed by a document.

A; it is genuine since it is quoted by the twelfth Century author R. Isaac ben Abba Mari in Sefer Ha‘ittur (ed. R. Meїr Jonah, vol. 1, 79b, Notes 121,122). In a parallel (anonymous) discussion, the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 118b" href="/Yevamot.118b">Babli (118b</a>) states that R.

According to that opinion, R. Aqiba declares the additional payments to be a fine; this seems to contradict the language of the Mishnah.<br>In the interpretation of the <i>Sefer</i> <i>Ha‘ittur</i>, the document of betrothal would count as proof of a <i>ketubah</i>. Since each woman claims to have had such a document but lost it, they cannot enforce a claim and the two have to fight about one <i>ketubah</i>. If the betrothal was by money’s worth, in the opinion of the Yerushalmi the divorcee can claim the basic amount of the <i>ketubah</i> even if the marriage was not consummated (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:1:2-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.1.2-6"><i>Ketubot</i> 5:1</a>). Since in that case there was no negligence on the part of the woman, he has to pay. (The Babli would hold that one does not follow the Mishnah and in practice no <i>ketubah</i> is due until the marriage is consummated.)</i>
“He robbed one of five people.” Rebbi Assi said, there is a Mishnah which follows Rebbi Aqiba against Rebbi Tarphon.

In the interpretation of R. Moses Margalit (פני משה), the Mishnah <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> refers to a case where there are witnesses to the robbery but they cannot identify the victim, but in <i>Yebamot</i> there are no witnesses at all.

It is argued that if the Yerushalmi reason were true, it could be applied to the case of the co-wife and then the woman left at home would be free to remarry. The Babli explains the position of R. Joshua that the woman was known to be free from levirate when her husband left. Since the probability that the mother-in-law gave birth to a live son is less than 50%, the known prior state remains in force because the probability that it remained in force (that either the mother-in-law had a baby girl who cannot be a levir, or there was a still birth, or a termination of pregnancy) is greater than 50%.</i>.

“Even though there are [marks] on his body and his clothing.” Did one not state: From where that if your fellow man is lost, you return him both body and property<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The verse to which this refers is not indicated; it probably refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:2" href="/Deuteronomy.22.2"><i>Deut</i>. 22:2</a> where the obligation to return a find is extended to include helping a person who is lost, since the end of the verse may be read “return him to himself.” The essence of the verse is interpreted to mean that the obligation to return property exists only after the person who claims to be the owner was examined as to the validity of this claim (<i>Sifry Deut.</i> 223; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 2:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.2.6.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 2:7</a>); in <i>Midrash Tannaïm</i> (<i>Midrash Haggadol Deut</i>, ed.

The answer given here (and in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 120b" href="/Yevamot.120b">Babli, 120b</a> and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 27b" href="/Bava_Metzia.27b"><i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 27b</a>) is that after death, bodily marks will rapidly change. The Babli in <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> adds that clothing or documents found on a corpse are no proofs of identity since they may belong to someone else.</i>? There is a difference, because marks are apt to change.
So is the Mishnah: “One testifies only up to <i>after</i> three days<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">One testifies that the person was identified within a full 72 hours.</i>.” Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Pappai, Rebbi Joshua from Suknin in the name of Rebbi Levi: During the first three days, the soul hovers over the body because she thinks that she will return to it<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 152b" href="/Shabbat.152b">Babli, <i>Šabbat</i> 152b</a>, the verse from Job quoted at the end of this sermon is taken as proof that the soul remembers this world until all flesh is decomposed.</i>. Once she sees that the splendor of his face changes after three days, she abandons him and goes away.
