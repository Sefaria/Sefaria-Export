Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A wife may be acquired<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In matters of criminal law, any relations the woman might have with another man would be adultery. The husband cannot live with his wife (and does not acquire any dowry she might bring with her) unless he accepts the financial responsibilities incumbent upon a husband in a public ceremony, attended by at least 10 witnesses (cf. Peah 6:2, Note 46). The acquisition, or betrothal, mentioned here only needs the presence of two witnesses.</i> in three ways; she regains her autonomy in two ways. She is acquired by money<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The woman agrees to be preliminarily married for a monetary consideration given in the presence of two witnesses.</i>, or by a document<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A written promise of marriage.</i>, or by intercourse<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Attested to by two witnesses. It is enough for the witnesses to confirm that the parties were together in a locked bedroom for a period of time sufficient for intercourse. Since one speaks of preliminary marriage, the couple is in principle forbidden to live together after such intercourse and before the definitive marriage. There is a midrashic doctrine that no woman can become pregnant from her first intercourse unless she had lesbian or autoerotic experiences [<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bereishit Rabbah 45:5" href="/Bereishit_Rabbah.45.5"><i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i>45(5</a>), 51(11); <i>Pesiqta rabbati</i> 42, p. 177].</i>. By money, the House of Shammai say, by a denar<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A Roman silver denar; under Augustus and his first successors about 3.5 g of silver.</i> or a denar’s value; but the House of Hillel say, by a <i>peruṭa</i> or a <i>peruṭa’s</i> value. How much is a <i>peruṭa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>peruṭa</i> was a small Hasmonean copper coin which disappeared with the end of the Jewish commonwealth, more than 100 years before the compilation of the Mishnah.

She regains her autonomy by a bill of divorce or by the husband’s death. A sister-in-law<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The widow of a brother who died childless; cf.

Once she is married, she is a wife in all respects and regains her autonomy by divorce or widowhood.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A wife may be acquired in three ways,” etc. So is the Mishnah: Either by money, or by document, or by intercourse. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated as follows: Not only by all three together, but even by any one of them.
By money, from where? “After he acquires,” this tells you that she is acquired by money.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 2a" href="/Kiddushin.2a">Babli 2a</a>. In rabbinic Hebrew, לקח means “to buy”. The Babli shows from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 23:13" href="/Genesis.23.13"><i>Gen</i>. 23:13</a> that לקח in biblical Hebrew may mean “to accept a deal involving money”. By the talmudic doctrine of invariability of lexemes in biblical language, the same meaning must apply in all cases.</i> By marital relations, from where? “And has marital relations with her,” this tells you that she is acquired by intercourse<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 9b" href="/Kiddushin.9b">Babli 9b</a>. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>: “After a man takes a wife and has marital relations with her” is the preamble to the rules of divorce. The verse is read to mean: “After a man buys and/or has marital relations with a woman, if he desires to terminate the relationship he is required to follow the rules of divorce.” Since there is no divorce without a preceding marriage, it follows that acquiring a wife by money and/or intercourse establishes marriage by biblical standards.</i>. I would say, by both together. Money without intercourse and intercourse without money, from where? <sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This elliptic statement is shortened from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:6:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.6.3"><i>Ketubot</i> 3:6 (Notes 88–92</a>). The man who sleeps with a virgin preliminarily married to another man is stoned; one who sleeps with a married woman who is not a virgin is strangled. Since the verse mentions only intercourse, it is deduced that even if no money was given, the girl is legally bound to her husband and the seducer or rapist is executed for adultery.</i> Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, it is written: “If a man is found lying with a woman having had intercourse with her husband.” Think of it, even if he did only acquire her by intercourse, the one coming after him is [executed] by strangulation. Not only regular intercourse but even perverse<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Sex play which leads to satisfaction without penetration and ejaculation.</i>. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, it is necessary to mention perverse intercourse for if it were regular, why mention her husband<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">If the verse was simply intended to state that the punishment of the adulterer with a non-virgin is different from that with a virgin, it would not have mentioned “her husband”. The husband makes his wife a non-virgin even by perverse intercourse, any other man only by penetration.</i>? As we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 7:11:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.7.11.1">Mishnah <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:15</a>.</i>: “If she was raped by two men, the first is stoned, the second strangled<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If the first one penetrated her.</i>.”
So we learned intercourse without money. Money without intercourse, from where? “She shall go free, without money.” “If he did acquire another one.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:11" href="/Exodus.21.11"><i>Ex</i>. 21:11</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:10" href="/Exodus.21.10">10</a>, speaking of the “Hebrew slave girl”, the underage girl sold by her father with the understanding that the buyer may use the amount he paid for the girl as bride-money in case he wants to marry her or give her to his son. This certainly is marriage by money. V. 11 notes that if she is not married either within 6 years or by the time she reaches adulthood, she goes free; the money given for her was to buy her working power. V. 10 states that once she is married, she cannot be treated differently from any other wife. It is inferred that as a matter of principle her acquisition cannot be different from that of any other wife.</i> Since one was by money, so the other is by money<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Simeon bar Ioḥai</i> (p. 167) the argument is inverted: Since in general a woman may be acquired by a document, so Hebrew slave girls may be acquired by a document.</i>.
By a document? “He shall write her a bill of divorce, hand it to her, and send her out of his house. If she left his house and went to be another man’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>.</i>” It brackets her being with her leaving<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 5a" href="/Kiddushin.5a">Babli 5a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 15b" href="/Eruvin.15b"><i>Erubin</i> 15b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sukkah 25a" href="/Sukkah.25a"><i>Sukkah</i>25a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 47a" href="/Ketubot.47a"><i>Ketubot</i> 47a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 21b" href="/Gittin.21b"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 21b</a>; <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 269, end.</i>. Since her leaving was by a document, so her being is by a document.
Rebbi Abin said that Ḥisqiah stated: <sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifry Deut</i>. 268; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 4b" href="/Kiddushin.4b">Babli 4b</a>.</i>“After he acquires,” which means that she is acquired by money<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 2a" href="/Kiddushin.2a">Babli 2a</a>. In rabbinic Hebrew, לקח means “to buy”. The Babli shows from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 23:13" href="/Genesis.23.13"><i>Gen</i>. 23:13</a> that לקח in biblical Hebrew may mean “to accept a deal involving money”. By the talmudic doctrine of invariability of lexemes in biblical language, the same meaning must apply in all cases.</i>. Would it not be an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Then the verse would be redundant.</i> Since the Hebrew slave girl, who cannot be acquired by intercourse, can be acquired by money, would it not be logical that this one, who may be acquired by intercourse, should be acquired by money? This is proved<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In these kinds of arguments, “proves” means “disproves the possibility of an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>” because the rules are not comparable.</i> by the sister-in-law, who cannot be acquired by money but is acquired by intercourse<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In definitive marriage. By biblical standards there is no preliminary levirate marriage.</i>. Therefore you would not be astonished if this one, who may be acquired by intercourse, might not be acquired by money. The verse says, “after he acquires,” this tells you that she is acquired by money<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is necessary to understand the rules.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifry Deut</i>. 268; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 5a" href="/Kiddushin.5a">Babli 5a</a>. The argument is completely parallel to that of the preceding paragraph.</i>“And has marital relations with her,” this tells you that she is acquired by intercourse. Would it not be an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>? Since the sister-in-law, who cannot be acquired by money, can be acquired by intercourse, would it not be logical that this one, who may be acquired by money, should be acquired by intercourse? The Hebrew slave girl proves<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In these kinds of arguments, “proves” means “disproves the possibility of an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>” because the rules are not comparable.</i>, who cannot be acquired by intercourse but is acquired by money. You likewise do not wonder that this one, who may be acquired by money, might not be acquired by intercourse. The verse says, “after he acquires,” this tells you that she is acquired by money; “and has marital relations with her,” this tells you that she is acquired by intercourse.
<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifry Deut</i>. 268; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 4b" href="/Kiddushin.4b">Babli 4b</a>.</i> By a document. Since money which does not send out permits to enter, would it not be logical that a document which sends out should permit to enter<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Money is used in preliminary marriage, to permit the woman to enter her husband’s family. Money cannot be used for divorce; the wife cannot pay the husband as a formal means of divorce.</i>? No. If you speak about money which eliminates dedication through redemption<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">All valuables dedicated to the Temple regain their profane status by redemption when that money is given to the Temple treasury, and in no other way.</i>, what can you say about a document which does not eliminate dedication through redemption<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Dedications cannot be redeemed by an I.O.U.</i>? The argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> is broken and you have to return to Scripture. Therefore, it was necessary to say: “He shall write her a bill of divorce, hand it to her, and send her out of his house. If she left his house and went to be another man’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>.</i>” It brackets her being with her leaving<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 5a" href="/Kiddushin.5a">Babli 5a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 15b" href="/Eruvin.15b"><i>Erubin</i> 15b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sukkah 25a" href="/Sukkah.25a"><i>Sukkah</i>25a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 47a" href="/Ketubot.47a"><i>Ketubot</i> 47a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 21b" href="/Gittin.21b"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 21b</a>; <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 269, end.</i>. Since her leaving was by a document, so her being is by a document.
Rebbi Yudan said, an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> that a free woman should be acquired by actual possession<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">His proof that arguments <i>de minore ad majus</i> are inappropriate here is explained at length in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.4.3"><i>Ketubot</i>5:5, Note 100</a>.<br>As a legal term, חֲזָקָה may have two very different meanings. What seems to be intended here is that ownerless property can be acquired by active actual possession (i. e., possession combined with use.) The idea seems to be that a woman, performing a wife’s duty in a man’s house, by this act should become his wife. The comparison is to a slave woman who belonged to a proselyte who failed to start a Jewish family and dies without heirs. Any Jew who gets hold of her and lets her perform a servile job for himself has acquired her in law.<br>A second meaning of חֲזָקָה is “permanence of the <i>status quo ante</i>,” cf. <i>Giṭṭin</i> 3:3, Notes 81,89; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 9:2:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.9.2.8"><i>Nazir</i> 9:2, Note 90</a>. This meaning is referred to, somewhat incongruously, in the verse quoted at the end; property is inherited by the permanence of the state of “belonging to”.<br>A subcategory of “permanence of the <i>status quo ante</i>” is the validation of squatter’s rights after three years of undisturbed possession, if accompanied by a claim of rightful acquisition.</i>. Is it not logical that since a Gentile slave woman, who cannot be acquired by intercourse, can be acquired by actual possession, by an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> a free woman, who can be acquired by intercourse, could be acquired by actual possession? The verse says, “and has marital relations with her.” She can be acquired by intercourse but cannot be acquired by actual possession. An argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> that a Gentile slave woman should be acquired by intercourse: Is it not logical that since a free woman, who cannot be acquired by actual possession, can be acquired by intercourse, by an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> a Gentile slave woman, who can be acquired by actual possession, could be acquired by intercourse? The verse<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:46" href="/Leviticus.25.46"><i>Lev</i>. 25:46</a>.</i> says, “you may leave them as inheritance to your sons after you, to inherit them as property.” She is acquired by actual possession; she is not acquired by intercourse. So we inferred that a woman can be acquired in three ways: by money, or by document, or by intercourse.
So far for Israel. For the Gentiles? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i> 18(8), a parallel source for this and the following paragraphs: R. Abbahu in the name of R. Joḥanan.</i>: It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 20:3" href="/Genesis.20.3"><i>Gen</i>. 20:3</a>, speaking to the Gentile Abimelech.</i> “you shall die because of the woman whom you took, since she is having marital relations with a husband.” They are guilty for those having marital relations; they are not guilty for the betrothed<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 57b" href="/Sanhedrin.57b">Babli, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 57b</a>.</i>. The words of Rebbi Eleazar imply, only if he had intention of acquiring her; the words of Samuel imply, even if he had no intention of acquiring her; since Rebbi Jonah said in the name of Samuel<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i>: “Rebbi Samuel.” For chronological reasons, and also because he is quoted after R. Eleazar, the reading of <i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i> is the only acceptable one.</i>: “A prostitute stands in a window<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">To attract customers.</i>. Two men sleep with her. The first one<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Who deflowers her. In R. Samuel’s opinion, a Gentile marriage can be contracted only by intercourse and there is no divorce. Therefore, a free woman is automatically married to the man who deflowers her and any subsequent intercourse with any other man (during the first man’s lifetime) is adultery.</i> is not killed, the second one is killed because of him<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As an adulterer. In his theory, a Gentile can sleep without guilt only with a wife whom he married as a virgin, or a chaste widow, or a servile prostitute who as a slave cannot marry.</i>.” But did the first one intend to acquire her<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Eleazar, Gentiles can be married only by mutual consent. Then they also can repudiate the marriage.<br>In <i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i> 18(8) only R. Samuel’s opinion is quoted, with the addition that “for Gentiles, intercourse acquires automatically.”</i>?
“A man.” Why does the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 18:5" href="/Leviticus.18.5"><i>Lev</i>. 18:5</a>: “Any man to any blood relation shall not come to uncover nakedness.” Parallel interpretations are in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 57b" href="/Sanhedrin.57b">Babli, <i>Sanhedrin</i>57b</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Acharei Mot, Chapter 13 1" href="/Sifra,_Acharei_Mot,_Chapter_13.1"><i>Sifra Aḥare Pereq</i> 13(1</a>).</i> say, “any man”? To include that Gentiles who committed adultery or incest<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">עֶרְוָה “nakedness”, abbreviated for גִּלּוּי עֶרְוָה “uncovering of nakedness”, is the legal term for “incest and/or adultery”.</i> by Gentile rules should be judged by Gentile law, but if they committed adultery with a Jewishwoman, one judges them by Jewish law. Rebbi Eleazar said, of all of them there is only the Jewish betrothed<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Gentile cannot commit incest with a Jewish partner since he has no family relationship with her. If he commits adultery with a married woman, he is guilty under Gentile law. The only case is intercourse with a preliminarily married woman, which is adultery in Jewish law but a relationship with an unmarried woman by Gentile standards.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 57b" href="/Sanhedrin.57b">Babli, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 57b</a>, this also is a statement of R. Joḥanan.</i>, for if he had intercourse with a Jewish preliminarily married woman he is guilty, with a betrothed Gentile woman he cannot be prosecuted. If he had intercourse with a Jewish preliminarily married woman he is guilty. How is he found to be guilty? By their rules or by Jewish rules? If you say by Jewish rules, by two witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:15" href="/Deuteronomy.19.15"><i>Deut</i>. 19:15</a>.</i>, 23 judges<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 1:2:1-4:10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.1.2.1-4.10">Mishnah <i>Sanhedrin</i> 1:4</a>.</i>, after warning<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 3:4:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.3.4.7"><i>Soṭah</i> 3:4, Note 121</a>.</i>, and by stoning. If you say by their rules, by one witness, one judge, without warning, and by the sword<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Reading of the <i>editio princeps</i>. The corrector wrote בהונקו. No root הנק is known.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This does not belong here; except for the name, it is the corrector’s text taken from <i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i> 34(19) where from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 9:6" href="/Genesis.9.6"><i>Gen</i>. 9:6</a> it is inferred that Gentiles are executed by the sword. The verse reads: שוֹפֵךְ דַּם הָאָדָם בָּאָדָם דָּמוֹ יִשָּׁפֵךְ “He who spills a human’s blood, by humans his blood shall be spilled.” Then the question arises whether a murderer who kills by strangling can be prosecuted under Noahide law. To this, R. Jehudah <i>bar Simon</i> gives a positive answer by reading the verse as: “He who spills a human’s blood <i>within a</i> human, his blood shall be spilled.” [In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 57b" href="/Sanhedrin.57b">Babli, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 57b</a>, R. Ismael is quoted as deducing that for a Gentile, the killing of a foetus, a “human within a human”, is a capital crime. In rabbinic law, abortion is not prosecutable and is even required if the mother’s life is at risk (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Oholot 7:6" href="/Mishnah_Oholot.7.6">Mishnah <i>Ahilut</i> 7:6</a>).]</i> Rebbi Jehudah bar Pazi added one who strangles, as a separate offense. What is the reason? For “blood in a human.”
If you say, by Jewish rules, he<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Gentile who had raped a preliminarily married virgin, mentioned in the paragraph before the last.</i> is guilty if he converted. If you say, by their rules, he cannot be prosecuted if he converted, as Rebbi Ḥanina said, a descendant of Noah who blasphemed and then converted cannot be prosecuted since the law changed for him<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Nobody can be convicted under a law which did not apply to him at the moment the criminal act was committed. Since after conversion, Jewish law applies to him, he cannot be prosecuted for prior crimes. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 71b" href="/Sanhedrin.71b">Babli agrees, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 71b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: The descendants of Noah are warned about nakedness<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">עֶרְוָה “nakedness”, abbreviated for גִּלּוּי עֶרְוָה “uncovering of nakedness”, is the legal term for “incest and/or adultery”.</i> as Jews are<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gen</i>.<i>rabba</i> 18(8), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 58b" href="/Sanhedrin.58b">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i> 58b</a>.</i>; <sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 2:24" href="/Genesis.2.24"><i>Gen</i>. 2:24</a>.

From <a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 20:12" href="/Genesis.20.12"><i>Gen</i>. 20:12</a> it is inferred that the uterine half-sister also is forbidden.</i>. Rebbi Samuel, Rebbi Abbahu, Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: A descendant of Noah who had perverse intercourse<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Any sex play which does not include penetration and ejaculation.</i> with his wife is killed. What is the reason? “He shall cling to his wife so they become one flesh,” at the place where they together create one flesh<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Any intercourse which excludes the possibility of creating a pregnancy is sinful, except regular intercourse with one’s pregnant wife.</i>.
Rebbi Yose asked: What is the legal status of “touching”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">If the two persons’ genitals are touching. This is the definition of a sex act for criminal and marriage laws (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:2:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.2.3"><i>Yebamot</i>, 4:2 Note 59</a>; 6:1, Note 11 ff.)</i> a male? What is the legal status of “touching” an animal? Were not all incest prohibitions inferred from the menstruating woman<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Not the prohibition, but the technicalities which make the act prosecutable. It is spelled out in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 20:18" href="/Leviticus.20.18"><i>Lev</i>. 20:18</a> that in the case of the menstruating woman, “touching” establishes the criminality of the act. Therefore, for Jews “touching” is the equivalent of completed intercourse in criminal law. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 54b" href="/Yevamot.54b">Babli, <i>Yebamot</i> 54b</a>, seems to reject the equation of bestiality with homosexual activity.</i>? The male is included; the animal is included. So far, for Israel. For Gentiles? Rebbi Mana said, not from this: “He shall cling to his wife”? Not in any way to somebody else’s wife, not in any way to a male or an animal.
So we have established that Gentiles have no preliminary marriage. Do they have divorce? Rebbi Jehudah ben Pazi and Rebbi Ḥanin in the name of the great Rebbi Ḥuna of Sepphoris: Either they have no divorce, or either of them may divorce the other. Rebbi Joḥanan from Sepphoris, Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥinena, in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman: “For the divorcer is hateful, says the Eternal, Israel’s God.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Malachi 2:16" href="/Malachi.2.16"><i>Mal</i>. 2:16</a>, speaking of the person divorcing his first wife without necessity.</i>” In Israel I gave divorce, I did not give divorce among the nations of the world. Rebbi Ḥananiah in the name of Rebbi Phineas: In the entire paragraph it is written “the Eternal, Sabaot”; only here it is written “Israel’s God.” To teach you that the Holy One, praise to Him, did lend his name only to Jewish divorce.

The House of Hillel hold that only the amount not amortized by the girl’s work in the meantime is bridal money.

There it is argued that since silver is mined from the earth, also “vessels” should be restricted to those made from terrestrial material, to exclude anything coming from the sea (either from seaweed or fish skin). R. Jehudah reads כֵּלִים as כְּלֵי יַם “objects from the sea” (explanation of J. N. Epstein). E. Z. Melamed also reports there that J. N. Epstein, in his personal copy of the Yerushalmi, emended the parallel reading in <i>Šebuot</i>, כלי חרס “clay vessels”, into כלי חרם “fisherman’s netting”, which might have been made from material grown in the sea. (The reading כלי חרס makes no sense, since clay vessels are always understood if “vessel” is used without qualifier in biblical texts and do not need to be defined through additions. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Zevachim 22a" href="/Zevachim.22a">Babli, <i>Zebaḥim</i> 22a</a>, anything grown in water is considered water.) “All kinds of vessels” includes vessels made from marine material.</i>.

This follows the House of Shammai who do not learn money’s worth from “vessels”. But following the House of Hillel who learn money’s worth from “vessels”, since “vessels” are two, also “money” is two.

But the House of Hillel should not marry women from the House of Shammai since they do not concede to them. Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Yannai: They all followed the same practice. If they followed the same practice, in this case we stated: “The House of Shammai sent and diminished it, since the House of Shammai say unless most of it is missing?” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the House of Shammai acted before the question came before the House of Hillel. After a question came before the House of Hillel, the House of Shammai were not touching it. Rebbi Abba Mari said, that is correct. Did we not state: “They declared impure all purities from before”, but not in the future. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rav and Samuel disagreed.

Talmudic theory identifies the biblical <i>šeqel</i> with the Roman tetradrachma, which is slightly more than the standard <i>šeqel</i> documented from First Kingdom times, 11.4 g. Since in the vernacular the <i>zūz</i>, the Babylonian half-<i>šeqel</i>, was identified with the Roman <i>denarius</i>, the “sheqel” was identified as two denar.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A Hebrew slave is acquired by money,” etc. It is written: “If your Hebrew brother or sister be sold to you,” he bracketed the male Hebrew with the female<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 15:12" href="/Deuteronomy.15.12"><i>Deut</i>. 15:12</a>. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 14b" href="/Kiddushin.14b">Babli, 14b</a>, points out that the verse only covers persons sold by others, the girl by her father and the man by the court, not the person who sells himself. <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 118 disputes the entire argument and holds that the female had to be mentioned separately from the male since the rules of her acquisition and liberation are distinct from those of the male. (E. g., the female cannot sell herself; the adult female cannot be a Hebrew slave.)</i>. Since the female Hebrew can be acquired by money or contract, also the male Hebrew can be acquired by money or contract. One understands money since it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:11" href="/Exodus.21.11"><i>Ex</i>. 21:11</a>. Since after six years, or after she reached adulthood, she leaves without payment, it follows that her work was worth money; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:19" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.19">Note 18</a>.</i>: “She leaves gratis, without money [due].” From where by contract? The female Hebrew is inferred from the free woman<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:10" href="/Exodus.21.10"><i>Ex</i>. 21:10</a> equates the marriage of the Hebrew slave girl to her master to the latter’s marriage with another, free, woman.

Epstein-Melamed, p. 167).</i>, and the male Hebrew from the female. This is a combination of inferences. That follows Rebbi Aqiba who accepts combination of inferences<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Except for texts based on <i>Lev</i>. For the intricacies of his position, cf. H. Guggenheimer, <i>Über ein bemerkenswertes logisches System aus der Antike</i>, Methodos 1951, pp. 150–164; <i>Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition</i>, in: Confrontations with Judaism, ed. Ph. Longworth, London 1966, pp. 171–196.<br>The problem before the rabbis of the second and third generations of Tannaïm was to derive a consistent legal system which intellectually could compete with the Roman law from the scattered remarks offered in the Biblical text. R. Ismael allows no more than one intermediate step between biblical text and legal statement.</i>. Following Rebbi Ismael who rejects combination of inferences? It was found that Rebbi Ismael stated: In the case of the word חֻפְשָׁה, “free” is inferred from חֻפְשָׁה<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">The expression חפשי is used in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:2" href="/Exodus.21.2"><i>Ex</i>. 21:2</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:5" href="/Exodus.21.5">5</a> in reference to the male Hebrew slave. In R. Ismael’s opinion, the <i>ḥâruphah</i> slave girl is a former Gentile who needs manumission (Notes 147,148) and חֻפְשָׁה mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:20" href="/Leviticus.19.20"><i>Lev</i>. 19:20</a> is her bill of manumission. Since the Gentile slave girl can be manumitted by a document, it is concluded that the Hebrew slave can be acquired by a document. As noted later, this is a <i>non sequitur</i>.</i>. Everywhere Rebbi Ismael rejects combination of inferences and here, he accepts combination of inferences? Rebbi Ismael stated it in the name of the Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows the sentence structure of A.</i>. From where is it derived for Rebbi Ismael? “Sending away, sending away.” Since “sending away” mentioned there means by a contract, also “sending away” here means by a contract<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Divorce, which requires a written document, is called “sending away” (of the wife) in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>. Therefore, the “sending away” of the Hebrew slave (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 15:12" href="/Deuteronomy.15.12"><i>Deut</i>. 15:12</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 15:13" href="/Deuteronomy.15.13">13</a>) also refers to a written document. As noted immediately, this only would prove that the master can terminate the indenture by a written document, not that he could acquire the Hebrew’s services by a document.</i>. But it does not compare. There it is to gain autonomy, here it is to be acquired by others! Rebbi Mattaniah<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">In A: “Rebbi said, a <i>baraita</i>.” This reading is preferable since a fifth-generation Amora is unlikely to appear in a Tannaïtic discussion.</i> said, “sale, sale”<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:42" href="/Leviticus.25.42"><i>Lev</i>. 25:42</a> it is stated that a Hebrew “shall not be sold as in the sale of a [Gentile] slave.” In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 15:12" href="/Deuteronomy.15.12"><i>Deut</i>. 15:12</a> it says, “If your Hebrew brother or sister be sold to you.” It is an accepted principle (<i>Sifry Deut</i>. 72, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 8:4:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.8.4.2-4">Yerushalmi <i>Baba batra</i> 8:5</a> (16b), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Temurah 5a" href="/Temurah.5a">Babli <i>Temurah</i>5a</a>) that if the verse notes that “something shall not be done,” if it is done it is sinful but legally valid since an invalid action does not have to be forbidden. Since the Gentile slave can be bought by contract (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.3.1">Mishnah 3</a>), the Hebrew slave also can be bought by contract. The question remains whether he can be bought by contract without the buyer sinning.</i>. Since “sale” mentioned there means by a contract, “sale” here also means by a contract. But since there<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Since the laws regarding Gentile slaves in general follow the rules of real estate, undisturbed possession for three years accompanied by a claim of rightful acquisition legally establishes ownership. Nobody claims that the same holds for Hebrew slaves.</i> it is possible by possession, then here it should be possible by possession. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">A: R. Ḥiyya bar Abba (an Amora of the third generation). The reading of L is the only one acceptable, referring to R. Ḥiyya bar Ada I, of the generation of transition between Tannaïm and Amoraïm.</i> said, the male Hebrew is like the female Hebrew<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">This essentially is the argument given at the start of this paragraph, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.2.2">Note 159</a>.

“By money”. “The money of his sale price shall be;”<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:50" href="/Leviticus.25.50"><i>Lev</i>. 25:50</a>, speaking of the redemption of a Hebrew slave from his Gentile master by his family.</i> he can be redeemed by money, not by produce nor by vessels<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 8a" href="/Kiddushin.8a">Babli 8a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar, Chapter 8 4" href="/Sifra,_Behar,_Chapter_8.4"><i>Sifra Behar Pereq</i> 8(4</a>).</i>. Everywhere you treat money’s worth like money, but here you do not treat money’s worth like money. Rebbi Abba Mari said, there is a difference, because the verse repeated “money, of money”<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">The first כסף is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:50" href="/Leviticus.25.50"><i>Lev</i>. 25:50</a>, the second (read מכסף for בכסף) <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:52" href="/Leviticus.25.52"><i>Lev</i>. 25:52</a>, about the same subject. The repetition shows that the redemption can be forced only by payment in cash.</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Text of A: א״ר חייא בר אדא, preferred over L: “Even R. Ḥiyya bar Ada will agree.”</i>, but if he wants to reduce, he can leave for the reduced amount even for produce, even for vessels<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">The cash requirement applies only to redemption by his family. If the slave himself buys his freedom, he can offer valuables instead of money.</i>. Rebbi Yudan, Rebbi Mattaniah’s father, said that this is only if he did not give them their money’s worth<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">The cash requirement applies only to redemption by his family. If the slave himself buys his freedom, he can offer valuables instead of money.</i>. But if he gave them their money’s worth, it is like money.
“By a document.” Rebbi Abbahu said, by a money document<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">A written contract which promises the slave a fixed sum of money, presumably at the end of his period of service.</i>; therefore not by a gift document<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">The slave agrees to serve without remuneration.</i>, since maybe he would renege. But then, could he not renege even with a money document? He said to him<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">R. Abbahu to the person raising the question.</i>, maybe there comes a year of famine and his master reneges<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">It is not a problem of the prospective slave’s reneging, but his master’s. If in a year of famine the cost of the slave’s upkeep exceeds the value of his work, the master might be tempted to get rid of the slave. But if there is an IOU in the slave’s hand, he can be sure to be kept for the full period. Therefore, with a money document the slave has the intent from the start to be acquired by the master.</i>.
The order of sale<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">The required text in a contractual sale or marriage of an underage girl by her father. This is the only relevant case possible in law after the disestablishment of the Jubilee.</i> is the following: I X sold my daughter to Y. The order of preliminary marriage is the following: I X gave my daughter to Y in preliminary marriage. Rebbi Ḥaggai asked before Rebbi Yose: If he switched and said, I Y acquired X’s daughter, I Y took X’s daughter in preliminary marriage? He said to him, what is the difference<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">The marriage of the underage girl is purely a matter of contract between two adults; the girl is not involved and it does not matter which party writes the contract. This is in contrast to the marriage of an adult woman where a text “I, X, am taking you, Y, as preliminarily wedded wife” is valid, but “I, Y, am agreeing to be your, X’s, preliminarily wedded wife” is invalid.</i>? But if he changed the language of sale to that of preliminary marriage or vice-versa, he did not do anything.
It is written: “Six years he shall work<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:2" href="/Exodus.21.2"><i>Ex</i>. 21:2</a>.</i>.” How much does he work? I could think that he leaves at the end of six [years]. The verse says, “and in the seventh he shall leave<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:2" href="/Exodus.21.2"><i>Ex</i>. 21:2</a>.</i>.” I could think that he leave at the end of seven [years]<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Šim‘on b</i>.<i>Jochai</i>(ed. Epstein-Melamed) p. 160 the argument is made that the slave should leave only at the end of the year since debts are remitted only at the end of the Sabbatical. A similar argument is presupposed here.</i>. The verse says, “six years he shall work.” How is that? He works the entire six and leaves at the start of the seventh. “And in the seventh he shall leave.” The seventh from the sale and not the Seventh of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbatical year. <i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Ismael</i> (ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 249).</i>. Do you say, the seventh from the sale and not the Seventh of the world? Since it says, “six years he shall work,” this spells out six years. How can I confirm “and in the seventh he shall leave?” The seventh from the sale and not the Seventh of the world. Say it is the opposite. Rebbi Ze‘ira said in the name of Rav Huna: It is written: “and in the seventh,” “and in the seventh<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that the correct interpretation is the one given by <i>Qorban Ha‘edah</i>: One has to read the word וּבַשְּׁבִעִית as if it were written twice with two different meanings. “Six years he shall work, including the Sabbatical; but in the seventh he shall leave.”</i>”. Rebbi Ḥuna said, if you say, in the Seventh of the world, what would the Jubilee free<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Since the 49th year of a cycle is a Sabbatical, if the slaves left then, nobody would be freed in the 50th, the Jubilee.</i>? Rebbi Joḥanan bar Marius said, this follows him who said that the Jubilee does not become part of a Sabbatical period<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbatical period following the first Jubilee starts only in year 51; there is a Jubilee in every year which is a multiple of 50 in the Jubilee calendar; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 61a" href="/Nedarim.61a">Babli <i>Nedarim</i> 61a</a>. This is the calendar also underlying the Saducee Jubilee.</i>. But following him who said that the Jubilee becomes part of a Sabbatical period, sometimes it falls in the middle of a Sabbatical period<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Since year 49 was a Sabbatical, the next Sabbatical is in year 55, and the next Jubilee in year 100 is in year 2 of the Sabbatical cycle. The Jubilee in year <i>n</i>∙50 falls on year <i>n</i> (mod 7) of a Sabbatical cycle, it will eventually fall on any of the years of the cycle.</i>. The rabbis of Caesarea say, even following him who said that the Jubilee becomes part of a Sabbatical period, we could deduce from here that the Sabbatical year frees the slaves and the Jubilee the pierced ones<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding argument cannot be used to prove that the “seventh’ mentioned in the verse is not the Sabbatical; the argument at the start of the paragraph is the only valid one. (The emendation of this sentence by the classical commentaries has to be rejected since the text is confirmed by A.)</i>.
From where even if he fell ill<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">He could not work the entire six years. Nevertheless, he leaves on time. The same argument in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 17a" href="/Kiddushin.17a">Babli, 17a</a>. In <i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Šim‘on b</i>.<i>Jochai</i>, p. 161, the word “gratis” is interpreted to mean that the master has no regress on the slave for his medical costs.</i>? The verse says<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:2" href="/Exodus.21.2"><i>Ex</i>. 21:2</a>.</i>, “in the seventh year he shall leave into freedom gratis.” I could think, even if he fled; the verse says<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:2" href="/Exodus.21.2"><i>Ex</i>. 21:2</a>.</i>, “six years he shall work.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 16b" href="/Kiddushin.16b">Babli 16b</a>; <i>Massekhet ‘Avadim</i> 1.</i>” What did you see to include this and to exclude that? After the verse included, it excluded. I am including the one who remains in his power and am exluding the one who is not in his power. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said that Rav Hoshaia asked: I understand that if he fell ill and fled afterwards, he has to make up [the time lost]. If he fled and then fell ill? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, let us hear from the following: “If a woman rebels against her husband, one writes him a bill of rebellion on her <i>ketubah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">A rewording of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Ketubot 5:9" href="/Mishnah_Ketubot.5.9">Mishnah <i>Ketubot</i> 5:9, Notes 199–100</a>. The wife refuses marital relations with her husband; the court deducts from her future claim of <i>ketubah</i>.</i> And Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: One writes a bill of rebellion on the <i>ketubah</i> of a menstruating woman or a sick one, a preliminarily married one and one waiting for her levir<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:8:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.8.2-5"><i>Ketubot</i> 5:10</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 63b" href="/Ketubot.63b">Babli <i>Ketubot</i> 63b</a>.</i>. Where do we hold? If she rebelled against him while she was menstruating, the Torah instructed her to rebel<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Since sexual relations with menstruating women are forbidden.</i>. But we must hold that she rebelled when she was not menstruating and then started menstruating. Here she is unable to rebel, nevertheless you say, one writes<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Once she refused marital relations, one fines her by reducing the sum due from her <i>ketubah</i> the entire time she had no relations, irrespective of the cause. By analogy, the runaway slave has to make up the time lost, including the time he was ill and could not have worked while in his master’s house.</i>. Here also, if he rebelled and then fell ill he has to make up. For he can say to him, if you had stayed with me, you would not have become sick. Rebbi Ḥinena said, that argument even works in the first case. If he fell ill and fled afterwards<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">If he was ill when he fled, he has to make up even the times of his sickness.</i>, he has to make up, since he can say to him, if you had stayed with me, you would have recuperated sooner.
“He regains his autonomy by years.” Some <i>Tannaїm</i> state: He may be sold for less than six [years], but he cannot be sold for more than six. But some <i>Tannaïm</i> state: He may not be sold for less than six [years] or more than to [year] seven. Rebbi Jeremiah said, the reason of that Tanna: Sometimes he is sold two or three years before the Jubilee; then the Jubilee arrives and frees him automatically<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Even though formally he was sold for six years. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 15a" href="/Kiddushin.15a">Babli 15a</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar, Chapter 7 4" href="/Sifra,_Behar,_Chapter_7.4"><i>Sifra Behar Pereq</i> 7(4</a>) in the name of the Tanna R.

He should be able to allot her to his brother by an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>! If he may allot her to his son who may not take his place for <i>ḥalîṣah</i> and levirate, should it not be logical that he may allot her to his brother who may take his place for <i>ḥalîṣah</i> and levirate? No. If you would accept the son since he will take [the father’s] place in a field of inheritance, what can you say about his brother who will not take his place in a field of inheritance? Would it be reasonable that he may allot her to him? The verse says, “if he allots her to his son.” He allots her to his son but may not allot her to his brother.
“If he allots her to his son;” but he may not allot her to his grandson. Samuel bar Abba asked before Rebbi Ze‘ira: In matters of inheritance you recognize the grandson like a son but here you do not recognize the grandson like a son? Rebbi Ze‘ira said, if anybody explains this matter, I shall pour him spiced wine. Rebbi Naḥum answered: In matters of inheritance where the brother can take the place of a son and all others can take the place of the son, the grandson takes the place of a son. But here, where neither the brother nor any other relative can take the place of a son, the grandson cannot take the place of a son. The rabbis of Caesarea answered: In matters of impurity you consider a brother like a son and all [near] relatives like a son but not a grandson like a son. They said, there went the spiced wine.
“If he allots her to his son;” with [the girl’s] agreement. Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is no agreement here. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said so, the statement follows Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah. Rebbi Samuel bar Eudaimon said, even if you say the statement follows Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah, is he not a minor? “If he allots her to his son;” with [the latter’s] agreement. Rebbi Joḥanan said, he allots her to his minor or adult son, with or without the latter’s agreement. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, he allots her only to his adult son with the latter’s agreement.
“A male nine years and one day old makes a widow for the High Priest or a divorcee or one who performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i> for a common priest.” In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish who must explain this for a marriage, she should also be free from levirate or <i>ḥalîṣah</i>, as we have stated: “If he married a woman, that one is free from levirate or <i>ḥalîṣah</i>.” Rebbi Abin said, following Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish it comes following Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah, as it was stated so: If a male nine years and one day old up to twelve years and one day old grew two pubic hairs, they are warts. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah said, they are indicators [of puberty]. Rebbi Jacob ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: Only if they were still there at the time of indicators.
Rebbi Yose asked: When they remained until the time of indicators, does he retroactively become a man or from that time onward? For Rebbi Abun it is obvious that he becomes a man retroactively, so certainly also for the future, for he explains the position of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Here ends fragment A.</i> by Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah. Why does Rebbi Yose not explain the position of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish by Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah since he asked, when they remained until the time of indicators, does he retroactively become a man or from that time onward? Rebbi Mana said, because he had difficulty. Rebbi Yose asked before me: When they remained until the time of indicators, does he retroactively become a man or from that time onward? One understands the case of a widow. But a divorcee? Explain it if he copulated with her after he became an adult and divorced her. <i>Ḥalîṣah</i>? Explain it if he copulated with her, died, and the [adult] brothers performed <i>ḥalîṣah</i>; she had <i>ḥalîṣah</i> because of him. In that case, even if he was younger than nine [years]! Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, that is correct. But because in all cases one stated “nine”, one stated this with them.
Rebbi Jehudah ben Pazi in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Rebbi Yose ben Jehudah learned from Aḥaz, as it was stated: Aḥaz produced a child at age nine, Haran at age six, and Caleb at age ten following him who identifies Caleb ben Ḥeṣron with Caleb ben Yephuneh.

One must assume that the Yerushalmi holds that in addition to the cases mentioned in the Mishnah, definitive marriage frees the girl from the ownership of her master (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:2:27" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.2.27">Note 279</a>). In that case, even though the act of preliminary marriage created the impossible situation described in the text, the definitive marriage solved the problem by eliminating the master’s ownership and with it his right of allotment. The only recourse the master has is to sue the father for the value of services lost. (Explanation of S. Z. Brauda, <i>loc</i>.<i>cit</i>. Note 236).</i>.

The idea seems to be that a woman, performing a wife’s duty in a man’s house, by this act should become his wife. The comparison is to a slave woman who belonged to a proselyte who failed to start a Jewish family and dies without heirs. Any Jew who gets hold of her and lets her perform a servile job for himself has acquired her in law.<br>A second meaning of חֲזָקָה is “permanence of the <i>status quo ante</i>,” cf. <i>Giṭṭin</i> 3:3, Notes 81,89; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 9:2:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.9.2.8"><i>Nazir</i> 9:2, Note 90</a>.

If real estate is sold, the seller accepts responsibility to indemnify the buyer if the latter should lose the real estate because of foreclosure of a pre-existing lien, whether or not this is spelled out in the sale contract. For a gift of real estate, the donor accepts responsibility only if this is so stated in the deed. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 128a" href="/Bava_Batra.128a">Babli, <i>Baba batra</i> 128a</a>, this is a matter in dispute; the ultimate authority Rav Naḥman agrees with the ruling of the Yerushalmi.</i>; one does not collect from slaves as from real estate<sup class="footnote-marker">350</sup><i class="footnote">While slaves can be given in chattel mortgage, they are not subject to blanket liens which cover all the debtor’s real estate.

Not of real estate, as it was stated: Real estate and slaves<sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote">Like Ptolemaic and Roman laws, rabbinic civil law is based on the distinction between ownership and possession.

Taking possession by use (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.9">Note 30</a>) of a piece of real estate establishes possession of all real estate and movables included in one sale contract. Similarly, movables are taken into possession by moving one piece; this simultaneously gives possession of all items included in the sale. Since taking possession of slaves is by individual action only, in this respect they follow neither the rules of real estate nor those of movables. Taking possession of slaves does not induce possession of either real estate or movables covered by the same sales contract; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 12a" href="/Bava_Kamma.12a">Babli <i>Baba qama</i> 12a</a>.</i>; he took possession of the real estate.

By <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 4:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.4.5.1">Mishnah <i>Giṭṭin</i> 4:5</a>, the master is then forced to emancipate the slave completely and the slave has to write an IOU for the part of him that was not manumitted. If the slave is not worth his upkeep, the slave has no interest in being freed but his master is interested in getting rid of him and even having the chance of collecting some money from the IOU. (In Roman law, partial emancipation is accepted by Ulpian I 18 but rejected by most other earlier authorities. The Mishnaic law also appears in Egyptian sources and is incorporated in Justinian’s Code; cf. R. Taubenschlag, <i>The Law of Greco-Roman Egypt in the Light of the Papyri</i>, New York 1944, p. 75.)</i>. But do the rabbis not hold that a person can free half of his slave?

Do the rabbis not hold that he may give to him through a third party? The rabbis hold that one who can acquire by himself can acquire through a third party; one who cannot acquire by himself cannot acquire through a third party.

Explain it following Rebbi Meïr since Rebbi Meïr makes the hand of the slave the hand of his master. But did we not state “his wife”?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Large animals by handing over<sup class="footnote-marker">409</sup><i class="footnote">Actual possession of cattle or horses is obtained by the buyer grasping either the animal’s hair or any saddle, bridle, or belt tied to it. Talmudic civil law, in parallel to Ptolemaic law in Egypt, is based on the distinction between ownership and possession. Ownership can be acquired by a monetary transaction but possession, including transfer of responsibility, requires a separate act. While acquisition, as a private act between consenting adults, is essentially unregulated, taking possession must follow specific rules.</i> and small<sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">Sheep and goats.</i> by lifting, the words of Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Eleazar. But the Sages say, small animals are taken possession of by drawing near<sup class="footnote-marker">411</sup><i class="footnote">By making the animal walk according to the buyer’s will, but also by lifting the animal.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Large animals are taken possession of by handing over,” etc. Rebbi Huna said, the halter gives possession only for property of the proselyte<sup class="footnote-marker">412</sup><i class="footnote">Who failed to start a Jewish family and whose property becomes ownerless at his death; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.9">Note 30</a>. In the Babli, <i>Baba meṣia</i>‘ 8b, <i>Rav</i> Huna states: that “a halter from another person takes possession except in case of a find and property of a proselyte.” On basis of this quote, all commentators and editors delete אֶלָּא “only” in the present text. The deletion is unjustified; the texts in Yerushalmi and Babli are not comparable.<br>In the Babli, the formulation makes it clear that the buyer either receives the animal’s halter from the seller or is instructed to take it. Since both a lost article and the estate of an intestate heirless person are ownerless, there is nobody who could hand over the halter or authorize its use. Therefore, only actual moving of the animal can be an act of simultaneous acquisition and taking in possession. While the text of the Babli is beyond doubt, confirmed by Rashi’s translation of מוסירה by <i>chevêtre</i>, it is quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Bava Batra 75b:13:1" href="/Tosafot_on_Bava_Batra.75b.13.1">Tosaphot <i>Baba batra</i> 75b, <i>s. v.</i> אחזה</a>, as מְסִירָה מֵחֲבֵירוֹ, “handing over by another person”, which is correct in meaning if not in text.

Rebbi Yose said, how can this person make a deal with another’s cow? But the cow’s [price] has to be restituted to the owner.” Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Yannai: Only if he gave permission to lend to others. Also Rebbi Ḥiyya stated thus: “The borrower cannot lend, nor the lessee lease, nor the borrower lease, nor the lessee lend, nor the trustee give to another unless they received permission from the owners. And all who changed the titles without the owners’ knowledge are liable. But the borrower is liable even if he did not change.” But it is because we stated: “An unpaid watchman can stipulate to be exempt from an oath and the borrower may stipulate that he not have to pay.” This means that even if he stipulated to be exempt he is obligated.

Let us hear<sup class="footnote-marker">452</sup><i class="footnote">Translation of נשמעינה in the <i>Ketubot</i> text, instead of נשבע “been made to swear” which does not fit here.</i> from the following: “If he wrote to her: ‘I have no vow or oath against you,’ he cannot make her swear, but he can ask an oath from the heirs or her business associates.” This implies that if he wanted to make the borrower swear, he can force him to swear. The second case teaches about the first, that if he wants to force the wife to swear, he can make her swear. Rebbi Ḥanina said, it is not necessary to derive the first case from the second, and what does one learn for the second case from the first? Following what Rebbi Hila said in the name of Rebbi Yannai: Only if he gave permission to lend to others. And here, only if he gave permission to let her sons be stewards. Rebbi Yose said, he has to pay the lease the entire time it is leased to him. Rebbi Ze‘ira asked Rebbi Abinna: If the owners borrowed it and it died? He said to him, we hold that they ate it. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, if they ate it, they ate their own property. Rebbi Ze‘ira asked before Rebbi Yasa: How does one act? He said to him, there are two against four; one does not act following the argument. He said to him, they are two against two! Rebbi Eleazar is the Elder Rebbi Ḥiyya’s student; Rebbi Joḥanan is Rebbi Yannai’s student.

He answered, you understand this since you own many spherules. He said to him, they become part of the common estate to be distributed.
Rav Jehudah sent and asked Rebbi Eleazar: May one foreclose slaves with real estate?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Guaranteed properties<sup class="footnote-marker">470</sup><i class="footnote">Real estate which normally is sold with a title guarantee.</i> can be acquired by money, or contract, or possession<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">A slave who becomes ownerless by the death of his intestate owner who dies without heirs can be acquired by anybody who makes him perform a slave’s duties for himself.

Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.4.3"><i>Ketubot</i> 5:5, Note 100</a>.</i>.

But if the dispute was about both movables and real estate, since one party has to swear about the movables, it can also be made to include a statement about the real estate.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Guaranteed properties,” etc. In earlier times, transfer of possession was effected by taking off a shoe. That is what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">475</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Ruth 4:7" href="/Ruth.4.7"><i>Ruth</i> 4:7</a>.</i>: “This was earlier in Israel about redemption and exchange, a person would take off his shoe.” Who took it off?

In the Babli, the transaction is not considered as archaic but as current practice, meaning that claims can be validly transferred following Rav when the transferrer moves some of the acquirer’s movable property.</i>, one said the acquirer, and one said the transferer. It turns out that this disagreement parallels the following disagreement which was stated: Boaz was giving to the redeemer; Rebbi Jehudah said that the redeemer gave to Boaz.
Then they changed it to clipping. <sup class="footnote-marker">478</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:10:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.10.8"><i>Ketubot</i>2:11</a> (<b>כ</b>), Notes 201–203.</i> What is clipping? If a man sold his inherited field, his relatives brought amphoras, filled them with roasted kernels and nuts and broke them before children. The children were collecting them and saying, X was clipped from his inheritance. When he brought it back, they were doing the same and saying, X returned to his inheritance. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, also if a man married an unsuitable woman, his relatives brought amphoras, filled them with roasted kernels and nuts and broke them before children. The children were collecting them and saying, X was clipped from his family. When he divorced her, they were doing the same and saying, X returned to his family.
Then they changed it to acquisition by money, by document, or by possession. By money: <sup class="footnote-marker">479</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following two paragraphs are from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.3">Halakhah 3 (ק), Notes 335–346</a>.</i>“Fields will be bought by money,” that is money. “Writing on a scroll and signing”, these are the witnesses on the contract. “And testifying of witnesses,” these are the witnesses to possession. Or maybe these are only the witnesses to the contract? These are already written: “Writing on a scroll and signing.”
Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Mana bar Tanḥum, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Real estate cannot be bought for less than a <i>peruṭah</i>. What is the reason? “Fields will be bought by money.” This disagrees with what Rebbi Ḥanina said: All <i>šeqalim</i> mentioned in the Torah are tetradrachmas, in the Prophets pounds, and in the Hagiographs <i>centenarii</i>, except for the <i>šeqalim</i> paid to Ephron. What is the reason? “For full money he shall give it to me.” There is no comparison since here it is written “money” but there “<i>šeqalim</i>”. They objected, is there not the rapist, for whom “money” is written and you say “<i>šeqalim</i>”.
This does not follow Rebbi Eliezer, for Rebbi Eliezer said that walking acquires. If one walked across a field in length and breadth, he acquired up to the place he walked, the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say that he did not acquire up to the moment he acted in possession. Everybody agrees that if somebody sells a path to another, when the latter went, he acquired. What is the reason? “Arise, walk in the Land, etc.”
By document.

“By money.” Rebbi Abba was of the opinion, by money if there was no intention to write a deed. But if money was given with the intention to write a deed for him, possession was transferred only when the deed was written<sup class="footnote-marker">486</sup><i class="footnote">Since proving title is difficult without a written deed, the buyer has no intention of accepting title without the deed.

For in general a person might give property rights only in writing, and here even orally. In general, a person might give only if real estate and movables are at the same place; here, however, the real estate was at one place and the movables elsewhere. He said to him: But is there a difference for Rebbi Eliezer? Is not the sick person for Rebbi Eliezer like the sick person for the rabbis? He said to him: The sick person for Rebbi Eliezer is like the healthy person for the rabbis.
There, we have stated: “Any real estate is subject to <i>peah</i> and first fruits, the words of Rebbi Aqiba.” What is the use of “any” real estate? Rebbi Mattaniah said, explain it if it had space for one stalk but a pearl was hidden in it.

He went to the upper floor to bring it and found his father sleeping. Some say that the key to the chest was in his father’s fingers; some say his father’s foot was resting on the chest. He descended to them and told them: I could not bring it to you. They thought, maybe he wants more money, and raised the price to two hundred, then to a thousand. When his father woke up from his sleep, he went up and brought it to them. They wanted to give him according to the amount last mentioned, but he refused. He said: Do I sell my father’s honor for money? I will not have any advantage from honoring my father. What reward did the Holy One, praise to Him, give him? Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: The following night, his cow gave birth to a red heifer and Israel gave him its weight in gold and took it. Rebbi Sabbatai said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Job 37:23" href="/Job.37.23"><i>Job</i> 37:23</a>), it is written: “Justice and much charity He will not suppress.” The Holy One, praise to Him, will not wait to give the reward for good deeds to the Gentiles.
Rebbi Tarphon’s mother went to promenade in her backyard on the Sabbath when her slipper broke. Rebbi Tarphon went and put his two hands under her feet and she walked on them until she got to her couch. Once the Sages came to visit him. She told them: Pray for my son Tarphon because he honors me too much. They asked her, what did he do for you? She told them what had happened. They said to her, even if he did this a million times, he did not yet reach even half of the honor that the Torah requires.
Rebbi Ismael’s mother came, spoke, and complained to our teachers about him. She said to them: Scold my son Ismael because he does not honor me! At that, the faces of our teachers became saffron colored. They said, is it possible that Rebbi Ismael does not honor his parents? They said to her, what did he do to you? She said, when he comes from the house of assembly, I want to wash his feet and drink from it, and he refuses. They said, since it is her wish it is her honor.
Rebbi Mana said: The millers are correct when they say that each and every person has in his chest that which is appropriate for him. Rebbi Tarphon’s mother said so and they answered her appropriately, Rebbi Ismael’s mother said so and they answered her appropriately. Rebbi Zeïra was sorry and said, if only I had father or mother that I could honor them and inherit paradise. When he heard these two instructions, he said: Praise to the All-Merciful that I have neither father nor mother. I could not have done as Rebbi Tarphon did and I could not accept what Rebbi Ismael accepted. Rebbi Abun said, I am free from honoring father and mother. They said, his father died when his mother was pregnant and she died in giving birth.
Some person might serve his father fattened meat and inherit hell. Some person might bind his father to the grindstone and inherit paradise. How does one serve his father fattened meat and inherit hell? A person used to serve his father fattened chickens. One day, his father said to him: My son, from where do you get the money for these? He said to him: Old man, old man, eat and shut up just as dogs eat and are silent. It turns out that he serves his father fattened meat and inherits hell. How does one bind his father to the grindstone and inherits paradise? A person was a miller at a grindstone; there came a requisition for millers. He said: Father, go and grind in my stead. If it should come to pass that anyone be degraded, it is better that it should happen to me rather than to you. If it should come to pass that anyone be beaten, it is better that it should happen to me rather than to you. It turns out that he binds his father to the grindstone and inherits paradise.

Rebbi Abba bar Cahana said, the verse equals the easiest commandment with the most difficult one. The easiest commandment is sending away [the mother] from the nest. The most difficult one is honoring father and mother. For both of them it is written: “Your days will be lengthened.” Rebbi Abun said, if for anything that is repayment of debt it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 5:16" href="/Deuteronomy.5.16"><i>Deut</i>. 5:16</a>): “That you shall be well and that your days shall be lengthened,” so much more something that involves monetary loss and personal danger.

<sup class="footnote-marker">612</sup><i class="footnote">The origin of this paragraph is <i>Pesaḥim</i> 8:1 (35d 1. 35 ff.), noted <b>ם</b>.</i> Rebbi Eleazar said: The Passover sacrifice of women is voluntary<sup class="footnote-marker">613</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence contradicts everything a student of the Babli would expect. Most commentators either emend the passage or explain it away. But since there are three witnesses to the text, emendation is not an acceptable option. In the Babli, 91b, R. Eleazar declares a woman to be obligated for Passover like men. However, this statement is obtained by an editorial re-interpretation of R. Eleazar’s statement.<br>In the Babli and its related texts, it is taken for granted that women present in Jerusalem on Passover eve are obligated to take part in the Passover meal, based on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:4" href="/Exodus.12.4"><i>Ex</i>. 12:4</a> which designates the participants as “persons”, not “men” (<i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Ismael</i>,<i>Piṣha</i>3, <i>Mekhilta dR</i>.<i>Šim</i>‘<i>on b</i>.<i>Jochai</i> p. 10; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 8:1:1-10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.8.1.1-10">Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i> 8:1</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 8:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.8.7.1">7</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 8:10" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).8.10">Tosephta <i>Pesaḥim</i> 8:10</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 91" href="/Pesachim.91">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 91a/b</a>.) But it is to be noted that missing the sacrificial meal is a deadly sin only for men (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 9:13" href="/Numbers.9.13"><i>Num</i>. 9:13</a>); only men are required (and permitted) to make up the missed sacrifice on the 14th of Iyar (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 9:13" href="/Numbers.9.13"><i>Num</i>. 9:13</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 8:10" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).8.10">Tosephta <i>Piṣha</i> 8:10</a>).<br>The statement means that an unaffiliated female, living neither in her father’s nor a husband’s house, is not obligated to seek a group with which to celebrate Passover. It would be considered most inappropriate if a single woman would join a group of men unrelated to her. But since she is included in the circle of celebrants of Passover by biblical law, if she alone or a group of similarly situated women want to organize their own Passover sacrifice and meal, they are authorized to do so.</i> but one pushes the Sabbath away for it<sup class="footnote-marker">614</sup><i class="footnote">If the 14th of Nisan is a Sabbath, the public Passover sacrifice has precedence over the Sabbath (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 6:1:1-18" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.6.1.1-18">Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i> 6:1</a>).

Still we say obligations depending on the Land only apply in the Land, but we might think that obligations not depending on the Land also should only apply in the Land. The verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 11:16-18" href="/Deuteronomy.11.16-18"><i>Deut</i>. 11:16–18</a>) “Be careful, lest your heart be seduced … and the Eternal’s rage be inflamed against you, etc. Put these words on your hearts,”.

On your fathers there was no yoke of government, but you [are obligated] even though there is on you the yoke of government.

Since they accepted upon themselves matters they were not obligated for, even matters they were obligated for the Omnipresent credited to them as if they were accepted voluntarily.
How does Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina explain “In view of all this, we execute a contract and sign”? Since they accepted [the obligations] with good grace, the verse credits it to them as if they had accepted it voluntarily. How does Rebbi Eleazar explain “more than your forefathers?” He explains it for the future since Rebbi Ḥelbo, Simeon bar Abba said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Your forefathers inherited the land of seven peoples, but you will in the future inherit the land of ten peoples. The three others are (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 15:19" href="/Genesis.15.19"><i>Gen</i>. 15:19</a>) “the Qenites, the Qenizites and the Qadmonites.” Rebbi Jehudah said, [these are] Arabia, Salmaia and Nabataea. Rebbi Simeon says, Asia, Spain, and Damascus. Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, Asia, Cartagena, and Thrace. Rebbi says, Edom, Moab, and the best of Ammon. “More than your forefathers”: Your forefathers, even though they were redeemed, were later subjugated again.

(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 30:6" href="/Jeremiah.30.6"><i>Jer</i>. 30:6</a>) “Inquire and see whether a male gives birth.” Just as a male cannot give birth so you, after you are redeemed, will not be subjugated again.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, everybody agrees about preliminary marriage that her father contracts but not she herself. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish agrees about a definitive marriage that she is not empowered to marry herself off and to let her father lose her earnings. In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan she has no legal standing relative to her father and cannot appoint an agent. In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish she does have legal standing relative to her father and can appoint an agent. A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “A man contracts a preliminary marriage either in person or through his agent and a woman contracts a preliminary marriage either in person or through her agent.” He explains it about an adult woman. But did we not state: “If an underage girl said, accept the bill of divorce for me, it is no valid bill of divorce until it reaches her hand.” He explains it about an orphan. But did we not state: “If her father said to [an agent]: Go and receive my daughter’s bill of divorce, if [the husband] wants to retract he cannot retract.” He explains that the Mishnah deals with cases; the first part about an orphan and the second part if she has a father. A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. “A man may contract a preliminary marriage for his adolescent daughter either by himself or by his agent.” He explains that following Rebbi Jehudah, since Rebbi Jehudah said, “no two hands can acquire together.” Rebbi Yose said, a rabbi came out from the assembly and said, a case was decided following Rebbi Joḥanan. Can one rely on that? It was no question of relying on him since it was as from the sea to the frying pan.

The definition of an underage girl is a female who does not yet have two pubic hairs.

In the present case, the expression “repudiates” would seem to be inappropriate but it is justified in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 46a" href="/Kiddushin.46a">Babli (46a</a>) by reference to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:16" href="/Exodus.22.16"><i>Ex</i>. 22:16</a> which uses the verb מאן to describe the father’s veto of the marriage of his daughter to her seducer.</i> but not she herself.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody performed preliminary marriage with a woman on condition that she had no obligation of vows on her and it turns out that she had vows to fulfill, she is not preliminarily married. If he married her definitively without inquiry and she had vows to fulfill, she should leave without <i>ketubah</i>.

If he married her definitively without inquiry and she had bodily defects, she should leave without <i>ketubah</i>.” The following Halakhah is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 7:7:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.7.7.2-5"><i>Ketubot</i> 7:9, Notes 110–143</a>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody performed preliminary marriage with a woman etc. We have stated defects. Which vows? Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoṣadaq: If she vowed not to eat meat, or not to drink wine, or not to wear dyed garments. Rebbi Ze‘ira said, the fine linen garments which come from Bet She‘an have the status of dyed garments. Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah deals with the case that he said to her, “on condition that you have no obligation of vows on you.” But if he said to her, “on condition that you have no vow on you,” then even if she made a vow not to eat carob fruit it is a vow.
“If she went to an Elder and he dissolved her vow, she is preliminarily married. To a doctor and he healed her, she is not preliminarily married.” What is the difference between the Elder and the doctor? The Elder uproots the vow from its start; the doctor heals only for the future. Some Tannaïm state: Even if she went to an Elder and he dissolved her vow, she is not preliminarily married. The <i>baraita</i> follows Rebbi Eleazar, as we have stated there: “Rebbi Eleazar said, it would have been logical about a vow which has to be investigated by a Sage, because the Elder uproots the vow from its start. Why did they forbid a vow which has to be investigated by a Sage? Because of a vow which does not have to be investigated by a Sage. Some Tannaïm state: She is allowed to marry without a bill of divorce. Some Tannaïm state: She is forbidden to marry without a bill of divorce. They wanted to say that he who says, she is allowed to marry without a bill of divorce is Rebbi Eleazar, and he who says, she is forbidden to marry without a bill of divorce are the rabbis. Everything follows the rabbis. He who says, she is forbidden to marry without a bill of divorce, the rabbis. He who says, she is allowed to marry without a bill of divorce: Since she knows that if she went to an Elder, he would dissolve her vow, since she does not go therefore she can be married without a bill of divorce. What is the reason of him who says, she is forbidden to marry without a bill of divorce, that she should not go to an Elder who would dissolve her vow, then the preliminary marriage would become retroactively valid for her and it would turn out that her children became bastards. Therefore she is forbidden to marry without a bill of divorce.
“If he married her definitively without inquiry”. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, the Mishnah deals with the case that he married her preliminarily conditionally but definitively silently. But if he married her preliminarily silently and definitively silently, she can claim her <i>ketubah</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, even if he married her preliminarily silently and definitively silently, she has no <i>ketubah</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: But she needs a bill of divorce from him even if he married her preliminarily conditionally but definitively silently. Rebbi Ze‘ira asked before Rebbi Mana: In case he married her preliminarily silently and divorced her after the preliminary marriage, what does Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish say? Let us hear from the following: “If she had bodily defects, as long as she is in her father’s house, the father has to prove.” This implies that if he proved his case, she can claim her <i>ketubah</i>. What do you see to say, if he married her preliminarily silently and divorced her after the preliminary marriage! Where do we hold? Since afterwards [it is stated]: “When was this said? For hidden defects, but he has no claim about visible defects.” If he. made it conditional, could he not also claim for visible ones? But did not the colleagues say before Rebbi Yose: Should we say that the following statement disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish? “Once she entered her husband’s domain, the husband has to prove.” This implies that if the husband proved his case, she has no claim to <i>ketubah</i>. But by the statement of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, she has a claim to <i>ketubah</i>. Rebbi Cohen in the name of the rabbis of Caesarea: The Mishnah deals with the case that he definitively married her but did not sleep with her; Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish speaks about the case that he definitively married her and slept with her; I am saying that she was acceptable to him since he took her to bed.
“And all defects which disqualify a priest disqualify a woman. They added to them for women mouth odor, sweat odor, and a hairless mole.” Rebbi Ḥamai bar Uqba in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: They taught this about the skin of the face. But did we not state: “When was this said? For hidden defects, but he has no claim about visible defects.” Is this not of the visible defects? Explain it if she hid it under her headgear. It was stated: “A mole with hairs is a defect, whether it be large or small, whether it be on the body or on the face. Without a hair it is a defect on the face but not on the body. When has this been said? If it is small. But if it is large, it is a defect whether it be on the body or on the face. How big is large? Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, up to an Italic <i>as</i>.” Rebbi Eleazar bar Ḥanina said, for example such a Gordianic denar: its measure is half a ubiquitous gold piece. Rebbi Radifa, Rebbi Jonah: Rebbi Jeremiah asked: A bald woman with a row of hair going from one ear to the other? They wanted to understand it from the following: “They added to them for women mouth odor, sweat odor, and a hairless mole.” They did not mention baldness. They wanted to conclude that it is not a defect. There came Rebbi Samuel the son of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun: Rebbi Nasa said, it is a defect. It is listed only if it is ugly for both sexes. But something which is beautiful in one sex but ugly in the other, like a bald pate, even though it is a defect it was not listed. You should know that this is so because a beard is beautiful for a man and a defect for a woman, and we did not state: In addition, for a woman a beard. There are breasts which are beautiful for a woman and a defect for men, and we did not state: In addition, for a man women’s breasts.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody preliminarily marries a woman and her daughter,” etc. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, one understands from this five rules: One understands that five women can be preliminarily married simultaneously. That a woman may receive her own wedding gift and that of her companion. And one may use the spoils of robbery for a preliminary marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah stated that the figs were the property of the women being married. It also states that this happened in a Sabbatical year. Since the produce of a Sabbatical year is ownerless, the Mishnah seems to contradict itself. One will have to explain that the women collected the figs and acquired them by the act of collection. Then the man came and took them away from them. The Mishnah only implies that a woman may be preliminarily married by objects robbed from herself since by accepting marriage she forgives the robber. It does not imply that objects obtained by robbery can be used to marry an uninvolved woman.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 52a" href="/Kiddushin.52a">Babli, 52a</a>, comes to an opposite conclusion. It assumes that the figs grew in the women’s orchard and were collected as ownerless produce by the man.

And one may preliminarily marry using produce acquired by a prohibited act<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Sabbatical produce can only be used to be eaten under the rules of the Sabbatical. Using such produce for an act of acquisition is illicit. Nevertheless, the act remains valid.</i>. And preliminary marriage is impossible in incest situations.

"Rebbi Haggai in the name of Rebbi Ze‘iri: Because (the prohibition of usufruct) is not transferred to its proceeds.

However, our ms. sources (including the Constantinople print edition) do not support Ran’s reading of R. Ḥanina; one has to accept the ms. reading as it stands.<br>The statement of R. Ḥaggai is straightforward and was explained by Ran. Since objects forbidden for usufruct are worthless, the money received by the seller was not payment for the object. Since it was necessary to point out that the marriage was valid, it follows that if the money had been given in exchange for an object acquired unlawfully, the marriage would be invalid.</i>.

It seems that the text in <i>Demay</i> is the original source.</i> Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina said, a person gives his tithes for the benefit of goodwill. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:10" href="/Numbers.5.10"><i>Num</i>. 5:10</a>) “Everybody shall be the owner of his holy things.” How does Rebbi Joḥanan explain this? He may give them to whomever he likes.
A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥaninah: “A vow that no Cohanim or Levites should have any advantage from me: they should take against his will.” He explains it about a person who says, I cannot possibly give them <i>any</i> gifts. You should know that this is so, since we have stated: “<i>These</i> Cohanim and Levites should [not] have any advantage from me; let others take.” A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “One may say, here you have a tetradrachma and give this firstling to my daughter’s son, a Cohen.” He explains, if he already wanted to give it to two Cohanim and that daughter’s son was one of them; then one said, here you have a tetradrachma and give it whole to my daughter’s son, a Cohen.
They asked before Rebbi Zeïra: a Cohen to an Israel, Rebbi forbids. What does Rebbi Yose say? He did not respond. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa said, so he said to them: In the opinion of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina, why is a Cohen to an Israel forbidden, not because it looks badly? Also Rebbi Joḥanan holds that from an Israel to an Israel it is forbidden because it looks badly. In addition, because of the following, as it was stated: “Cohanim and Levites who help at the threshing floor have no right either to heave or to tithe, and if the farmer gave, it is desecrated, as it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:15" href="/Leviticus.22.15"><i>Lev</i>. 22:15</a>): ‘They should not desecrate the sanctified things of the Children of Israel,’ but they do desecrate them! In addition, they said that their heave is no heave, their tithes are no tithes, their dedications are no dedications, and about them the verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Micah 3:11" href="/Micah.3.11"><i>Micha</i>3:11</a>): ‘Their heads judge for bribes, their priests instruct for hire, etc.’ The Omnipresent brings over them three catastrophes; that is what is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Micah 3:12" href="/Micah.3.12"><i>Micha</i> 3:12</a>): ‘Therefore, because of you Zion will be ploughed over as a field, Jerusalem will be desolate, and the Temple Mount a wooded hill.’
A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “If a man performs preliminary marriage using heaves, or tithes, or gifts to priests, or water for purification, or the ashes of purification, she is married even if he is an Israel.” He explains it with heave he inherited from his maternal grandfather, a Cohen.

Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: “This shall be an elevation sacrifice for thirty days,” it is an elevation sacrifice for thirty days; after thirty days it automatically becomes profane<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A different version, describing an animal designated as (most holy) elevation offering for 30 days and afterwards as (simply holy) well-being offering, is quoted as tannaïtic text in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 29a" href="/Nedarim.29a">Babli, <i>Nedarim</i> 29a</a>.</i>. What is its status regarding larceny<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">An animal dedicated as sacrifice is forbidden for all use; it cannot be used for work, nor can it be shorn for its wool.

What is the difference between dedication and woman? We find that a dedication can be eliminated without redemption but we do not find that a woman could leave without a divorce document.

In R. Simeon’s opinion, the reversion to profane status is automatic; the Cohanim to whom it is distributed do not have to redeem it from the Temple treasury.</i>” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, explain it according to everybody regarding a bought field<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">A field which was not a family heirloom but bought from another owner automatically reverts to its hereditary owner in the Jubilee year.

Rebbi Abbahu<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that this name is incorrect since earlier R. Abbahu stated that the animal may be validly sold (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.1.5">Note 16</a>).

Rebbi Eleazar said, it was necessary [to state], even if the second preliminarily married her absolutely<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation of R. Abbahu is not the only one possible. Since the Mishnah mentions the condition “from now and after 30 days” only for the first man, it is quite possible that the second marries her unconditionally.

Rebbi Isaac bar Tebele asked before Rebbi Eleazar: As you take it<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">מַה נַפְשֵׁךְ is a technical term implying that a certain conclusion follows from two mutually exclusive premises.</i>; what the first acquired, he acquired; the remainder the second finished<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This elliptic statement can be explained as follows (R. Moses Margalit): If the statement of the first groom, “from today and after 30 days”, means that he requires 30 days to make up his mind and might annul the preliminary marriage, then it is obvious that the second contracted a valid marriage and the first is eliminated. But if “from today and after 30 days” means that he wants to be married now but his obligations start only after 30 days, the first acquired the right to preliminarily marry the woman after 30 days. If now the second man marries her unconditionally within the thirty days, which the first cannot hinder, his acquisition should have eliminated the option which the first had acquired.</i>. He answered, is this kind of argument applicable to incest prohibitions<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Incest and adultery prohibitions are so serious that no kind of intellectual acrobatics is applicable to them.</i>? How is that? To any woman who is not acquired by one man only, even preliminary marriages of a hundred men apply.
A student asked before Rebbi Ze‘ira: If he gave it to her in the morning on condition that he divorce her in the afternoon<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">From the following it seems that the question was about a case in which A gave a wedding gift to a woman stating that she should be preliminarily married to him “from now after a specified time” but divorcing her before the end of the stated period. B preliminarily married the same woman after A’s conditional marriage but before the divorce. The Mishnah refers to the situation after the end of the 30 day period, when both preliminary marriages are in conflict. That situation may be rectified by at least one divorce.

Since the authorities quoted in the Talmud belong to the third Century, the term must have been in use in the Hellenistic world long before it appeared in surviving papyri.<br>As a special stipulation, the <i>symphōn</i> contract has to be executed concurrent with the preliminary marriage; otherwise it could not undo the marriage without a divorce.

If that day should pass without me having taken you in, I shall have no claim on you.” If anything intervened beyond his control? Rebbi Joḥanan said, matters beyond his control are as if he were inactive. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, matters outside his control are as if he had acted. In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, what would be necessary? “If that day should pass without you having taken me in, I shall have no claim on you.” When Rebbi Joḥanan was dying, he told his daughters to act following Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. He said, sometime in the future there might be a court which follows him; then his descendants might be in danger of bastardy.

Mishnah ‘<i>Eruvin</i> 3:5 permits a person to prepare a number of ‘<i>eruvin</i> which are mutually exclusive, and say: “If attackers appear in the East, my ‘<i>eruv</i> in the West shall be active; if they appear in the West, my <i>‘eruv</i> in the East shall be active; if there is no danger, I shall be like the other inhabitants of my place.”</i>” So is the Mishnah: “A person can impose a condition of his<i>‘eruvin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Since there are at least two.

Then the present Mishnah would be unnecessary. But the new facet of this Mishnah is that preliminary marriage may be effected with lawyer’s or worker’s fees.</i>? But so it is: “By what I shall speak for you to the government; if he did speak for her to the government for a <i>peruṭah</i>’s worth she is preliminarily married, otherwise she is not preliminarily married.” “By what I shall work for you as a worker; if he did work for her as a worker for a <i>peruṭah</i>’s worth, she is preliminarily married, otherwise she is not preliminarily married.” Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav: Only if she set aside a tetradrachma in her chest for him<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">The lawyer or the worker have to present the bill for their work; if the bill amounts to at least a <i>peruṭah</i>, she is married by the forgiving of the bill if she had the money to pay. This formulation avoids the problem of the Babli, that marriage cannot be effectuated by forgiving a loan, and the fee due a professional might be considered a loan slowly accreting through delivery of his services.</i>. With what did he effectuate the preliminary marriage? As we have stated there: “If anything is bartered instead of money, if one party entered in possession, the other is obligated for its trade-in<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 1:6, Note 521. By writing the bill, the lawyer puts a monetary value on his services.</i>.”
“On condition that my father agree; if the father agreed, she is preliminarily married; if the father does not agree, she is not preliminarily married;” silently he does not agree<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">This is an example of the problem of the undistributed middle, frequently discussed in the Babli but rarely in the Yerushalmi. The Mishnah is silent on the status of the marriage if the father refuses to express an opinion. The formulation “if the father agreed” seems to imply that failure to give a positive reply is a rejection. If the formulation had been “unless the father objects,” the father’s silence would have signified assent.</i>. “If the father died, she is preliminarily married;” silently he agreed<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">According to the argument of the preceding Note, if the father died without expressing an opinion, the marriage should be invalid. The second and third clauses of the Mishnah seem to contradict the first.</i>. “If the son died, one instructs the father to say that he does not agree;” silently he agreed. Rebbi Joḥanan asked Rebbi Yannai, can the Mishnah say so? He answered him, do you ask wretched Yannai to explain <i>Qiddušin</i>? Rebbi Yannai returned and explained the Mishnah: “On condition that my father agree; if the father agreed, she is preliminarily married; otherwise she is not preliminarily married,” he said on condition that [the father] express his opinion but he did not<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">One has to read the first clause as explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:6:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.6.3">Note 178</a>, that there is no undistributed middle but the son made the validity of the marriage dependent on the explicit acceptation by his father. The father’s silence means rejection.</i>. “If the father died, she is preliminarily married;” as if he had given his opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">If the father died before he had an opportunity to react, the court may assume that he might have assented if he had lived; the woman is married to the extent that if another man married her preliminarily before the first one married her definitively, she would need a bill of divorce from both of them.</i>. “If the son died, one instructs the father to say that he does not agree;” as if he had given his opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the father had given his initial consent, if the son died before the definitive marriage the court will instruct the father to refuse to accept the marriage in order not to forbid the woman to a Cohen. This clause has nothing to do with the problem of the undistributed middle.</i>. Rebbi Ze‘ira said [before Rebbi Yasa]<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Reading of G. The text of L is unacceptable; R. Ze‘ira cannot ask his student’s student R. Yose but he can ask his teacher and R. Simeon ben Laqish’s student R.

He answered him, so says Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, Rebbi does not refrain from stating generality and detail simultaneously<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">The three clauses of this part of the Mishnah refer to three different situations. In the first clause, a very restrictive interpretation is appropriate, in the second a very general one, in the third even a prior acceptance is turned into a rejection. This agrees with the general style of the Mishnah.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah states thus: “On condition that I have a <i>bet</i> <i>kor</i> of arable land”, a generality; “at place X”, a detail<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.3.1">Mishnah 3:3</a>.

Halakhah 7

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> “I preliminarily married off my daughter but I do not know to whom I married her preliminarily,” and somebody comes and says, I married her preliminarily, he is believed<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Since the father has the right to marry off his underage daughter, if he believes that the person claiming her is his son-in-law, he has the right to marry her to him.</i>. This one says, “I married her preliminarily,” and that one says, “I married her preliminarily,” both give a bill of divorce or, if they so wish, one gives a bill of divorce and the other marries her definitively.

G simply has a note: גרש בסוף פירקא תניינא דיבמות עד לא הכל … “One continues the end of the second Chapter of <i>Yebamot</i> as far as “he is not [trusted] in any way.”</i>“If one says, I preliminarily married off my daughter”, etc. About what is he trustworthy? Samuel says, he is trusted to give a bill of divorce. Assi said, he is trusted to marry. Rav Huna said in the name of Rav: He is trusted to marry. Rebbi Joḥanan said, he is trusted to marry but one does not infer anything for another case from this ruling. What means, one does not infer anything for another case from this ruling? I sold one of my fields but I do not remember to whom I sold it. If someone comes and says, I bought it, he is not trusted in any way. In preliminary marriage, the same holds true. “I betrothed one of my daughters but I do not remember to whom I betrothed her. If someone comes and says, I married her preliminarily,” he is not trusted in any way. The Mishnah disagrees with Rav: “If somebody brings a bill of divorce from overseas and says, it was written and signed in my presence, he shall not marry that woman.” There, she is considered by everybody to be a married woman. Here, she is considered to be a married woman only by two persons. One waits until these two come and say, this is the man who gave her <i>qiddushin</i>. The Mishnah disagrees with Samuel: “This one says, I married her preliminarily, and that one says, I married her preliminarily. Both of them give a bill of divorce, but if they agree, one gives a bill of divorce and the other one marries.” He explains this, if [the father] says, I did betrothe her to one of these two but I do not remember which one it was. Rebbi Ze‘ira, Rebbi Yasa, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If one of them jumped the gun and married her, one does remove her from him. That is, if this one says, I married her preliminarily, and that one says, I married her preliminarily, and one of them jumped the gun and married her definitively. But if he said, I married her preliminarily and then married her definitively, and another one comes and says, I married her preliminarily, he is not trusted in any way. It was stated thus: If after the marriage another man comes and says, I married her preliminarily, he is not trusted in any way.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “I preliminarily married off my younger daughter,” etc. “I preliminarily married off my daughter.” The underaged are included<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture bases the rules of a criminal procedure on the uncorroborated statement of a father who says “I gave my daughter to this man” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:16" href="/Deuteronomy.22.16"><i>Deut</i>. 22:16</a>), it is concluded that his statement concerning a daughter over which he has the power to give her away into marriage has to be accepted by the court without further documentation or corroboration.</i>, the adults are excluded<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Since the father has no right to give her away into marriage.</i>. “My daughter was preliminarily married,” even the underaged are not included<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">The language seems to imply that the father was not involved in the marriage.

The word of Samuel agrees with this. A Persian when dying said to them: Give this man’s<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">His own.</i> wife a bill of divorce.

In the case of the Mishnah, the bill of divorce would be for the mother; the daughter is not mentioned in the discussion. Rav, the teacher of R. Ḥuna, states that if he gave the bill of divorce on his own initiative, one can force him to pay the divorce settlement required by the law of <i>ketubah</i>.</i>.

Assuming that the man either is reasonably well trained in the law or has access to legal advice, he can avoid being badgered into offering a bill of divorce and then forced to pay a hefty sum by threatening to marry the woman’s sister. Since the Mishnah permits him to marry the sister, one cannot ask him to give a divorce to his sister-in-law since by that act he would prohibit his prospective wife to himself. It is in the interest of the woman desiring the bill of divorce to make it clear that she has no monetary claims. (Explanation of D. Fraenckel.)<br>The last sentence cannot be read as declarative: “one forces the divorce of the certain because of the doubtful”, meaning that the man would be barred from marrying the sister because of the unproven claim of the woman, since this would contradict both the Mishnah which permits the woman’s relatives to the man, and the general principle that in marriage matters only those statements count which can be backed up by the testimony of two witnesses. The case cannot be compared to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 3:3:2-4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.3.3.2-4.3"><i>Yebamot</i> 3:4</a> where a man is forced to divorce his (rabbinically) preliminarily married wife and give <i>ḥalîṣah</i> to her sister.<br>“Fellow” is used here not in the technical sense of a person observing the laws of ritual purity (cf.

Since the mss. of the Ben-Asher tradition uniformly write קֳדָשִׁים in the verse here, it is clear that the masoretic interpretation of the verse forbade <i>all</i> holy food to the desecrated priests, whether Temple sacrifices or “outside <i>sancta</i>”, i. e., heave and tithes. But the Yerushalmi, based on the Mishnaic distinction between קָדְשֵׁי קָדָשִׁים “most holy sacrifices”, destined exclusively for the altar and/or legitimate priests in the Temple precinct, קֳדָשִׁם קַלִּים “simple sacrifices” (well-being offerings) shared between altar, priests, and the donor’s family, and קָדְשֵׁי הַגְּבוּל “outside <i>sancta</i>”, here reads מִקָּדְשֵׁי הַקָּדָשִׁים “from most holy sacrifices.” This immediately raises the question why desecrated priests are not summarily excluded from <i>all</i> holy food (as they are in rabbinic practice).

Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: A Mishnah said that the proselytes from Palmyra are acceptable. There, we have stated: “All stains coming from Petra are pure.” Therefore, the proselytes from Palmyra are acceptable.
Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa presented traditions: Of Rebbi Ḥanina and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, one declares permissible and the other admits. He who declares permissible admits. But he who admits does not declare admissible. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Naḥman: Babylonia, as far as family pedigree is concerned, extends up to the <i>yzq</i> canal. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, of Rav and Samuel, one said up to the <i>yzq</i> canal, the other said up to the <i>Wani</i> canal. Rav Jehudah said, between the rivers is like Nahardea as far as family pedigree is concerned. Rebbi Ḥanina ben Beroqa in the name of Rav Jehudah: The people of Moesia are questionable only because of doubts of desecrated women. The Cohanim amongst them did not care about divorcees. There they said, Moesia is dead, Media sick, Elam and <i>gbby</i> dying. The maritime district is the purple-blue of Babylonia. <i>Šny</i>’,<i>gbby</i>’,<i>and ṣrry</i> are purple-blue of the maritime district.
<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The following four paragraphs are from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:3:8-11" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.3.8-11"><i>Yebamot</i> 8:3, Notes 193–212</a>.</i> Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Josia: The eleventh generation of bastards is qualified following Rebbi Simeon; he does not use [the principle of <i>gezerah šawah</i> for] “the tenth, the tenth.” It was stated: Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon says, in the eleventh generation of bastards, the males are forbidden but the females permitted. Rebbi Samuel ben Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, it turns out that Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon follows the argument of Rebbi Meïr. As Rebbi Meïr said, a <i>gezerah šawah</i> is as if written in a verse, so Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon says, a <i>gezerah šawah</i> is as if written in a verse. Here also, the males are forbidden but the females permitted. In that case, even immediately? Only from the tenth onward.
They asked Rebbi Eliezer, what is the status of the eleventh generation of a bastard? He said to them, bring to me a third generation and I shall declare him pure, for he would not live. Rebbi Eliezer parallels Rebbi Ḥanina? As Rebbi Ḥanina said, once every sixty to seventy years the Holy One, praise to Him, brings a plague into the world to eliminate the bastards and he takes the qualified ones with them in order not to publicize the sinners. This parallels what Rebbi Levi said in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: “In the place where the ascent offering has its throat cut before the Eternal, the purification sacrifice has its throat cut,” in order not to publicize the sinners. “Also He is wise and brings evil;” could one better understand “also He is wise and brings good”?

When Rebbi Ze‘ira immigrated here, he heard voices call “he-bastard, she-bastard”. He said, what is this? There goes that of Rav Huna, since Rav Huna said, no bastard lives more than thirty days. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said to him, I was with you when Rebbi Abba, Rav Huna said in the name of Rav: No bastard lives more than thirty days, when? If it is unknown. Therefore, if it is known, he lives.
Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: In the future, the Holy One, praise to Him, will only deal with the tribe of Levi. What is the reason? “The refiner will sit, the purifier of silver, and will refine them,” etc. Rebbi Ze‘ira said, like a man who only drinks from a clean cup. Rebbi Hoshaia said, because we are not<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Yebamot</i>: “we are”.

Rebbi Ḥanina the son of Rebbi Abbahu said, also in the future, the Holy One, praise to Him, will deal with them charitably. What is the reason? “They will be for the Eternal presenters of an offering in charity.”
Rebbi Joḥanan said, one does not investigate a family in which a family disqualification has disappeared. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, a Mishnah says so: “There was a family Bene Ṣerifa in Transjordan who were forcibly distanced by Ben Ṣion. Another [family] was there who were forcibly integrated by the people of Ṣion.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">The text of <b>ג</b> “by Ben Ṣion” is confirmed by all sources of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 8:7" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.8.7">Mishnah <i>Idiut</i> 8:7</a>.</i>” Nevertheless, the Sages did not want to make their names public. But the Sages transmit them to their sons and students two times in a Week. Rebbi Joḥanan said, by the Temple service, I know them and the leading personalities of the generation have disappeared in them. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, Pashḥur ben Immer had 5000 slaves, and their traces have disappeared in the high priesthood. These are the insolent in the priesthood. Rebbi Eleazar said, their main training: “Your people is like quarrelsome priests.” Rebbi Abbahu said, Samaritans disappeared in thirteen villages in the times of [persecution]<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows <b>ג</b> which alone makes sense.</i>.

They objected to Rebbi Jehudah, but is it not written, “one injured in his testicles or with amputated urethra should not come into the Eternal’s congregation”? That refers to bodily blemishes. But is it not written, “children that will be born to them in the third generation may enter the Eternal’s congregation”? That is a positive commandment. But the rabbis said, there are three congregations, the congregation of Cohanim, the congregation of Levites, the congregation of Israelites; “they shall not come, they shall not come, they shall not come.”

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Any who are forbidden to marry in the congregation are permitted to marry one another<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Even a bastard who is certainly forbidden may marry a foundling whose status is only questionable, as already stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.4.1.1">Mishnah 1</a>.</i> but Rebbi Jehudah forbids. Rebbi Eliezer says, certain with certain are permitted, certain with questionable, questionable with certain<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">This clause was inserted only as a memory help; “certain with questionable” is the same as “questionable with certain”; it does not make any difference who is the male and who the female.</i>, and questionable with questionable are forbidden. The following are questionable: the silenced one, the foundling, and the Samaritan<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Who are Jewish but do not follow the rabbinic rules of marriage and divorce. The child of a Samaritan divorcee from a second husband might be a bastard by rabbinic rules.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The entire Halakhah is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:2:5-9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.2.5-9"><i>Yebamot</i> 8:2, Notes 136–155</a> (<b>ג</b>).</i> Rebbi Jeremiah said, as a matter of principle, an Israel with an injured testicle may marry a female bastard. Rebbi Yose said, it applies only to family disabilities, not to bodily defects. The strength of Rebbi Yose comes from the statement of Rebbi Ḥilqiah, Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: One did state this only for an Israel with an injured testicle, but not a Cohen, since, as you say there, if he is certainly a Cohen he is forbidden to marry a convert; here also, he is certainly an Israel and forbidden to marry a female bastard.
[In the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah, may a male bastard not marry a female bastard?]<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Missing here, added from <b>ג</b>. Since the paragraph is the answer to the question asked in this sentence, it is clear that <b>ג</b> is the source and the text here the copy.</i> Let us hear from the following, as Rebbi Immi said, Rebbi Jacob from Gebal stated before Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Isaac bar Tevele in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Rebbi Jehudah stated that a male bastard should not marry a female bastard so that bastards should disappear from the world. Similarly, is an Ammonite man forbidden to marry an Ammonite woman? Was that needed for the rabbis? For if Rebbi Jehudah thought that this disqualified converts from any of the Eternal’s congregations, then [the Ammonite] could not marry an Ammonite woman since for her he would be of the Eternal’s congregation. He could not marry an Egyptian woman since for her he would be of the Eternal’s congregation. Rebbi Mattania said, one frees a slave girl and marries her to him. Similarly, could an Egyptian man not marry an Egyptian woman? Let us hear from the following, as Rebbi Abbahu stated before Rebbi Joḥanan: “Rebbi Jehudah said, Benjamin, an Egyptian convert, was a student of Rebbi Aqiba. He said, I am an Egyptian convert married to an Egyptian convert. My son is an Egyptian convert; I shall marry him to an Egyptian convert so that my grandson will be qualified to marry into the congregation. Rebbi Aqiba said to him, my son, it is not so. But you marry him to the daughter of an Egyptian woman convert so that there should be three generations on either side.”
Rav Jehudah in the name of Rav: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer. The words of the Sages? Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac: “No bastard shall marry into the Eternal’s congregation”. He cannot marry into a congregation which is certain. He may marry if the membership in the congregation is questionable.
There, we have stated: “If it is doubtful whether [the child is] a nine-months’ child of the first [brother] or a seven-months’ of the second, he has to divorce her, the child is legitimate, and they are obligated for a reparation offering for a possible sin.” It was stated: “The first son could be [High]<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Missing from the text here but necessary. If the male child is legitimate and his father a Cohen, he is a Cohen. The emphasis is on the fact that the child in theory could be High Priest.</i> Priest, any second son possibly is a bastard. Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob said, there is no such thing as a possible bastard.” Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob agrees in cases of doubt of Samaritans and desecrated persons. This refers to what we have stated there: “Ten classes returned from Babylonia.” In the opinion of Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob, eight. In the opinion of Rabban Gamliel and Rebbi Eliezer, nine. In the opinion of the rabbis, ten.

“Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says,” etc. There, we have stated: “Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, the daughter of proselytes should not marry into the priesthood unless her mother be from Israel” They all interpret the same verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ezekiel 44:22" href="/Ezekiel.44.22"><i>Ez</i>. 44:22</a>): “Only virgins from the seed of the House of Israel.” Rebbi Jehudah says, unless his father be from Israel. Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, either her father or her mother. Rebbi Yose says, unless they are born in the holiness of Israel. Rebbi Simeon says, unless they grow the hymen in the holiness of Israel. It was stated in the name of Rebbi Simeon: “A girl which became a proselyte being less than three years and one day of age is acceptable for the priesthood since it was said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 31:18" href="/Numbers.31.18"><i>Num</i>. 31:18</a>): ‘All the female children unfit for sleeping with a male you shall let live for yourselves,’ and Phineas was with them.” How do the rabbis explain? You shall let live as slaves and slave girls for yourselves.
Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan; Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Practice follows Rebbi Yose. Ḥanin bar Abba in the name of Rav: Practice follows Rebbi Yose, but Cohanim are used to follow Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob. A Cohen married the daughter of proselytes. The case came before Rebbi Abbahu who let him kneel before the low bench. Rebbi Bevai said to him, did the Rabbi not teach us that practice follows Rebbi Yose? He answered, but are not Cohanim used to follow Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob? He retorted, Rebbi, does one whip because of what one is used to do? He said to him, if you look at it in such a way, you have appeased me and I shall let him get up. After he got up, he said to him, since the lash was withdrawn I am permitted to have her.
Rebbi Jacob bar Idi in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: It happened that a family in the South had a bad reputation. Rebbi sent Romanus to investigate them. He investigated and found that a grandmother had been converted at less than three years and a day of age, and he declared them fit for the priesthood. Rav Hoshaia said, he declared them fit following Rebbi Simeon. Rebbi Ze‘ira said, here it is everybody’s opinion since Rebbi Ze‘ira said in the name of Rav Ada bar Ahava, Rebbi Judan brings it in the name of Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The child of an adult is fit since it is a prohibition deduced from a positive commandment. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:13" href="/Leviticus.21.13"><i>Lev</i>. 21:13</a>) “But he shall take a wife in her virginity.” Any prohibition deduced from a positive commandment is a positive commandment. Analogously, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:14" href="/Leviticus.21.14"><i>Lev</i>. 21:14</a>) “only a virgin from amidst his people he shall take as wife,” not a proselyte. Is any prohibition deduced from a positive commandment a positive commandment? Rebbi Hoshaia objected: But the second generation of an Egyptian is a prohibition deduced from a positive commandment! Rebbi Hoshaia turned around and said, a positive commandment for Israel cannot be compared to a positive commandment for Cohanim. A positive commandment for Israel implies a prohibition for everybody. A positive commandment for Cohanim implies a prohibition for Cohanim but a permission for Levites and Israel.
