Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

MISHNA: The woman is acquired in three ways and acquires herself in two ways. [She is] acquired with money, with a document and with intercourse. With money? Beit Shammai says: With a dinar, or the value of a dinar. And Beit Hillel says: With a perutah, or with the value of a perutah. And how much is a perutah [worth]? One eighth of the isser italki. She acquires herself with a get, or with the death of the husband. A yevama is acquired with intercourse, and acquires herself with chalitzah or with the death of [all available] yavam[s].
GEMARA.<br>Mishna stated "or" with money "or" with a document "or" with intercourse.  Rabbi Hiya in a breita thus: it is not complete by all three, even one of them. 
From where do we learn that it can be done with money? "A man takes" (Deuteronomy 24,1) stating that she can be acquired with money.  From where do we learn that it can be done with intercourse? "posses her" (ibid.) I would say by this and by this.  Money without intercourse, intercourse without money, from where we we learn it? Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:  It is written: "If a man is found lying with another man’s wife" (Deuteronomy 23,23).

"Someone who does one mitzvah, it is good for him, and his days will be lengthened, and he will inherit the land. And one who does one aveirah, it is not good for him, and his days will not be lengthened, and he will not inherit the land." There we teach: "Thus anyone who sits and does not sin, he is given the reward as if he did a mitzvah." Rabbi Z'eirah said: One who is about to do a doubtful aveirah and doesn't do it. Rabbi Yose bar Rabbi Bun said: One who designates one mitzvah for themselves and never transgressed it in his life. What's an example? Rabbi Mar Ukban said: Such as honouring parents...

[And you find that with our father] Avraham, that he kept the Torah even it had not yet come to the world, as it is stated: "because that Avraham hearkened to my voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws [Torahs]." It elevated him and blessed him in his youth, and gave him posterity and hope in his old age. Regarding his youth, what does it say (Genesis 13:2): "And Avram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold." Regarding his old age, what does it say (Genesis 24:1): "And Avraham was old , well stricken in age; and the Lord had blessed Avraham in all things."
Rabbi Hezkiya, Rabbi Cohen in the name of Rav: It is forbidden to reside in a city that has no doctor, and where there is no bathhouse, and where the courthouse does not flog and imprison [criminals]. Rabbi Yosi ben Rabbi Bon: It is also forbidden to reside in a city where there is no vegetable garden. Rabbi Hezkiya, Rabbi Cohen in the name of Rav: In the future, a person will give a judgement and an accounting over everything that his eye saw and he did not eat. Rabbi Elazar paid attention to this teaching and gathered small coins (that did not require change and could be spent immediately), in order to [purchase and] eat every kind [of produce] with them once a year.
