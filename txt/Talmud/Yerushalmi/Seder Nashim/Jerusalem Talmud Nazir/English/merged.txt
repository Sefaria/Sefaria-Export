Jerusalem Talmud Nazir

From here that substitute names for vows are like vows. “Or he swears,” why does the verse say “an oath”? From here that substitute names for oaths are like oaths. One reads that<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The text is quoted from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.2-3"><i>Nedarim</i> 1:1, Notes 12–22</a>.</i> at the start of the first Chapter of Nedarim, up to: Rebbi Ismael stated: “any person who vows a vow of <i>nazir</i>”. From there that a person can obligate himself as <i>nazir</i> while he currently is a <i>nazir</i>.
It was stated: “All substitute names for <i>nazir</i> vows are like <i>nazir</i> vows, and one whips because of them.” Even though Rebbi Joḥanan said, one does not whip for prohibitions<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.5"><i>Nedarim</i> 1:1, Note 36</a>.</i>, he agrees in this case that he is whipped<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody makes a vow using unapproved language and does not keep it, he cannot be accused of transgressing a biblical prohibition.

Even though Rebbi Jehudah said, a questionable <i>nazir</i> vow is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 4:6:2-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.4.6.2-8">Halakhah 4:6</a>; based on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:2" href="/Numbers.6.2"><i>Num</i>. 6:2</a>.</i>, he agrees in this case that he be whipped<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since the vow is not questionable.</i>. Where do we hold? If he has the intention of becoming a <i>nazir</i>, even if he only said, I shall be a <i>nazir</i> if I mention bread, he is a <i>nazir</i>. Similarly, if he had no intention of becoming a <i>nazir</i>, even if he mentioned <i>nazir</i>, he is no <i>nazir</i>; for example if he was reading the Torah and mentioned <i>nazir</i>,<i>naziq</i>. But we hold about one who says, I declared my vow of <i>nazir</i> by any of these expressions. If one of them is a valid expression of a vow of <i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">From the list mentioned in the Mishnah.</i>, it will fall on him, otherwise, will the vow of <i>nazir</i> not fall on him? One tells him: keep the discipline<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 12:28" href="/Deuteronomy.12.28"><i>Deut</i>. 12:28</a>; if he had the intention of becoming a <i>nazir</i>, even if he did not use exactly the prescribed language. The same expression is used in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 81b" href="/Menachot.81b">Babli, <i>Menaḥot</i> 81b</a>, regarding a person who makes an irregular vow of a sacrifice.</i>.
“I shall be”. Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: When he saw <i>nezirim</i> pass by<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">There is no vow of <i>nazir</i> without an implicit or explicit reference to the institution of <i>nazir</i>. The reference may be to a <i>nazir</i> passing by.</i>. If he said “beautiful”, what is the rule? Does he ridicule them or [does he mean] “I shall be like them”? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Samuel<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nazir 2b" href="/Nazir.2b">Babli, 2b</a>, Samuel takes the position attributed to R.

“Or I shall be beautiful”. Where do we hold? If he said “beautiful”, is that not the previous case? When he grabs his hair, is that not what we have stated: “I shall be like this one”, following Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina who holds that “I shall be like this one” refers to the case that he is grabbing his hair<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 1:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.1.1.8">Note 23</a>.</i>. But we must hold that he says, “there is nothing more beautiful than this”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">. In that case, we assume that he himself wants to be as beautiful and let his hair grow.</i>.
“<i>Naziq</i>,<i>naziaḥ</i>,<i>paziq</i>”. Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are expressions chosen by earlier generations and nobody has the right to add to them. But did not Rebbi Ḥiyya state: <i>raziaḥ</i>,<i>haziaḥ</i>? Rebbi Shila said, also to expressions chosen by earlier secondary ones nobody has the right to add. <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the paragraph the text is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:2:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.2.3"><i>Nedarim</i> 1:2, Notes 115–120</a> (<b>נ</b>).</i> But did not Bar Qappara state <i>ḥeres</i>? Rebbi Ze‘ira said, that is a name relating to the High One: “If He commands the sun: would it not shine?”. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, these are Gentile words, like those Nabateans who say <i>khaspa</i> for <i>ḥaspa</i>. Rebbi Yose said, it is reasonable in other places, but in a place where the <i>nazir</i> is called <i>naziq</i>, do I say that a <i>nazir</i> of people with speech defects should not be a <i>nazir</i>?
It was stated: “The House of Shammai say, both substitute names and substitutes of substitutes are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Nazir (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Nazir_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta <i>Nazir</i> 1:1</a> (cf. also 1:2); <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 10b" href="/Nedarim.10b">Babli <i>Nedarim</i> 10b</a>. The expression “forbidden” refers to “vows of prohibition” rather than to vows of <i>nazir</i>.</i>. But the House of Hillel say, substitute names are forbidden, substitutes of substitutes are permitted.” What are substitutes of substitutes? Rebbi Abba bar Zavda said, <i>menazaqa</i>,<i>menaziqna</i>,<i>mefaḥazna</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pi‘el</i> forms of the accepted roots נזק, פזח.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, these are not substitutes of substitutes, they are really substitute names, for is somebody who said <i>menadarna</i> not a <i>nazir</i>? But one who says <i>menadarna</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since Galilean rabbinic Hebrew mostly replaces <i>qal</i> by <i>pi‘el</i> (such as מְהַלֵּךְ for הוֹלֵך), an unusual <i>pi‘el</i> form for נדר “to make a vow” (and equally, for נזר “to vow to be a <i>nazir</i>”) is valid speech.<br>The form מנזדנא used here makes no sense; most probably one has to read מְנַזַּרְנָא as in the preceding sentence.</i> is like one who said <i>mefaḥazna</i>. Following Rebbi Yose, these are substitutes of substitutes, as we have stated: “I have to bring birds’, Rebbi Meïr says, he is a <i>nazir</i>, but the Sages say, he is not a <i>nazir</i>. “Rebbi Joḥanan said, because of substitutes of substitutes: <sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Daniel 4:30" href="/Daniel.4.30">Dan. 4:30</a>. This establishes a proverbial connection between long hair and a mention of birds.</i>“Until his hair became mighty as an eagle’s and his fingernails like those of birds.”
“I shall be like this one”; Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina said, if he grabs [a <i>nazir</i>’s] hair and says, “I shall be like this one.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli, Samuel admits the possibility that a <i>nazir</i> was standing nearby and the person making the vow pointed to him.</i> “I shall tend my hair, I shall groom my hair”. If he says, I shall be of those who have to tend or grow their hair<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since in popular speech a <i>nazir</i> is characterized by his long hair, saying that one wants to be “of those who grow their hair” is a clear vow of <i>nazir</i>.</i>. “I shall tend my hair and I shall groom my hair”, if he says I shall neither tend nor grow my hair for less than thirty [days], he means thirty<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.1.3.1">Mishnah 1:3</a> states that an unspecified period of <i>nezirut</i> is 30 days. Therefore, mentioning 30 days in a statement regarding hair is a statement of <i>nezirut</i>.</i>. “It shall be my obligation neither to tend nor to grow my hair,” if he says, it shall be my obligation neither to tend nor to grow my hair more than thirty [days], he means thirty. “I shall be obligated to grow my hair”, means “I shall tend my hair, I shall groom my hair”. Or “It shall be my obligation neither to tend nor to groom my hair, but to let it grow wildly<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For the standard 30 days.</i>.”
“ ‘I have to bring birds’, Rebbi Meïr says, he is a <i>nazir</i>, but the Sages say, he is not a <i>nazir</i>.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, because of substitutes of substitutes: “Until his hair became mighty as an eagle’s and his fingernails like those of birds.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Daniel 4:30" href="/Daniel.4.30">Dan. 4:30</a>. This establishes a proverbial connection between long hair and a mention of birds.</i>” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, because an impure <i>nazir</i> brings birds<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:10" href="/Numbers.6.10"><i>Num</i>. 6:10</a>. But no pure person would entertain the idea of becoming a <i>nazir</i> if he expects to become impure since that could extend his period of <i>nezirut</i> indefinitely.</i>. Does he bring birds<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Many people use צִפּוֹר only for wild birds.</i>? He brings turtledoves or young pigeons. There are some Tannaïm who state that all pure birds are called צפור, and there are some Tannaïm who state that all birds, whether pure or impure, are called צפור. He who says that all pure birds are called צפור, “you may eat any pure bird<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:11" href="/Deuteronomy.14.11"><i>Deut</i>. 14:11</a>. In Scripture, צפור is feminine.</i>.” He who says that all birds, whether pure or impure, are called צפור, “say to any winged bird<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Ezekiel 39:14" href="/Ezekiel.39.14"><i>Ez</i>. 39:14</a>.</i>. “What is the rabbi’s reason? He is like somebody offering birds for the upkeep of the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The expression הֲרֵי עָלַי “I have to bring” is a regular form of a vow, which in Temple times implied a gift to the Temple. A single bird can be offered as a voluntary sacrifice (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 1:14-17" href="/Leviticus.1.14-17"><i>Lev</i>. 1:14–17</a>) but a couple can be given only as an obligatory sacrifice, i. e., a reparation or a purification sacrifice. These can never be given voluntarily, as result of a vow. Since the vow was formulated for <i>birds</i>, not <i>a bird</i>, it is concluded that the birds have to be given to the Temple for its upkeep, to be sold to persons needing them for obligatory sacrifices, with the proceeds given to the Temple treasury.</i>. What is Rebbi Meïr’s reason? He is like somebody offering a reparation sacrifice for the upkeep of the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This is an impossibility; an obligatory sacrifice cannot be given voluntarily and it has to be offered on the altar, not sold for the Temple’s benefit. Therefore, the vow has to be interpreted as a wish to be in a situation in which one has to bring a reparation sacrifice to the Temple. The only reparation sacrifices which depend on the person’s initiative are either the possible sacrifice of the impure <i>nazir</i> or those required of the person guilty of larceny (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:14-16" href="/Leviticus.5.14-16"><i>Lev</i>. 5:14–16</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21-26" href="/Leviticus.21-26">21–26</a>). Since it is impossible to think that a person should want to commit larceny for religious purposes, the state of <i>nazir</i> is the only alternative.</i>. What is the difference between them? If somebody says, “I take upon myself to bring a reparation sacrifice.” In the opinion of Rebbi Meïr he is a <i>nazir</i> since one cannot bring a reparation sacrifice for the upkeep of the Temple. In the opinion of the rabbis he is a <i>nazir</i> since an impure <i>nazir</i> brings a reparation sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since in this formulation there is no difference between the rabbis and R. Meïr, all commentaries read “he is <i>not</i> a <i>nazir</i>”; since no person would accept <i>nezirut</i> with the prospect of an indefinite duration unless he spells this out clearly at the start, the vow is invalid because it is unrealistic. If one keeps the original wording, the rabbis and R. Meїr agree not only on the result but also on the reasoning behind it.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> “I am off grape kernels<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This uses the expression of the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:4" href="/Numbers.6.4"><i>Num</i>. 6:4</a>: “During the period of his vow, he may eat nothing which can be made from wine-grapes, neither kernels nor skin.” Anybody who prohibits to himself anything characteristically forbidden to a <i>nazir</i> makes a vow of <i>nazir</i> (unless explicitly disawoved in the same breath) and is subject to all its rules.</i>,” or “off grape skin,” or “off hair shaving,” or “off impurity”; he is a <i>nazir</i> and all rules of <i>nezirut</i> apply to him. “I am like Samson ben Manoaḥ, like Dalilah’s husband, like the one who lifted the gates of Gaza, like the one blinded by the Philistines,” he is a Samson-<i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A Samson-<i>nazir</i> follows the rules not of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6" href="/Numbers.6"><i>Num</i>. 6</a> but of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Judges 13:1" href="/Judges.13.1"><i>Jud</i>. 13:1</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Judges 13:5" href="/Judges.13.5">5</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Judges 13:14" href="/Judges.13.14">14</a>: His vow is life-long; he is forbidden wine and any intoxicating drink, and cannot shear his hair. He does not have to avoid the impurity of the dead.</i>. What is the difference between a <i>nazir</i> in perpetuity<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A person who made a vow to follow the rules of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6" href="/Numbers.6"><i>Num</i>. 6</a> for the rest of his life.</i> and a Samson-<i>nazir</i>? If the hair of a <i>nazir</i> in perpetuity becomes heavy, he shaves it off with a knife and brings three animals<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">He celebrates the end of a <i>nazir</i> period, as prescribed in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:13-20" href="/Numbers.6.13-20"><i>Num</i>. 6:13–20</a>, except that at the end of the ceremony he cannot drink wine but immediately starts the next period. The frequency of his shaving is a matter of dispute in the Halakhah.</i>; if he becomes impure, he brings a sacrifice of impurity. If the hair of a Samson-<i>nazir</i> becomes heavy, he does not shave; if he becomes impure, he does not bring a sacrifice of impurity.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “I am a <i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of the Mishnah in the Babli and most Mishnah mss.</i> off grape kernels,” etc. So is the Mishnah: “either off grape kernels,” or “off grape skin,” or “off hair shaving,” or “off impurity”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">He is <i>nazir</i> if only one of the expressions mentioned were used. One should not translate: “I am off grape kernels and off grape skin and off hair shaving and off impurity”, implying that he only is a <i>nazir</i> if he recited the entire catalogue. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nazir 3b" href="/Nazir.3b">Babli, 3b</a>, the latter is the opinion of R. Simeon.</i>. If he mentioned <i>nazir</i> with any one of them, following Rebbi Jehudah only if he mentioned “and”, but following Rebbi Meïr even if he did not mention “and”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The disagreement between them was explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 9:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.9.6.2"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 9:7, Notes 85–101</a>, mainly in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 1:3:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.1.3.2">Notes 93–95</a>. According to R. Jehudah, if he makes a vow to become a <i>nazir</i> and then adds “and forbidden kernels, and forbidden skins, and forbidden haircuts, and forbidden impurity”, each “and” implies a new vow for an additional period of <i>nezirut</i>. According to R. Meïr, just reciting the catalogue adds a new obligation for each item listed, even if the items are not connected by “and”.</i>.
“I am a <i>nazir</i> and a <i>nazir</i>;” he is two times a <i>nazir</i>, for he could have said, “ “I am a <i>nazir</i>.” “I am a <i>nazir</i>,<i>nazir</i>,” two. “I am a <i>nazir</i>, once, and repeated,” he is four times a <i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since he will be twice a <i>nazir</i> if he said “I am a <i>nazir</i>, once” by the preceding argument, the repetition would apply to all that precedes it.</i>.

The rabbis have stated: A circular house, or one <i>digon, trigon, pentagon</i>, is not subject to the laws of leprosy of houses (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:33-53" href="/Leviticus.14.33-53"><i>Lev.</i> 14:33–53</a>); a house built <i>tetragon</i> is subject to those laws. (A text similar to the last sentence is in Tosefta <i>Nega‘im</i> 6:3; Mishnah <i>Nega‘im</i> 12:1 mentions only a round house and a <i>trigon</i> house.) In <i>Baba batra</i>, the word <i>digon</i> is further determined by the note that of the two consuls (<i>Archontes</i>), the one who is not eponymous is called <i>archon digon</i> (in the interpretation of the commentary ascribed to R. Gershom, a person “appointed <i>archon</i> for the second time”.)<br>Under the influence of the Babli, the dictionaries, starting with the 11th Cent. <i>Arukh</i>, have identified the words <i>digon, trigon, tetragon</i> used by Symmachos with the same words used in the Tosephta of <i>Nega‘im</i>. Now it is clear that in the latter Tosephta, <i>trigon</i> corresponds to τρίγωνος “triangular”, <i>tetragon</i> is τετράγωνος “quadrilateral, square”, and <i>pentagon</i> to πεντάγωνος “pentagonal”. In spherical geometry, there exists a notion of <i>digon</i>, but this cannot be traced back earlier than the 17th Cent.; it is a notion foreign to the spirit of Greek mathematics. S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta kiFshutah Nazir</i> p. 504) has recognized correctly that a word δίγωνον does not exist in classical or Byzantine Greek. Therefore, the talmudic <i>digon</i> cannot be translated “bi-angular”. The word is more likely to be δίγονος “double, twin”, which certainly makes sense in the statements about <i>nazir</i> and <i>archon</i> (<i>archon digon</i> “associate <i>archon</i>”). In parallel, the words <i>trigon</i> and <i>tetragon</i> used for the <i>nazir’s</i> vow have well documented non-geometric meanings τρίγωνος “threefold”, τετράγωνος “fourfold”.<br>There only remains the problem of explaining the word <i>digon</i> used in Tosephta <i>Nega‘im</i>. It cannot mean “biangle” since a house with only two corners automatically must have curved walls and is excluded as a “round house”.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> “I am a <i>nazir</i> from here to place X.” One estimates how many days it is from here to place X.

Rebbi Jehudah said, this happened, and after he had finished, he died.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “ “I am a <i>nazir</i> from here to place X,” etc. Where do we hold? If in the count of a solar year, 365 <i>neziriot</i> following the count of a solar year. If in the count of a lunar year, 354 <i>neziriot</i> following the count of a lunar year. But “the count of the days of a year” is problematic<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Since he could have in mind either an actual Julianic year of 365 or 366 days, or an actual Jewish lunar-solar year which according to the calendar in current use is between 353 and 385 days (with somewhat greater variations in the Mishnaic calendar, described in the appendix to the author’s <i>Seder Olam</i>, Northvale 1998.)

The formulation of the Yerushalmi Mishnah, referring simply to “a year” is not found in any of these parallel sources.<br>At this point, the scribe of the ms. wrote<br>גרש ההלכתא קדמייתא דרישא דנדרים עד מטי סופא דהילכתא<br>“One reads here from the the first Halakhah at the start of Nedarim until the end of the Halakhah.”<br>This was deleted by the corrector who prepared the ms. for the printer and inserted the text (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:14" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.14"><i>Nedarim</i> 1:1, Notes 93–102</a>).

It was stated in the name of Rebbi Jehudah: This man was destined for death, only his <i>nezirut</i> suspended it.
The Mishnah follows Rebbi Jehudah <i>since it was stated in the name of Rebbi Jehudah</i>, the ancient pious ones desired to bring a purification offering, but the Omnipresent did not let a sin happen to them; so they made a vow of <i>nazir</i> in order to be able to bring a purification offering. Rebbi Simeon says, they became sinners because they made a vow of <i>nazir</i>, for it was said: “He shall atone for himself for what he sinned about the person,” that one sinned against his own person because he barred himself from [drinking] wine. It turns out that the position of Simeon the Just parallels Rebbi Simeon. As it was stated: Simeon the Just said, I never ate the reparation offering of a <i>nazir</i> except once. Once a man came to me from the South, I saw that he was handsome, with beautiful eyes and good looks, and his hair in waves. I said to him, my son, what induced you to cut off that beautiful hair? He said to me: Rabbi, I was a shepherd in my village and I went to fill the water vessel with water when I saw my mirror image in the water and my instinct rushed over me and tried to remove me from the World<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Since the obligation is 29 days, the 30th day automatically is the day of celebration.</i>. I said to it, wicked! You are rushing me to something which is not yours; it is upon me to sanctify you to Heaven! I embraced him, kissed him on his head and said, my son, there should be many more in Israel who fulfill the Omnipresent’s will like you. About you the verse says, “man or woman, if he clearly articulates vowing a vow of <i>nazir</i>, to be a <i>nazir</i> for the Eternal.” Rebbi Mana asked: Why following Simeon the Just, even following Rebbi Simeon? Did Simeon the Just never eat a purification offering for suet? Did Simeon the Just never eat a purification offering for blood? Simeon the Just holds that people make a vow while they are upset. Since they make the vow while they are upset, in the end, they wonder. But if he wonders, his sacrifices become similar to one of those who slaughtered profane animals in the Temple courtyard. But this one made a well thought-out dedication, when his mouth and his thoughts were in unison.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If his wife had a miscarriage,” etc. Should one not be afraid that he might have been viable?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> “I am a <i>nazir</i> and a <i>nazir</i> when a son is born to me.” If he started counting for himself when a son was born to him, he finishes his own<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Then he brings his sacrifices and shaves.</i> and then counts for his son. “I am a <i>nazir</i> when a son is born to me, and a <i>nazir</i>.” If he had started counting for himself when a son was born to him he interrupts his own, counts for his son<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Then he brings his sacrifices and shaves.</i>, and then finishes for himself<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is after shaving, he has to complete 30 days.</i>.

About a <i>nazir</i> who became impure, the opinions of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina seem contradictory.

And is not the seventh day counted for a person impure by the impurity of the dead, who made a vow of <i>nazir</i>? Would this obligate him to bring a sacrifice for his impurity?

Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If he polluted himself during his son’s <i>nezirut</i> but was warned because of his own <i>nezirut</i>, he is whipped<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Since a <i>nazir</i> is forbidden by biblical law to pollute himself with the impurity of the dead (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:6-7" href="/Numbers.6.6-7"><i>Num</i>. 6:6–7</a>), if he pollutes himself intentionally and his criminal intent was ascertained because he was warned by two witnesses not to pollute himself and he did it anyway, he is punished in criminal law.

In the parallel sources, the statement is accepted as practice.</i>” i. e., his vow of <i>nazir</i> should precede his sacrifice, rather than that his sacrifice precede his vow of <i>nazir</i>.
Rebbi Judah asked before Rebbi Yose: Why should his <i>nezirut</i> not precede that of his son<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the second part of the Mishnah. If he had started his own <i>nezirut</i> when his son was born, why should he not finish his own and only then start the <i>nezirut</i> honoring his son’s birth?</i>? Did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: “This animal shall be dedicated as elevation sacrifice after 30 days.” If he sold it within the thirty days, it is sold; its dedication sanctifies<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">If the animal dedicated as one kind of sacrifice after 30 days was dedicated and used for another sacrifice within this period, it is perfectly legal since the prior dedication was inactive in the intervening period. (Quoted in <i>Qiddušin</i> 3:1, 63c 1. 42.)</i>. He said, is that not, if one said “This”. Perhaps if he said: “I have the obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">If a person dedicates an animal saying: “this animal is dedicated”, and anything happens to the animal before it is sacrificed, the owner does not have to look for a replacement. But if he says, “it is my obligation to bring”, he has to bring the dedicated animal and, if anything happens to it, the owner must provide a replacement. Therefore, if the animal was dedicated after 30 days but no longer exists, no replacement is due. But a vow of <i>nazir</i> is personal and has to be dealt with under the rules of personal responsibility.</i>”? But the one who says, “I am”, is like one who says, “I have the obligation.”
Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: “<i>Nazir</i> after twenty days and <i>nazir</i> 100 days from now on.” He counts twenty days, interrupts and counts another 30 days, and counts another 80 to complete his first <i>nezirut</i><sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Nazir (Lieberman) 2:10" href="/Tosefta_Nazir_(Lieberman).2.10">Tosephta 2:10</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nazir 14a" href="/Nazir.14a">Babli 14a</a>. A person makes a vow to be a <i>nazir</i> after 30 days and simultaneously makes a vow immediately to be a <i>nazir</i> for 100 days. Then he starts his immediate <i>nezirut</i> for 20 days, continues to count the 30 days of his other <i>nezirut</i>, brings his sacrifices and shaves, and counts the remaining 80 days of his immediate <i>nezirut</i> and brings the second set of sacrifices. Since the continuation of the interrupted <i>nezirut</i> is for more than 30 days, it is a valid <i>nezirut</i> and he does lose the initial 20 days.</i>.

The only impurity forbidden to the <i>nazir</i> is the impurity of corpses; therefore, it is quite possible for a sufferer from scale disease to be a <i>nazir</i> (even though such a person could never shave before he is healed since he cannot enter the Temple precinct.)</i>, may he shave once and have it counted for his <i>nezirut</i> and his scale disease?

The problem is that the students declare that both the <i>nazir</i> and the sufferer from scale disease in his preliminary purification shave <i>before</i> the sprinkling of the blood; this seems to presuppose the uncorrected reading in the preceding sentence.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody said, “I am a <i>nazir</i>,” etc. This supports Bar Qappara<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 1:3:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.1.3.2">Chapter 1:3, Note 93</a>.</i>, that if he shaved on the 30<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> day, he did not fulfill his obligation.

Both of them<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">One anonymous Mishnah cannot represent two contradictory opinions.</i>? It is only one opinion, “this testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.3.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>. R. Pappaias testified that a person who vowed two <i>neziriot</i> and shaved for the first on the thirtieth day may shave the second time on the 60<sup>th</sup> day (since the 30<sup>th</sup> day is counted for both; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 3:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.3.1.1">Note 1</a>.) Since the testimony is formulated conditionally, “if he shaved on the 30<sup>th</sup> day”, not as an absolute statement, “he shaves on the 30<sup>th</sup> and 60<sup>th</sup> days”, it follows that shaving on the 30<sup>th</sup> day is irregular. The Mishnah follows neither Bar Qappara nor R. Jonathan but the practice proclaimed by R. Pappaios.</i>”. They knew that it was forbidden to shave on the 30<sup>th</sup>; they thought that if he shaved on the 30<sup>th</sup> day, he did not fulfill his obligation. He came to testify that if he shaved on the 30<sup>th</sup> day, he fulfilled his obligation.
Something happened<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A close relative died. By rabbinic convention, the mourner cannot leave his house for the first seven days after burial; he does not shave for thirty days. R.

Yose criticizes R. Immi. The Mishnah requires the <i>nazir</i> to shave on his 31<sup class="footnote-marker">st</sup> day; it only legitimizes shaving on the 30<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> after the fact. But R. Immi shaved on the 30<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> on his own initiative. R. Zeriqa seems to hold that what is acceptable after the fact in biblical rules is permitted from the start in rabbinic usage.</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah instructed Rebbi Isaac Aṭoshia, and some say, Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav Isaac Aṭoshia, to shave on the 30<sup>th</sup> day, following the Mishnah<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mo‘ed qaṭan</i> 3:5. “If somebody buried his relative three days before a holiday, the seven-day rule is waived for him. Eight days, the 30 day rule is waived for him, as they said: Sabbath is counted but does not interrupt, holidays interrupt but do not count.” If somebody was mourning for three days before the holiday, he does not have to continue the intense mourning period after the holiday; he continues with the remainder of the 30-day period. Similarly, if he was keeping at least one day of mourning after the seven-day period, the holiday cancels the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. (The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 19b" href="/Moed_Katan.19b">Babli, <i>Mo‘ed qaṭan</i> 19b</a>, reduces the 8 day period to 7 since “part of a day is like a whole day” and the 30-day period starts on the seventh.)</i>: “Eight days, the decree of 30 days is waived for him.” The eighth has the same status as the 30<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> day<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The argument here goes as follows: If the 8th day of mourning was holiday eve, the mourner can shave in the afternoon in preparation for the holiday. The time elapsed from dawn to the afternoon is counted as a full day for him. Therefore, the person who shaves on the 30<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> day can nevertheless count the entire 30<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> day as being part of his mourning period.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, there is a difference; there they permitted in order to honor the holiday. You should know this, since Rebbi Ḥelbo bar Ḥuna said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If his eighth day falls on the Sabbath, he shaves Sabbath eve. If you say that they did not permit in order to honor the holiday, then even if his 30<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> day falls on the Sabbath, he should shave Sabbath eve<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Nobody allows the mourner to shave on the 29th day.

Eleazar’s statement, that the <i>nezirut</i> can be counted as the one covered by his vow, but he objects to the formulation referring to “a sacrifice”, which implies that a <i>nazir</i> can shave and drink wine after one sacrifice. This is R. Simeon’s opinion in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 6:9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.6.9.1">Mishnah 6:11</a>. R. Joḥanan insists that all three sacrifices be brought in order to be valid; this is the opinion of the anonymous majority which in R. Joḥanan’s opinion always defines practice (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:11:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.11.8"><i>Yebamot</i> 4:11, Note 177</a>).</i>.

But did not Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa command the colleagues: If you hear anything formulated by Rebbi Eleazar, you should know that Rebbi Joḥanan disagrees; not unless he brings all his sacrifices. They wanted to say, following the rabbis. But here, we hold with Rebbi Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since the disagreement between R. Eleazar and R.

Rebbi Ḥinena in the name of Rebbi Phineas: Explain it for his <i>nezirut</i> and the <i>nezirut</i> he pledged for his son. In that, the second can be used for the first<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">He rejects the previous explanation and restricts the possibility of substituting the second period for the first to the case that both are occasioned by the birth of a son, one period for himself and one for his son’s birth.

Ḥiyya’s argument is disregarded; both <i>neziriot</i> combined constitute one vow.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, did we not argue about one who said, “I am a <i>nazir</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It had been decided that the substitution of sacrifices was possible only for the person who said, “I am a <i>nazir</i> and <i>nazir</i>.” It would be a reasonable interpretation to say that the second “and <i>nazir</i>” was said for emphasis rather than duplication. Therefore, the second <i>nezirut</i> is a rabbinic obligation, not an original vow, and there should be no discussion of legalistic niceties in this case.</i>? He really should be a <i>nazir</i> only once. You were severe with him and obligated him to be a <i>nazir</i> twice. Is it not enough that you were severe with him and obligated him to be a <i>nazir</i> twice, that now you say, he has nothing in his hands?

Joḥanan interprets this to mean: even in a case where he does not defile himself, because he was defiled before he made the vow, he violates the separate prohibition of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:6" href="/Numbers.6.6">v. 6</a>.</i>? He said to him, if they warned him because of “he shall not come”, he is whipped; because of “he shall not defile himself” he is not whipped<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">He reads the verses as they are written. The <i>nazir</i> can be warned, and is whipped, for an active <i>coming</i> to corpses. But nobody can be whipped for a prohibition formulated in the passive voice.</i>. Rebbi Hila said, Rebbi Joḥanan learned from prostrating, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 2:3.

He wondered following the Sages; it is obvious to him following Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. We have stated about this: If one came, was lying on a couch, and dipped with them, even if he did not eat grain the volume of an olive one ‘invites’ with him, the words of the Sages. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: One never ‘invites’ anyone unless he has eaten grain the volume of an olive. But did we not formulate, “two [eating] bread and one [eating] vegetable, then one ‘invites’?” This <i>baraita</i> follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel.

But a <i>nazir</i> cannot cleanse himself by a purification sacrifice (or, if duly warned by two witnesses, cannot be criminally prosecuted for desecrating his holy status) unless he consumed more than the legal minimum. For most matters of food, the legal minimum is the size of an average olive used for the production of oil (cf. H. Guggenheimer, <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, Northvale 1995, pp. 326–328).

In general, the answer depends on what was unintentional. If a person does not know that today is Sabbath, for all he does wrong he owes one sacrifice.

Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: One does not whip for anything imparting taste except imparting taste for the <i>nazir</i>. [Rebbi Ze‘ira said, one does not whip for anything imparting taste until he tasted the forbidden thing itself]<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Missing here, added from the text in ‘<i>Orlah</i> since it is required by the following text.</i> except the <i>nazir</i> even if he did not taste the forbidden thing itself. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, for food imparting taste what is forbidden and what is permitted is not combined, but for the <i>nazir</i> forbidden and permitted do combine. A <i>baraita</i> supports one and a <i>baraita</i> supports the other. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ze‘ira: If wine in the volume of an olive fell into a dish and he ate from it, he cannot be prosecuted unless he ate the entire dish. In the opinion of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal, if he ate the volume of an olive from it he is guilty. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Abba bar Mamal: “What do we understand when it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:3" href="/Numbers.6.3"><i>Num</i>. 6:3</a>): ‘Anything in which grapes were soaked he shall not eat, and fresh or dried grape berries he shall not eat’?

It means that if he soaked grapes and then soaked his bread in that, if it adds up to the volume of an olive, he is guilty. From here you argue about all prohibitions of the Torah. Since for all that comes from the vine, whose prohibition is neither permanent, nor a prohibition of usufruct, and whose prohibition can be lifted, He made taste like the thing itself; it is logical that for every prohibition of the Torah which is permanent, is a prohibition of usufruct, whose prohibition cannot be lifted, taste is treated like the thing itself. From here, the Sages inferred that everything imparting taste is forbidden.” This is difficult for Rebbi Ze‘ira: you say everywhere “unless he tasted<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The impure <i>nazir</i> cannot restart his vow if he left two hairs uncut. But the requirement of a knife also applies to a pure <i>nazir</i>.</i>”, and here you say, “even if he did not taste.”

A Mishnah states that scalded is called cooked: “Is one who makes a vow to abstain from cooked food permitted roasted and scalded food”? Rebbi Joḥanan said, in matters of vows one follows common usage. Rebbi Joshia said, in matters of vows one follows biblical usage. What is the difference between them? ‘A <i>qônām</i> that I shall not taste wine on Tabernacles.’ In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan he is forbidden on the last day of the holiday. In the opinion of Rebbi Joshia, is he permitted? Rebbi Joshia also agrees that he is prohibited. Rebbi Joshia said it only for restrictions.
Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, Rebbi Joḥanan ate bake-meats and said, I did not taste food on that day. But did we not state: “He who made a vow not to eat food is permitted water and salt”? Explain it following Rebbi Joshia, who said, in matters of vows one follows biblical usage. And from where that everything is called food? Rebbi Aḥa bar Ulla said: “And ten female donkeys carrying grain, bread, and food, etc.” Why does the verse say, “and food”? From here that everything is called food.

Rebbi Assi in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, if they were not raisins, but if they were raisins they are condiments in more than 200.

Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac said to Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Rebbi Yasa disagrees with you and the Mishnah disagrees with both of you: “Anything which sours, flavors, or creates <i>dema</i>‘?

How is this? One says, all sources of flavor by one in 100; the other says, all sources of flavor by one in 60. For him who says all sources of taste by one in 100, you take the foreleg as one in 100 of the ram. For him who says all sources of taste by one in 60, you take the foreleg as one in 60 of the ram. For him who says one in 100, you remove the bones from the foreleg. But if you remove the bones from the foreleg, remove them from the ram!

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The High Priest and the <i>nazir</i> do not defile themselves for their relatives<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The High Priest is forbidden to defile himself even for father or mother, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:11" href="/Leviticus.21.11"><i>Lev</i>. 21:11</a>; the same holds for the <i>nazir</i>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:7" href="/Numbers.6.7"><i>Num</i>. 6:7</a>. In the Babli and many Mishnah mss. (but not in Maimonides’s autograph) there is an additional clause: “but they have to defile themselves for a corpse of obligation”, i. e., an abandoned corpse of whose burial nobody is taking care. The first person finding the body has to bury him.</i>. If they were walking on a road and found a corpse of obligation, Rebbi Eliezer says, the High Priest<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Even the High Priest, and certainly a common priest. Similarly, the Sages require that the <i>nazir</i> defile himself but not a common priest if they stumble on the corpse together.</i> shall defile himself but the <i>nazir</i> shall not defile himself. But the Sages say, the <i>nazir</i> shall defile himself but the High Priest shall not defile himself. Rebbi Eliezer said to them, the Priest shall defile himself, who does not bring a sacrifice for his defilement, but the <i>nazir</i> shall not defile himself, who has to bring a sacrifice for his defilement. They told him, the <i>nazir</i> shall defile himself, whose holiness is temporary, but the Priest shall not defile himself, whose holiness is permanent.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The High Priest and the <i>nazir</i>,” etc. It is written: “He shall not go close to a dead body.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:11" href="/Leviticus.21.11"><i>Lev</i>. 21:11</a>, speaking of the High Priest.

If it cannot refer to non-relatives, refer it to relatives. It is written: “Not to go close to a dead body,” and you say so? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said, from here repeated prohibitions in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In his opinion, the High Priest who defiles himself for a corpse violates two identical prohibitions.</i>. But it is to permit the corpse of obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the rule that “an exclusion on top of an exclusion means an inclusion.” Since in general a Cohen is forbidden to defile himself for the dead, the repetition of the prohibition for the High Priest indicates an obligation to defile himself in some cases. Since father and mother, for whom defilement is commanded to the common priest, are forbidden to the High Priest, the corpse for whom the High Priest (and by implication, any priest) has to defile himself is a non-relative, the corpse of obligation.</i>. Some understand it from the following: “<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:4" href="/Leviticus.21.4"><i>Lev</i>. 21:4</a>.</i> The man shall not defile himself, in the midst of his people” he may not defile himself<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If other Jews are present who may bury the dead, he may not defile himself.

Anybody not warned about blasphemy is not warned about a corpse of obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This means that the details of the rules for burials apply only to Jews to whom the details of the rules of blasphemy apply.</i>.

A biblical commandment which is both positive and negative is the strongest of all commandments and will supersede opposing simple positive or simple negative commandments (Babli <i>Yom Ṭob</i> 8b, severely restricted in <i>Yebamot</i> 3b/4a) if written in the same verse (Yerushalmi <i>Yom Ṭob</i> 1:3, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 2:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.2.1.5"><i>Ḥallah</i> 2:1, Note 10</a>, unrestricted).</i>. From where do you add the sword he was killed with, the gallows on which he was hanged, the towel with which he was strangled? Why does the verse say, “you shall bury him”? I could think he alone is buried; the verse says “bury, you shall bury him”, a burial for him, and his gallows, and his stone<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 45b" href="/Sanhedrin.45b">Babli, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 45b</a>.</i>. How does one do it? One digs down three [handbreadths], so the plough shall not unearth him. “You shall bury him”, whole and not partially. “You shall bury him”, from here that if he left anything [unburied], he did not do anything, for it is said “bury, you shall bury him”. From here that it is not a corpse of obligation unless it consists of his head with most of the body.
Rebbi Yasa stated before Rebbi Joḥanan: Just as one defiles himself for a corpse of obligation, so one defiles himself for a limb of a corpse of obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This contradicts the preceding statement.</i>.

When Yehudinai, the sister of Rebbi Judah the Prince, died, Rebbi Ḥanina sent for Rebbi Mana but the latter did not come. He said to him, if one does not defile himself for them during their lifetime, so much less in their death. Rebbi Nassa said, in their death they treated them like a corpse of obligation.
May a Cohen defile himself for the honor of his teacher? The father-in-law of Rebbi Yannai the Younger died. He was both his father-in-law and his teacher. He asked Rebbi Yose who forbade it. Rebbi Ḥama (?) heard it and said: His students should defile themselves for him. The students [of Rebbi Yose]<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">From the text in <i>Berakhot</i>, required by the context.</i> defiled themselves for him but ate meat and drank wine. Rebbi Mana told them: One of two things you cannot escape. If you are mourners, why did you eat meat and drink wine; if you are not mourners, why did you defile yourselves?
May a Cohen defile himself for the study of Torah? Rebbi Yose was sitting and teaching when a dead body was brought in. He did not say anything either to those who remained sitting or to those who left.
Rebbi Nihumi the son of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: My father did not walk under the arch of Caesarea. Rebbi Ammi walked. Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Cohen and Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa went walking in the streets of Caesarea. They came to the arch and Rebbi Cohen left. They reached a place of purity and he returned to them. He asked them: “What were you discussing?” Rebbi Ḥizqiah said to Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa: “Do not tell him anything!” We do not know whether it was because he was angry that he left since one defiles oneself for words of Torah or whether it was because he was haughty.
It is stated: A Cohen may defile himself by leaving the Land for civil and criminal suits, for the consecration of the New Moon and intercalation  of a year, to redeem a field from a Gentile, to study Torah, and to marry a wife. Rebbi Judah says, if he has a place to study, he should not defile himself. Rebbi Yose says, even if he has a place to study, he may defile himself, since a man may not have the luck to learn from every teacher. They said about Joseph the Cohen that he followed his teacher and defiled himself following his teacher to Sidon. In truth, they said a priest should not go abroad unless one promised him a wife.
May a (High) Priest defile himself for the lifting of hands? Gabilah, the brother of Rebbi Abba bar Cohen said before Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: A Cohen defiles himself for the lifting of hands. Rebbi Aḥa heard it and said: I never told him anything. On second thoughts he said, maybe he heard from me what Rebbi Jehudah ben Pazi said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Every Cohen who stays in the synagogue and does not lift his hands transgresses a positive commandment, and he wanted to say that a positive commandment supersedes a negative commandment. I never told him anything. Bring him in and I will flog him!
Rebbi Abbahu was sitting teaching in the fortified synagogue in Caesarea; there was a coffin there. There came the time for lifting the hands and they did not ask him. There came the time for eating and they asked him. He said to them: For the lifting of hands you did not ask me, for eating you are asking me? When they heard this, each one was taking himself away and fled.
Rebbi Yannai said: A Cohen defiles himself in order to see the King. When King Diocletian visited here, Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba was seen stepping over graves at Tyre in order to see him. Rebbi Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: There is an obligation to see great persons of government, so that when the kingdom of the dynasty of David will return one will know how to distinguish one government from the other.
May [a Cohen] defile himself in honor of his father and mother? Rebbi Yasa heard that his mother had come to Bostra. He went and asked Rebbi Yoḥanan, may I leave? He said to him, if it is because of danger on the road, leave. If it is in order to honor your mother, I do not know. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, Rebbi Yoḥanan still needs to answer. He importuned him, so he said: Since you decided to go, return in peace. Rebbi Eleazar heard this and said: there is no greater permission than that.
May a (person) [Cohen] defile himself in honor of the public? It is stated: When there are two acceptable roads, one long and pure, the other one short and impure: If the public was walking on the long one, he goes on the long one; otherwise, he goes on the short one in honor of the public. That refers to impurity by their words; also for impurity that is from the words of the Torah? From what Rebbi Zeïra said, so great is the honor of the public that it temporarily pushes aside a prohibition, that means even impurity that is from the words of the Torah.
Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Yose the Galilean, in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: One does not ask rulings on practice before the bier of a deceased. But Rebbi Yoḥanan asked Rebbi Yannai before the bier of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoẓadaq about him who dedicated his elevation sacrifice for the upkeep of the Sanctuary, and he answered him! Let us say when they were bringing him to the study hall. But Rebbi Jeremiah asked Rebbi Zeïra before the bier of (Rebbi Simeon and) Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac! Let us say that he answered him when he was far away; when he was close he did not answer him.
It is stated: The carriers may not wear sandals lest a shoelace of one of them break so he would be prevented from performing a good deed.
Rebbi Zeïra bent down during a eulogy. They wanted to straighten him up and found that he tarried. They said to him, what is this? He said to them, because we will go there, following (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 7:2" href="/Ecclesiastes.7.2"><i>Eccl</i>. 7:2</a>): “Let the one who is alive take it to heart.”

But if the power of the slave to vow as <i>nazir</i> be rabbinical, then there can be no biblical punishment for infraction. On this R. Mana notes that quasi-biblical status is not biblical status, and biblical punishment for non-biblical infractions (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:4" href="/Deuteronomy.25.4"><i>Deut</i>. 25:4</a>) is impossible.<br>Therefore, the question is rephrased: If the power of the slave to enter into a state of <i>nazir</i> is biblical but the power of the master to force him to disregard his vow is only from practice, should the slave not be subject to prosecution for infringing his vow? The question is not to be taken seriously; it rather points out a logical inconsistency between the rule which allows the slave to become a <i>nazir</i> and the rule which allows the master to override, but not abolish, that vow.</i>.

We came to the disagreement between Rebbi Meїr and Rebbi Yose: “If [the slave] is not in the presence of his master, Rebbi Meїr says, he cannot drink, but Rebbi Yose says, he may drink.” Where do we hold? If he told him, drink whether in my presence or not in my presence, even Rebbi Meїr will agree. If he told him, drink in my presence, do not drink in my absence, even Rebbi Yose will agree.

In the present paragraph, the main text is missing. Both for the person going to celebrate the Passover sacrifice and the <i>nazir</i> who finished his term, the impurity caused by a doubtful case of a grave in the abyss is disregarded. In view of the central role of purity in everything connected with the Sanctuary, it is obvious that some biblical justification has to be found for the rule. In the case of Passover, the argument notes that the verse could have stated that a person “on a far trip” was required to celebrate the Second Passover. The addition “for you” seems to be superfluous. It is interpreted to mean just as the road is open to the wanderer, so the impurity has to be in the open for the impure person.

So far for the people celebrating Passover. From where the <i>nazir</i>? Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi [Yannai]: “If a person dies suddenly on him”. Since on him it is in the open, so everything in the open. This eliminates the grave in the abyss which is not in the open.
