What is an example? Someone was cutting meat and laid the knife on his hand. Would he in turn cut the other hand?
(Leviticus 19:18) "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Rabbi Akiva says: This is the great principal of the Torah. Ben Azzai says: (Genesis 5:1) "This is the book of the generations of Adam" is the great principal of the Torah. 
(Mishnah Nedarim 9:4) "Maybe he will become poor and you will not be able to support him?" Rabbi Zeira said: Poverty is frequent. There was once a man with a case against a wealthy man, which came before Rav for judgment. Rav sent after him [the wealthy man]. He said, "For him I am asked to come for judgment? Even if all the camels of Arabia came together, they could not carry the bolts of my treasures." Rav heard this and said, "Is he so proud of what is not his? May his wealth be reduced." Just then an order was issued by the king that he and whatever belonged to him should be relinquished to the treasury. He came to Rav and said to him, "Pray for me, that he will return my soul [i.e., let me live]." He prayed for him and he gave him back his life.
