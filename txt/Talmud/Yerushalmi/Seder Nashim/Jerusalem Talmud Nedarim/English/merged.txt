Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> All substitute names<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since vows and oaths are sacral acts, the invocation of vow or oath is automatically the invocation of God’s Name. Just as God’s Name should not be invoked in vain, the people shied away from using the expressions “vow, making a vow” or “oath, swearing”. As explained in the next Note, one of the oblique references to a vow was the word <i>qorbān</i> and its substitute, as given in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>.</i> of vows<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Making a vow is taking on an obligation. There are three kinds of vows found in talmudic literature.<br>A person may vow to bring a sacrifice or to give a certain sum to the Temple. This is a relatively simple matter since (Mishnah <i>Qiddšin</i> 1:6) “speaking to Higher Powers is like delivering to a human”; i. e., a promise to God is as final as delivering the merchandise in a commercial transaction. Therefore, these vows are only a minor topic in the present tractate.<br>A person may make a vow to become a <i>nazir</i> for a certain time; then he is required to abstain from grapes and grape products as well as from becoming impure by the impurity of the dead, and he must let his hair grow. This kind of vow is discussed in Tractate <i>Nazir.</i><br>The main topic of Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> is “any vow or oath of prohibition to deprive oneself” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:14" href="/Numbers.30.14"><i>Num.</i> 30:14</a>), i. e., a vow in which a person for any reason prohibits to himself things which otherwise are permitted. One may also make a vow to forbid certain actions to oneself but the actions must be forbidden as things are forbidden. (Self-flagellation is forbidden in Judaism since inflicting any wound on oneself is forbidden except for medical purposes, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 8:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.8.4.1">Mishnah <i>Baba qama</i> 8:5</a>.) Since an animal which was dedicated as a sacrifice is forbidden for any profane use, it became general practice to say about anything of which one wanted to prohibit all use for himself “this is <i>qorbān</i> for me”, or simply <i>qorbān</i> “sacrifice”. Therefore, if in <i>Math.</i> 15:5 it is noted that a son can say to his parents that all he possesses should be <i>qorbān</i> for them; on the surface it is the height of mistreatment of the parents if the son prohibits them any use whatsoever of his property and even prohibits himself to help his parents in any way. The rabbinic answer would be that if the son goes off to fight as a guerilla against the Romans, or the Herodian government, cutting off all ties might save his parents’ property from confiscation. (Cf. <i>Peah</i> 1:1, Note 113, about the unpredictability of the duty to honor father and mother: “Somebody might serve his father fattened meat and go to hell; another might bind his father to the grindstone and go to paradise.”) The vow could also be in error, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.3.2.1">Mishnah 3:2</a>. Chapter 4 shows that a person forbidding his property to another can nevertheless take care of that other person. Cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 9:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.9.1.8">Chapter 9, Note 38</a>.<br>{In <i>Math.</i> 15:5, Jesus complains that Pharisees declare a person free from prosecution (פָּטוּר) if he violates the commandment to honor and fear father and mother by maliciously forbidding his property to them. The pharisaic rule in question is that “a prohibition violated without an action is not prosecutable” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 63" href="/Sanhedrin.63">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i> 63a/b</a>). Speech is not counted as an action in this respect. The rule is opposed by R. Jehudah who in many cases represents older traditions (from his father’s teacher R. Eliezer.) The testimony of <i>Math</i>. shows that in this case, the majority opinion is the historic position. R. Jehudah’s position is that of the Qumran community in the Manual of Discipline and the Damascus Document.}</i> are like vows, of bans<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">“Ban” is the irrevocable gift of property to the Temple, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:28" href="/Leviticus.27.28"><i>Lev</i>. 27:28</a>.</i> like bans, of oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">An oath is subject-related, in contrast to a vow which is object-related. If a person prohibits himself to eat any bread, that is an oath of deprivation. If he prohibits the use of a specified loaf, or even any loaf, on himself, that is a vow of deprivation.</i> like oaths, of <i>nazir vows</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">While this is also a vow of deprivation it follows its own rules, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:1-21" href="/Numbers.6.1-21"><i>Num</i>. 6:1–21</a>.</i> like <i>nazir</i> vows. If one says to another, I am vowed away from you<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the detailed explanation of what substitute names are. All expressions in this sentence are examples of נדר הנאה “a vow [to forbid] usufruct”, in which A tells B that all of B’s property is forbidden to A as if it were a sacrifice or sacred property and A’s property to B..</i>, I am separated from you, I am distanced from you, that I will not eat from yours, that I will not taste from yours, he is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">All of B’s property, not only his food.</i>. I am excommunicated from you, Rabbi Aqiba was stringent in that because of a doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">R. Aqiba decided that, while the exact meaning of “excommunicated” in this context is unknown since the use of a judicial term by a private person is inappropriate, the most extensive interpretation must be adopted.</i>. As vows of the wicked, he vowed as <i>nazir,</i> a sacrifice, and an oath<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is very elliptic. Since the <i>nazir</i> prohibits vines and all their products for himself and he needs atonement for his status (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:11" href="/Numbers.6.11"><i>Num</i>. 6:11</a>) one concludes (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:2-3:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.2-3.7"><i>Nedarim</i> 1:1</a>, 36d 1. 50; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 10a" href="/Nedarim.10a">Babli 10a</a>) that it is essentially sinful to deprive oneself from permitted enjoyments. It follows that just people do not make vows of deprivation or <i>nezirut</i>. They also do not make vows of sacrifices since such a vow implies that the person will be financially responsible until a correct sacrifice has been presented in the Temple. Responsible people offer free-will gifts in which they designate an animal as sacrifice; if anything should happen to that animal before it is sacrificed he is not obligated to offer a replacement.<br>Since the wicked do make vows and swear, any expression of vow or oath declared to be in the form used by the wicked has to be interpreted to imply a maximum obligation. Still, somebody who simply says that he makes a vow of the wicked is not obligated for anything unless some object on which the vow could fall was before him at that moment. For example, if a loaf of bread was before him and he said, this loaf is for me as a vow of the wicked, he is forbidden to eat that loaf. If a long-haired <i>nazir</i> was passing before him and he said, that is for me as a vow of the wicked, he is a <i>nazir</i> for the standard period of 30 days.</i>. As vows of the good ones, he did not say anything<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since good people do not make vows nor do they swear.</i>. As their freewill gifts<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody said, this loaf of bread is to me as a free-will gift of a just person, he means that for him it is <i>qorbān</i> and therefore forbidden for all usufruct. Similarly, if a long-haired <i>nazir</i> was passing before him and he said, that is for me as a free-will gift of the just, he is a <i>nazir</i> for the standard period of 30 days.</i>, he made a vow of <i>nazir</i> and sacrifice.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “All substitute names of vows are like vows,” etc. It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:3" href="/Numbers.30.3"><i>Num.</i> 30:3</a>.</i> “Any person who vows,” why does the verse say “a vow”? From here that substitute names of vows are like vows. “Or he swears,” why does the verse say “an oath”? From here that substitute names of oaths are like oaths. “But any ban,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:28" href="/Leviticus.27.28"><i>Lev.</i> 27:28</a>.</i>” why does the verse say “which he bans”? From here that substitute names of bans are like bans. “A vow of <i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:2" href="/Numbers.6.2"><i>Num.</i> 6:2</a>.</i>”, why does the verse say “to be a <i>nazir</i>”? From here that substitute names of <i>nazir</i> vows are like <i>nazir</i> vows. So far for Rebbi Aqiba who says that these are expressions of additions. <sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 8:1:12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.8.1.12"><i>Yebamot</i> 8:1, Note 72</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 27a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.27a">Babli <i>Avodah zarah</i> 27a</a> (and another 18 times without attribution). The quotes are from speeches of Laban and Joseph in <i>Gen</i>. which have no legal implications. This proves that the repetitions are a matter of style.</i> For Rebbi Ismael who said, these are double expressions in the normal style of the Torah, “going you went, desiring you desired, by stealing I was stolen”, from where? “<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:3" href="/Numbers.30.3"><i>Num.</i> 30:3</a>.</i> Any person who vows a vow to the Eternal or swears an oath to forbid a prohibition on himself shall not profane his word,” why does the verse say “he must fulfill anything coming out of his mouth”? From here that substitute names of vows are like vows and substitute names of oaths are like oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The second half of the verse is clearly written for emphasis. It implies (a) that a vow is valid only if pronounced, not if only thought of and (b) that any speech which can be interpreted as a vow is a vow.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 3" href="/Nedarim.3">Babli, 3a/b</a>, quotes both the argument in the style of R. Aqiba and that of R. Ismael without mentioning any names.</i>. And from where that substitute names of bans are like bans? “A vow, a vow”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is an application of the second hermeneutical rule of <i>gezerah šawah</i> “equal cut”. If it was established in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:3" href="/Numbers.30.3"><i>Num</i>. 30:3</a> that “vow” means “anything that implies a vow” and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:2" href="/Leviticus.27.2"><i>Lev</i>. 27:2</a> any dedication to the Temple, including bans, is classified as “vow”, it follows that anything which implies a ban is a ban.</i>. Since “a vow” at one place means that substitute names of vows are like vows and substitute names of oaths are like oaths, “a vow” at the other place means that substitute names of bans are like bans. And from where that substitute names of being a <i>nazir</i> are like being a <i>nazir</i>? “A vow, a vow”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Again this is an application of <i>gezerah šawah</i>, but this time the reference quote is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:2" href="/Numbers.6.2"><i>Num</i>. 6:2</a>, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:14" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.14">Note 14</a>.</i>. Since “a vow” at one place means that substitute names of oaths are like oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This reference is odd since the argument is about vows, not oaths. One has to assume that the scribe left out the relevant portion of the sentence which should be identical to the one used in the preceding case.</i>, “a vow” at the other place means that substitute names of being a <i>nazir</i> are like being a <i>nazir</i>.
How does Rebbi Aqiba explain “he must fulfill anything coming out of his mouth”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">If a vow cannot be fulfilled completely, it is not a vow.</i>? From here that if part of a vow is invalid, all of it is invalid. Does Rebbi Ismael not agree with this? Everything derives from there. It follows from there that substitute names of vows are like vows and substitute names of oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">That conclusion could have been drawn even if the word כל “all, anything” were not written. Therefore, the clause admits two conclusions independent of one another.</i> are like oaths and it follows from there that if part of a vow is invalid, all of it is invalid. How does Rebbi Ismael explain “any person who vows a vow of <i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:2" href="/Numbers.6.2"><i>Num.</i> 6:2</a>.</i>”? From there that a person can obligate himself as <i>nazir</i> while he currently is a <i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The pentateuchal state of <i>nazir</i> is always limited in time (when a Temple is in existence. Since a <i>nazir</i> is only permitted to drink wine after he has absolved the required Temple ritual, a person vowing to be a <i>nazir</i> today must remain in that state until the Temple is rebuilt and officiating Cohanim are found who have complete documentary proof of their priestly status going back to the priests officiating in the second Temple.) The prophetic state of <i>nazir</i>, as exemplified by Simson and Samuel, is unlimited but does not include a prohibition of the impurity of the dead. It is noted here that while a person is in the state of a <i>nazir</i> for a fixed period, he can undertake to be a <i>nazir</i> for an additional period, to begin after the Temple procedure for the current <i>nezirut</i> was performed. This statement is needed since the vow of <i>nazir</i> of an unincumbered person makes that person a <i>nazir</i> immediately upon pronouncing his vow.</i>. Does  Rebbi Aqiba not agree with this? He agrees and everything derives from there<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The same verse.</i>. He agrees that from there a person can obligate himself as <i>nazir</i> while he currently is a <i>nazir</i>.

Therefore, substitute names which are in common use are as effective as the explicit mention of the word “ban”. But if an unspecified ban is intended for Cohanim (the majority opinion in Mishnah ‘<i>Arakhin</i> 8:6), the collection of the gift is a money transaction between Cohanim and the giver, subject to the rule that “the proof is on the claimant” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 3:8:2-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.3.8.2-8"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:9</a>, 21b 1. 70; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 46b" href="/Bava_Kamma.46b">Babli <i>Baba qama</i> 46b</a>). The Cohanim would have to prove that the putative giver in his use of the substitute words really did intend to refer to bans. This proof seems almost impossible. Therefore, substitute bans could not be like bans and the Mishnah here must be interpreted as supporting the opinion that unspecified bans are for the Temple.</i>.

Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Eleazar disagree, for Rebbi Joḥanan said, one whips for prohibitions<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Somebody forbade something for himself without using the language either of vows or of oaths or any of the recognized substitute expressions.

Rebbi Jeremiah said, there is a difference there because of the ways of peace<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">“Ways of peace” are the obligations of interpersonal relationships necessary in a civilized society; in this case, visiting the sick.</i>.

But if he swears that he will not fulfill his religious obligations, the oath is invalid since, in the language of the Babli, “he already is under oath from Mount Sinai”, and a valid oath cannot be superseded by another oath. Since visiting the sick is a religious obligation, if the prohibition of usufruct is interpreted as an oath it should be nonexistent in the case of a visit to a sick person.

Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.1">Note 1</a>.</i>, or <i>qônāḥ,</i> or <i>qônās,</i> these are substitute names for <i>qorbān. Ḥēreq, ḥērek, ḥēreph,</i> these are substitute names for ban. <i>Nāzîq, nāzîaḥ, pāzîaḥ,</i> these are substitute names for <i>nazir.

While the difference between vow and oath is important in rabbinic law, people in everyday speech do not make these fine distinctions. If the verb is an expression of making a vow but the noun is “oath”, the entire sentence has to be interpreted as being an oath.</i>, these are substitute names for an oath.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody says <i>qônām,</i> or <i>qônāḥ,</i>” etc. So far for himself. Can one dedicate to Heaven by saying <i>qônām</i><sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Can one dedicate property to the Temple using the expression <i>qônām</i> or any other of the recognized substitutes for <i>qorbān?</i></i>? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">There exists a Babylonian version of this <i>baraita,</i> <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 35a" href="/Nedarim.35a">Babli 35a</a> and in abbreviated form <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Nedarim (Lieberman) 4:6" href="/Tosefta_Nedarim_(Lieberman).4.6">Tosephta 4:6</a>. The Babylonian version differs from the Yerushalmi in that the lender asserts that he has only one spade which he needs for himself and only asserts that he has no spare and, most importantly, that the lying lender’s property is only forbidden to him during his lifetime but becomes the property of his heir while in the Yerushalmi the property becomes the Temple’s. Therefore, the position of the Babli is opposed to that of the Yerushalmi and every attempt to emend and explain the Yerushalmi in the light of the Babli falsifies the text.</i>: One said to another, lend me your spade<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">In modern Hebrew, קרדום is an axe. But in Mishnaic Hebrew it means “spade” as shown by the formulaic expression קרדום לחפור בו “a <i>qardom</i> used for digging.”</i>. He said, <i>qônām</i> the spade if I have it, <i>qônām</i> my property on me. If he has a spade, his property would be forbidden for this one “has no spade”<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">He made a conditional vow. The vow must refer to an object. If he has no spade, there is nothing the vow refers to, and the vow is nonexistent. But should he have a spade, the vow refers to an object and is valid.</i>. Rebbi Taḥlifa from Caesarea said, there is a difference, for he used the same expression to attach the spade and to attach his property<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">As described in detail now, the two vows are one and both refer to the spade.</i>. As you look at it, if the spade is sanctified, so is his property. If the spade is not sanctified, neither is his property. If he said, <i>qônām</i> the spade if I have it, and added <i>qônām</i> my property on me, if he owns a spade, his property is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">To himself, but not to any other person in the world.</i>. That is correct. Rebbi Joshua ben Ḥananiah said, if he had said “my property”<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Without repeating the word <i>qônām,</i> or any equivalent expression, there is no vow.</i>, it would be permitted for he stopped. That is correct. He only asserted that the person had no spade. Therefore, if he has a spade, his property is forbidden. That means that the spade was sanctified. That means that the property was sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joshua ben Ḥanania holds that the property is permanently forbidden to everyone, including the heirs, and must be surrendered to the Temple administrator. This proves that <i>qônām</i> is as valid for dedications as <i>qorbān.</i></i>. This means that a person may dedicate to Heaven using the expression <i>qônām.</i>
Rebbi Jeremiah asked: May a person bind himself by a word which has both a profane and a sacral meaning? Did we not state קוֹנָס? Its name is קונסה<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Which word is intended is not quite clear. The early commentators vote for קְנָס “a fine”; then קוּנְסָה could be a stand-in for קְנָסָא. Another possibility would be קִינְסָא “a chip”. There is no problem in asserting that קוֹנָס is used only for vows. Note Arabic قّونّس “point of the helmet”.</i>. Did we not state שְּׁבוּתָה? Its name is שְׁפוּתָה<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">“Cooking”. It also could be a word שפתא <i>[Tanḥuma Re’e</i> (5) “a bench”.] This is another example to show that in Galilee, under the influence of Greek, β was /v/ and /v/ close to /f/.</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the paragraph, the text is also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 1:1:2-9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.1.1.2-9"><i>Nazir</i> 1:1</a>, 51a 1. 52.</i> But did not Bar Qappara state <i>ḥeres</i><sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">In Mishnaic Hebrew the word usually means “potsherd”, which certainly is not coming close to the meaning “ban” for which it may be substituted according to Bar Qappara.

Rebbi Ze‘ira said, that is a name relating to the High One: <sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Job 9:7" href="/Job.9.7"><i>Job</i> 9:7</a>.</i>“If He commands the sun: would it not shine?”. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, these are Gentile words<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The Yerushalmi is inconsistent in its attribution. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 1:1:2-9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.1.1.2-9"><i>Nazir</i> 1:1</a> (and the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 10a" href="/Nedarim.10a">Babli 10a</a>), R. Joḥanan is reported to hold that the substitutes are words from foreign languages whereas R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that they are artificial words created by the Sages to avoid using Hebrew sacral words. In the latter case it would be obvious that only officially sanctioned words may be used.</i>, like those Nabateans who say <i>khaspa</i> for <i>ḥaspa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">They cannot distinguish between ح and خ.</i><i>.</i> Rebbi Yose said, it is reasonable in other places, but in a place where the <i>nazir</i> is called <i>naziq</i><sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Where ר is not a dental sound but close to a French /r/, which may be confounded with ق or غ.

Why is the invocation of Saul’s name not a form of oath. In the verse quoted, the meaning of “imposing a curse by an oath” is clear and undisputed. There is no answer, probably because religious fear was never connected with the name of Saul. It is noteworthy that all through proto-Mishnaic, Mishnaic, and Talmudic periods the name Moses is not used for living persons; there are a few appearences of a substitute name such as Maishe.</i>”? By my right hand, that is a vow, by my left hand, that is a vow<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 10b" href="/Nedarim.10b">Babli, 10b</a>, only “right hand” is accepted.</i>.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Not profane I shall not eat from yours, not usable, not pure, pure, or impure, leftover, or mushy, is forbidden. Like a sheep, like the storage places, like wood, like altar gifts, like the altar, like the Temple, like Jerusalem. If one made a vow by one of the serving pieces of the altar even though he did not mention “sacrifice”, it is as if he made a vow by the sacrifice. Rebbi Jehudah says, he who says “Jerusalem” did not say anything<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah enumerates substitute terms for <i>qorbān</i> in making an oath which forbids the use of certain things to the maker of the vow. Most details are explained in the Halakhah. “Leftover” are the leftovers of a valid sacrifice after the time allotted for its consumption; this is forbidden both as a sacrifice and as leftover. “Mushy” is the biblical term for a sacrifice which was brought from the start with the idea that it should be eaten out of its time and/or its place. This also is doubly forbidden.<br>An extended list of substitute expressions is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Nedarim (Lieberman) 1:3" href="/Tosefta_Nedarim_(Lieberman).1.3">Tosephta, 1:3</a> (partially quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 13a" href="/Nedarim.13a">Babli, 13a</a>).</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Not profane I shall not eat from yours,” etc. That which I would eat from you shall not be profane but a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">The same explanation in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 11a" href="/Nedarim.11a">Babli, 11a</a>.</i>.
“Not usable” for me but it is for the altar.
“Not pure,” for me but it is for the altar.
“Pure,” for the altar but not for me.
“Impure,” for me but [pure] for the altar. 
“Mushy”. There is no difference whether mushy for an elevation offering or mushy for a well-being offering<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The elevation offering is totally burned on the altar; no part of it is eaten. Nevertheless, there is a time limit on the sacrifice; it must be burned on the altar during the day it was slaughtered and the following night. If the blood was received by the officiating Cohen with the idea of burning the sacrifice the next day, the sacrifice itself becomes forbidden as mushy. The well-being offering can be eaten for two days and the intervening night or, for a thanksgiving offering, the day and the following night; but if its blood is brought to the altar with the idea of eating from the sacrifice when mushy, immediately it is permanently forbidden.</i>. The leftover of an elevation offering [never]<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that the scribe switched “had” and “did not have” between elevation and well-being offerings. Since the elevation offering never was permitted to anybody, it was forbidden to use it while it was a sacrifice and it remained forbidden as leftover after its time had expired. Therefore, “leftover from an elevation sacrifice” is a thing which is permanently forbidden. Used in a vow formula it implies permanent prohibition.</i> had a time when it was usable, the leftover of an elevation offering (never) had a time when it was usable<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Since a well-being offering can be eaten for some time by the offerer and his family and the prohibition of “leftover” is one after the fact, if somebody refers to food as “leftover from a well-being offering” it is unclear whether one refers to the time it was permitted or when it was forbidden. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 12a" href="/Nedarim.12a">Babli (12a</a>) takes it for granted that “leftover” as object of a vow can only refer to leftover from an elevation offering, implicitly answering the open question of the Yerushalmi.</i>. If he said, this is for me as a leftover of a well-being offering, what is it?
“Like a sheep.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, like the sheep of the daily offering<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The most common sacrifice, a natural substitute for <i>qorbān.</i> In that case, one should read כָּאִימְרָא. The statements are quoted in <i>Gen. rabba</i>56(14).</i>. There, they say, like the young of a purification offering<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">The purification offering of a common person is a female animal. If she gives birth after dedication, the lamb is totally forbidden; it cannot be used for anything and nothing can be done for it. What the rabbis there (Babylonia) assert is that a substitute for <i>qorbān</i> can be something which is forbidden even to the altar (and so could be considered as the opposite of <i>qorbān</i>). This opinion is not mentioned in the Babli.</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, like our father Abraham’s ram<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber.</i> 22:13. This was a sacrifice on an altar; one reads כְּאִימְרָא.</i>. What Rebbi Ḥiyya<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Gen. rabba,</i> this is attributed to Bar Qappara. In one opinion, the ram was created at the end of the Sixth Day of Creation [Mishnah <i>Abot</i> 5(9)].</i> stated supports Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Like a sheep which never suckled. Following the opinions of the rabbis there, one could state: Like the Temple courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">This also is forbidden for profane use and is not a sacrifice.</i>. Rebbi Abin said, following the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish one could state: Like the sacrifices on the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See next paragraph.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Abun said, following Rebbi Joḥanan one could state: Like the cleansing of the inner altar and the candelabra<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">This really refers to the statement that one may make a vow by referring to the serving pieces of the altar. R. Joḥanan prefers that one make the vow by something which is served daily.</i>.
“Like the storage places,” like the storage places of wood, like the storage places of sacrificial animals<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The storage place for altar wood was in the Temple courtyard, where wood was checked for worms (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Middot 2:5" href="/Mishnah_Middot.2.5">Mishnah <i>Middot</i> 2:5</a>).

But fire is not anything a vow can fall on. The same problem arises with the last three terms which cannot represent <i>qorbān</i>, but only the place of the <i>qorbān</i>.</i>. “Like the altar,” like the sacrifices on the altar. “Like the Temple hall,” like the sacrifices in the Temple hall<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The daily incense and the blood of those special sacrifices whose blood has to be sprinkled on the incense altar.</i>.

A says to B, swear that you have no wheat, barley, and spelt of mine, and B says Amen. If it turns out that he swore falsely, he is guilty of one crime. R. Simeon says, if he swore correctly about the wheat, he cannot be prosecuted for swearing falsely about barley and spelt since an oath (and a vow) which is partially voided is totally voided.</i>.

Yose’s question, nothing is forbidden when the second and third oaths are pronounced; therefore, they all are valid and with one act the person who then eats the loaf commits three sins in one act.<br>The second, not very likely, explanation, by R. Moses Margalit, assumes that many loaves are before the person when he makes the multiple oath and one may assume that each single oath refers to a different loaf.

Rebbi Yudan said, since we have stated: “this is for me like salted meat<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the <i>baraita,</i> that is meat dipped twice in salt.</i>, like libation wine,” this imples that short-term salted is called “salted”.

“This is for me like heave, if Temple heave, he is forbidden,” therefore ‘heave of thanksgiving’ is permitted. “If heave from the threshing floor, he is permitted,” therefore ‘heave of thanksgiving’ is forbidden. Here you say, forbidden; there, you say, permitted.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Four kinds of vows did the Sages dissolve: Speeding-up vows, exaggeration vows, vows in error, and vows about acts of God<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These will all be explained in the Mishnah.</i>. What are speeding-up vows? One who has something to sell says, a <i>qônām</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this form, the vow is void and does not have to be dissolved since it is not indicated to what it refers. One has to assume that the vendor says the money received for the sale shall be <i>qônām</i> if I sell for less.</i> that I shall not reduce the price below a tetradrachma, and the other one says, a <i>qônām</i> that I shall not increase my bid to more than a sheqel; both of them intend three denarii<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A tetradrachma is 4 denarii, a sheqel 2.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Four kinds of vows did the Sages dissolve,” etc. Do not the Sages permit all kinds of vows?

This is the only argument accepted in the Babli.</i>: “He shall not profane his word.” <i>He</i> cannot profane his word; this implies that others can profane his words. Who is that? That is the Sage who dissolves the vow.

(Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 3:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.3.1.3">Note 17</a>.)</i>.
Rebbi Immi said, who is the Tanna of speeding-up vows? Rebbi Tarphon<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">He says in Mishnah and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 5:3:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.5.3.2-4">Halakhah <i>Nazir</i> 5:5</a>, and in Tosephta <i>Nazir</i> 3:19 R.

He who says “one who wants” supports Rebbi Abba<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The first part refers to people who intend to change their mind but it implies nothing for R.

So is the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This language is somewhat unexpected since it usually introduces an emendation of the Mishnah.</i>: “Any vow which I make in the future shall be void, [it is void] if he remembers at the moment he makes the vow,” if he did not stipulate a reservation<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">If a person stipulates expressly that his vows shall be void even if he does not remember that stipulation at the moment of the vow, the stipulation is valid and active.</i>. But if he stipulated a reservation, then even if he does not remember. That is for vows; but for oaths? There are reservations for vows, there are no reservations for oaths, as it was stated about oaths imposed by judges<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Text from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:1:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.7.1.7"><i>Soṭah</i> 7:1, Note 27</a>.</i>: “According to our understanding, not according to your understanding.” Rebbi Jehudah said, he makes him swear according to his understanding. Why does he stipulate with him? Because of the uneducated, lest they say that there may be mental reservations for oaths.

But if it was because of the robber, he is obligated to give him another field. If a river washed it away, he may say to him: Here is yours before you.”<br>Somebody took real estate from another by threats and/or force. In general, we say that “real estate cannot be stolen” since the original owner can prove his claim in court once anarchy has been suppressed. But here we deal with the case that something happened before the original owner could sue the robber and the field is no longer available. If the field was taken by an “oppressor”, a Roman official against whom there is no recourse in the courts then, if everybody’s field was taken, the original owner has no claim since the field would have been taken even if it had not been stolen. But if the field was taken because the robber had a run-in with the law, the robber must pay for a replacement even though legally the field was still the original owner’s property when it was taken. The Yerushalmi (<i>Neziqin</i>, 7c, line 20) notes that even if the oppressors took the field from the robber because of the robbed, the robbed could claim replacement from the robber since he might say: Give me what is mine and let any other person deal with me.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated: Rebbi Meïr says that as soon as a person abandons anything from his property, it is no longer in his possession. Rebbi Yose says, nothing may leave the hands of its owners except if it is taken up by another person<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">E. g., if somebody is injured on abandoned property which had not been taken up by another person, the original owner has to pay according to R. Yose but not according to R. Meïr.</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Abba bar Ḥiyya, both say, Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Yannai: The words of Rebbi Yose [deal with the case] that a person gave a gift to ten people and this one was one of them<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yose compares abandoning property to giving something to a group of people without specifying who gets what.

If somebody abandoned his field, some Tannaïm say, he can retract<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">If nobody took the property in the meantime.</i>, but some Tannaïm say, he cannot retract. Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: The one who says that he can retract follows Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Since the property still is his to do with as he pleases.</i>.

<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">The entire paragraph is also in <i>Peah</i> 6:1, explained there in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 4:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.4.3.1">Notes 23–27</a>.</i> So far, if he abandoned it for a longer period of time. But if he abandoned only for a short time? Let us hear from the following: “If he abandoned his field, he may cancel his action during three days.” Rebbi Ze‘ira said, it says only “three days”. Therefore, after three days he may not cancel his action. Rebbi Simeon Dayana stated before Rebbi Ze‘ira: Even after three he may cancel his action. He said to him, since you say after three days, is it the same after three or after many? A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ze‘ira<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 44a" href="/Nedarim.44a">Babli 44a</a>.</i>: “About when is this said? If he abandoned in an unspecified way. But if he said: My field shall be abandoned one day, one week, one month, one year, a sabbatical period, as long as nobody took it over, either he or another person, he may cancel. But after somebody acquired it, either he or somebody else, he cannot cancel.” This means that short or long periods are the same. It also means that they were not worried about dishonesty. This means that a person may abandon and reacquire. That obviously answers Rebbi Zeïra’s question, since Rebbi Zeira had said, are short and long times the same?
“This one can come and eat, but Rebbi Yose forbids.” What is Rebbi Yose’s reason? Because his vow preceded his abandonment. Therefore, not if his abandonment preceded his vow. They asked before Rebbi Yose: What is the difference if his vow preceded his abandonment<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Why does R. Yose accept abandonment before the vow as valid when he holds that everything remains the person’s own until it is picked up by somebody else?</i>? He said to them, it did not occur to him to forbid what he abandoned<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">It has nothing to do with property rights. A vow cannot refer to anything that was not in the vower’s mind.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, so they asked before him: That means, not if it applies to a single person<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the second half of the paragraph where it is stated that for everybody abandonment declared before three adult witnesses is immediately valid since it is a public act; even for R. Meïr an act before less than three witnesses is not valid. But in the Mishnah it is stated that no witnesses are present and nevertheless R. Meïr holds that in respect to the vow the abandonment is valid.</i>? But did we not state: “This one can come and eat, but Rebbi Yose forbids”? He said to them, it did not occur to him to forbid what he abandoned. Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Joṣadaq: If somebody abandons his field to ten persons he cannot retract<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 45a" href="/Nedarim.45a">Babli, 45a</a>, three people. (R. Joshua ben Levi holds that this requirement is rabbinic.)</i>. Rebbi Yose said, that follows Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Mana asked: When you said, “to three,” [did you not mean] “in the presence of three”? Instead of asking about Rebbi Meïr, ask about Rebbi Yose! When you said, “to ten,” [did you not mean] “in the presence of ten”? He said to him, if he abandoned it before two persons, he can retract and it remains subject to tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">If any of the persons knowing of the abandonment takes the property for himself, he cannot prove the title if the original owner reneges on his abandonment since he can support his claim only by one witness, which is not enough. Therefore, if the owner abandons the real estate and then reclaims it, it never left his potential possession and all produce grown on his field was never totally abandoned; the duty of tithing was never disestablished..</i>. If he abandoned it before three persons, he cannot retract and it is free from tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Any one of the three can take the real estate and has two witnesses to back up his claim. If the original owner would retake it when nobody else had taken it, he takes genuinely abandoned property and no tithes are due (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 4:9:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.4.9.2">Note 106</a>).</i>.

It happened in Bet Ḥoron with a person whose father was by a vow forbidden usufruct from him; when he married off his son he said to a friend, here the courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">His own courtyard, where the wedding takes place and his father is forbidden entry.</i> and the meal are given to you as a gift and they shall be yours until my father has come and eaten with us at the [wedding] meal.

He said, I did not give you my property that you should dedicate it to Heaven. He said to him, you gave me your property only that you and your father should eat, drink, and be friendly with one another and let the sin hang on my head. When the case came before the Sages they said, any gift with the proviso that if [the recipient] dedicated, it was not sanctified, is no gift.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If a person who by a vow was forbidden usufruct from another,” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is obvious that this one was learned.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One who makes a vow to abstain from vegetables is permitted squash, but Rebbi Aqiba forbids it. They said to Rebbi Aqiba, does it not happen that a person says to his agent, buy vegetables for us, and he says, I found only squash<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Vegetables” are grown in a vegetable garden and eaten raw or as a side dish.

But Rebbi Aqiba must think that squash are vegetables, but the rabbis think that squash are not vegetables. That applies to legal situations. “The vegetables of this garden are sold;” if squash were there, they would be sold in the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba, not sold in the opinion of the rabbis.

Everybody agrees that a person who vows to forbid gourd to himself is permitted vegetables, as it was stated: A person who makes a vow to abstain from a main object is forbidden the peripherals; if he vows from the peripherals, he is permitted the main object.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> ‘A <i>qônām</i> that I shall not taste wine this year’, if the year became intercalary he is forbidden it and its intercalary month. ‘Until the start of Adar’, until the first of First Adar; ‘until the end of Adar’, until the end of First Adar<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.2">Halakhah 1, Note 12</a>.</i>.

Nisan is biblically counted as the first month and Tishre as the seventh, but in Second Temple practice the year always started in the fall with the first day of Tishre. One does not discuss here the problem of the several calendars of the monarchical period.<br>Since the Mishnah states that “he is forbidden during the year and its intercalary month”, it seems that the year must be counted from Nisan since, if it were counted from Tishre, the intercalary month would be in the middle of the year and it should be obvious that the person imposes a continuous prohibition on himself.</i>?

But since he said, <i>this</i> year, the prohibition lasts either 12 or 13 months, as the case may be. The statement of the intercalary month is made to underline the difference between “a year” of twelve months and “this year” of possibly 13 months. If somebody says on New Year’s Day of an intercalary year that he will not drink wine for <i>a</i> year, he will in effect be permitted to drink wine on the first of the coming Ellul. But for <i>this</i> year, he has to observe the additional intercalary month without compensation.</i>; therefore, it was necessary to say that “he is forbidden it and its intercalary [month]”.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rebbi Eliezer says, one opens<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">If a person comes to a Sage to ask about a vow, the Sage may find him “an opening of remorse” by telling him that his parents must be ashamed that their son is one of the wicked who make vows (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.1.1.1">Chapter 1, Note 9</a>).</i> for a man by the honor of his father and mother, but the Sages forbid it.

It was only after the Arab conquest, when the Jews in Babylonia had lost their real estate holdings, that the Gaonic authorities decreed that every <i>ketubah</i> must be paid in currency and/or movables.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Father and husband jointly dissolve the vows of a preliminarily married adolescent girl<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">An underage girl can be married off by her father. A woman becomes an adult in two steps. At age 12 (if she had developed two pubic hairs) she becomes an adult before the law but the father retains the right to marry her off and the right to her earnings for an additional 6 months, when she is called נַעֲרָה “adolescent girl”. After these 6 months she becomes an adult, בּוֹגֶרֶת “ripe”, is totally independent from her father, and has to marry on her own. The vow of a minor below age 11 is void. If she made a vow after age 11 (for a male after age 12), one has to investigate whether she understands the meaning and implications of a vow. If the investigation has a positive result, her vows are valid and, as far as vows are concerned, she has acquired the status of adolescent, even though in other legal aspects she remains a minor.<br>The chapter on vows states clearly that the father can dissolve his dependent daughter’s vows (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:4-6" href="/Numbers.30.4-6"><i>Num.</i> 30:4–6</a>). Similarly, the husband can dissolve the vows of his wife if she lives “in his house” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:11-15" href="/Numbers.30.11-15">vv. 11–15</a>). A preliminarily married girl (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 6:2:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.6.2.6"><i>Peah</i> 6:2 Note 46</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 4:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.4.1.6"><i>Demay</i> 4:1, Note 19</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 8:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.8.1.2"><i>Terumot</i> 8:1, Note 9</a>) remains under her father’s jurisdiction until she is taken to her husband’s house in the final ceremony. It is asserted that during her status as preliminarily married wife, the father can dissolve her vows since she is “in his house” and the husband is given special authority over her vows in vv. 7–9 which, therefore, are not duplicated in vv. 11–15.<br>The power of dissolution in any case is restricted to the day after the father or husband first was informed of the vow (vv. 6,9,13,15). But if one of them agreed to the vow within the allotted period, he can no longer object after that.</i>. If the father dissolved but not the husband, or the husband but not the father, it is not dissolved; one does not have to mention whether one of them confirmed it.

(The existence of undisclosed prior vows might be grounds for divorce.) An underage girl orphaned from her father can be married off by her mother and brothers, but that is only a rabbinic institution (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.1.2.1"><i>Yebamot</i>1:2, Note 118</a>).

That is a rhetorical question since the two cases are not comparable. For the rabbis, the husband dissolves the vow of the preliminarily married minor only in conjunction with the father, but he also dissolves vows made before the marriage. Once the woman is emancipated from her father, either by completed marriage or by becoming of age, the husband dissolves alone but only vows made during the marriage.</i>? How do the rabbis explain “with her vows on her”? What are we talking about?

Not what is between her and others. “Between a father and his daughter,” not what is between her and others. Does Rebbi Eleazar not agree with this? He agrees; he understands everything from there: “Between a man and his wife”, not what is between her and others<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is the topic of Chapter 11. The husband can only void vows that either involve the relations between husband and wife or “vows of deprivation” (v. 14); he can forbid his wife to mortify herself.

“One does not have to mention if one of them confirmed it.” Come and see; if the father dissolved, it is not dissolved, and you say so<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah stated that if only one of them dissolved, in the example given, the father, the vow is not dissolved. Why does one have to mention that it is not dissolved if one of them confirmed the vow, since confirmation implies non-dissolution!</i>? Not on that it was said, but on the following: If the father dissolved his part but the husband did not have time to dissolve before he died, the father dissolves the husband’s part<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">While the husband cannot dissolve after the father’s death (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 10:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.10.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>), the father can dissolve alone after the husband’s death (as long as the marriage is in the preliminary stage) since after the husband’s death the underage daughter returns to the father’s tutelage.</i>. Rebbi Nathan said, those are the words of the House of Shammai.

The Babli has a long discussion about the nature of the joint powers of dissolution. If the powers are parallel, then the dissolution by one of the parties has no influence on the other; the husband’s death leaves half of the vow undissolved and undissolvable. But if the powers are joint ones, then the husband’s death opens the way for the father to exercise his now unrestrained powers.

If the father dissolved but the husband did not, would she be whipped<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since the father may dissolve after the husband’s death but the husband cannot dissolve after the father’s death, it is clear that the father’s power over his underage preliminarily married daugher is greater than the husband’s. Is the father’s power strong enough to eliminate the prohibition to violate one’s vow contained in 30:3?</i>? Or since if the husband died and his part became void in favor of the father, would she not be whipped? This follows him who said, death does not force [dissolution]<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that the word בַּהֲפָרָה is missing here; it was inserted in <i>editio princeps.</i><br>The argument follows the Sages in the previous paragraph, who hold that the husband’s death automatically voids the vow.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> “The way of learned people is that, before his daughter left his house, he told her: ‘Any vows which you had vowed in my house are dissolved’. Similarly, the husband tells her before she enters his domain<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I. e., before the final marriage ceremony.</i>: ‘Any vows which you had vowed before you enter my domain are dissolved,’ for after she enters his domain he cannot dissolve<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 10:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.10.4.1">Mishnah 4</a>. The quote does not prove anything; the proof is from the second part of the Mishnah which requires the husband to dissolve all prior vows of his bride prior to her entering his house, i. e., as long as she still is only preliminarily married. After she enters his house, he can no longer dissolve prior vows. Since the final marriage ceremony emancipated the girl (older than three years and one day) from her father and the father’s death does the same, it is concluded that the husband’s power over a preliminarily married girl endures only as long as she is under her father’s tutelage.</i>.<br>An adult girl and one who had waited<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A different text of the Babylonian Mishnah is amended in the Halakhah there to the Yerushalmi text.</i> twelve months and a widow 30 days<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.2.1">Mishnah <i>Ketubot</i> <i>5:2</a></i> states that a girl who never was married before has 12 months after the preliminary marriage to prepare her trousseau and a widow 30 days.

If the groom does not bring her into his house by the appointed time (by means of the final marriage ceremony), he nevertheless becomes resposible for her upkeep as if he were completely married.</i>, Rebbi Eliezer says, since her husband is responsible for her upkeep he may dissolve but the Sages say that the husband dissolves only after she enters his domain.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> These are the vows which he may dissolve: Matters connected with mortification<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In addition, he can dissolve vows impinging on their marital relations, as explained later.</i>. [E. g.], “if I wash, if I do not wash; if I wear jewels, if I do not wear jewels.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These examples refer to conditional vows. One derives from the contract of the tribes of Gad and Reuben with Moses (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 32:29-30" href="/Numbers.32.29-30"><i>Num.</i> 32:29–30</a>) that a legally valid conditional contract must spell out the conditions both positively and negatively: If I do certain things, there is a stipulated consequence; if I do not, then the consequence is stipulated not to happen (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.3.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 3:3</a>). The vow is understood to be: A <i>qônām</i> should be a certain thing for me if I ever wash; if I do not wash, the thing shall not be <i>qônām</i>. Since not washing is mortification, the husband has the right to void the vow. If the vow had been unconditional, the husband would have no jurisdiction over it.</i>” Rebbi Yose said, these are not vows of mortification<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">His position is explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “These are the vows which he can dissolve,” etc. It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:14" href="/Numbers.30.14"><i>Num</i>. 30:14</a>. The verse ends: “Her husband shall confirm it or her husband shall dissolve it.”</i>: “Any vow and any oath of prohibition to mortify.” That covers only vows which contain mortification. Vows regarding the relations between him and her, from where? “Between a man and his wife<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:17" href="/Numbers.30.17"><i>Num</i>. 30:17</a>. One opinion in this Halakhah (Notes 11 ff.) and the consensus in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 79b" href="/Nedarim.79b">Babli (79b</a>) hold that the dissolution of vows of mortification is permanent since it is expressly sanctioned by the verse but that dissolution of a vow regarding marital relations, which is the result of an indirect inference, is valid only as long as the marriage continues. Such a dissolution would be automatically voided for the divorcee or widow. The Mishnah mentions only vows the husband can permanently dissolve.</i>.” So far the husband; the father from where? Since the husband can dissolve only vows of mortification and matters between him and her, so the father can dissolve only vows of mortification and matters between him and her<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This argument seems to be taken out of thin air. It is explained in <i>Sifry Num</i>. 155: V. 17 reads “These are the principles which the Eternal commanded to Moses between a husband and his wife, between a father and his daughter, in her adolescence, in her father’s house.” Now this verse is really an appendix to the laws governing the married wife. It is concluded that the restrictions which apply to the husband in relation with his wife in <i>his</i> house also apply to the father in relation to the adolescent daughter in <i>his</i> house.</i>.
Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish disagree. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the husband dissolves both vows and oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The heading of the paragraph, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:2" href="/Numbers.30.2"><i>Num</i>. 30:2</a>, speaks of vows and oaths.

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish also disagree about the vows submitted to the Elder. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Elder permits both vows and oaths. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, the Elder permits vows, the Elder does not permit oaths. That of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish parallels that of Issi (Assi). A person came before Rebbi Yasa<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since Yerushalmi אִיסִּי is the same as Babylonian אַסִּי, the formal name should not be יוֹסֵי but יָסָה.</i> to have his vow permitted. He asked him, what did you swear? He answered, ὢ πόποι<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Greek πόποι is classically an exclamation of surprise, anger, pain, etc.; it is later explained as “divinities, gods”. While the husband avoided using Hebrew or Aramaic expressions for God’s name, the Greek in this case has the meaning of “God of Israel”; this classifies the act as an oath, which R. Yasa refused to annul. The husband swore that his wife should no longer enter his house, i. e., he forced himself to divorce her and pay her the divorce settlement.</i> Israel, that she should not enter my house. He said to him, ὢ πόποι Israel, she shall not enter your house!
Rebbi Ze‘ira explained the Mishnah: “These are the vows which he can dissolve: Matters connected with mortification. [E. g.], ‘if I wash, if I do not wash; if I shall wear jewels, if I do not wear jewels.’ Rebbi Yose said, these are not vows of mortification” but vows between him and her. “The following are vows of mortification<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.2.1">Mishnah 11:2</a>. In this interpretation, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.2.1">Mishnah 2</a> is the continuation of the remark of R. Yose in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.1.1">Mishnah 1</a>.</i>” following Rebbi Yose. For example, “she said, all produce of the world is <i>qônām</i> for me, he may dissolve.” The rabbis say, if he dissolves vows of mortification, they are permanently dissolved. Vows between him and her are only dissolved as long as she is married to him. Rebbi Yose says, both vows of mortification and vows between him and her, if he dissolved them they are permanently dissolved<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since R. Yose also agrees that the husband dissolves both vows of mortification and those between him and her, there must be a practical difference between the two classes of vows to make the classification important.</i>. That means, the rabbis say, if he dissolves vows of mortification, they are permanently dissolved. Rebi Yose says, if he dissolves vows between him and her, they are permanently dissolved. What is the difference between them? If she said, any benefit from me shall be <i>qônām</i> for you when I leave your domain. Why can he not dissolve that? Because she did not say, any benefit from my body shall be <i>qônām</i> for you when I leave your domain<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A vow between him and her is only subject to the husband’s dissolution if it interferes with their marital relations. For R. Yose, he can dissolve a vow that would permanently forbid any sex with her after divorce; for the rabbis, he cannot dissolve the vow which comes into effect only after he will have lost the right of dissolution.</i>. Rebbi Ze‘ira and Rebbi Hila, both of them say: That is the essence of vows between him and her. In the opinion of Rebbi Ze‘ira, Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said the same thing since we stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.4.1">Mishnah 11:4</a>, about a woman who vows not to do anything he tells her to do. The rabbis hold that he does not have to dissolve the vow since by law she is required to live with him and keep house for him, and nobody can abolish his duties under the law by making a vow. R. Aqiba holds that he must dissolve the vow since she might do more for him than is legally required and then would violate her vow. R. Joḥanan ben Nuri says that he would be well advised to dissolve the vow since she would not be able to do anything for him after a divorce. This implies that the husband may dissolve now the vow regarding matters between him and her which would become effective only after a future divorce.</i>: “Rebbi Joḥanan said, he shall dissolve it since maybe he would divorce her, then she would be forbidden to return to him.”
Rebbi Hila explained the Mishnah: “These are the vows which he can dissolve: Matters connected with mortification. [E. g.], ‘if I wash, if I do not wash; if I wear jewels, if I do not wear jewels.’ ” What means “Rebbi Yose said, these vows are not vows of mortification”? They are vows between him and her. “The following are vows of mortification” is everybody’s opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.2.1">Mishnah 2</a> can be read as being accepted by everybody. This implies that R. Yose does not disagree with the anonymous majority that the husband’s powers of dissolution of vows between him and her are restricted to the time of their marriage. He simply disagrees with the classification of the two examples quoted in the Mishnah and holds that not washing or not wearing jewellery is not done as mortification but to spite the husband.</i>.
“If I wash, if I do not wash.” It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In a <i>baraita</i> not otherwise recorded.</i>: “If I wash, if I do not wash; if I wear jewels, if I do not wear jewels”, these are vows of mortification. Both according to Rebbi Ze‘ira or according to Rebbi Hila, Rebbi Yose seems to contradict his own opinion, as <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the next paragraph, the text is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 8:5:4-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.8.5.4-5"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 8:5, Notes 77–84</a>.</i> it was stated: “A water source belonging to the townspeople, between them and outsiders, they have precedence over outsiders. Between outsiders and their animals, the outsiders have precedence over their animals. Their washing and the lives of outsiders, their washing has precedence over the lives of outsiders.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, who is the Tanna who said that washing is a necessity for survival? Rebbi Yose! As it was stated: “One may use it neither for steeping nor for washing. But Rebbi Yose permits it for washing.” The opinions of Rebbi Yose are contradictory. There he says, washing oneself is not a necessity of life<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">“There” is the Mishnah here, where R. Yose qualifies not washing as not being a mortification.</i>. And here, he says washing one’s garments is a necessity of life! Rebbi Mana said, a person might put off washing himself but nobody puts off washing his clothes.
<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the next paragraph, the text is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 8:5:4-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.8.5.4-5"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 8:5, Notes 77–84</a>.</i> Jehudah from Ḥusa hid himself in a cave for three days because he wanted to find the reason why the necessities of life of one’s town have precedence over the necessities of life of another town. He came to Rabbi Yose bar Ḥalaphta and said, I was hiding in a cave for three days because I wanted to find the reason why the necessities of life of one’s town have precedence over the necessities of life of another town. He called his son Rebbi Abba and asked him about the reason why the necessities of life of one’s town have precedence over the necessities of life of another town. He said to him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 35:15" href="/Numbers.35.15"><i>Num</i>. 35:15</a>): “These [six] cities shall be”, each town shall be, and only afterwards their surroundings around them.

The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 83b" href="/Nedarim.83b">Babli, 83b</a>, notes that the first sentence of the Mishnah implies that the husband is not “people”. The second clause, in its version, seems to imply that the woman can eat only from gleanings etc., not from the husband, who would be part of “people” and as such entitled to dissolve the vow. R. Joḥanan points out that the second clause is part of the first sentence, not a stand-alone sentence: The woman may eat from her husband and, in addition, gleanings, abandoned sheaves, and <i>peah</i>.</i>”.

<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the Halakhah, the text (with minor variants) is from <i>Demay</i> 6:3, explained there in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:4:4-10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.4.4-10.1">Notes 59–76</a>.</i> Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina said, a person gives his tithes for the benefit of goodwill. Rebbi Joḥanan said, a person may not give his tithes for the benefit of goodwill. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:10" href="/Numbers.5.10"><i>Num</i>. 5:10</a>) “Everybody shall be the owner of his holy things.” Rebbi Joḥanan said “it shall not be his”. May he give them to whomever he likes?
A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥaninah: “A vow that no Cohanim or Levites should have any advantage from me, they should take against his will.” He explains it about a person who says, I cannot possibly give them <i>any</i> gifts. You should know that this is so, since we have stated: “<i>These</i> Cohanim and Levites should [not] have any advantage from me, let others take.” A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “An Israel can say to another Israel, here you have a tetradrachma and give this firstling to my daughter’s son, a Cohen.” He explains, if he already wanted to give it to two [Cohanim] and that daughter’s son was one of them; then one said, here you have a tetradrachma and give it whole to my daughter’s son, a Cohen.
They asked before Rebbi Zeїra: a Cohen to an Israel, Rebbi forbids. What does Rebbi Yose say? Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa said, so he responded to them: In the opinion of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina, why is a Cohen to an Israel forbidden, not because it looks badly? Also Rebbi Joḥanan holds that from an Israel to an Israel it is forbidden because it looks badly. In addition, because of the following, as it was stated: “Cohanim and Levites who help at the threshing floor have no right either to heave or to tithe, and if the farmer gave, it is desecrated, as it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:15" href="/Leviticus.22.15"><i>Lev</i>. 22:15</a>): ‘They should not desecrate the sanctified things of the Children of Israel,’ but they desecrate them! In addition, they said that their heave is no heave, their tithes are no tithes, their dedications are no dedications, and about them the verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Micah 3:11" href="/Micah.3.11"><i>Micha</i> 3:11</a>): ‘Their heads judge for bribes, [their priests are for hire].’ The Omnipresent brings over them three catastrophies; that is what is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Micah 3:12" href="/Micah.3.12"><i>Micha</i> 3:12</a>): ‘Therefore, because of you Zion will be ploughed over as a field, Jerusalem will be desolate, and the Temple Mount a wooded hill.’
A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “If somebody marries preliminarily giving heave, tithes, ‘gifts’, water for sprinkling, or ashes of the red heifer, she is married, even if the groom is an Israel.” He explains it with heave he inherited from his maternal grandfather, a Cohen.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> 4: ‘A <i>qônām</i> that I shall not work according to the wishes of my father, or your father, or my brother, or your brother,’ he cannot dissolve. ‘According to your wish,’ he does not have to dissolve<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Since she is obligated to keep house for him and work in the house, and nobody can annul his obligations by a vow.</i>.

The excess? Rebbi Meїr says, it is dedicated; Rebbi Joḥanan the Alexandrian said, it is profane.” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, they disagree about the excess over five tetradrachmas<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">It is stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.8.1">Mishnah <i>Ketubot</i>5:9</a> that the husband has to give his wife a silver obolus every week as pocket money. If he does not give it, the Mishnah states that he has lost his claim to her earnings (and his dedication is void since nobody can dedicate what is not his.)

He explains it in the case of one who supports his wife with food but does not give her an obolus for her needs<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that R. Meїr, who is the presumed author of an anonymous Mishnah, states that spinning the 5 tetradrachmas is for the silver obolus she receives, and the excess of her work is for the food the husband provides. In the case considered here, the husband has no right to the value of the first 5 tetradrachma weights of her spinning but he can dedicate all the excess. R. Joḥanan the Alexandrian will hold that the 5 tetradrachmas will pay for the food and the excess for the pocket money, then the excess is the wife’s property and the husband has no right to dedicate it.</i>, as we stated: “If he does not give her an obolus for her needs, what she earns is hers”. Rebbi Joḥanan said, they disagree about the excess left after [the husband’s] death; for he explains it if he does not support her with food<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">He explains an arrangement that the wife takes neither food nor money from the husband and retains all her earnings for herself. In that case, the husband has no say about her earnings. But if she dies before him, he inherits from her and can dedicate what he wishes. (In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 58b" href="/Ketubot.58b">Babli, <i>Ketubot</i> 58b</a>, this is Samuel’s position.) R. Joḥanan the Alexandrian holds that nobody can dedicate anything not in his possession; therefore, any disposition of his future inheritance which he makes during her lifetime is void.</i>. But if he supports her with food, everybody agrees that it became dedicated<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joḥanan holds that the spinning of the first 5 tetradrachmas pays for food and pocket money. Therefore, anything in excess is unincumbered property of the husband.</i>. And here, he cannot dissolve! Rebbi Meїr says. he does not have to dissolve<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Since she is obligated, she cannot avoid an obligation by a vow.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan the Alexandrian said, hers. Rebbi Aqiba said, hers.

Joḥanan ben Nuri holds that the excess is the husband’s; therefore he only counsels the husband to dissolve to permit him to take his wife back after a divorce.</i>.
“Rebbi Aqiba said, he has to dissolve.” Rebbi Abba said, if she forbids the yields of her work, [vowing] not to work, he can force her up to the weight of five tetradrachmas. More than that he cannot force, for he has to be afraid that she may work more and it turns out that she profits from what is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since the excess is hers automatically.</i>. Therefore, Rebbi Aqiba says, he has to dissolve his part. Rebbi Hila said, it is impossible for her to make exactly the weight of five tetradrachmas. He could force her up to the weight of five tetradrachmas; more that that he cannot force. He has to be afraid that she might be over the limit by a minute amount; then he would profit from what is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">If she thinks that she spun the weight of five tetradrachmas but in fact she made a little more, then in accepting this he would be sinning inadvertently. It is in his interest to dissolve the vow. The smallest weight measurable in talmudic theory is the <i>peruṭa,</i> 1/32 of an obolus (about 4 mg in silver equivalent).</i>. Therefore …<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that one has to insert here the text from R. Abba’s argument.</i>.
“Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said, he should dissolve.” Rebbi Hila said, the reason of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri is that even if he knows that if he divorces her she would be forbidden to return to him, she needles him until he divorces her<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Since R. Joḥanan ben Nuri holds that the excess work is the husband’s and the vow would be active only after divorce, it seems that at this moment there is neither a vow of mortification nor one between him and her. How could the husband legally dissolve the vow? It seems R. Hila reads “she knows that if he divorces”. He argues that it is a vow between him and her since the wife, knowing that the husband would be extremely reluctant to divorce her, could be quite unpleasant with impunity and he would suffer.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The vow of a widow or a divorcee,” etc. This refers to what Rebbi Ismael says, the vow decides; Rebbi Aqiba says, prohibition decides<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.6.2">Note 65</a>.

Ismael says that the point of activation of the vow determines; there is no vow until after 30 days and the husband then can dissolve the vow. The Mishnah follows R. Aqiba.

R. Ismael says, the husband can dissolve (since the vow starts to be active in his domain, it is not a vow preceding the marriage). R. Aqiba says, he cannot dissolve (since the vow was made when she was a widow). In the case here, the remarriage was before the 30 days were over; for R. Ismael there is no question that the husband can dissolve the vow. For R. Aqiba the question is whether the divorce is counted to introduce a new domain, in which case he can dissolve, or is a continuation of the old, in which case he had his chance and did not use it.
