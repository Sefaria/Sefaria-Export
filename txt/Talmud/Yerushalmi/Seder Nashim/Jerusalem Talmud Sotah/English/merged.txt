Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If a man declares his jealousy<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">If a man suspects his wife of infidelity, he may subject her to the ordeal described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5" href="/Numbers.5"><i>Num.</i> 5</a>. Since the ordeal involves a sacrifice and it is forbidden to bring profane food into the Temple precinct, the wife has to be warned in due form not to associate with the man the husband suspects to be his wife’s paramour. His right to bring his wife to the Temple can be established only by the testimony of two witnesses of good standing.</i> to his wife, Rebbi Eliezer says, he declares his jealousy in front of two [witnesses] and takes her to drink<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I. e., he takes her to the Temple precinct for the ordeal.<br>It will be explained later that from the moment the husband establishes his right to submit his wife to the Temple ordeal, any intercourse with her is forbidden to him until she is cleansed by the ordeal. This means that without a Temple, the wife will be forbidden after the jealousy was declared and the husband has to divorce his wife and can never take her back. If he can establish the fact that she was alone with another man after being duly warned, the divorce would be the wife’s fault and no payments would be due at the time of the divorce.</i> by the testimony of one witness or his own testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the interpretation of the Mishnah, R. Eliezer holds that once the wife was warned in due form, the fact that she had a tête-à-tête with the suspect does not need a formal proof; the husband can declare to the priest in the Temple that he saw the two together.</i>. Rebbi Joshua says, he declares his jealousy in front of two [witnesses] and takes her to drink by the testimony of two [witnesses]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joshua requires that both the warning to the wife and the fact of a subsequent tête-à-tête have to be established in a form acceptable to the priests’ court in the Temple.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If a man declares his jealousy to his wife,” etc. It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:14" href="/Numbers.5.14"><i>Num.</i> 5:14</a>.</i>: “A spirit of jealousy overcame him and he declared his jealousy to his wife;” this implies that he should not declare his jealousy jokingly, or in the middle of a conversation, or lightly, or in a friendly manner<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The witnesses to the declaration of jealousy must be able to testify that the wife could not possibly have had the impression that the husband was less than absolutely serious.</i> but in a way that inspires fear. If he transgressed and declared his jealousy in one of the aforementioned ways: was this said as an obligation or as a necessity? If you say as an obligation, his declaration of jealousy is valid<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">While he did not do what he was supposed to do, his dereliction would not invalidate his declaration.</i>. If you say as a necessity, his declaration of jealousy is invalid. This is resolved referring to the statement<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Accepted also in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 19a" href="/Menachot.19a">Babli, <i>Menaḥot</i> 19a</a>. Any procedure that is described as תּוֹרָה or חֻקָּה in the Torah must be executed to the letter or it is invalid; quoted also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 2:3:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.2.3.2"><i>Soṭah</i> 2:3</a> (18a), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 7:2:2-11:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.7.2.2-11.4"><i>Pesaḥim</i> 7:2</a> (34b).<br>It follows that for the Yerushalmi, any declaration of jealousy that is not executed in a spirit of gravity is invalid.</i>: Anywhere “law” or “teaching” is mentioned, it is an absolute necessity.
The declaration of jealousy, Rebbi Joshua said in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, is obligatory<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If the husband has reason to suspect his wife, he has no choice but is obligated to declare his jealousy. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 3a" href="/Sotah.3a">Babli, 3a</a>, the position of R. Eliezer is ascribed to R. Aqiba and that of R. Joshua to R. Ismael. Since R. Joshua is the greater authority than R. Eliezer and R. Aqiba is greater than R. Ismael, in practice the Babli takes the position opposite to the Yerushalmi.</i>; but Rebbi Joshua said, it is optional. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose said before Rebbi Yasa, it turns out that Rebbi Eliezer follows the House of Shammai and Rebbi Joshua the House of Hillel<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 9:8:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.9.8.4">Mishnah <i>Giṭṭin</i> 9:11</a>; <i>Sifry Deut</i>. #269.</i>. As the House of Shammai say, a man may not divorce his wife except if he found in her a matter of nakedness<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Illegitimate nakedness: incest and adultery.</i>. If he found her behavior ugly<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">“Ugly things” in a moral sense, from which one may presume that she was unfaithful but there is no proof. The Babli uses כעור in the same sense. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 7:6:2-7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.7.6.2-7"><i>Ketubot</i> 7:7</a> (fol. 31c), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 24b-25a" href="/Yevamot.24b-25a">Babli <i>Yebamot</i> 24b/25a</a> an example is given, that the husband comes home and sees a pedlar leave the house and his wife getting dressed. Our sources indicate that in such a case the husband may divorce his wife without paying, claiming the divorce is his wife’s fault. It is not mentioned that in the absence of witnesses to the presumed sex act, the House of Shammai prohibit the divorce. This may qualify the entire argument as homiletic.</i>, he cannot divorce her since he found no proof of adultery; he cannot keep her since he found her behavior ugly. Therefore, he says, it is obligatory. But was it not stated in the name of the House of Shammai: Not only that the woman must leave because of incest; from where that she must leave if her head’s [hair] is loose, if the side seams of her dress are open, or her arms stripped bare<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 90" href="/Gittin.90">Babli, <i>Giṭṭin</i> 90a/b</a>, this is a statement of R. Meïr, following the House of Hillel.</i>? The verse says, “for he found in her a matter of nakedness.” Rebbi Mana said, I confirmed this if there are witnesses, but not if there are no witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">If there are independent witnesses to the indecent behavior (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 1:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.1.1.3">Note 12</a>), the House of Shammai agree that the husband must divorce his wife; but in the case of a declaration of jealousy they might not permit a divorce except if the ordeal proves the wife guilty.</i>.
“And Rebbi Joshua [follows] the House of Hillel.” For the House of Hillel say, even if she burned his food<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 9:8:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.9.8.4">Mishnah <i>Giṭṭin</i> 9:11</a>; <i>Sifry Deut</i>. #269.</i>. Therefore, he says it is optional. If he wants to declare his jealousy, he declares his jealousy; if he wants to divorce her, he divorces her<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 7:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.7.6.1">Mishnah <i>Ketubot</i> 7:6</a> spells out that the husband can divorce his wife for cause (without payment) if he can prove indecent conduct. If he divorces her because she is a bad cook, he has to pay.</i>.
What is Rebbi Eliezer’s reason? “For he found in her a word of nakedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">16”</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1">Deut. 24:1</a>.</i>. “Nakedness”, that is the rendez-vous<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">“Meeting in secret” with another man.</i>. “Word”, that is the declaration of jealousy. “Word, word”; just as “word” mentioned there requires two witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:15" href="/Deuteronomy.19.15"><i>Deut.</i> 19:15</a>: “By the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall a <i>word</i> (fact, circumstance) be confirmed.” The argument is based on the second hermeneutical rule (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Braita d'Rabbi Yishmael" href="/Sifra,_Braita_d'Rabbi_Yishmael"><i>Sifra</i> Introduction</a>) that the meaning of words is unchanged from one occurrence to the other.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 90a" href="/Gittin.90a">Babli, <i>Giṭṭin</i> 90a</a>, this is quoted as the argument of the House of Shammai.</i>, so “word” mentioned here requires two witnesses. “But he can take her to drink by the testimony of one witness or his own testimony,” “she was untrue to him in untruthfulness<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:12" href="/Numbers.5.12"><i>Num</i>. 5:12</a>. The root מעל denotes the sin of embezzlement or fraud (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:15" href="/Leviticus.5.15"><i>Lev</i>. 5:15</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:6" href="/Numbers.5.6"><i>Num</i>. 5:6</a>; cf.

Arabic معالة).</i>”, about the conditions spelled out to her through the mouth of others<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In this interpretation, מעל refers to fraud as breach of contract; it does not imply unfaithfulness of the wife, as explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:14" href="/Numbers.5.14"><i>Num</i>. 5:14</a>. Therefore, the breach of contract is that the wife went to a rendez-vous with the man forbidden to her by the declaration of jealousy in front of two witnesses. The clause (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:12" href="/Numbers.5.12"><i>Num</i>. 5:12</a>) that she breached her contract <i>with him</i> is read to mean that he is empowered to prosecute this breach before the Temple priests.</i>.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 2b" href="/Sotah.2b">Babli 2b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Sotah (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Sotah_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>.</i>: “Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah says in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, he declares his jealousy by the testimony of one witness or his own testimony; he takes her to drink on the testimony of two witnesses.” It is said here: “For he found in her a word of nakedness<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut.</i> 24:1</a>.</i>”; “finding” anywhere has to be validated by witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Everywhere the Torah uses the expression כִּי מָצָא, כִּי יִמָּצֵא “if it happened” the implication is that the case must be heard before a duly constituted court.</i>. How does Rebbi Eliezer explain “a word”? A circumstance that brings into the habit of nakedness<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A “word (or case, matter) of nakedness” is not nakedness itself.</i>. May a single witness let him take her to drink<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This seems to refer to the first version (the Mishnah) of R. Eliezer’s position. The earlier argument (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 1:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.1.1.5">Note 20</a>) showed that the husband is empowered to bring his wife to the Temple on his own testimony; one still needs an argument to permit a single witness to a secluded rendez-vous to allow the husband to bring his wife to the Temple.</i>? His own testimony can never obligate him to swear in money matters but it will let him take her to drink<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">R. David Fraenckel points out that this sentence is ambiguous. It either can mean that a person’s own word in money matters can never bring onto him a biblical obligation to swear, for if he agrees that he owes money he pays and if he disputes the [entire] claim and the other party has neither witnesses nor documents, no oath is due. But it also may mean that a statement of a claimant can never obligate the defendant to swear.</i>, a single witness who will obligate him to swear in money matters<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 35:30" href="/Numbers.35.30"><i>Num</i>. 35:30</a>: “A single witness should not testify in a death penalty case” is interpreted to mean that in money matters a single witness in support of a claim of money obligates the defendant to swear (Sifry <i>Num</i>. 161; the argument here is hinted at in Sifry <i>Deut</i>. 188).</i> not so much more? May a relative bring her to drink<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">No relative can be a witness in court in any proceeding. Therefore, it is most irregular that the husband’s word should carry any weight in any proceedings.</i>? Who is a closer relative than her husband? May a hearsay witness bring her to drink? What is the difference between him and a relative? A relative may be disabled today but he might be enabled later<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">No relative can be a witness in court in any proceeding.

What is the reason of Rebbi Joshua<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 2b" href="/Sotah.2b">Babli, 2b</a>, the argument attributed to R. Joshua refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:13" href="/Numbers.5.13"><i>Num</i>. 5:13</a>: “There is no witness <i>against her</i>”, meaning that a single witness to her adultery will make the Temple ceremony superfluous and will make her lose the <i>ketubah</i> money otherwise due to her in a divorce, but will not be valid either to prove a declaration of jealousy or a secluded rendez-vous.</i>? ““For he found in her a word of nakedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut.</i> 24:1</a>.</i>” “Word”, that is the declaration of jealousy. “For he found”; “finding” has to be validated by witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Everywhere the Torah uses the expression כִּי מָצָא, כִּי יִמָּצֵא “if it happened” the implication is that the case must be heard before a duly constituted court.</i>.

They answered on the words of Rebbi Yose ben Jehudah: If so, there is no end to it. If he is believed, he declares his jealousy (before two) [by himself]<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The text (in parentheses) is an obvious error but it appears also in the Rome ms. The translation [in brackets] is a conjectured emendation.<br>The problem is that according to R. Yose ben R. Jehudah’s version, the husband may state that he had declared his jealousy without the wife having a possibility of disproving his claim. He may then plant witnesses and trick her into being alone with another man in order to divorce her without payment.</i>, brings witnesses that she was in a secluded place and disables her from receiving the <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The marriage contract specifying the monetary obligations of the husband towards his wife and her children. The same argument is given in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 2b" href="/Sotah.2b">Babli, 2b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, what business did she have in a secluded place<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Being alone with another man is misbehaving. It is stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 4:12:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.4.12.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddushin</i> 4:12</a> that a woman, other than his mother or daughter, may not be alone with man to whom she is not married (unless the latter’s wife is close by). Why should the husband not be able to divorce her through her fault?</i>? But it refers to the statement in the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah’s version of R. Eliezer’s position. In R. Yose ben R. Jehudah’s version, at least the fact of the wife’s misbehavior must be established in court by two witnesses subject to cross-examination. But in the Mishnah’s version, two witnesses are needed only to certify the relatively minor fact of the declaration of jealousy but after that, the husband can deprive the wife of her <i>ketubah</i> money simply by stating that she misbehaved. This contradicts all rules of procedure in civil cases. The same argument is given in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 2b" href="/Sotah.2b">Babli, 2b</a>.</i>. Is he believed to declare formally his jealousy and then say that she was in a secluded place and disable her from receiving her <i>ketubah</i>? Rebbi Mana said, even for that other Tanna<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yose ben R. Jehudah.</i> it is [a] valid [objection], following him who says that he may declare his jealousy in respect to her father or her son. Is he believed to declare his jealousy with respect to her father and her son, can he then bring witnesses that she was in a secluded place with them and disable her from receiving her <i>ketubah</i>? If you ask, what business did she have in a secluded place? The Torah permitted her to be in a secluded place, since Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Ioḥai, it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 13:7" href="/Deuteronomy.13.7"><i>Deut</i>. 13:7</a>.

In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 80b" href="/Kiddushin.80b">Babli <i>Qiddushin</i> 80b</a>, R. Joḥanan is quoted in the name of R. Ismael, in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 21b" href="/Sanhedrin.21b"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b</a> and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 36b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.36b"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 36b</a> in the name of R.

Witnesses of a declaration of jealousy who were found to be false<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The technical term “scheming witnesses” derives from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:19" href="/Deuteronomy.19.19"><i>Deut.</i> 19:19</a> where it is stated that the penalty inflicted on a false witness shall be the punishment <i>he schemed</i> to inflict on the accused.

About witnesses concerning her being in a secluded place who were found to be false, you say that they are whipped; why should they not pay<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">On their testimony, the wife loses her <i>ketubah</i>-money</i>? It is not through their action that she loses her <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Without testimony which confirms the declaration of jealousy, their testimony is worthless.

If she was seen going to a secluded place by one witness in the morning<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">And the same witness saw the suspect man going to the same place.</i> and by one witness in the evening, it is to be treated like the following: <sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 5:4" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).5.4">Tosephta <i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:4</a>; quoted also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 7:4:2-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.7.4.2-8">Halakhah <i>Giṭṭin</i> 7:4</a>.</i>“If she was together alone with him by the testimony of two witnesses, she needs a second bill of divorce from him; if there was a single witness she does not need a second bill of divorce from him.

Josef Caro’s lengthy discussion of this paragraph in <i>Bet Joseph,</i> <i>Ṭur Ḥošen Mišpaṭ</i> 30(7).

Just as she is forbidden to her husband’s brother, so she is forbidden to her paramour’s brother. I might think that just as the co-wife of a woman accused of infidelity is forbidden to her husband’s brother, so she should be forbidden to her paramour’s brother. Let us hear from the following: “A woman’s husband went overseas; they came and told her that her husband had died, and she had a levir here; he married her in levirate and died. Then her husband returned. She is forbidden to him but her co-widow is permitted to him; she is forbidden to him but his brother’s wife is permitted to him.” Is his brother’s wife not like the co-wife of a woman accused of infidelity? That means that the co-wife of a woman accused of infidelity is permitted to her paramour’s brother. Rebbi Judan said, this follows the rabbis there, as Rebbi Hila said, one states there, for incestuous relationships no divorce is needed except for a married woman; Rebbi Aqiba says also from his wife’s sister. But following the rabbis here? Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: everybody agrees that his brother’s wife needs a bill of divorce from him because of the rule of a married wife. She is forbidden by the incest rules, and an incest-prohibited woman frees her co-wife. Rebbi Ḥinenah said, it is accepted even according to the rabbis here. They fined her but not her heirs. Rebbi Ḥananiah, the son of Rebbi Hillel, said, according to the rabbis there, she should be permitted to him<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since one pubic hair does not make the person an adult, there is no witness who testifies to the person being an adult.</i>. Rebbi Ze‘ira in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, the co-wife of a woman accused of infidelity is forbidden, the co-wife of a divorcee is permitted. Rebbi Jacob [bar Aḥa] in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: All co-wives are permitted except the co-wife of a woman accused of infidelity. Samuel said, the divorcee herself is permitted to her house. Does he disagree? Since they were discussing co-wives they did not mention divorcees. Why is the co-wife of a woman accused of infidelity forbidden? Rebbi Joḥanan said, they touched this case because it looks like adultery. Rav said, because impurity is written there parallel to incest prohibitions.

It follows that if the husband is not blameless [in sexual matters of any kind], the ordeal becomes inactive. Since the <i>Soṭah</i> is forbidden to her husband, if he sleeps with her before she is cleansed by the ordeal he is not blameless and the innocence of his wife can never be proven.</i>. What does he have to do: He brings her to the court at his place and they give him two scholars to prevent him from sleeping with her on the trip. Rebbi Jehudah says, her husband is believed about her.

These include that a Cohen has to present the offering to the altar, that he take a handful to the altar to be burned, and that the remainder be eaten under the rules of most holy sacrifices.

Aqiba’s argument is explained away: one accepts her statement that she is impure only if made in a self-assured way, when she can be believed; but if she makes the confession while trembling, one suspects that she might be pure but has been intimidated by the procedure and therefore her guilt has not been established. Both sources disagree with the Yerushalmi.</i>.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> She does not finish drinking before her face becomes yellow, her eyes protrude, and her veins swell. She is taken outside so that she does not pollute the temple courtyard. If she has merit, it suspends. There is merit which suspends for one year, there is merit which suspends for two years, there is merit which suspends for three years. From this, Ben Azai concluded that one is obligated to teach his daughter Torah, so that when she needs to drink, she will know that the merit will assist her. Rebbi Eliezer says: whoever teaches his daughter Torah teaches her debauchery. Rebbi Joshua said: a woman prefers one <i>qab</i> and frivolity to nine <i>qabim</i> and abstinence. He used to say: a foolish pious man, a sly wicked man, a predatory woman, and hits by the predatory, these are the ones who ruin the world.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If her flour offering became impure before it was sanctified in a Temple vessel,” etc. It was stated: If her flour offering became impure before it was sanctified in a Temple vessel, it is treated like all other flour offerings and should be redeemed; after it was sanctified in a Temple vessel, it is treated like all other flour offerings and should be burned<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is that of the Mishnah (the one missing word, ואם, is also missing in most mss. of the Babli and of the Maimonides tradition of the Mishnah).

This differs from the case of a sacrifice brought in error which is treated according to the rules of profane animals introduced in error into the Temple; Mishnah <i>Keritut</i> 6:1–2. (In the Mishnah, there are dissenting opinions that the hung reparation offering is a valid offering in all cases.)<br>R.

It was stated: If her offering became impure before the fistful was sacrificed<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">It is unclear what this sentence implies here. It is obvious that an impure sacrifice is forbidden as sacrifice and as food. In the Babli (note 178), the entire text of the Mishnah is quoted.

If the same rules were to apply, it is difficult to see why there should be two distinct offerings.</i>? If you want to say, under the rules of a fistful, one cannot bring them during the night, one cannot bring them after death, and he is forbidden to think about them<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrifices can be offered in the Temple only between the morning and evening daily sacrifices. Remainders of sacrifices for which blood and fat were offered during daytime can be brought to the altar during the night.<br>A sacrifice can be brought only during one’s lifetime.<br>In talmudic theory (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Zevachim 2:2" href="/Mishnah_Zevachim.2.2">Mishnah <i>Zebaḥim</i> 2:2</a>), a sacrifice is either valid or invalid from the start. Therefore, the biblical prohibitions of פִּגּוּל and נוֹתָר (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:5-7" href="/Leviticus.19.5-7"><i>Lev.</i> 19:5–7</a>) are interpreted to mean that the sacrifice becomes permanently prohibited if any of the prescribed actions in the Temple were executed with the idea that the meat should be eaten out of its allotted time or place. This means that the Cohen, by thinking to eat from the rest of the offering the next day or outside the Temple courtyard while dealing with the fistful taken for the altar, will invalidate the offering. This danger is restricted to the fistful, whose correct treatment will permit the rest to be eaten by the Cohanim. What these think while eating the rest is irrelevant; the only actions which are invalidated by wrong thoughts are those on which something else depends, either that part of the sacrifice becomes permitted as food, or that people are purified or otherwise enabled by it.</i>. If you want to say, under the rules of a remainder, one can bring them during the night, one can bring them after death. Is he forbidden to think about them? Let us hear from the following: Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">While both mss. read here “R.

Rebbi Joḥanan asked, where are we holding? If the upper ashes<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">The ashes on the top of the altar are hot and spreading the offering out means burning it on the altar. If that were the meaning, R. Eleazar’s position is that of his father and does not have to be mentioned.</i>, Rebbi Simeon already said it. If it cannot refer to the upper ashes, let it refer to the lower ashes<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">The ashes removed from the altar to the floor of the courtyard (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:2" href="/Leviticus.6.2"><i>Lev.</i>6:2</a>).</i>. That means, one can bring them during the night, one can bring them after death, and he can think about them<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Anything not destined for the altar cannot permit anything else. Therefore, any wrong intention the Cohen may have while depositing the rest on the ashes is irrelevant; he may think what he wishes. Similarly, since the burning of the fistful permits the consumption (or dispersion) of the remainder by the Cohanim, if the owner of the offering dies after the burning of the fistful it cannot have any influence on the status of the rest.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, he is forbidden to think about them since they are not qualified as food either for humans or for the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">The argument of the previous Note is valid only for the offering of an Israel, for whom the fistful really permits the remainder to the Cohanim. But for the offering of a Cohen, the offering of the fistful according to R. Eleazar ben R. Simon does not permit anything, not even to bring the rest onto the altar. Therefore, the sacrificing of the fistful cannot lift the rules of פִּגּוּל and נוֹתָר for the Cohen’s offering.</i>. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal asked: Does Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon follow the rules of his father or the rules of the rabbis? According to the rules of his father, it should be brought on top [of the altar]. According to the rules of the rabbis, why should he take a fistful<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">They require that the entire offering be burned, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 3:6:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.3.6.5">Note 182</a>.</i>? He follows his father’s rules. Rebbi Simeon says, the tenth of an <i>epha</i> of a Cohen is like the tenth of an <i>epha</i> of an Israel. Since a fistful is taken from the tenth of an <i>epha</i> of an Israel, so a fistful is taken from the tenth of an <i>epha</i> of a Cohen. Maybe, since this one is eaten, the other is also eaten? The verse says, “Any flour offering of a Cohen shall be totally burned; it shall not be eaten.” Then it should be burned totally! You bound it to “it shall not be eaten”; you did not bind it to “it has to be sacrificed in its entirety.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon accepts the comparison of the obligatory to the voluntary offering of a Cohen, called “binding (הֶקֵּשׁ) of one verse to the other”; it is only to modify the rule of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:16" href="/Leviticus.6.16"><i>Lev.</i> 6:16</a>, which deals with voluntary offerings, not that of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:15" href="/Leviticus.6.15"><i>Lev.</i>6:15</a>, which deals with an obligatory offering of another kind.</i>”
Rebbi Yose said, Rebbi accepted the opinion of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon and taught accordingly<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that the last sentence of the Mishnah can be explained only following R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon.</i>. Rebbi Abba bar Cohen asked before Rebbi Yose: Why Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? Even following his father, Rebbi Simeon! He said to him, “eating” is on the altar, “burning” is not on the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbinic usage follows biblical usage in this case. The burning of sacrifices on the altar is never called “burning”, but “eating (by the fire)”, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:3" href="/Leviticus.6.3"><i>Lev.</i> 6:3</a>.

Aqiba is not deterred by the fact that in וּבָאוּ the <i>vav</i> is both conjunctive and conversive; any <i>vav</i> that is translated even in the LXX by καὶ must indicate a duplication of meaning. If the duplication of subjects were not intended, then Scripture would have found a way to use only באו (or imperfect יבואו) without the <i>vav</i>.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 28a" href="/Sotah.28a">Babli, 28a</a>, takes notice only of the teachings of R.

In the biblical laws of impurity, no defilement is imparted to a clay vessel touched by impurities from the outside. But if the clay vessel encloses a space that can be covered and something of original impurity enters the space (even before it touches any wall), the entire vessel becomes impure in the first degree. {Degrees of impurity are explained in the commentary to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1"><i>Demay</i>, Chapter 2, Note 137</a>.} Therefore, any food inside the vessel becomes impure in the second degree.

An additional argument, mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 29b" href="/Sotah.29b">Babli 29b</a>, is needed to clarify the statement of R. Aqiba. An original source of impurity is either a “father of impurity” which in touching a pure vessel, person, or food induces primary impurity, or a “grandfather of impurity” creating a “father of impurity” by contact (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1"><i>Demay,</i> Chapter 2, Note 137</a>). If a piece of “grandfather of impurity” falls into the clay vessel, the vessel becomes “father of impurity” and the loaf lying in it becomes impure in the first degree.

Therefore, it is important to state that <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:33" href="/Leviticus.11.33"><i>Lev.</i> 11:33</a> is written in a paragraph dealing with the impurity of dead reptiles which are only “fathers of impurity”, inducing impurities that can be washed off by immersion in water.

Just as the <i>ṭevul yom</i> does not invalidate profane food that it could not be turned into heave<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">A person who was impure and cleansed himself by immersion in water during daytime. It is explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:6-7" href="/Leviticus.22.6-7"><i>Lev.</i>22:6–7</a> that impurity is removed by immersion in water during daytime “and when the sun disappears he will be pure; afterwards, he may eat sanctified food.” (The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 2" href="/Berakhot.2">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i>2a/b</a>, discusses whether וּבָא הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ means “the sun disappears” or “the sun rises”). The <i>ṭevul yom</i> therefore is no longer impure but before sundown he is not pure for sanctified food; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1"><i>Demay</i> Chapter 2, Note 138</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 2:1:14" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.2.1.14"><i>Terumot</i> Chapter 2, Note 51</a>. Since he is forbidden only sanctified food, one may assume that he is pure for profane food.

An additional argument, mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 29b" href="/Sotah.29b">Babli 29b</a>, is needed to clarify the statement of R. Aqiba. An original source of impurity is either a “father of impurity” which in touching a pure vessel, person, or food induces primary impurity, or a “grandfather of impurity” creating a “father of impurity” by contact (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1"><i>Demay,</i> Chapter 2, Note 137</a>). If a piece of “grandfather of impurity” falls into the clay vessel, the vessel becomes “father of impurity” and the loaf lying in it becomes impure in the first degree. In that case, one has ample biblical references that the loaf is still active in transmitting impurity, generating secondary impurity; the tertiary impurity mentioned by R. Aqiba is not addressed. Therefore, it is important to state that <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:33" href="/Leviticus.11.33"><i>Lev.</i> 11:33</a> is written in a paragraph dealing with the impurity of dead reptiles which are only “fathers of impurity”, inducing impurities that can be washed off by immersion in water.

There, they say, because Rebbi Joshua praised Rebbi Aqiba, it implies that practice follows his argument.

Rebbi Aqiba was tortured before the evil Tineius Rufus. There came the time for reciting the <i>Shema‘.</i> He started to read and laughed.

But all my life I read this verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:5" href="/Deuteronomy.6.5"><i>Deut.</i> 6:5</a>): “You must love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, all your soul, and all your force.” I loved Him with all my heart. I loved Him with all my money. But whether with all my soul I could not test. But now, when “with all your soul” came, the time of reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> has arrived and my mind has not wavered, therefore I am reciting and laughing.
Neḥemiah from Emmaus served Rebbi Aqiba for 22 years and he taught him “את and גם mean additions, אך and רק mean exclusions.” He asked him: What means that which is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:13" href="/Deuteronomy.6.13"><i>Deut.</i> 6:13</a>) “את the Eternal, your God, you must fear.” He said to him, Him and His Torah.

Since the last testimony, which forbids her permanently, is confirmed from a single witness, the first testimony, which does not forbid her permanently, should logically be confirmed from a single witness.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “It would have been logical: Since the first testimony,” etc. The first testimony is about being in a secluded place; the last testimony is about impurity.

Then one should state: “A witness says that she became impure, and a woman says that she did not become impure; a woman said that she became impure and a witness said that she did not become impure.” In the House of Rebbi they stated it this way. It was stated in the name of Rebbi Neḥemiah: One follows the majority of the testimonies. How is that? Two women against one woman they considered as if there were two witnesses against one witness. What you say refers to a woman and women. But if there were a hundred women against one [male] witness, they are like one witness.

The word טורטני appears in quite a number of other sources (collected in Krauss, <i>Lehnwörter</i>) where it is perfectly adequate to see in it Greek τρυτάνη “pair of scales”. By the concurrent testimony of Rashi and R. Ḥananel, certainly based on Gaonic material, the interpretation of R. Isaac’s statement is that the grape bunch was pictured carried between two poles which at each end were fixed to a cross-beam. Each cross-beam at both extremities had smaller cross beams, giving space for 8 bearers, all marching in the same direction. There is no reason not to accept this interpretation for the Yerushalmi; but for the position of the Yerushalmi following R. Ismael, it seems rather that the image is that of a single pole, with four men preceding the grape bunch and four men following behind it.<br>It is possible that “scale” here stands for “scale bar”. But it is possible that טורטני may be a Babylonian corruption of a Semitic word טוּרְטוּר of <i>pilpel</i> type.</i>; in the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba a beam and beams of beams.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> When the Elders of Jerusalem had completed their work<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">To determine which town is responsible for bringing the calf.</i> and left, the Elders of that town bring “a cattle calf, one which never had been used for work, which never had drawn under a yoke.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 21:3" href="/Deuteronomy.21.3"><i>Deut</i>. 21:3</a>.</i>” Bodily defects do not disqualify it.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One which never had been used for work,” intentionally, “which never had drawn under a yoke,” intentionally or unintentionally<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The problem discussed in this paragraph is that if no work ever had been done with the calf, it should be obvious that it never was harnessed under a yoke to draw anything. Therefore the mention of the yoke must give harnessing the animal a status different from any other agricultural work. For the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 46a" href="/Sotah.46a">Babli, 46a</a>, imposing a yoke disables the calf whether it was used for work or not, while other agricultural work disables only if it was actually used.

The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 26" href="/Pesachim.26">Babli, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 26a/b</a>, gives as example that if the farmer lets the calf accompany its mother while she is threshing and by this helps in threshing, it remains acceptable but if the farmer intends that the calf should suckle and thereby help in threshing, it becomes disqualified.</i>. Rebbi Jonah explains the Mishnah: “One which never had been used for work,” intentionally, “which never had drawn under a yoke,” intentionally or unintentionally, if it actually had drawn<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Imposing the yoke does not disqualify the calf, only actually drawing (a cart or a plow) does.</i>. Rebbi Yose explained the Mishnah: Intentionally even if it had not drawn<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, imposing the yoke on the calf disqualifies it.</i>, unintentionally if it actually had drawn. It turns out that Rebbi Jonah follows Rebbi Ismael and Rebbi Yose the rabbis. Rebbi Jonah follows Rebbi Ismael, since Rebbi Ismael says, anything which was in a set and left the set to teach leaves its set and stands in its new meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This is a version of the hermeneutical rules not found in the Babli or the <i>Sifra</i>; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.7.4.5">Chapter 7, Note 108</a>. Drawing ploughs or carts was part of the set of works for which cattle are used. If drawing is singled out for separate attention, in this opinion the general rules valid for agricultural works, that the animal has to be made to work, indicated by the passive, are no longer valid. The active mode seems to imply that if the calf drew something on its own initiative, it still will be disabled.<br>This rule is not to be identified with the 12th rule (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Braita d'Rabbi Yishmael" href="/Sifra,_Braita_d'Rabbi_Yishmael"><i>Sifra</i> Introduction</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Temurah 13b" href="/Temurah.13b">Babli <i>Temurah</i> 13b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 25b" href="/Shevuot.25b"><i>Šebuot</i> 25b</a>): “Anything which was in a set and was taken out to be judged by different rules you cannot restore into the set unless the verse does this explicitly.” Once an animal was dedicated as sacrifice, it is forbidden to exchange it (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:10" href="/Leviticus.27.10"><i>Lev</i>. 27:10</a>). The same is true for animal tithes (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:33" href="/Leviticus.27.33"><i>Lev</i>. 27:33</a>), which are sacrifices. The fact that the rules are spelled out again for tithes (whose status of sanctity is automatic) shows that the differences in the rules are intended; one cannot infer from the rules of one for those of the other.</i>. Therefore, he has to spell out “one which never had been used for work,” intentionally, “which never had drawn under a yoke,” intentionally or unintentionally, if it actually had drawn<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse puts the emphasis on drawing, not on carrying the yoke.</i>.

Therefore, he has to spell out: intentionally even if it had not drawn, unintentionally if it actually had drawn.

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Ze‘ira: “One which never had been used for work,” a general statement, “which never had drawn under a yoke,” a detailed statement. If a general statement is followed by a detail, the general does not contain more than the detail<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The fifth hermeneutical rule.

He said, since [omitting] First Tithe is a deadly sin and [omitting] Second Tithe [implies] the sin of <i>ṭevel</i>, a person should give a name to heave and heave of the tithe and give them to the Cohen; Second Tithe he exchanges for coins. About the remaining tithe of the poor, he who has a claim on another person must bring proof.
Why should he not make the declaration? Rebbi Hila said, he causes anger before the Omnipresent by saying “I did” when he did not. If it is so, he who separated should make the declaration, he who did not separate should not make the declaration, as we have stated: “Up to ‘Look down’ they were saying it in an undertone, from ‘Look down’ onwards in a high voice.”
“The arousers.” Those who were saying (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 44:24" href="/Psalms.44.24"><i>Ps</i>. 44:24</a>): “Be roused, why do You sleep, o Eternal, etc.” Does there exist sleep before the Omnipresent? Has it not already been said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 121:4" href="/Psalms.121.4"><i>Ps</i>. 121:4</a>): “Lo, He will not slumber nor sleep, the Guardian of Israel!” Why does the verse say (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 78:65" href="/Psalms.78.65"><i>Ps</i>. 78:65</a>): “Like a sleeper awoke the Eternal, like a hero exhilarated by wine.” But in a symbolic way it is as if sleep were before Him when Israel is in trouble and the other peoples are at ease. So it says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Job 17:2" href="/Job.17.2"><i>Job</i> 17:2</a>): “When they apostasize, My Eye will rest.”
“The hitters.” Those who were hitting the calf between its horns. Joḥanan the High Priest said to them, how long will you feed torn animals to the altar? He went and made them rings. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Jehudah: He made rings for them, wide below and narrow at the top.
“Up to his days the hammer was hitting in Jerusalem,” up to his early days. “And in his days nobody had to ask about <i>demay</i>” because he sent out teams
The word of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi implies some are censure and some praise. Since Rebbi Yose said in the name of Rebbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya, Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Tanḥum, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, originally tithe was split into three parts. One third to his acquaintances among Cohanim and Levites, one third to the public treasury, one third to the poor and the fellows in Jerusalem. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, a person who went to court in Jerusalem, up to three letters he paid for himself, from there on from the public treasury. When Eleazar ben Paḥora and Judah ben Pakora came, they took it by force and it would have been in his hand to stop this but he did not but disestablished the declaration of tithes, and this is for censure. But the arousers for praise and the hitters for praise.
“Up to his days the hammer was hitting in Jerusalem,” up to his early days. Rebbi Ḥasida asked Rebbi Ḥizqiah, is it not reasonable to the end of his days. He said, I also am of that opinion.
{What means] <i>demay?</i> Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Abbahu, Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Jehudah ben Pazi: Maybe he put in order, maybe he did not put in order.
