Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A virgin is married on Wednesday and a widow on Thursday, for in smaller towns court convenes two times per week, on Monday and Thursday, so if he has a complaint about virginity he can quickly go to court<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This reason, explored at length (and rejected) in the Halakhah, refers only to the marriage of the presumed virgin. For the widow, both Talmudim explain that the groom will have three days, the day of the wedding, Friday, and the Sabbath, to spend with his new wife. If he marries any other day, the groom might be expected to go to work the next day. In a metropolis one might expect to have the court available every working day.</i>
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A virgin is married on Wednesday,” etc. Bar Qappara said, because a blessing is written there. But a blessing in only written on the Fifth and the Sixth days! On the Fifth for birds and fish<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The days of the week, which in Hebrew are simply numbered from 1 to 6, are identified with the Days of Creation. Fish and birds, created on the Fifth Day (Thursday) are blessed in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 1:22" href="/Genesis.1.22"><i>Gen</i>. 1:22</a>.</i>, on the Sixth for Adam and Eve<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 1:28" href="/Genesis.1.28"><i>Gen</i>. 1:28</a>.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, the reason of Bar Qappara is the Fourth, evening of the Fifth<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A couple which marries on Wednesday will first sleep together in the following night. Since the Jewish day starts at nightfall, this already is Thursday; they immediately benefit of the blessing to be fruitful and multiply. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 5a" href="/Ketubot.5a">Babli, 5a</a>, this is a <i>baraita</i> in Bar Qappara’s name.</i>, and the Fifth, evening of the Sixth<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 5a" href="/Ketubot.5a">Babli, 5a</a>, the explanation of R. Yose is part of the <i>baraita</i> attributed to Bar Qappara.</i>. Is there not a blessing written also on Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 2:3" href="/Genesis.2.3"><i>Gen</i>. 2:3</a>.</i>? No blessing is written for creatures, only for the day.
Because no blessing is written for creatures? Could she have been married on the Sabbath if a blessing were written for creatures? But was it not stated<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>baraita</i> is stated in full in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 2:6:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.2.6.2-5"><i>Berakhot</i> 2:6</a> (5b 1. 7), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.10.1">Note 261</a>.</i>: “A man should not first have sexual relations<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">With his virgin bride.</i> on the Sabbath, for he makes a wound.” It must follow “others”, for “others permit it.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is part of the <i>baraita</i> text in <i>Berakhot</i>. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 6b" href="/Ketubot.6b">Babli, <i>Ketubot</i> 6b</a>, the opinion of “others” is ascribed to “the Sages” and practice is decided following them.</i>” But “others” permit only when he is already married<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning the final marriage ceremony in which the bride enters her husband’s house, which consists of the recitation of the “Seven Benedictions” in the presence of at least ten witnesses (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.12">Note 76</a>) after which the couple is considered married in all respects by being alone together. This ceremony activates all monetary aspects of the marriage contract.</i>, for before he was married he had no right to what she finds, what she earns<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In addition, the woman acquires the right to all services the husband is obligated to deliver in return for his acquisition of her property rights.</i>, and to dissolve her vows<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Without needing her father’s consent; cf. <i>Nedarim</i> Chapter 11.</i>. After he married her, he has the right to receive what she finds or earns, and to dissolve her vows. If you say so, he is like someone who acquires on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Which is certainly forbidden by rabbinic standards, and, in the opinion of Isaiah, by biblical standards (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 58:13" href="/Isaiah.58.13"><i>Is</i>. 58:13</a>).</i>. Rebbi Mana said, this means that those who marry a widow<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Who make the big wedding meal Friday night, to save the expenses of a separate Sabbath meal.</i> must take her in<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">He must take her into his house before sunset to acquire his marital rights.<br>This sentence, which has no parallel in the Babli, is the source of an extensive rabbinic literature; cf. <i>Šulḥan ‘Arukh Even Ha‘ezer</i> 64:5. (In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Yoma 13b:3:1" href="/Tosafot_on_Yoma.13b.3.1">Tosafot, <i>Yoma</i> 13b, <i>s</i>. <i>v</i>. לחדא</a>, the statement is quoted in the name of R. Ḥanina.) The question is whether the clause “to take her in”, is different from “entering the <i>ḥuppah</i>” used to describe the final marriage ceremony of a virgin. From Medieval times, <i>ḥuppah</i> denotes the canopy, open on all sides, under which the pair stands for the recitation of the “Seven Benedictions”. But there is no reason to assume that חוּפָּה originally meant anything but the totally covered bridal bedroom (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 19:6" href="/Psalms.19.6"><i>Ps</i>. 19:6</a>), from חפה “to cover”. There is no indication here that the rules of transfer of property rights are different for marriages of virgins and widows.</i> when it is still daytime on Friday, that he should not be like someone who acquires on the Sabbath.
Rebbi Eleazar explains the reason given in the Mishnah, that if he has a complaint about virginity he can quickly go to court<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">His explanation is given later, by R. Hila. He insists that the Mishnah does not refer only to the fact that if he married a girl supposed to be a virgin and he found her lacking virginity that he can divorce her without paying but he can claim “erroneous acquisition” and ask the court to void the marriage without bill of divorce.</i>. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Eleazar: Since the time of danger<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 3b" href="/Ketubot.3b">Babli 3b</a>. As S. Lieberman points out (<i>Tosefta ki-Fshutah</i> vol. 6, p. 187), “danger” always refers to the persecutions after the war of Bar Kokhba, when Jewish observances were forbidden and, therefore, marrying on Wednesday would have been a capital crime. (The Babli explains otherwise.)</i> they used to marry on Tuesdays and the Sages did not object; about Monday one does not listen to him, but if it was because of a danger it is permitted. What is “because of a danger”? because of sorcery<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody is afraid that sorceresses will put a spell on him to make him impotent if he marries on a day known to be a day for marrying, one lets him marry on any other day.</i>. What is the difference between Monday and Tuesday? One who waits one day cannot be compared to one who waits two days. Why not let him wait two days? That his acquisition should not be sweet for him. Why should his acquisition not be sweet for him? One cannot tolerate it, since Rebbi Hila said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, if he found the door open, he is forbidden to keep her because she might have been unfaithful<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Here סוֹטָה means “unfaithful, deviant” in a general sense, not in the technical sense discussed in Tractate <i>Soṭah</i>. R. Eleazar holds that the Mishnah does not only give the husband the right to complain about lack of virginity but obligates him to go to court to annul his marriage since nobody can stay married to an adulterous wife (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 5:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.5.1.1">Mishnah <i>Soṭah</i> 5:1</a>) and he presumes his bride was deflowered after she was preliminarily married to him, up to a year earlier. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 8b-9a" href="/Ketubot.8b-9a">Babli, 8b/9a</a>, the same argument is quoted in his name.</i>. Could we not suspect that she was raped<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">If a married woman is raped, the husband does not have to divorce her unless he is a Cohen.</i>? A rape is public knowledge. And even if you suspect that she was raped, there is no other doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>editio princeps</i>: לֹא סָפֵק <b>אֶחָד</b> “is there not <i>only one</i> doubt?” It is a generally recognized principle in both Talmudim that a single doubt referring to biblical precepts has to be judged restrictively, a double doubt leniently. Cf <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 7:3:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.7.3.5"><i>Yebamot</i> 7:2, Note 73</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 3a" href="/Beitzah.3a">Babli <i>Beṣah</i>3a</a>.</i>. There is a doubt whether she was raped or whether she was [willingly] opened<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">If she was a willing partner to adultery. This only applies to a girl which has the status of adolescent since “the seduction of a minor is rape” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 33b" href="/Yevamot.33b">Babli <i>Yebamot</i> 33b</a>).</i>. From the words of the Torah one has to be stringent. Rebbi Yose said, if you suspect that she was raped, there are two doubts. There is a doubt whether she was raped or whether she was [willingly] opened; there is a doubt whether it happened after she was preliminarily married or before. From the words of the Torah, with two doubts one has to be lenient<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The husband who claims that his bride was not a virgin is not obligated to divorce his wife against his will; R. Eleazar’s interpretation of the Mishnah is rejected by R. Yose.</i>.
If he performed the preliminary marriage in the bridal chamber, these strictures do not apply. They said that Rebbi Mattaniah acted thus for his daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If the preliminary marriage (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 6:2:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.6.2.6"><i>Peah</i> 6:2, Note 46</a>) precedes the final marriage ceremony only by a few moments, the bride could not possibly have committed adultery and R. Eleazar’s argument becomes pointless.<br>R. Mattaniah’s procedure was adopted by all Jewish groups (except that the bridal chamber was transformed into a canopy, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.3">Note 15</a>.) To separate the preliminary from the final marriage, one spends some time by publicly reading the marriage contract. However, it seems that the current procedure is not derived from any talmudic statement but is a consequence of the poverty of the remnants of the Jewish communities in Western Europe after the devastation of the First Crusade which did not allow most people to organize two festivities, one for the preliminary and a separate one for the definitive wedding; cf. I. Schepansky, התקנות בישׂראל, vol. 3, Jerusalem-NewYork 1992, pp. שע-שעא.</i>.<br>In the opinion of Rebbi Eleazar, could she be married any day at a place where courts are in session every day<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 3a" href="/Ketubot.3a">Babli, 3a</a>, (and at the end also in the Yerushalmi, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.10">Note 66</a>) this is accepted as a declarative sentence (subject to the condition that the groom spend three days to prepare the wedding feast.)</i>? And at a place where there are no courts (every day)<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">An erroneous corrector’s addition (reproduced in <i>editio princeps</i>).</i> could she never be married? One does not want to abolish the time of Wednesday<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Nobody challenges the first statement in the Mishnah, even if they disagree with the meaning of the later part of that Mishnah.</i>. Why does one not want to abolish the time of Wednesday? Because he<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eleazar accepts that the Wednesday/Thursday combination is preferable over Sunday/Monday, even though local courts always also sit on Monday.</i> also accepts what Bar Qappara stated. Bar Qappara said, because a blessing is written there. Could she not be married on Sunday, that he might quickly go to court on Monday? Some want to say, not to abolish the time of Wednesday; some want to say, because of what Bar Qappara stated, for Bar Qappara said, because a blessing is written there<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 3b" href="/Ketubot.3b">Babli, 3b</a>, the reason of the rejection is that the groom has to spend three days to prepare the wedding feast.</i>.
One agrees that she should not be married either Friday or Saturday night. Not on Friday, for the honor of the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">That the wedding feast should not impinge on the observance of the Sabbath and the Sabbath meal. As noted above, the wedding of a widow, which proceeds without great fanfare, may be scheduled for Friday.</i>. Not Saturday night: The colleagues say, because of the exertion; Rebbi Yose says, for the honor of the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That he should not prepare on the Sabbath for the feast scheduled directly after nightfall; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 5a" href="/Ketubot.5a">Babli 5a</a>.</i>. A <i>baraita</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 2a" href="/Ketubot.2a">Babli 2a</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 3a" href="/Ketubot.3a">3a</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 5a" href="/Ketubot.5a">5a</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 7a" href="/Ketubot.7a">7a</a>. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta, 1:1</a>, this is given as an alternative to the reason explained in the Mishnah.</i> supports the colleagues: Why did they say, a virgin is married on Wednesday? That a man should prepare for his needs<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The wedding feast.</i> three consecutive days.
<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The parallels are in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 5:2:2-16" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Beitzah.5.2.2-16"><i>Beṣah</i> 5:2</a> (63, 1. 64) and <i>Ta‘aniot</i> 4:9 (69b, 1. 50).</i> Rebbi Abba bar Cohen said before Rebbi Yose: Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Jacob bar Idi: A man may not [preliminarily] marry on a Friday. That means, to make an engagement feast<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since this would impinge on the Sabbath meal. It is in order to make the preliminary marriage on Friday and arrange the engagement feast as the Sabbath meal.</i>. This implies that the preliminary marriage itself is permitted. Samuel says, even on the Ninth of Ab<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The anniversary of both destructions of the Temple, the most severe day of mourning in the Jewish calendar, where any exhibition of joy is frowned upon.</i> a preliminary marriage is permitted, lest another forestall him. The argument of Samuel seems inverted. There<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">A similar argument in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 18b" href="/Moed_Katan.18b">Babli, <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 18b</a>.</i>, he says, “God puts singles in a house, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 68:7" href="/Psalms.68.7"><i>Ps</i>. 68:7</a>.

Therefore, one judges money matters<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition is explicitly restricted to criminal matters.</i>! Also, Rebbi Ḥiyya stated thus: One judges money matters on Friday but not criminal matters.

Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Crispus: An adult woman is like an open amphora<sup class="footnote-marker">47,</sup><i class="footnote">Once she is older than 1½ years, her body is so soft that the rupture of the hymen may not be noticed.

R. Eleazar holds that the Mishnah does not only give the husband the right to complain about lack of virginity but obligates him to go to court to annul his marriage since nobody can stay married to an adulterous wife (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 5:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.5.1.1">Mishnah <i>Soṭah</i> 5:1</a>) and he presumes his bride was deflowered after she was preliminarily married to him, up to a year earlier. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 8b-9a" href="/Ketubot.8b-9a">Babli, 8b/9a</a>, the same argument is quoted in his name.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel case in the Babli, 9a, the argument ascribed here to R. Yose (Notes 21-23) is used to restrict R. Eleazar's statement to the case of either a Cohen (who has to divorce his wife in case of rape) or a person who preliminarily married a girl aged less than 3 full years (who could not have had premarital sex). Note also the change of language: R. Hila in the name of R. Eleazar states that he <i>is forbidden to keep her</i>; here he <i>is not authorized</i> to keep her. As Rashi explains in the Babli, there one treats the case that the husband comes to court to report the case and is ready to be convinced if the proceedings clear his wife. In the Yerushalmi one treats the case that the husband comes to complain convinced that his bride was unfaithful after preliminary marriage. Then one follows the principle that if somebody is convinced that something is forbidden, one cannot permit it.<br>Since the husband is only subjectively forbidden to keep his wife who objectively may have been a virgin, he has to pay the full amount of her ketubah since obligations based on written contracts can be abolished only by a full proof of the guilt of the beneficiary.</i>. This also applies to what Rebbi Ḥanina said, since Rebbi Ḥanina said: It happened that a woman was found without virginity and the case came before Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 10b" href="/Ketubot.10b">Babli, 10b</a>, a woman did not bleed when deflowered and Rabban Gamliel the elder accepted the fact that not to bleed was hereditary in her family and told the husband to enjoy his wife.

She said, the stairs in my father’s house were high and it was rubbed off. Rebbi believed her. That means, not to let her lose her <i>ketubah</i>.

Why should she not be believed<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">If she claims to have been a virgin at the time of the final marriage ceremony.</i>?

R.

There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 7:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.7.7.1">Mishnah 7:8</a>.

If the disagreement surfaces before the final marriage, the burden of proof is on the father; after that, the burden of proof is on the husband.</i>: “If she had bodily defects while still in her father’s house, the father has to bring proof.” Rebbi Eleazar asked Rebbi Joḥanan: Is this Mishnah from Rabban Gamliel and Rebbi Eliezer? Not from Rebbi Joshua<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Since R.

There is a difference because bodily defects have a way to appear<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">For problems that have to be expected, the person in control of the place where they happened is responsible. In Halakhah 7:8, it is stated that in the matter of very frequent defects, the husband can complain if at the start he had stipulated that the bride be free from even the most minute impairment.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, formerly we saw rabbis who compared bodily defects to [defects of] virginity.

If the final marriage ceremony is held at the father’s house, then in case of a blemish the burden of proof would have to be on the father; therefore, for the claim of missing virginity the father has to bring proof that his daughter either was a virgin at the moment of final marriage or lost her virginity in a manner which did not impair the validity of the marriage.</i>. Claims of missing virginity from bodily defects<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Again, this should be inverted: Rules for claims about blemishes derived from rules of complaints about virginity.</i>: For if she developed bodily defects and there is a doubt whether it happened after she entered his domain or before she entered his domain, the husband has to provide proof, from claims of missing virginity. But if she lost her virginity, was it not in her father’s house? Nevertheless, you say, the husband has to provide proof<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">This follows only Rabban Gamliel and R.

Eliezer); this is stated explicitly in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 12b" href="/Ketubot.12b">Babli (12b</a>). In the Mishnah here it is agreed that the loss of virginity occured in her father’s house.

A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “If two are saying, she was kidnapped but is pure, and two are saying, she was kidnapped and is impure, she should not get married, but if she married she should not leave.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 2:2" href="/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).2.2">Tosephta <i>Ketubot</i> 2:2</a>. The kidnap victim who was raped cannot marry a Cohen.</i>” Rebbi Yose said, since these say, she is pure, and those say, she is impure, it is as if two said, she was kidnapped, and two said, she was not kidnapped, and we depend on what she says. If two are saying, she had been betrothed and two are saying she had not been betrothed. Rebbi Jonah compares that to fat. If two said, X ate fat, and two said, X did not eat fat, did he not have to bring a “hung” reparation sacrifice because of the doubt? Here, he should give a bill of divorce because of the doubt. Rebbi Yose said to him, do not compare this to fat, because even if he says my conscience bothers me, he brings a “hung” reparation sacrifice. A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Yose: If two are saying she had been betrothed and two are saying she had not been betrothed, she should not get married. The end disagrees with Rebbi Jonah: If she married she must leave. Rebbi Mana said, Rebbi Yose did not say that she may marry, nor did Rebbi Jonah say if she married she must leave, he said only, do not compare this to fat, because even if he says my conscience bothers me, he brings a “hung” reparation sacrifice.

Joḥanan is confirmed by the Babli, but not its explanation.</i>. Rav Ḥuna said, only if he remembers his testimony. Rebbi Joḥanan said, even if he does not remember his testimony. It turns out that Rav Ḥuna follows Rebbi and Rebbi Joḥanan the Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">It is obvious that nobody has to refresh his memory in order to identify his signature, so the difference must be about testifying to the substance of the document. R. Joḥanan follows the Sages since his testimony about his signature certifies the document and any additional information is ancillary but for Rav Huna the testimony about the signature says nothing about the contents of the document; any additional testimony must be <i>by the mouth</i> of the witnesses and not by his writing.

If the surviving witness were enabled to testify to his own signature and, with the help of an unrelated person, to that of the other witness, then 75% of the testimony would be from one witness (100% of his own half and 50% of the other half). But testimony of witnesses is acceptable only if both of them have equal validity.<br>The paragraph appears also in <i>Roš Haššanah</i> 2:1, 57d.</i>. How is that? If one identified his own signature<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Which he is enabled to do by the Mishnah following the Sages.</i> and that of his colleague, but that second witness’s signature was not known to anybody<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">In court.</i> except his colleague, may that colleague together with somebody from the market place<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">I. e., unconnected with the court and the parties before the court.</i> testify on that signature? That is what Rebbi Ze‘ira, Rav Ḥuna, said in the name of Rav: One witness and someone from the market cannot together certify the signature of the second witness. Another case where there are no two persons: The signature of one is known by everybody, but that second witness’s signature is not known to anybody except his colleague. Can that colleague testify on his signature as if he were someone from the market place? If you say so, the entire testimony is confirmed by one witness. Rebbi Yudan said, that is correct. If two people come from a town that is mostly Gentile, like Hippos<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">On the mountain ridge overlooking the Eastern Shore of Lake Genezareth.</i>.

<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel (with very minor deviations) to the remainder of the Halakhah is in <i>Terumot</i> 7:1, fully explained there in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:2:1-5:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.2.1-5.4">Notes 3–73</a>, shortened also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 7:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.7.2.2"><i>Baba Qama</i> 7:2</a> (fol. 5d), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Makkot 1:1:2-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Makkot.1.1.2-8"><i>Makkot</i> 1:1</a> (fol. 31a); <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 32b" href="/Ketubot.32b">Babli <i>Ketubot</i>32b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 36a" href="/Bava_Kamma.36a"><i>Baba Qama</i> 36a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Makkot 7b" href="/Makkot.7b"><i>Makkot</i> 7b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Makkot 13b" href="/Makkot.13b">13b</a>. The variant readings from Terumot are noted ת.</i> There, we have stated: “If somebody eats heave intentionally, he pays the principal but not the fifth.” And we have stated: “The following are flogged.” Here you say, he is flogged, and there you say, he pays. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Mishnah is two-sided: If he was cautioned, he is flogged; if he was not cautioned, he pays. Rebbi Joḥanan is of the opinion that in a case where there is flogging or restitution, when he pays he is not flogged. Why should he not be flogged and have to pay? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:2" href="/Deuteronomy.25.2"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>) “Corresponding to his guilt.” You sentence him for one offence but you may not sentence him for two offences. The verse speaks of one who may incur two punishments (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:2" href="/Deuteronomy.25.2"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>): “The judge shall have him laid down and flogged in his presence a number [of times] because of his guilt.”
<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The text in <i>Terumot</i> is close enough that the explanations given there are valid here, but the details of the texts differ too much to be presented as variant readings of one and the same text.</i> Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, even if he was not cautioned should he not pay since when cautioned he would be flogged? A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: “If somebody eats heave in error, he pays principal and fifth<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 6:1.</i>,” but if he was cautioned, will he not be flogged? He explains it following Rebbi Meïr since Rebbi Meïr said, he is flogged and pays. A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, as we have stated: “The following adolescent girls can claim a fine,” but if he was cautioned, will he not be flogged? He explains it following Rebbi Meïr since Rebbi Meïr said, he is flogged and pays. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Rebbi Meïr learned from the calumniator. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:18" href="/Deuteronomy.22.18"><i>Deut</i>. 22:18</a>) “They shall punish him,” flogging; (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:19" href="/Deuteronomy.22.19"><i>Deut</i>. 22:19</a>) “and they shall fine him”, money. But the rabbis say, [the law of] the calumniator is separate because of its novelty; one cannot learn from a novelty! Because nowhere else will a person become guilty by speech, but here he becomes guilty by speech; therefore, nothing can be inferred. Another explanation: one cannot transfer the rules of either payment or flogging. Did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If he [eats] fat in error but is intentional about the sacrifice, if he was cautioned he will be flogged and has to bring a sacrifice? So here, he is flogged and he pays. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:2" href="/Deuteronomy.25.2"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>) “Because of his guilt.” If two possibilities are given to the court, one chooses one of them. This excludes matters in the power of Heaven.
Everybody agrees that there is no money payment in capital cases, as it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 24:21" href="/Leviticus.24.21"><i>Lev</i>. 24:21</a>): “The slayer of an animal must pay for it but the slayer of a human shall be put to death.” Just as you did not make a difference between unintentional and intentional action of a slayer of an animal to force him to pay money, so you should not make a difference between unintentional and intentional action of a slayer of a human to free him from paying money. Where do they differ? About money in a flogging case. Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is no money in a capital case but there is money in a flogging case, but Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, just as there is no money in a capital case so there is no money in a flogging case.
Rebbi Immi the Babylonian in the name of the rabbis from there: The reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish is “criminal, criminal.” “Criminal” is mentioned in capital cases, “criminal” is mentioned in cases of flogging. Just as for the criminal in capital cases there is no monetary fine, so for the criminal mentioned in flogging cases there is no monetary fine.
Nathan bar Hoshiah said, one speaks about an adolescent girl, the other about an adult woman. The adolescent has a fine but nobody is flogged for her; for the adult he is flogged but pays no fine, she cannot be sold; she has no claim for shame and blemish. The rabbis of Caesarea said, explain it that she seduced him or remitted [the fine] for him. Nathan bar Hoshaiah thinks that in a case of flogging and payment he pays but is not flogged. Why should he not be flogged and have to pay? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:2" href="/Deuteronomy.25.2"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>) “Because of his guilt.” You sentence him for one offence but you may not sentence him for two offences. From perjured witnesses. Just as you say there, perjured witnesses pay but are not flogged, here also he pays and is not flogged. Rebbi Jonah said, the reason of Rebbi Nathan bar Hoshaiah: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:2" href="/Deuteronomy.25.2"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>): “For his evil deed.” It refers to one whose flogging frees him from his guilt, excluding one who is told: get up and pay.
Our Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish! “If somebody eats heave intentionally he pays the principal but not the fifth.” In the opinion of Nathan bar Hoshaiah who said he pays, it is understandable. In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan who said, if he was cautioned he is flogged, but if he was not cautioned he pays, he explains it as intentional without cautioning. In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish there is no difference between intentional and unintentional, between cautioned or not cautioned. He explains following Rebbi Meïr who says, he is flogged and he pays.
Rebbi Ḥinena said before Rebbi Mana: Even if Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish thought the entire Mishnaiot were Rebbi Meïr’s, does the verse agree with Rebbi Meïr? Is it not written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:14" href="/Leviticus.22.14"><i>Lev</i>. 22:14</a>): “If a person ate consecrated food in error”? But Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish must hold that the fifth is a sacrifice. But even if he holds that the fifth is a sacrifice, can the principal be a sacrifice? Rebbi Yudan bar Shalom said, the Mishnah declares that the principal is a fine, as we have stated: “He does not pay in heave but in totally profane food which is turned into heave.” If he had to pay from what he ate, it would be fine. And it was stated: “If he ate impure heave, he has to pay in pure profane food, but if he paid in impure profane, he discharged his obligation.” Does he not owe him the price of wood? That shows that the principal is a fine and since the principal is a fine, the fifth also is a fine. But Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish follows his own opinion. Just as Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, there, everybody was under the obligation of (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 20:16" href="/Exodus.20.16"><i>Ex</i>. 20:16</a>) “Do not become a false witness against your neighbor”, but this one was treated separately, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:19" href="/Deuteronomy.19.19"><i>Deut</i>. 19:19</a>) “do to him what he intended to do to his brother”, to pay money; also here, everybody was under the obligation of (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:10" href="/Leviticus.22.10"><i>Lev</i>. 22:10</a>) “no outsider shall eat holy [food],” but this one was treated separately, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:14" href="/Leviticus.22.14"><i>Lev</i>. 22:14</a>) “if somebody should eat holy [food] in error,” to pay money.
Did we not state: The Sages admit to Rebbi Meïr that one who stole his neighbor’s heave is flogged and has to pay since whoever eats heave is flogged. Did we not state: The Sages admit to Rebbi Meïr that one who stole his neighbor’s fat is flogged and has to pay since whoever eats fat is flogged. Did we not state: The Sages admit to Rebbi Meïr that one who muzzled his neighbor’s cow is flogged and has to pay six <i>qab</i> per cow and four <i>qab</i> for a donkey since whoever muzzles his cow is flogged. Rebbi Yose said, the same holds if death is the penalty. If he stole Temple heave and ate it, he is whipped and has to pay since in any case he caused monetary loss.
Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose: If it is so, he who sleeps with his minor sister should be flogged and have to pay since if he sleeps with his adult sister he is flogged. He reversed himself and said, there death and payment fall on him simultaneously. But here, when he muzzled he is subject to flogging but only later for payment. Rebbi Ze‘ira objected before Rebbi Mana: He who sets fire to his neighbor’s grain stack on the Sabbath is subject to capital punishment from the first ear but only later for payment! One cannot say that because for every single ear there is cautioning for the death penalty. Here also, for every moment of muzzling there is cautioning for flogging. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, two Amoraïm. One said, if he muzzled for heave which is Temple property. The other one said, if he muzzled through an agent. Then the agent is flogged and he is free (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 17:4" href="/Leviticus.17.4"><i>Lev</i>. 17:4</a>): “As a blood guilt it will be charged on <i>this</i> man,” not on his employers.
In error for heave and intentional for leavened, in error for heave and intentional for <i>nazir</i>, in error for heave and intentional for the Day of Atonement. If one explains it with two things, it is fine. If one explains it for one, this is the disagreement of Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish.
There, we have stated: “The only difference between the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement is that intentional infraction of the former is punished by the hands of man, but intentional infraction of the latter is punished by extirpation.” Therefore, for payment both follow the same rules. This is by Rebbi Neḥoniah ben Haqanah since “Rebbi Neḥoniah ben Haqanah says, the Day of Atonement follows the rules of Sabbath for payment. But Rebbi Simeon ben Menassiah says those subject to extirpation equal those subject to capital punishment.” What is between them? Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Avina said, a menstruating adolescent girl is between them. Rebbi Mana said, also his wife’s sister is between them. In the opinion of Rebbi Neḥoniah ben Haqanah, just as the Sabbath does not become permitted after its prohibition started; so theDay of Atonement does not become permitted after its prohibition started. However, these may become permitted after their prohibition started, he has to pay. But Rebbi Simeon ben Menassiah said, extirpation applies to the Sabbath and the day of Atonement; extirpation does not apply to these, he has to pay.
Rebbi Judah bar Pazi asked: What say these Tannaïm about whipping and extirpation? Rebbi Yose said, that is a problem for the rabbis. Rebbi Jonah said, why can we not understand it from what Rebbi Simeon ben Ioḥai stated? As Rebbi Simeon ben Ioḥai stated: “Rebbi Ṭarphon says, extirpation was mentioned for the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement. Since for extirpation mentioned for the Sabbath there is no payment in a case involving the death penalty, so for extirpation mentioned for the Day of Atonement there is no payment in a case involving extirpation.” Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose: When do we need this? Not for Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish? But for Rebbi Joḥanan, if he admits flogging in death penalty cases, certainly flogging in extirpation cases, since they disagreed: If somebody slaughters [an animal] and its young for idolatrous purposes. Rebbi Joḥanan says, if he was cautioned about an animal and its young, he is flogged, about idolatry, he is stoned to death. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, even if he was cautioned about an animal and its young, he is not flogged since he would be stoned to death had he been cautioned about idolatry. He said to him, we need it even for Rebbi Joḥanan! Here are two cases, there it is one case.
According to Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, what is between these Tannaïm and those rabbis? Prohibitions without extirpation. Rebbi Judan said, he who sleeps with a bastard girl is between them. Rebbi Ḥananiah said, he who puts fire to the grain stack of his neighbor on a holiday is between them. These Tannaïm think, since there is no extirpation, he pays. Those rabbis think, since there is flogging he does not pay. But then “these are the adolescent girls who can claim a fine” cannot follow the rabbis! Rebbi Mattaniah said, explain it according to everybody if it refers to a bastard male who sleeps with a bastard girl.
But is his brother’s wife not his sister-in-law? Explain it that the man’s brother had children and had performed the preliminary wedding with a woman when he died and [the surviving] brother came and raped her.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The seducer pays for three things and the rapist for four. The seducer pays for shame, diminution of value<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The computation of payments for shame and diminution of value are explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.8.1">Mishnah 8</a>. Usually, the diminution of value refers to the loss of virginity but, in the case of forcible rape, it may also include the consequences of bodily injury such as a scar or a broken bone.</i>, and fine. The rapist in addition pays for suffering; the seducer does not pay for suffering. The rapist pays immediately, the seducer only if he divorces her<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The rapist’s fine is formulated as a fine in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:29" href="/Deuteronomy.22.29"><i>Deut</i>. 22:29</a>. That verse, stipulating that the fine goes to the father, then decrees that the rapist has to marry his victim and is barred from ever divorcing her. In contrast, the payment of the seducer is formulated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:16" href="/Exodus.22.16"><i>Ex</i>. 22:16</a> as payment of a virgin’s <i>ketubah</i> in case of a divorce.</i>. The rapist drinks from his pot<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">He has to marry her even if she is ugly and deformed.</i>; the seducer may divorce if he wishes.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The seducer pays three,” etc. This does not follow Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon freed the rapist from paying for suffering<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 39a" href="/Ketubot.39a">Babli, 39a</a>, there is a short discussion on what the suffering is for which the rapist has to pay. In the opinion of Samuel, represented in the Yerushalmi by his student’s student Rav Ḥisda, it is the suffering inflicted by the attack. This is rejected in the Babli, since R. Simeon could not have opposed that payment. The payment for suffering therefore is restricted in the Babli to payment for the pain caused by the rupture of the hymen. In contrast, the Yerushalmi starts out with assuming that the pain is that of the deflowering and ends up with embracing the point of view of Samuel.</i>. To what can you compare this? To one who cuts somebody’s wart when that one would have cut it himself in the future. To what can you compare this? To one who cuts somebody’s trees when that one would have cut them himself in the future. They said to him, you cannot compare one who is deflowered by rape to one who is deflowered by consent; you cannot compare one who is deflowered on a dungheap to one who is deflowered in the bridal chamber! How does Rebbi Simeon interpret ’’because he mistreated her”? They said in the name of Rav Ḥisda, explain it that he raped her on thorns.
“The seducer only if he divorces her,” etc. Rav Ḥisda said, if he does not want to keep her. But if he decides to keep her, he does not give anything. Rebbi Ismael stated: “He should weigh silver appropriate for the bride-price of virgins<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:16" href="/Exodus.22.16"><i>Ex</i>. 22:16</a>, speaking of the seducer.

Rebbi Eleazar asked: Do the daughters of the rape victim have the rights given by the <i>ketubah</i> stipulations<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.4.1">Mishnaiot 4:8–12</a> contain a number of stipulations which the courts will enforce whether or not they were written in the <i>ketubah</i> document. The one in question here (Mishnah 11) states that the daughters, who do not inherit in the presence of sons, will have to be fed and lodged from the inheritance until they marry (they have a lien on the inheritance which has to be satisfied before the sons, the heirs, can take any money from the inheritance.) Since R. Ismael stated in the preceding paragraph that the seducer has to write a virgin’s <i>ketubah</i>, it is clear to him that <i>all</i> stipulations of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.4.1">Mishnaiot 4:8–12</a> apply to the future children of the seduced girl. The only problem is with the rape victim who, never facing divorce, does not have a <i>ketubah</i> in the opinion of the rabbis who disagree with R. Yose ben R. Jehudah later in this paragraph. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 54a" href="/Ketubot.54a">Babli, 54a</a>, this question is also asked and similarly left unanswered. In practice, this is a negative answer since “the burden of proof is on the claimant” and in the absence of a rule the daughters cannot prove their claim.</i>? It is clear to me that the rape victim has no [<i>ketubah</i>] of the male children, and that the seduced victim has no [<i>ketubah</i>] of the male children<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>ketubah</i> of male children (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 4:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.4.10.1">Mishnah 4:10</a>) stipulates that if a man has sons from different wives, the amounts of the different <i>ketubot</i> are first taken from the inheritance and distributed among the sons of the wives; the remainder is then split evenly among the sons (except that an eventual male firstborn takes a double portion). The reason given for this stipulation is that fathers should be encouraged to give their daughters ample dowries which become part of the <i>ketubah</i> obligations of their husbands, to make them attractive to prospective suitors. Therefore, the stipulation is necessary to insure that the property remains in the possession of the direct descendants of the givers. But since the rape victim and the seduced girl are married by biblical decree, they cannot expect dowries.</i>. If you say that he questions in both cases, we could ask, do the daughters of the rape victim and the daughters of the seduced girl have the rights given by the <i>ketubah</i> stipulations? That is a problem following the rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">And is unanswered.</i>, but it is obvious following Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah; as it was stated: Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah says, the rapist gives a mina as <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the seducer who writes the <i>ketubah</i> of a virgin for a minimal sum of 200 <i>zuz</i>, the rapist already paid the fine of 200 <i>zuz</i> to the girl’s father. He therefore writes for his wife an additional <i>ketubah</i> of the non-virgin.</i>.

The adult, neither sale nor fine<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">In the Bablylonian sources (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 40b" href="/Ketubot.40b">Babli 40b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 29a" href="/Ketubot.29a">29a</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Ketubot (Lieberman) 3:8" href="/Tosefta_Ketubot_(Lieberman).3.8">Tosephta 3:8</a>), R. Meïr is reported to decree sale but no fine for a girl from the age of one day until adolescence, fine but no sale for the adolescent, and nothing for the adult. Since for a rape at age below three years the hymen is supposed to repair itself, there is no place for the fine at that age. The statement that a father cannot sell his daughter once she reaches the age of marriage, 3 years and one day, is found only here. In any case, the statement is purely theoretical since the institution of Hebrew slaves was not re-established on the return from Babylonia even though the girl was supposed to be sold in marriage.</i>. Following the rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babylonian sources, the rabbis hold that a daughter can be sold until she becomes an adolescent and she can claim the fine starting at the age of 3 years and one day.

Therefore, it seems that the statements regarding girls below and above the age of 3 years and one day should be switched.</i>: From one day old until the age of 3 years and one day there is sale and fine together.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Payments for shame, diminution of value, and fine of a seduced adolescent girl belong to her father, as are payments for suffering for the victim of an attack. If she appeared in court during her father’s lifetime, they are the father’s; after the father’s death they are the brothers’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The claim to the payments is established with the first appearance of the claimants before the court (today one would say with the filing of court papers.)

Cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.7.2">Chapter 3, Note 109</a>. Once the claim is noted as the father’s, upon the father’s death it becomes part of the estate which is inherited by the male children.

But since the text nowhere gives monetary rights deriving from male children to the father, the question is who receives payments which do not depend on the sex of the child. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 87" href="/Bava_Kamma.87">Babli, <i>Baba Qama</i> 87a/b</a>, states flatly that the father has no claims to sums due under laws which are independent of the sex of the injured party.</i>.

In Babli and Tosephta, he is never required to pay anything to his own underage children of either sex.<br>It is clear that in the case of the father attacking his own daughter, “diminution of value” must refer to damage done to her physical appearance, not defloration. Since sexual relations with one’s daughter are a capital crime, no payment can be demanded (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 4:4:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.4.4.8">Note 111</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:1:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.1.7">Chapter 3:1 Note 30</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 7:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.7.1.2"><i>Terumot</i> 7:1 Note 5</a> ff.)</i>.

This is then explained away as referring to children who no longer live at home. In the Yerushalmi, payments for shame and diminution of value belong to the father; of the others he collects the yield of the capital until the daughter reaches adulthood. The treatments in the two Talmudim have very few points in common even though they are based on almost identical tannaitic texts.</i>, but payments for shame and diminution of value belong to her father.
What did you see to say so<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Mishnah, that if the case came to court after the father’s death the fine is not part of the inheritance but belongs to the girl even if she still is supported by the brothers and her earnings go to them.</i>?

Therefore, in the absence of a father, or if the girl is no longer in his <i>potestas</i>, one may disregard the mention of the father and read the verse as an obligation to pay the girl.</i>” How is this? If there were court proceedings<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This quotes the language of the Babli Mishnah, cf.

Rebbi Jehudah says, even the poorest in Israel should not provide for her less than two flutes and one wailing woman.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The father has the benefit to give his daughter,” etc. One understands that the father has a benefit from money or contract. By intercourse? Explain it that [the groom] said to [the father]: When your daughter becomes mine by intercourse, this money shall be your property.
“He has the right to what she finds.” Rebbi Zakkai from Alexandria asked: How do you treat what she found on [her] field<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">A field which she inherited from her mother’s side and to whose yield the father has no claim.</i>, as a find or as her usufruct?

Zakkai’s question is not answered, the fact that only one interpretation is analyzed further seems to indicate that anything she finds on her field belongs to her.</i>.
“If she is definitively married, the husband in addition eats usufruct in her lifetime,” as a regulation they instituted that he should oversee his wife’s property and eat from it. Is it also thus for the father? Without incentives the father overseas the daughter’s property; should he eat? “He is required to pay for her upkeep and her ransom.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">This is an unnecessary quote from the Mishnah; the text continues to refer to the wife’s property.</i>” It was stated: If the husband said, it is impossible for me to eat and to oversee, one does not listen to him<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is a generally valid regulation, the court cannot relieve the husband from caring for his wife’s property.

“And her burial.” It was stated: If the husband refused to bury her, the father buries her and recovers his expenses in court. Rebbi Ḥaggai said, they said only, the father. Therefore, a third party cannot recover. Rebbi Yose says, both the father and also a third party can recover.

Therefore, the father can recover. Rebbi Yose says, neither the father nor a third party can recover. In the opinion of Rebbi Ḥaggai, both for burial and for upkeep the father can recover, a third party cannot recover.

The House of Hillel insist on interpretation of the <i>ketubah.</i> Hillel the Elder explained it, using the vernacular. In Alexandria they were writing that a man there became betrothed to a woman. Another man abducted her from a public place. When this came before the Sages, they intended to declare [the children] as bastards. Hillel the Elder told them, bring your mothers’ <i>ketubah.</i> They brough their mothers’ <i>ketubah.</i> They found written there: “When you enter my house you shall be my wife according to the laws of Moses and the Jews.”
The House of Shammai insist on interpretation of the <i>ketubah.</i> As the House of Shammai explain, the text of her <i>ketubah</i> document teaches, for he writes: “If you would be married to another man you shall take the amount I wrote for you.” The House of Hillel reversed themselves and taught following the House of Shammai.
Rebbi Meïr insists on interpreting the contract text. Rebbi Meïr explained, if somebody accepts a field as a contractor, at the moment [he] accepts, one estimates how much it is expected to yield and he gives to [the owner]. Because the standard contract reads: “If I let it lie fallow and do not work on it, I shall pay as if from the best.”
Rebbi Jehudah insists on interpreting the contract text. Rebbi Jehudah explained: A man brings for his wife any sacrifice she is obligated for, even if she ate suet or desecrated the Sabbath. Also, Rebbi Jehudah says, once he divorces her, he is no longer obligated for her, for she writes to him “any other obligations that may come to you from me from earlier times.”
Rebbi Yose insists on interpreting the contract text. Rebbi Yose explained: In a place where one treats the <i>ketubah</i> as a loan, she collects the entire amount. Where one doubles, she collects only half the amount. Rebbi Eleazar the caper grower insists on interpreting the contract text. Rebbi Eleazar the caper grower explained: nobody is permitted to buy domesticated or wild animals or birds unless he has food prepared for them. Rebbi Joshua ben Qorḥa insists on interpreting the contract text. Rebbi Joshua ben Qorḥa explained: a person lending money to another person should not take pledges except in court; he should not enter [the debtor’s] house to take the pledge, for he writes to him: “It will be paid by the property that came to my hand that I shall acquire corresponding to this [sum].”<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">In the text of <i>Yebamot</i>: “a person lending money to another person should not take pledges from him for more than the value of the loan since he writes for him: It will be paid …” That text should be considered the correct one since (a) it refers to the text of the contract and (b) the statement here is a biblical commandment (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:10-11" href="/Deuteronomy.24.10-11"><i>Deut.</i> 24:10–11</a>).</i>
Rav Huna insists on interpreting the contract text. Rav Huna explained: “The sons shall inherit but the daughters must be fed.” Since the sons inherit movables, the daughters also are fed from movables. Samuel said, the daughters are not fed from movables. A Mishnah supports Samuel: “The female children you shall have from me shall dwell in my house and be supported from my property.” It was stated on this: From real estate but not from movables. Rebbi Abba bar Zavda said: Rav Huna follows Rebbi and Samuel follows Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar, as it was stated: “One uses both guaranteed property and non-guaranteed property for the support of the wife and the daughters, the words of Rebbi. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says, guaranteed property may be taken by sons from sons, by daughters from daughters, by sons from daughters, and by daughters from sons. But non-guaranteed property may be taken by sons from daughters but not by daughters from sons.” They said, Rav Huna reversed himself. They said, that was well done, <i>ketubah</i> is a biblical commandment but support of the daughters is from their words. May their words uproot a biblical commandment?

“If somebody who works his wife’s property has the intention of divorcing her and goes and takes from the ground, he is quick and is rewarded. If somebody who works the property of prisoners heard that they prepare to return, goes and takes from the ground, he is quick and is rewarded. These are properties of prisoners: In any case where his father, brother, or any person from whom he might inherit, went overseas; it was heard that they died, and he went to work the inheritance. But property of abandoning persons one takes out of their hands. These are properties of abandoning persons: In any case where his father or any person from whom he might inherit went overseas, he did not hear that they died, but he went to work the inheritance. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, I heard that there is no difference between prisoners and abandoning persons. But property of broken persons one takes out of their hands. These are properties of broken persons: In any case where his father, brother, or any person from whom he might inherit, went overseas, and his whereabouts are not known. Samuel says, the prisoner is one who left involuntarily. If he had left voluntarily he would have given him instructions. The abandoning person is one who left voluntarily. You should know that he had the intention of keeping [the relative] off his property since he left voluntarily and did not give him instructions.

Rebbi Mana said, since the house is not worth more than 10 it is as if her <i>ketubah</i> was only 10<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence certainly is correct in <i>Rosh</i> and incorrect in the ms.</i>. One concludes that if she says real estate and they say money, the law sides with the heirs. <br>The following is Rosh’s explanation (Chapter 4, #29): “This is the explanation: What are the rules if there was no house there appropriate as a dwelling for the widow and the orphans together? They said to him, the orphans rent a house for her and if she says, real estate, i. e., ‘I want to dwell in my husband’s house’, but they say money, ‘we rent you an apartment but we want to dwell [in the house]’, the law sides with the heirs since she has no property rights in the real estate, only an easement. Therefore, they can rent an apartment for her and they can dwell in that house. {And what we say that she has the right to continue living in her husband’s dwelling (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 12:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.12.3.1">Mishnah 12:3</a>), that is if the house is large enough for all but they want to move her to a lesser apartment.} In the case of that woman, whose <i>ketubah</i> was 20 denars and the only apartment in the estate was a house worth 10 denars (Note of <i>Qorban Nathanael</i>: insufficient to pay the <i>ketubah</i>), R. Ḥanina ruled that either they give her the house or they pay her 20 denars. On that, R. Mana(I) said that she should not take the real estate but that they could give her 10 denars since she has no property rights in the real estate, only an easement. Therefore also in general, since she has no property rights to the apartment, only a claim to be given one, they can move her out of the apartment and rent a different one for her.</i> Rebbi Ze‘ira asked Rav Naḥman bar Jacob and (Rebbi) Abime bar Pappai: What if there was no house? They said to him, the heirs rent a house for her. One concludes that if she says real estate and they say money, the law sides with the heirs. As the following: A woman’s <i>ketubah</i> was twenty denars, and there was a house worth at most ten denars. The case came before Rebbi Ḥanina who said, either they give her a house or they give her twenty denars. Rebbi Mana said, since the house is not worth more than 20 it is as if her <i>ketubah</i> was only twenty. One concludes that if she says real estate and they say money, the law sides with the heirs.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One gives a virgin twelve months from when the husband requested to marry her to provide for herself<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">To make her trousseau.</i>. Just as one gives to the woman so one gives to the man to provide for himself<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">To look for a house and otherwise prepare for a family.

If the time has come and they are not definitively married, they eat from his [property] and may eat heave<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">If the prospective husband is a Cohen, the preliminary marriage is the act of acquisition. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:11" href="/Leviticus.22.11"><i>Lev.</i> 22:11</a>, speaking about heave, reads: “If a Cohen buy a person with his money, that person may eat it.” Since the preliminary marriage is formally an acquisition by money, the bride can eat heave as soon as the groom is required to feed her. Therefore, if the delay of the wedding is his fault, the girl’s family can require that he feed her after the statutory 12 months delay, and he can fulfill his obligation by providing her with heave (for which he did not pay) and which she must eat in levitic purity in her father’s house.</i>. Rebbi Ṭarphon says, one gives her everything in heave. Rebbi Aqiba said, half profane and half heave<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">As the Halakhah explains, a woman regularly has periods of impurity. R. Aqiba requires the groom to provide her with profane food for her periods of impurity; R. Tarphon, in the interpretation of the Babli, thinks that she can sell the heave and buy profane food for the money. This is a very problematic proposition since heave, for which the only possible buyers are other Cohanim, cannot fetch a price commensurate with that of profane food.</i>.

It is difficult to know what “in its time” means. The Tosephta reads: “Adulthood is equivalent to a request [for marriage], twelve months.” This means the same as the explanation in the Babli: “If a girl became preliminarily married after she was an adult for 12 months, one gives her 30 days as for a widow,” since she had ample time to sew her trousseau. One can read the Yerushalmi in the same sense, that the time of reaching adulthood is as good as an engagement.</i>: Adulthood in its time is twelve months. Rebbi Hila said, state: One gives an adult twelve months and one gives her a preliminary wedding, and thirty days to a widow. We have stated: “One gives a virgin twelve months,” and you say so<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">How can the time given between definitive and preliminary marriages be 30 days when it is 12 months?</i>?

The practice of the returnees from Babylonia probably should read: “When the time has come and they were not definitively married, they eat from his property and eat heave. If the husband died, they eat from his property and [do not] eat heave.” The levir who is a Cohen cannot cause his prospective wife to eat heave since in contrast to his brother he has no preliminary marriage that could count as acquisition. A Cohen’s widow can eat heave only if she remains a member of the priestly clan, i. e., if any descendants of her husband by her survive her husband’s death. Vice versa, a Cohen’s daughter married to an Israel can eat heave after her husband’s death only if no descendants of her husband by her survive her husband’s death.</i>.

Babylonian sources (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 58a" href="/Ketubot.58a">Babli 58a</a> and Tosephta) record a fourth opinion, by R.

“If she spent six months for her husband and six months for the levir, she cannot eat heave.

Therefore, if somebody goes to the ownerless real estate and acts as proprietor, fencing in or harvesting a field or painting a house, he has acquired the piece of real estate by his action. Similarly, if somebody takes an ownerless slave from the estate and tells him to work on his orders, the work of the slave makes him the property of the person giving the orders. The work can be quite symbolical, such as carrying a stone for a short stretch, to qualify as חֲזָקָה and if the acquirer is a Cohen, the slave is qualified to eat heave. Therefore, the means of acquisition of slave girls and wives are only partially comparable; the ways of acquisition of a slave are not subordinated to those for a wife.</i> to permit her to eat heave, what can you say about a wife who cannot be acquired by active possession? If an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i> can be reversed, the argument is invalid.

The answer is that he would agree to the Babli’s explanation, except that he has another one in addition. Since the Mishnah can be explained in several ways consistent with his legal doctrines, he may choose different (parallel, not contradictory) doctrines in different situations.</i>.

And if this Y hates this X, her husband, and desires to leave his home, she shall lose her <i>ketubah</i> money, and she shall not take anything but only that which she brought from her father’s house and she shall go out by the mouth of the court (עַל פֻּם בֵּית דִּינָה) and with the consent of our masters, the Sages.”<br>The sentence about the husband hating his wife does not bring anything new. The sentence about the wife hating the husband states first that the husband does not have to pay the promised <i>ketubah</i> sum, then that she takes the rags with her (following R. Ismael ben R. Yose in the preceding paragraph), and, finally, that she is to be divorced “by the mouth of the court,” i. e., that the court will direct the husband to divorce his wife. Even though biblical law, as interpreted by all Jewish sects, does grant the husband the exclusive power to divorce, to the exclusion of any right of the wife to force a divorce, R. Yose (the Amora) holds that if the divorce is forced as consequence of a monetary settlement, the stipulation regards monetary, not religious, obligations and is enforceable in court.<br>The essence of this prenuptial agreement, which allows a woman to buy her freedom from an intolerable marriage, was adopted in Babylonia by the Saboraim Rav Rabba and Mar Rav Huna as a <i>taqqanah,</i> a rabbinic ordinance, which instructed the husband to divorce his rebellious wife while granting him the monetary advantages of the Yerushalmi agreement. This ordinance was in fact disestablished by R. Asher ben Ieḥiel, <i>Rosh,</i> in the 14th Century, when he interpreted the rule as a recommendation, not obligatory on the husband. Cf. I.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> What a woman finds or makes with her hands belongs to her husband<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 4:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.4.6.1">Mishnah 4:6</a>.</i>.

For this, he is paid with the yield of the property. All these rules can be modified by prenuptial agreements.</i>.

The expression “diminution of value” used here covers both injury (permanent impairment) and pain; “shame” is mental anguish. Since the husband has a claim to her handiwork, he also has a claim for payment for the time his wife is unable to work.</i>; Rebbi Jehudah ben Bathyra says, in case it is covered<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The wife’s injury is covered by her clothing; then the husband’s shame that he was unable to defend his wife is not so great. If the wife’s injury is visible, the husband’s loss of face is serious.</i>, she receives two thirds and he one third; in case it is visible, he receives two thirds and she one third. His part shall be given immediately; her part shall be invested in real estate and he eats its yield.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “What a woman finds or makes with her hands belongs to her husband,” etc. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Immi: Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish disagree: One said, this is everybody’s opinion, the other said it is in dispute<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Between R. Meïr and R. Joḥanan the Alexandrian who disagree in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.5.1">Mishnah 5:5</a> whether a man can dedicate his wife’s work to Heaven.</i>. We do not know who said what. It is reasonable that Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish should be the one who said it is in dispute since he explained that [the husband] provides her with food but does not give her a silver obolus as pocket money<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:5:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.5.2-4">Halakhah 5:5</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:4:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.4.2"><i>Nedarim</i> 11:4, Notes 51–55</a>. R. Meïr holds that the obligatory work the wife does for her husband is for her silver obolus and what she does in addition is for her food. Therefore, if he does not provide her with pocket money, he has no right to her work and, similarly, to what she finds. For R. Joḥanan the Alexandrian, the work is for her food and the excess for the pocket money. (This is where R. Joḥanan disagrees.) Therefore, the husband has the right to what she makes and finds.</i>, and we did state: “If he does not give her a silver obolus as pocket money, what she makes with her hands is hers.” The work of her hands is parallel to what she finds. Rebbi Jacob bar Immi came in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: It is everybody’s opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">What she finds belongs to her husband according to everybody, as explained in the next paragraph.</i>. That means that Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish varies in his opinions<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that he taught different approaches to different students.</i>.
For whom is it needed<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The clause in the Mishnah that the husband has only the usufruct of any inheritance coming to his wife during the marriage.</i>? For Rebbi Meïr! Even though for Rebbi Meïr the hand of the slave is his master’s hand<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, R. Meïr holds that a wife cannot act legally except as her husband’s representative. It would seem reasonable that a wife can retain separate property by prenuptial agreement (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 7:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.7.1.1"><i>Yebamot</i> 7:1, Note 1</a>), but for R. Meïr one would expect that a wife can only acquire an inheritance as representative for her husband. Therefore, it is essential that the Mishnah state that an inheritance becomes the wife’s sole property for which the husband has to act as administrator. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.9.1"><i>Nedarim</i> 11:8, Note 70</a>; <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 4:4, Note 95; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 88b" href="/Nedarim.88b">Babli <i>Nedarim</i> 88b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 23b" href="/Kiddushin.23b"><i>Qiddušin</i> 23b</a>.</i> and if the wife acquired title the husband should have acquired it; he agrees that his rights over it<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The inheritance.</i> are restricted to the use of the yield.

Any non-Jewish slave who became semi-Jewish by circumcision (for a male) and immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> is called “Canaanite slave”.

Why do we say: “The finds of his adult son and daughter or of his Hebrew slave<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">While the rules for the treatment of Hebrew slaves (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:1-11" href="/Exodus.21.1-11"><i>Ex.</i> 21:1–11</a>) are a frequent topic in the Talmudim, the subject is purely theoretical since the institution of Hebrew slavery disappeared with the end of the First Commonwealth. It is asserted that only the working capability of the slave is the master’s, not his body. Therefore, if he lifts a find to acquire it, it is not the master’s hand which lifts the find.</i> or slave-girl belong to them,” because he cannot direct them to do other work<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, the master can direct the Hebrew slave to perform any task he asks of him; but he cannot direct him not to use his hands for anything else.</i>. But his wife he cannot direct to do other work<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In Chapter 5, an exhaustive list was given of work the husband can demand from his wife. The wife’s body certainly is not her husband’s property. Therefore, one does not understand why her find should be her husband’s.</i> and you say that her find belongs to him! Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is another reason for his wife. What is the other reason for his wife? Rebbi Ḥaggai says, because of quarrel<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">One has such a poor opinion of Jewish husbands that one is afraid he would be offended if the wife would not share her find with him [mentioned also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 1:5:2-6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.1.5.2-6.2"><i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 1:5</a> (8a 1. 15)].

Rebbi Yose does not say so, but that she should not smuggle away<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning: stealing.</i> any of her husband’s property and say, I found it.

This because of that<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yose will agree that in the case of a find in the presence of other people his reason is invalid. He holds that, nevertheless, the rabbinic decree giving the find to the husband stands because ịt would be impractical to admit exceptions.</i>. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, if they<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the adult children to whom the Mishnah in <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> assigns their finds. This is qualified; the Mishnah applies only if the children are financially independent. In the Babli, this is formulated that “they are not dependent on their father’s table.” Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 4:6:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.4.6.3"><i>Peah</i> 4:6, Note 107</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 1:5:2-6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.1.5.2-6.2"><i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 1:5</a> (8a 1.3); <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 12b" href="/Bava_Metzia.12b">Babli <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 12b</a>.</i> are not dependent on their father.

Rebbi Isaac instructed about one who had sent away his wife but not liquidated her <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Greek φερνή “dowry”. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 7:6:2-7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.7.6.2-7">Halakhah 7:7</a>, the word is used in the meaning of <i>ketubah</i>, the document in which the value of the dowry was recorded. Therefore, it seems reasonable to read the text that R. Isaac obligated the former husband to support his former wife until he had paid the last penny of everything he was obligated to by the <i>ketubah</i> document, not only until he had returned all her dowry.</i>, that he has to feed her until the time he liquidated it.
Rebbi Redipha, Rebbi Aḥa, in the name of Rebbi Abun bar Cahana: Because he does not make her lose anything<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the rules of R. Yehudah ben Bathyra who gives the husband part of the payment for shame and diminution of value. Why should the husband get part of the payment for shame?

In Tosephta 13:4, it is stated: If somebody decided on money for his underage daughter but then went bankrupt, one forces him to give because one can give a minor benefit but not obligation.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If she decided to bring him 1’000 denars,” etc. Why did they say for money, one and one half times, and for estimations less one fifth?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If she decided to bring him money, each tetradrachma is turned into six denars<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This is 150%, as stated in the preceding Mishnah.</i> and the groom engages himself for ten denars for the perfume box for each mina<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">He will provide her with perfumes and accessories worth one tenth of the cash dowry.</i>; Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, all follows local custom.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If she decided to bring him money,” etc. “If she decided to bring him 500 denars by appraisal, he makes it 400.

Lieberman reads in the text נקִיצּוּתָהּ “what she had decided”, based on the Tosephta text (6:6), and explains that the woman takes all if she actually delivered what she had promised.

In the Babli, קִיצוּתָא is “a fixed date”, קִיצְוְתָא “a fixed price.” The explanation given here is close to that proffered by R. Moses Margalit.<br>Since the groom doubled the original appraisal and deviated from the norm, acceptance of this deviation is valid only if explicitly endorsed either in the <i>ketubah</i> or in an accompanying document. In the <i>ketubot</i> published by A. M. Friedman, the sums are regularly acknowledged by the bride’s representatives.

This is a rabbinic rule. R. Meïr holds that no remarriage is permitted in case of any vow that needs to be annulled by an Elder (cf. <i>Nedarim</i> Chapter 9). The reason is that one has to avoid a situation in which the divorcee marries another man and for him goes to an Elder to have him annul the vow. If the ex-husband says, “if I had known that her vow will be annulled, I would not have divorced her,” he retroactively would annul the bill of divorce, make his ex-wife a bigamist and bastards of her children from the second husband. Therefore, one has to make clear to him that the divorce is final and irreversible, to prevent him from having second thoughts. But if the cause of the divorce is an invalid vow, the divorce is not caused by the vow and the husband may remarry his divorcee (as long as she did not marry another man). R. Eleazar says that remarriage was forbidden in the second case because of the first one since it is obvious that the husband must be an ignoramus if he divorces his wife because of a vow which every competent scholar will immediately declare as invalid if asked about it (“a vow which does not have to be investigated by a Sage” because the Sage will declare it invalid at first sight.)</i>” What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar?

If he goes ahead with the definitive marriage, the marriage is valid and can be dissolved only by a bill of divorce, but his original condition has not been withdrawn and, therefore, he does not have to pay.</i>.

He said to him, the Mishnaiot apply only to circumstances that are either stringent on both sides or lenient on both sides. But here it is a stringency on one side and a leniency on the other side. But did we not state: “The House of Shammai say, property abandoned to the poor [is abandoned]?” Is this not lenient for the poor and stringent for the householder, and it was stated! He said to him, it is lenient for the poor and not stringent for the householder, since he intentionally abandoned it. He said to him, did we not state: “If the sheaf that was near a closure, a stack, cattle, or vessels was forgotten,” is this not lenient for the householder and stringent for the poor, and it was stated! He said to him, it is lenient for the householder but not stringent for the poor, because they did not acquire it yet. You may also say here, it is lenient for the woman and not stringent for the husband since he did not yet acquire property rights to it. He said to him, since he became betrothed to her, the inheritance fell to both of them.
Rebbi Jehudah said, they argued before Rabban Gamliel: Because preliminarily married she is his wife and definitively married she is his wife; just as the sale by the latter is void, the sale by the former also should be void. He said to them, we are ashamed of the new ones, now you want to roll the new on over the old ones! The new ones, after the definitive marriage; the old ones before the definitive marriage, when she was married in the second ceremony.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If she inherited money; real estate should be bought<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is the husband’s duty to preserve his wife’s property. In the economic environment of the later Roman Empire, real estate was the only investment guaranteed to keep its value (investments appropriate for the guardian of widows and orphans). Simce the husband is required to pay for all her needs, she has no direct use for the cash she inherited.</i> with it and he eats its yield. For produce cut from the ground, real estate should be bought and he eats its yield; with produce connected to the ground, Rebbi Meïr says one has to estimate how much the property<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The field in which the crop is standing.</i> is worth with produce and how much without, for the difference real estate should be bought<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since R.

But the Sages say, standing produce is his<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is yield.</i>, cut it is hers; real estate should be bought from it and he eats its yield.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If she inherited money; real estate should be bought,” etc. Rebbi Jeremiah said, this is Rebbi Meïr’s opinion since Rebbi Meïr considers standing [produce] as if it were cut<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 6:6. In rabbinic interpretation, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex.</i> 22:8</a> defines when an oath is required by the court: “About any criminal matter, about an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or anything lost, <i>if he agrees</i> <i>that this is it,</i> the suit shall be heard by the judges …” This is read to mean that an oath is needed if the defendant agrees that the plaintiff has a case but that he owes less than what is being claimed (cf. <i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael, Mišpaṭim</i> 15). The part of the claim in dispute is what the claimant considers criminal withholding of his property by the defendant. If the defendant rejects the entire claim, the claimant has to prove his case by witnesses or documents; if the defendant admits part of the claim the claimant can request that he swear not to owe more. But since the examples given in the verse are all about movables, it is concluded that claims of real estate cannot be resolved by an oath (Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i>6:5). On that, R. Meïr states that “some things are on the ground but are not real estate”. The example given is that the claim is “I handed over to you (to harvest and make wine from) ten vines full of fruit” but the defendant claims “there were ony five.” In that case, R. Meïr requires the defendant to swear but the Sages hold that anything connected to the ground is like real estate.<br>Since the produce on the field is considered as the wife’s capital, not the husband’s produce, R. Jeremiah infers that the Mishnah does not represent practice since it follows R. Meïr in a case in which the majority disagrees.</i>.

If she died, what shall be done with her <i>ketubah</i> and the properties which enter and leave with her? The House of Shammai say, the husband’s and the father’s heirs shall split it. But the House of Hillel say, the properties are in the hands of the holders; the <i>ketubah</i> in the hands of the husband’s heirs and the properties which enter and leave with her in the hands of the father’s heirs.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If property came to a woman waiting for her levir,” etc. Here, you say “she may sell or give away and it is valid.” And you also say “the husband’s heirs should split with her father’s heirs!” Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, when do you say “she may sell or give away and it is valid”? If they came to her before she became a woman waiting for her levir. When do you say “the husband’s heirs should split with her father’s heirs”? If they came to her after she became a woman waiting for her levir. If they came to her before she became a woman waiting for her levir and produced revenue after she became a woman waiting for her levir, [that revenue is as if] they came to her after she became a woman waiting for her levir. Rebbi Ze‘ira said, the levir in this situation is a problem for the House of Shammai. If he is a husband, he inherits everything. If he is not a husband, he inherits nothing. Because of the doubt, “the husband’s heirs should split with her father’s heirs.” For the House of Hillel it is obvious that he is a husband and inherits everything. For even his brother had only the usufruct.
Rebbi Hoshaia stated: Her heirs, those who inherit her <i>ketubah</i> are obliged to bury her. Rebbi Yose said, if Rebbi Hoshaia had not stated this, we would have had a problem. If she had no <i>ketubah,</i> do they not have to bury her? This is difficult. If a woman has no <i>ketubah,</i> does she not have to be buried? A wife, even if she has no <i>ketubah,</i> must be buried. This one, if she has a <i>ketubah,</i> is entitled to burial costs. But here, if she does not have a <i>ketubah,</i> she is not entitled to burial costs.

This rule is not mentioned in the Yerushalmi and the latter’s position in this matter is not known. In Rashi’s interpretation, only dedications to the altar break contracts, not dedications which are purely monetary gifts to Temple or charity. Therefore, that principle does not apply here in any case.<br>The text is Mishnah <i>‘Arakhin</i> 6:2. There it is stated that if somebody dedicates his encumbered property, neither can the wife collect her <i>ketubah</i> nor a creditor his claim from Temple property which must first be redeemed. Then it is stated that if the creditor’s claim is at least equal to the appraised value of the property, he may lend another denar to the debtor and force him to redeem it to be able to foreclose the now secular property.</i>” Not necessarily a denar, but anything, that a dedication should not be seen to be profanated without redemption<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">This is a generally accepted principle; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Arakhin 32b" href="/Arakhin.32b">Babli <i>Arakhin</i> 32b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 31a" href="/Pesachim.31a"><i>Pesaḥim</i>31a</a>.

R. Joḥanan implies that a person using the dedicated property for his personal advantage before it was redeemed is obligated for a sacrifice. On the other hand, it is sinful to offer unnecessary sacrifices which would be ”profane animals in the Temple courtyard.” If the sacrifice is valid then the dedication must be valid and could not be undone by a token amount but would require appraisal by a Cohen (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:11-14" href="/Leviticus.27.11-14"><i>Lev.</i> 27:11–14</a>).</i>. That is difficult. If one would be guilty of complete larceny, should if not be redeemed for its full value?

Since you diminished the woman’s power in that her <i>ketubah</i> is a lien only on the properties of her first husband, you strengthened her power in this matter that if the heir came and took it, one removes it from his hand. It was stated thus: Trees and cutting, old or young, one removes from their hands.

Other vessels cannot become impure; to this fact one attributes the great number of stone vessels found on archeological sites of the Second Temple period. (Similarly intrinsically pure vessels made of cow dung have not survived for the archeological record.) The impurity of glass vessels, unknown to Moses, is purely rabbinical. One has to take the information that the impurity of glass ware “was decreed” by the head of the Synhedrion with a grain of salt.

It is not obvious whether the document was written before or after the definitive marriage and whether the inheritance was foreseeable or not. If the document was written before the definitive marriage and the wife was in line for the inheritance, there is no reason why the husband’s renunciation of his rights would not be valid since that essentially is the case of the Mishnah. In addition, it is the right of any person not to accept an inheritance. Therefore, in view of the answer given, it seems that one speaks of an inheritance which was unexpected, that at the moment of preliminary marriage the wife was not a probable recipient of the inheritance but that later some prospective heirs died which made the wife the next surviving kin. Since such an occurrence is not foreseeable, no contracts can be concluded about them. If the document was executed after the definitive marriage, it would require an additional statement in which the husband cedes his rights to future yield to his wife.</i>?

Then the question is raised why does the husband eat the yield of property coming from others but not from his own gift. But in this version, the questions of R. Mattanah and R. Immi duplicate one another. The text of Rosh seems to be a contamination of the current and the following paragraphs.<br>The passive voice, real estate <i>should be bought,</i> is that of our Tosephta text, in contrast to the quotes from both Talmudim in which <i>he</i> buys the real estate.

In the Yerushalmi, it is supposed that the acquirer removes the produce from the public place since it is obvious that it would not be his when left in the public place. But if the produce was already in a place belonging to the claimant, according to Rav and R. Simeon ben Laqish “a person’s courtyard acquires for him automatically” (Babli <i>Baba meṣi‘a</i> 10b). For R. Joḥanan, “a person’s courtyard acquires for him only by a conscious act.” Therefore, in a situation where an unlearned person could think that anything in a private domain to which the owner has a claim is automatically his, we may assume that the conscious act of acquisition is missing. This argument assumes that the first part of the Mishnah is everybody’s opinion and the difference between R. Ṭarphon and R. Aqiba refers only to the excess.<br>In the Babli, the entire first part of the Mishnah is considered R.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If she went from her husband’s grave to her family,” etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">This quote has nothing to do with the Halakhah which discusses only <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 9:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.9.7.1">Mishnah 8</a>.</i> Rebbi Ze‘ura said, this came down in the manner of a biblical oath. The <i>ketubah</i> is acknowledged in her hand for collection; it is as if collected. But since with the document of 200 there is an acknowledment of payment and she says, one mina [is due to her], she cannot be paid without an oath<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">He discusses the first case of the Mishnah, if she had compromised the <i>ketubah</i> by signing a receipt for partial payment without specifying the amount. The basic biblical text is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex.</i>22:8</a>: “About any guilty behavior, about an ox, or a sheep, or a garment, or anything lost, if he agrees that this is it, the case of the two parties shall come before <i>Elohim.</i>” This is explained as follows (<i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael,</i> ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 301; <i>Mekhilta dR. Simeon bar Ioḥai</i> ed. Epstein-Melamed p. 203; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 107a" href="/Bava_Kamma.107a">Babli <i>Baba Qama</i> 107a</a>, <i>Baba Me</i>ṣ<i>i‘a</i> 5a,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 98a" href="/Ketubot.98a">98a</a>): The paragraph speaks in vv. 6–7 about a person who holds another’s property without being paid for his services, who will not have to pay if the property is stolen and the holder never used it for his own purposes. Then v. 8 continues about <i>any</i> behavior implying monetary obligation, i. e., any monetary claim of one person against another, and requires first that the object of the claim be well defined (an ox, a sheep, etc.) and that the defendant of the suit agree that “this is it”, i. e., that there is a case, then there shall be a trial before a judge acting as <i>Elohim,</i> as a representative of God as judge. <i>In praxi</i> this means that if the claimant cannot prove his case by witnesses or documents, the defendant can free himself from paying by swearing while holding a copy of the Torah and being subject to all the rules of judicial oaths. But if the claim is for one thing (e. g., an ox) and the defendant agrees only that something else is owed to the claimant (e. g., a sheep), or if the defendant disputes the entire claim, he cannot be forced to swear and the claimant loses his case.<br>R. Ze‘ura notes that the case of the damaged <i>ketubah</i> has most of the features of a case requiring an oath by biblical standards, even though it seems otherwise since the divorced wife claims the remainder of the <i>ketubah</i> but the husband claims that all was paid. For that he argues that everybody knows that a <i>ketubah</i> becomes payable at the moment of divorce. Therefore, the husband is considered to have paid the <i>ketubah</i> sum and now he requests to get his money back, and the ex-wife disputes part of his claim. (In the opinion of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 48b" href="/Shevuot.48b">Babli, <i>Šebuot</i> 48b</a>, 81a, this is held only by the House of Shammai; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 9:7:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.9.7.5">Note 178</a>.) There are two points why the case does not fit the framework of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex.</i>22:8</a>: The person who swears a biblical oath does not have to pay, but in the case under discussion the wife swears in order to collect money. This is by rabbinic tradition. Second, since the <i>ketubah</i> is a mortgage lien (or: in talmudic times was a mortgage lien), the suit is about real estate and real estate claims cannot be settled by oaths (Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 6:5). This argument is explicit in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 87b" href="/Ketubot.87b">Babli, 87b</a>, where the place of R. Ze‘ura is taken by (the slightly younger) Rami bar Ḥama.</i>.
It was stated “compromised”. Not that she reduced her <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is quoted in <i>Šebuot</i> 7:7 (38a 1. 25), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 8:6:2-12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.8.6.2-12"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 8:6</a> (26b 1. 49); <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 87b" href="/Ketubot.87b">Babli 87b</a>.</i><i>.</i> If her <i>ketubah</i> was 200 but she claims a mina, she is paid without an oath<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli, this is made more explicit: If her <i>ketubah</i> was 1000 <i>zuz,</i> the husband claims that it was paid but he has no receipt, the divorced wife states that she received nothing but that her claim was only a mina, this is <i>not</i> conceding part of the husband’s claim (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 9:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.9.7.2">Note 166</a>) and she collects without an oath. It seems that the Yerushalmi would agree to that interpretation.<br>On documents which show that 200 <i>zuz</i> written in the <i>ketubah</i> might mean 100 <i>zuz</i> in actual money (and the standards by which the value of a <i>zuz</i> is determined), cf. M. A. Friedman, <i>loc. cit.</i> Note 87.</i>. What is the difference between one who compromises and one who claims less? Rebbi Ḥanina said, if she compromises there was a transaction between them<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, the oath is required if only to protect creditors with claims against the estate.</i>; if she claims less there was no transaction between them<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">At least, there is no presumption of any transactions between her and her husband regarding her <i>ketubah</i> during her marriage. Therefore, anybody claiming that there was such a transaction in order to impose an oath on the widow would have to prove his case in court.</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked: Since we stated there: “If one witness testifies that [the <i>ketubah</i>] was paid, she shall not be able to collect without an oath,” should it be similar that if one witness testifies that [the <i>ketubah</i>] was reduced, she shall not be able to collect the reduced sum without an oath? Rebbi Yose said, at the moment that one witness testifies that the amount should be reduced, he is like a single witness who contradicts the testimony of two [witnesses]<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">The two witnesses who signed the <i>ketubah</i> document.</i> but no single witness can contradict the testimony of two<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">There can never be an oath imposed for a lesser claim in the settlement of a <i>ketubah</i> since the preceding paragraph dealt with the case of no witnesses and there can be no oath if there are two witnesses.</i>.
It was stated: If an heir’s father held a compromised promissory note, the son collects without swearing<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">If the father had indicated that a certain part of the note was paid, and both the lender and the borrower had died, the lender’s son collects the remainder from the borrower’s son without swearing that no more than the sum indicated had been paid (assuming that the borrower’s son cannot produce a document or witnesses that more had been paid than was claimed), since he could not collect if he had to swear that he was 100% sure that his claim was in the correct amount.</i>. In that the son’s power is greater than the father’s, since the son collects without swearing while the father can collect only by swearing<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">If the borrower had died.</i>.

The House of Hillel hold that she cannot collect her <i>ketubah</i> since she cannot prove her innocence to the heirs (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 185, Note 38) based on the general principle that “the burden of proof is on the claimant.” Since the House of Shammai also agree to that principle, it must follow that for them the <i>ketubah</i> is as good as paid and the heirs are the claimants who want to have the money back but who cannot prove their case. This shows that for the House of Shammai the <i>ketubah</i> is the widow’s property from the moment of the husband’s death.</i> Rebbi Yose said, there the reason of the House of Shammai is: Bring my husband and I shall drink<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding argument is invalid.

The House of Hillel hold that the heirs do not have to pay her <i>ketubah;</i> since she brought the problem on herself by being seen with another man after having been duly warned by her husband in front of two witnesses; she cannot collect except by successfully clearing her name.

Loss and gain of a stock company are distributed per share.</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">This Mishnah poses difficult problems. First, it deals with a scenario that cannot arise since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.1.1">Mishnah 1</a> stated that a <i>ketubah</i> which precedes in time has to be satisfied from the estate before the later <i>ketubah</i> can be claimed. Therefore, the case of the Mishnah presupposes that the husband married three woman simultaneously. While this is possible in theory, it is excluded in practice. The problem is a practical one if applied to the case that the amount available in bankruptcy proceedings is not sufficient to cover all claims of equal rank.<br>At first glance, it seems that the Mishnah is inconsistent, applying three different rules to three different cases. Since the Mishnah must guide the judge to correctly apportion payment of claims <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>c</i><sub>3</sub> if the available amount <i>a &lt; c</i><sub>1</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>3</sub>, for all <i>a</i> between 0 and <i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ c</i><sub>3</sub>, it is obvious that the Mishnah has to be explained by one single consistent formula or algorithm. In addition, the algorithm must be applicable to any number <i>n</i> of claims.<br>In the tenth Century, Saadya Gaon suceeded in reducing the number of different rules employed in the Mishnah to two (<i>Oṣar Hageonim Ketubot</i> p. 310). A complete discussion of the Geonic treatment of the Mishnah was given by I. Francus, שיטת הגאונים בפירוש משנה וברייתא, סיני פכו-פכז (תשס-תשסא) קצה-ריב (M. H. Katzenellenbogen Memorial Volume).<br>The first complete solution of the problem of finding a uniform rule for all three cases was given by R. J. Aumann and M. Maschler, Game Theoretic Analysis of a Bankruptcy Problem from the Talmud, <i>J. Econom. Theory</i> <b>36</b>(1985) 195–213. In the framework of the theory of cooperative games, the authors show that the distribution of the Mishnah corresponds to the <i>nucleolus</i> strategy in game theory. Using only elementary mathematics, a single distribution formula covering all cases was given by M. Balinski in: Quelle équité, <i>Pour la science</i> <b>311</b> (September 2003) 82–87; What is Just? <i>Am. Math. MONTHLY</i> <b>112</b>(2005), 502–511. While these authors succeed in explaining the Mishnah in itself, they do not explain the interpretation given to the Mishnah by the Talmudim. Nor do they explain why in both Talmudim the Mishnah is rejected out of hand. The explanation of the Babli is in language close to the Yerushalmi but translated into mathematical formulas the results are quite different; in both Talmudim the proposed explanation results in a procedure which is not monotone; i. e., it is possible that if the available amount <i>a</i> is increased, the payouts for some claimants are decreased. The solutions both of Aumann/Maschler and Balinski are monotone, increasing with <i>a.</i><br>Balinski shows that the Mishnah can be understood in terms of a different distribution problem in Mishnah <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> 1:1, as indicated by Alfasi (<i>Ketubot</i> 10, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 51b" href="/Ketubot.51b">51b</a> in the Wilna ed.). Since this problem is also the basis of the arguments in both Talmudim, Balinski’s method is explained first. In <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> there are two claimants for an amount of 1. The first claims it all, the second claims ½. Both claims are of the same status. Then the first is awarded <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, the second <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>. While the claims are in ratio 2:1, the awards are in ratio 3:1. The reason given is the rule ascribed to Symmachos, a student of R. Meïr, that “money in doubt is split evenly” [Babli <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> 2b, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 35b" href="/Bava_Kamma.35b"><i>Baba qama</i> 35b</a>; Yerushalmi <i>Baba meṣiʻa</i> 8:5 (11d 1. 18); cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.1.3">Chapter 2, Notes 9</a> ff.]. Since the second claimant asks only for ½, the other half is awarded to the first claimant. The first half is in doubt; therefore it is split evenly between the two parties, resulting in the awards mentioned.<br>In order to arrive at a mathematical formulation, assume that <i>n</i> claims <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> are advanced,<br><i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>&lt; c</i><sub>2</sub> <i>&lt; … &lt; c</i><sub>n</sub><i>.</i><br>If several claims were identical they would be consolidated into a single claim and the award split evenly between the participants. For any amount <i>a</i> available for distribution, the payout for claimant <i>i</i> is p<sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>,</i><br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>+ p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>+ …</i> <i>+ p</i><sub>n</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a.</i><br>We also introduce the sum of the claims, S =<i>c</i><sub>1</sub> <i>+ c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ … + c</i><sub>n</sub> and M= S/2. For <i>n</i> = 2, Symmachos’s argument determines the payouts uniquely:<br>If <i>a ≤ c</i><sub>1</sub><i>,</i> the entire sum is in dispute,<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a</i>/2<i>.</i><br>Therefore, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>= p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>= c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>.</i><br>If c<sub>1</sub> &lt; <i>a ≤ c</i><sub>2</sub>, the amount <i>a - c</i><sub>1</sub> belongs to claimant 2 and<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= c</i><sub>1</sub>/2,<br><i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a-c</i><sub>1</sub><i>+c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>= a-c</i><sub>1</sub>/2,<br>and p<sub>1</sub>(c<sub>2</sub>) = <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>/2,<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>c</i><sub>2</sub>)<i>= c</i><sub>2</sub><i>-c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>.</i><br>If <i>c</i><sub>2</sub><i>&lt; a</i>, both claimants have equal rights to the excess over <i>c</i><sub>2</sub>,<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>+</i>(<i>a - c</i><sub>2</sub>)/2<br><i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>) <i>= c</i><sub>2</sub><i>-c</i><sub>1</sub>/2<i>+</i>(<i>a-c</i><sub>2</sub>)/2<i>=</i>(<i>a+c</i><sub>2</sub><i>-c</i><sub>1</sub>)/2<i>.</i><br>If <i>a = c</i><sub>2</sub><i>+c</i><sub>1</sub> = S, all claims are satisfied in full. Using the function min(<i>x,y</i>) = smaller of <i>x</i> or y<i>,</i> Balinski did express the formulas given above by<br>(1) <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i>) = min(<i>c</i><sub>i</sub>/2, λ) where λ is chosen so that <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>+ p</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>a</i>)<i>= a</i>;<i>i =</i> 1,2.<br>An inspection of the formulas shows that the distribution is symmetric about the middle value of the claims:<br>(2) <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>M-x</i>)<i>+ p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>M+x</i>)<i>= c</i><sub>i</sub>.<br>This means that the distribution for <i>M ≤ a ≤ S</i> is determined if it is determined for 0 ≤ <i>a</i>≤<i>M.</i> In the Mishnah here, it should be sufficient to indicate the distribution up to an estate of 300 if the sum of claims is 600. But the generalization of the procedure for <i>n</i> = 2 to <i>n</i> &gt; 2 is not trivial. As Balinski points out, an arbitrary distribution function which yields the given values for <i>a = c</i><sub>i</sub> and satisfies (2) is compatible with the Mishnah. His own solution is to postulate (1) for <i>i</i> = 1, … <i>n.</i> Then (2) is satisfied and the distribution is monotone. For example,<br>{<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(400),<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(400),<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(400)} = {100-<i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(200),200-<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(200),300-<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(200)} = {50,125,225}.<br>The problem with this solution, as with most other solutions proposed in the last 1000 years, is that the Talmudim take another view. The solution of the Babli is easily described as a recursive computational procedure. We assume that <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>),…,<i>p</i><sub>i-</sub><sub>1</sub>(<i>a</i>) have been determined; leaving an amount <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> to be distributed. We determine <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>). If <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> ≥ <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>j</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>/(<i>n-i</i>) for <i>j</i> = <i>i</i>, … <i>n</i>. Otherwise, all claims larger than <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> are consolidated into one claim <i>C</i><sub>i</sub> = <i>c</i><sub>i</sub><sub>+1</sub> + … + <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> and <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) is the payout assigned to claimant #<i>i</i> in the two-person distribution problem for claims <i>c</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>i</sub> and amount <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>. The fictitious second claimant then receives <i>P</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = <i>a</i><sub>i</sub><sub>+1</sub> and the process continues.<br>In the example of the Mishnah, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> = 100, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> = 200, <i>c</i><sub>3</sub> = 300. For <i>a</i> = 100, by the first alternative <i>p</i><sub>j</sub>(100) = 100/3 for all <i>j</i>. For <i>a</i> = 200, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> = 100, <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> = 400. Therefore, 100 is assigned to the second party and 100 is split evenly. This yields <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(200) = 50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(200) = 150. Since 200 &gt; 150, the latter amount is split evenly, resulting in <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(200) = <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(200) = 75. For <i>a</i> = 300, one sees that <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(300) = 50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(300) = 250; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(300) = 100 = 200/2, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(300) = 50 + 200/2 = 150. This explains the numbers stated in the Mishnah, but what about <i>a</i> = 101? In that case, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(101) = 50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(101) = 51; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(101) = <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(101) = 51/2 = 25.5. This clearly is unacceptable; the procedure of the Mishnah has to be rejected.<br>The explanation of the Yerushalmi (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.4.3">Note 69</a>) is not so clearly stated but it seems to be the following: The procedure also is recursive. If <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> ≥ <i>a</i><sub>i</sub><sub>,</sub><i>p</i><sub>j</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>/(<i>n-i</i>) for <i>j</i> = <i>i</i>, … <i>n</i>. Otherwise, one considers all two-person problems between claimants <i>i</i> and <i>i</i>+1,…, <i>n</i>. <i>In praxi</i>, this means that one has only to split between <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>c</i><sub>n</sub>. If <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> &lt; <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> &lt; <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> then <i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(a<sub>i</sub>) = <i>c</i><sub>i</sub>/2. If <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> &lt; <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> then write <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> = <i>c</i><sub>n</sub> + δ. Claims <i>n</i> and <i>i</i> overlap to the amount <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> - δ. This means that<br><i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>) = δ + (<i>c</i><sub>i</sub> - δ)/2 = (<i>c</i><sub>i</sub> + δ)/2.<br>For <i>a</i> ≤ <i>M</i>, the numbers obtained for Babli and Yerushalmi coincide; the Yerushalmi’s method also is not monotone. The results for <i>a</i> &gt; <i>M</i> disagree. For example, for the data of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.4.1">Mishnah 4</a>, the Yerushalmi gives<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(400)=100, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(400)=100, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(400)=200 while the Babli gives<br><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>(400)=50, <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>(400)=350; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>(400)=100, <i>p</i><sub>3</sub>(400)=250.</i>

That she cannot reclaim from him the usufruct he had [from her property].
Rebbi Yose said: All the time my teacher Rebbi Hila told me, state in your <i>baraita</i> that he inherits from her and defiles himself for her. We have also stated so: A man defiles himself for his qualified wife but does not become defiled for his disqualified wife.

He who remarried his divorced wife after she had remarried. For him who says since these are words of the Torah, and this case is a word of the Torah, therefore she has <i>ketubah</i>. For him who says since these are punished together with the child, this one, since neither she nor the child is punished, therefore, she has no <i>ketubah</i>.
Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said that Rebbi Ze‘ira and Rebbi Hila say that they differ about sustenance. Rebbi Joḥanan said, she may demand sustenance. Rebbi Eleazar said to him, one says to him, divorce her! And you say so? They wanted to say, for him who says they differ about the conditions attached to a <i>ketubah</i>, Rebbi Joḥanan said, she has the <i>ketubah</i> stipulations. Rebbi Eleazar said to him, everybody agrees that she cannot claim support since they even punished her heirs, so much more herself. But for him who says that they differ about sustenance, it follows that they do not differ about the stipulations of a <i>ketubah</i>. They fined her, but did not fine her heirs.

But both the value of the standing crop which the buyer lost, and the value of the investments the buyer made in the property cannot be recovered from mortgaged property.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If the widow said, I cannot move from my husband’s house, the heirs cannot say to her, go to your father’s house and we shall support you there, but they support her and give her a dwelling commensurate with her honor.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">41a</sup><i class="footnote">The following Halakhah in its entirety is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 9:3:3-17" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.9.3.3-17">Halakhah <i>Kilaim</i> 9:4 (Notes 70–136</a>). The ms. readings from <i>Kilaim</i> are printed in Frank-Rühl typeface in the variant readings.</i>“If the widow said, I cannot move from my husband’s house,” etc. It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 88:6" href="/Psalms.88.6"><i>Ps</i>. 88:6</a>): “Among the dead is freedom.” When a person dies he becomes free from the Commandments.
Rebbi commanded three things on his death-bed: My widow should not move from my house; do not eulogize me in small towns; and he who served me during my lifetime should also serve me in death. “My widow should not move from my house,” is that not a Mishnah? “The widow who said, I cannot possibly move from my husband’s house …” Rebbi Dositheos said, that they should not say, this is the house of the patriarchate and must serve the patriarchate. Rebbi Eleazar bar Yose said, as we have stated: “She lives in the houses just as she lived while her husband was overseas, she uses silver and gold vessels just as she used to while her husband was overseas, she is fed just as she was fed while her husband was overseas.” “Do not eulogize me in small towns” because of the quarrels. “He who served me during my lifetime should also serve me in death;” Rebbi Ḥananiah from Sepphoris said, for example Yose Ephrati and Joseph from Haifa. Rebbi Ḥizqiah added, do not use many shrouds on me and let my coffin have holes at the bottom. These words say that Rebbi was buried in a single shroud since Rebbi said, not as a man left, he will come. But the rabbis say, just as a man left, he will come. It was stated in the name of Rebbi Nathan: The garment that went with a person to the grave will come back with him. What is the reason? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Job 38:14" href="/Job.38.14"><i>Job</i> 38:14</a>) “The seal turns itself around like clay, they appear in dress.” Antoninus asked Rebbi, what is the meaning of what is written: “The seal turns itself around like clay?” He said to him, He Who brings the generation clothes it.
Rebbi Joḥanan commanded: Dress me in beige, neither white nor black. If I rise among the just I shall not be ashamed, if I rise among the wicked I shall not be ashamed. Rebbi Joshia commanded: Dress me in clean white. They said to him, in what are you better than your teacher? He said to them, why should I be ashamed of my deeds? Rebbi Jeremiah commanded: Dress me in clean white, dress me in my socks, put my shoes on my feet and a walking stick in my hand, lay me on my side; when the Messiah comes I shall be ready.
The people from Sepphoris said: We shall kill anybody who tells us that Rebbi died. Bar Qappara associated with them, his head covered and his garments torn. He said to them: Earthlings and angels held the Tablets of the Covenant; the angels were stronger and they took away the Tablets. They said to him: Rebbi died. He said to them: You said it. They tore their clothes and the sound of the tearing was heard from the gate to a distance of three <i>mil</i>.
Rebbi Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Mana: Miracles happened that day. It was Sabbath eve and all the surrounding towns came together to eulogize him. They made him [Rebbi] rest in eighteen synagogues until they brought him to his resting place but the day extended for them until each one had time to get to his house, fill an amphora of water, and light the candles. When the sun set, the rooster crowed. They were anxious and said, maybe we did desecrate the Sabbath? There came a voice and said to them, every one who was not lazy for the eulogies of Rebbi shall be announced for the life of the Future World, except the fuller. When the latter heard this, he climbed on the roof, threw himself down, and died. There came a voice and said, including the fuller.
Rebbi dwelt in Sepphoris seventeen years and applied to himself (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 47:28" href="/Genesis.47.28"><i>Gen</i>. 47:28</a>): “Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years,” Jehudah lived in Sepphoris seventeen years. Of these he suffered from toothache for thirteen years. {Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, all these thirteen years no woman lying-in died in the Land of Israel and no pregnant woman had a miscarriage in the Land of Israel.} Why did he have a toothache? Once he saw a calf to be slaughtered when it bellowed and said to him, Rebbi, save me! He said to it, for that you were created. At the end, how was he healed? He saw them killing a burrow of rats. He said to them, let them live, it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 145:9" href="/Psalms.145.9"><i>Ps</i>. 145:9</a>) “His mercy extends to all His creatures.”
Rebbi was very meek and said, all a man might ask from me I am ready to do, except what the Elders of Bathyra did for my ancestor: they divested themselves and appointed him. If Rav Huna, the Head of the Diaspora, came here I would let him sit higher than myself since he is from the tribe of Judah and I am from Benjamin, he is from the male line and I am from the female. Once, the elder Rebbi Ḥiyya visited him and said, Rav Huna is outside. The face of Rebbi became saffron-colored. He [R. Ḥiyya] said to him, it is his coffin. He [Rebbi] said to him, go outside and look who wants you there. He stepped outside and did not find anybody; he understood that he [Rebbi] was angry with him. He did not visit him again for thirty days. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, in those thirty days did Rav learn from him [R. Ḥiyya] the principles of Torah. At the end of thirteen years and thirty days, Elijah visited him [Rebbi] in the likeness of the older Rebbi Ḥiyya. He said to him, how does my lord feel? He said to him, one tooth hurts me. He said to him, show it to me. He showed it to him, he put his finger on it and it was healed. The next day, the older Rebbi Ḥiyya came to him and asked him, how does Rebbi feel, what is with that tooth? He said to him, from the moment that you put your finger on it, it was healed. At that moment, he said, woe on you, lying-in women of the Land of Israel, woe on you, pregnant women of the Land of Israel! He [R. Ḥiyya] said to him, that was not me. From that moment on, he [Rebbi] treated him with honor. When he [Rebbi] went to the assembly hall, he said, may the older Rebbi Ḥiyya come inside. Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose asked, closer than me? He said, beware! The older Rebbi Ḥiyya inside, and Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose innermost. Rebbi used to state the praises of the older Rebbi Ḥiyya before Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose. {Once, he [R. Ismael ben R. Yose] saw him [R. Ḥiyya] in the bathhouse and he did not show him reverence. He [R. Ismael ben R. Yose] said to him [Rebbi], is that the one of whom you state praises? He said, what did he do to you? He said, I saw him in the bathhouse and he did not show me reverence.} He [Rebbi] said to him [R. Ḥiyya], why did you do that? He said to him, so much should come over me if I realized that I was washing myself, at that time my eyes were occupied with the allegorical interpretation of the entire book of Psalms. From that moment on, he [Rebbi] appointed two students to accompany him [R. Ḥiyya] because of the danger.
Rebbi Yasa fasted eighty days to see the old Rebbi Ḥiyya. In the end, he saw his bier and him sleeping on it. If you say that Rebbi Assi was an insignificant person, one tanner came to Rebbi Joḥanan and said, I saw the sky falling but one of your students supported it. He asked him, could you recognize him? He said, if I would see him, I would recognize him. He made all his students pass before him [the tanner], and he recognized Rebbi Assi. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish fasted three hundred fasts to see the old Rebbi Ḥiyya but did not see him. In the end, he started to feel badly and said, did he study Torah more than I did? They said to him, he spread Torah more than you did and in addition he went into exile. He said to them, did I not also go into exile? They said to him, you went into exile to study, he went into exile to teach.
When Rav Huna, the Head of the Diaspora, died they brought him here. They said, where shall we put him? They said, let us put him next to Rebbi Ḥiyya the elder for he is one of them. They said, who might want to bring him there? Rebbi Ḥaggai said, I shall go up to put him there. They said to him, you are looking for a pretext, for you are an old man and you want to go to rest there yourself. He said to them, put some string on my feet and when I shall be weak you pull. He went in and found the three arguing. “Jehudah my son, after you, and no more. Ḥizqiah my son, after you, and no more. Joseph ben Israel, after you, and no more.” He [R. Ḥaggai] lifted his eyes to look, it was said to him lower [your eyes], turn around. Rebbi Ḥiyya the elder [who said to] his son Jehudah, make space for Rav Ḥuna that he may rest there. But [Rav Ḥuna] did not accept this. They said, since he did not accept that one made space for him, so his descendants will never end. He [R. Ḥaggai] exited from there eighty years old and his years were doubled.
It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 47:30" href="/Genesis.47.30"><i>Gen</i>. 47:30</a>): “You shall carry me from Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” What would Jacob lose at any place he would prophesy? Rebbi Eleazar gave an inner reason, Rebbi Joshua ben Levi gave an inner reason, Rebbi Ḥanina gave an inner reason. What is the inner reason? Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 116:9" href="/Psalms.116.9"><i>Ps</i>. 116:9</a>) “I will walk before the Eternal in the Land of Life.” But the lands of life are only Tyre and its surroundings and Caesarea (maritima) and its surroundings; there is cheap (food), there is plenty. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish in the name of Bar Qappara, the Land whose dead will live again in the days of the Messiah. What is the reason? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 42:9" href="/Isaiah.42.9"><i>Is</i>. 42:9</a>) “He gives soul to the people on it.” That would mean that our teachers in Babylonia would lose out! Rebbi Simai said, the Holy One, praised be He, walks before them and they roll like wine barrels. When they arrive in the Land of Israel their souls are with them. What is the reason? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ezekiel 36:24" href="/Ezekiel.36.24"><i>Ez</i>. 36:24</a>) “I shall bring you to your soil,” (37:14) “give My spirit into you, and you will live.”
Rebbi Berekhiah asked Rebbi Ḥelbo. Rebbi Ḥelbo asked Rebbi Immi. Rebbi Immi asked Rebbi Eleazar. Rebbi Eleazar asked Rebbi Ḥanina, some say Rebbi Ḥanina asked Rebbi Joshua: Even those like Jeroboam and his kind? He said to him, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 29:22" href="/Deuteronomy.29.22"><i>Deut</i>. 29:22</a>) “Sulphur and salt, conflagration throughout the country.” Rebbi Berekhiah said, one asked the other and we understand nothing from it. What does it mean? Since the Land of Israel was burned, judgment was executed on it. We have stated in the name of Rebbi Jehudah: Seven years was the Land of Israel burned; that is what is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Daniel 9:27" href="/Daniel.9.27"><i>Dan</i>. 9:27</a>) “The Covenant overtook the public for one week.” What did the secondaries in it do? Pieces, pieces and it was burned.
It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 20:6-7" href="/Jeremiah.20.6-7"><i>Jer</i>. 20:6–7</a>): “But you, Pashḥur, and all inhabitants of your house will go into captivity. You will come to Babylon, die there, and be buried there.” Rebbi Abba [bar Zemina] said, Rebbi Ḥelbo and Rebbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina. One of them said, if somebody dies there and is buried there, he has two [detriments] in hand. If he dies there and is buried here, he has one [detriment] in hand. The other one said, burial atones for their death.
Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: A human’s feet bring him to where he is wanted. It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 22:20" href="/I_Kings.22.20"><i>1K</i>. 22:20</a>) “The Eternal said, who will seduce Ahab that he should go and fall in Ramot Gilead?” Might he not die in his house rather than there? Eliḥoref and Aḥiah were two of Solomon’s secretaries. He [Solomon] saw the Angel of Death looking at them and grinding his teeth. He said a word and put them into space. He [the Angel of Death] went and took them from there, then he came laughing before him [Solomon]. He said to him, just before you were grinding your teeth and now you are laughing at us? He said to him, the Merciful told me to take Eliḥoref and Aḥiah from space and I was wondering who would put them there where I was sent to take them; He put it into your mind to do so that I could complete my mission. I went and dealt with them there. The two sons of Rebbi Reuben ben Strobilos were students of Rebbi. He [Rebbi] saw the Angel of Death looking at them and grinding his teeth and said, let us exile them to the South, maybe the exile atones. He [the angel of death] went and took them from there.
Ulla was an emigrant. He was dying there and started to cry. They said to him, why are you crying? We shall bring you [to the Land of Israel]. He said to them, how does this help me? I am losing my pearl in an impure land. One cannot compare one who expires in the bosom of his mother to one who expires in the bosom of a strange woman. Rebbi Meïr was dying in Assos. He said, tell the people of the Land of Israel, there is your Messiah. With all that, he said to put his bier on the cape since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 24:2" href="/Psalms.24.2"><i>Ps</i>. 24:2</a>): “For He founded it on seas, based it on rivers.”
“Seven seas surround the Land of Israel: The ocean, lake Tiberias, lake <i>Samkho</i>, the salt sea, lake Ḥolata, lake Sheliat, lake Apamea.” But does there not also exist the lake of Ḥomṣ? Diocletian dammed up rivers and created it. It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 21:20" href="/Numbers.21.20"><i>Num</i>. 21:20</a>): “Looking down on the desert.” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, if one ascends the desert mountain one finds the likeness of a sieve in lake Tiberias, that is the well of Miryam. Rebbi Joḥanan bar Mara said, the rabbis estimated it and it is assessed opposite the middle gate of the old synagogue of <i>Imdvtgyn</i>.
Rebbi Bar Qiria and Rebbi Eleazar were taking a walk on the road when they saw coffins being brought into the Land from abroad. Rebbi Bar Qiria said to Rebbi Eleazar: What good is that going to do them? I am reading for them (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 2:7" href="/Jeremiah.2.7"><i>Jer</i>. 2:7</a>) “My inheritance your considered an abomination” during your lifetime, “you came and made My Land impure” in your death. He said to him, when they arrive in the Land, one takes a lump of earth and puts it on the coffin, as it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 32:43" href="/Deuteronomy.32.43"><i>Deut</i>. 32:43</a>) “His earth atones for His people.”

Rebbi Abba said, the reason of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina is that it applies not only to a <i>ketubah</i> of a mina or two hundred, but even regarding a <i>ketubah</i> of one thousand denar they proclaimed a relaxation of the laws of <i>ketubah</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody went overseas and another person provided for his wife<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The other person neither was appointed by the husband to provide for his wife, nor did the wife sign that she received his support as a loan, to be repaid at her husband’s return.</i>, Ḥanan says, he lost his money. The High Priests’ sons disagreed with him and said, let him swear on what he expended, that she shall collect; Rebbi Dosa ben Hyrkanos endorsed their statement. Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai said, Ḥanan said correctly that he put his money on a deer’s antler<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The deer runs away and sheds his antlers every year; a person who puts his money on a deer’s antlers is declaring it ownerless.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody went overseas,” etc. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal asked: If somebody pays off somebody else’s debt without the latter’s knowledge, is that the disagreement of Ḥanan and the High Priests’ sons<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 15:1:1-2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.15.1.1-2.2">Mishnah <i>Yebamot</i> 15:1</a> states that in this case the widow may remarry without proof of the husband’s death, she certainly must be believed regarding the monetary implications of her husband’s death.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, there the reason of the High Priest’s sons is that he would not expect his wife to starve. But here, [the debtor could say:] “I could negotiate with him and he would forgive some.” Think of it, if [the loan] was on a pledge! “I could negotiate with him and he would return my pledge.” So far about a creditor who does not push [for repayment]. Even for a creditor who pushes, we can hear from the following: “He may give his <i>šeqel</i>.” If somebody does not pay his <i>šeqel</i>, does one not take a pledge from him? This says, even for a creditor who pushes. You should know that this is so, as we have stated: “He can bring for him nests for males or females suffering from genital discharges, nests for childbirth, purification and reparation offerings” since nothing of these comes to [the other person’s] hand. And here also, that nothing should come into his hand.
Rebbi Joshua ben Levi says, nobody is held responsible for his neighbor except for <i>annona</i> and head-tax. Rav said, anything for which one is held responsible for one’s neighbor has to be repaid. The strength of Rav is from the following: “He who appropriated a field and oppressors took it.” He did not hear that Rebbi Joḥanan said, they exacted a fine from a robber. Rebbi Abin asked, what is greater? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun, and Rebbi Ḥiyya ben Julianus both said in the name of Samuel; one said, it is like <i>annona</i> and head-tax; the other said, it is not like <i>annona</i> and head-tax.
There, we have stated: “He heals him in the sense of personal healing but not in the sense of financial healing.” Rebbi Judan and Rebbi Yose. One of them said, here if the vow refers to his body, there if the vow refers to his property. But the other said, here if he has somebody else who can heal him, there if there is nobody else who can heal him. If he has somebody else who can heal him, he should not be able to heal him personally! Not by everybody is a person successfully healed.
Is not the property of the finder forbidden to the owner of the cow? Ulla bar Ismael in the name of Rebbi Isaac: If each man’s property was forbidden to the other.
Who is the Tanna of “the gain should be given to the sacred fund”? Rebbi Meïr! For Rebbi Meïr said, one commits sacrilege with prohibitions. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked: If somebody made a vow [to forbid] a loaf to himself, can he use it to warm his hands? Let us hear from the following: “If he said, this loaf shall be dedicated, if he or another person ate it, they committed sacrilege; therefore, it can be redeemed. But if he said, it is for me [as if dedicated], if he ate it he committed sacrilege on goodwill but others would not commit sacrilege.” He said only, if he ate it. Therefore, to warm his hands is permitted. The students of Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya: That is if he said I shall not eat it nor taste it; if he forbade only eating to himself. But the question was, if somebody made a vow [to forbid] a loaf to himself, can he use it to warm his hands?

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody sues another for amphoras of oil, and the defendant admits [that he owes him] vessels, Admon says, since he admitted part of the claim he is made to swear, but the Sages say, what he admitted was not of the kind that was claimed<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">If neither party has proof but the defendant admits to part of the claim, it is rabbinic interpretation (Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 6:1) of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex</i>. 22:8</a> that the defendant has to swear that he does not owe more than he admitted. In Admon’s interpretation, a claim for amphoras of oil is a claim for oil and the vessels in which it is contained, but for the Sages it is simply a claim for a certain standard measure of oil; if ownership of the vessels is also claimed, it would have to be stated explicitly. This Mishnah is repeated as part of Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i>6:3, in a series of explanations of what means “agreeing to part of the claim.”</i>. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, I am convinced by Admon’s statement,
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody sues another for amphoras of oil,” etc. The Mishnah, if he sued him for wheat and he admitted barley; but if he sued him for two kinds and he admitted one of them, according to everybody he is free<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Except for this sentence, which is redundant since it is repeated in the Mishnah with attribution of authorship, the Halakhah is a not quite complete copy of Halakhah <i>Šebuot</i> 6:3. Since the deviations between the two texts are not easily described as variant readings, both texts are given here side by side. It is seen that the basis of discussion is Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i>6:6, not <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 13:4:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.13.4.2"><i>Ketubot</i> 13:4</a>.

Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The Mishnah, if he sued him for wheat and he admitted barley; but if he sued him for two kinds and he admitted one of them, according to everybody he is free<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah referred to is <i>Šebuot</i> 6:3 which states that if the claim was for wheat but the defendant admits an obligation for barley, the admission is not relevant for the claim and the defendant does not have to swear, except that Rabban Gamliel holds that <i>any</i> admission by the defendant obligates the latter to swear. This sentence is followed by a copy of the Mishnah here, detailing the difference between Admon and the majority about claims for oil with or without the containers. It is now claimed in the name of R. Joḥanan that if a claim is put forward for two unrelated items, the admission in full of liability for one item does not induce an obligation on the defendant to swear if he denies all liability for the second claim since the two claims, while stated together before the court and treated at the same time, really constitute two separate suits. This opinion is quoted in the name of R. Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of R. Joḥanan in the <i>Šebuot</i> text and in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 108b" href="/Ketubot.108b">Babli, 108b</a>; it is explicitly rejected in the name of R.

The inconsistency of the Babli was recognized by the early commentators.</i>. And why did we state: “Rabban Gamliel obligates him”? This comes to tell you the power of Rabban Gamliel, how far he obligates people. Rebbi Abbahu [supported] that of Rebbi Immi. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish says, the Mishnah, if he sued him for wheat and he admitted barley; but if he sued him for two kinds and he admitted one of them, according to everybody he is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The opinion of R.

He started claiming from him barley, wheat and spelt. Rav told him, charge him with anything you have to charge, and in the end he will swear one oath about everything.

The Mishnah states that if one suit contains claims that have to be adjudicated following different rules of procedure, they cannot be consolidated and have to be treated separately. Since claims for real estate cannot be resolved by taking oaths (Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 6:5), if the claim was for movables and real estate, an admission by the defendant either of the claim for movables in full or for the claim for real estate either partially or in full cannot trigger an obligation to swear.</i> “if he sued him for vessels and real estate; if he admitted the vessels and denied the real estate, the real estate and denied the vessels”?

What does he do with it? He explains it, to transfer an oath to him. But did we not state: If somebody sues another for amphoras of oil, and the defendant admits [that he owes him] vessels”? How do we hold? If he sued him for vessels and oil, and he admitted one of them, everybody agrees that this refers to the claim. But if he sued him for oil and he admitted vessels, everybody agrees that what he admitted does not refer to the claim, for Rebbi Ze‘ira, Rebbi Abuna said in the name of Rav: The Mishnah deals with the case that he sued for vessels full of oil; the ones are full, the others empty<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Šebuot</i> text for an intelligible version of this statement.</i>.

Can one not ask him in the end<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The disagreement between Admon and the rabbis is not one that is frequently going to happen in practice. Since the problem is one of semantics, does a claim for amphoras of oil imply separate claims for amphoras and the oil that fills them or is “amphora of oil” simply a technical term denoting a standard volume for which contracts of delivery are made? Any judge asked in such a matter will ask the parties to clarify the meaning of their statements and then it will be obvious whether the defendant accepted part of the claim or not. The difference in the interpretation could only arise if one of the parties cannot be asked, either if a party dies or if he loses his speech.</i>? If he lost his speech.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If two people mutually produced promissory notes of one on the other, Admon says: “If I owed you, how come you borrowed from me?”<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">The one whose note is dated later claims that his own indebtedness was paid off even though he has no receipt in his possession, since the other party could have taken its money back instead of taking out a loan.</i> But the Sages say, each collects the amount of his note.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If two people mutually produced promissory notes of one on the other,” etc. If one borrowed a mina from the other, but the other borrowed from him 200 [<i>zuz</i>]. Rav Huna said, Rav Naḥman bar Jacob and Rab Sheshet disagree. One says, one counts one mina against the other mina, but the other says, each one collects the amount of his note<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 110a" href="/Ketubot.110a">Babli, 110a</a>, Rav Naḥman is identified as holding that each one collects the amount of his note, Rav Sheshet that one counts mina against mina. Rav Naḥman’s opinion is then restricted to the case that neither of the parties has money to satisfy his obligation and that the average quality of their respective real estate holdings is unequal. This means that in the Babli, Rav Naḥman agrees with Rav Sheshet except in the case where such a mutual accounting would be to the detriment of one party. This interpretation is excluded by the Yerushalmi’s examples at the end of this paragraph.</i>.

He who says, each one collects the amount of his note, learns it from the Sages and Admon<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Most commentators want to correct the text from מֵרַבָּנִין וְאַדְמוֹן to מֵרַבָּנִין דְּאַדְמוֹן “the rabbis opposing Admon.” But since מֵרַבָּנִין וְאַדְמוֹן can be interpreted as “the rabbis in their discussion with Admon”, the readings of ms. and <i>editio princeps</i> can be upheld as <i>lectio difficilior</i>.</i>. Can the Sages and Admon not agree that one counts one mina against the other mina? Because we have stated: Admon says: “If I owed you, how come you borrowed from me?” Therefore it was necessary to say, each one collects the amount of his note<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">It is not necessary to read the Mishnah as prescribing that the notes have to be paid in cash and cannot be liquidated by accounting. Since Admon would allow one of the note holders to contest the other note without producing a receipt, all the rabbis say is that nobody can claim that a valid note was paid unless he produces a receipt.</i>. If the holder of the note of 200 forgave a mina, but the holder of the note of a mina did not forgive. For him who says, one counts one mina against the other mina, already one mina against the other mina was counted<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">No money changes hands since the two notes cancel one another out.</i>. But for him who says, each one collects the amount of his note, then what he forgave he cannot collect but what was not forgiven he can collect. If the note for 200 was written in a document but the loan for a mina was not written. For him who says, one counts one mina against the other mina, already one mina against the other mina was counted.
