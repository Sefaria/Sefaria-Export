Jerusalem Talmud Peah



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<b>Mishnah</b> <br>These are the matters that do not have a <i>shiur</i> <small>(Jastrow: no definite proportion or quantity prescribed)</small>: <i>Peah</i> <small>(lit. corner, that of the field and the obligation to leave for the poor)</small>, <i>Bikkurim</i> <small>(first fruits of the first permissible harvest which one is obligated to bring to the Temple and say the prescribed benediction)</small>, The Appearance <small>(reference to either the Mitzvah to appear at the Temple for the Festivals and/or the <i>Korban</i> brought for that occasion)</small>, acts of kindness, and the study of Torah.<br> These are the matters that a person eats from its fruits in This World, and the principal is maintained for the The World to Come: the honoring of father and mother, acts of kindness, bringing peace between a person and his friend, and learning Torah is equivalent to them all.
<b>Gemara</b> Rabbi Binyamin the son of Levi said that Rabbi Yitzchok and Rabbi Ami were sitting and asking: Why did it not teach <i>Terumah</i> <small>(the portion to separate from the completed harvest to give to the <i>Kohanim</i>)</small> with them <small>(i.e. with the other cases in the Mishnah)</small>?<br>Said Rabbi Ami "Because of disagreement" <small>(i.e. it's lack of required maximum measurement is subject to a disagreement thus wasn't included, see Terumos 4:5)</small>. <br> Said Rabbi Yosi "A person can make their whole field <i>Bikkurim</i> but a person cannot make their whole field <i>Terumah</i>. <br>They <small>(the Scholars) asked: Behold it <small>(i.e. the Mishnah)</small> says <i>Peah</i>, and behold <small>(a Baraisa, the Tosefta 1:1)</small> "A person cannot make his whole field <i>Peah</i>" - and it was taught! <br>Said Rabbi Yosi: The harvesting <small>(i.e. the cutting or reaping)</small> of the first stalk is similar to smoothing <small>(מְמָרֵחַ refers to the flattening or smoothing [like a final packaging] of collected produce in silos or similar where the harvest process is considered complete and now subject to the Terumah obligation)</small>. Until one does cut the first stalk, the field is not obligated in <i>Peah</i>, from when the first stalk is cut, the field is obligated in <i>Peah</i>. <small>(At that point after cutting the first stalk when the obligation begins)</small> one who wants to make his whole field <i>Peah</i> can do so. However, here <small>(in the case of Terumah)</small> so long as the pile is not smoothed, it is not obligated in <i>Terumah</i>. Once smoothed, one who wants to make his whole pile <i>Terumah</i> cannot for we are taught there <small>(in a Mishnah, Challah 1:9)</small> "One who says all my grains are <i>Terumah</i> or all my dough is <i>Challah</i> has not said anything <small>(i.e. it is ineffective)</small> until there remains some left over." <small>(Therefore the Mitzvah of <i>Peah</i> begins after an event [the beginning of the harvest as the verse describes which is defined as the first cutting of the field to harvest], at that point once the obligation begins there is no limit to the Mitzvah either allowing one to leave the entire field or a even a minuscule amount. <i>Terumah</i> similarly starts once the harvest is complete but it is limited as it is supposed to be a 'portion' of the harvest that is given to the Kohanim therefore cannot be unlimited as the Torah's request to take a portion of the completed harvest implies there has to be a portion remaining kept as regular non-<i>Terumah</i> [<i>chullin</i>] food.)</small></small>

He who collects Peah and says: “Behold, this is for such-and-such poor man” - Rabbi Eliezer says: He acquired it for him; the Sages say: He must give it to the first poor person that he finds. The Leket, the Shikhechah, and the Peah of a non-Jew are obligated in tithes unless he abandons them.
Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said: The dispute is in a where the owner of the field is rich, but if he is poor, since he can take -- he has acquired it [for the poor person].
Rabbi Zeira said: Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yochanan, and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi all said the same thing [that one can acquire a lost object for someone else]. Rabbi Eliezer, as Rabbi Zeira said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: a man can acquire a lost object for his friend. Rabbi Yochanan, as we teach in a Mishnah: "Something found by his minor son or daughter, or something found by his gentile servant or maid-servant, or something found by his wife - these belong to him. Something found by his adult son or daughter, or something found by his Hebrew servant or maid-servant, or something found by his wife whom he divorced, even if he has not yet paid her the value of her ketubah [monetary settlement payable to a married woman upon divorce or the death of her husband], these belong to them." And Rabbi Yochanan said: this is when they [the adult children] are not dependent on their father, but when they are, objects they find go to the father. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi: for Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said: The dispute is in a where the owner of the field is rich, but if he is poor, since he can take -- he has acquired it [for the poor person].
It is taught [in a Baraita]: he who hires a worker, to do anything, what he finds belongs to the employer. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish asked upon the Baraita: If wants to back out - he can, and you say that what he finds belongs to the employer? Rabbi Jacob bar Acha asked, as Rabbi Yossi questions: Why do we need to quote this from Reish Lakish? Why not learn it from what Rabbi Jacob bar Acha stated: Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish argued. Rabbi Yochanan said: a man can acquire a lost object for his friend. and Reish Lakish said: a man cannot acquire a lost object for his friend.
Rabbi Redifa said: Rabbi Jonah and Rabbi Yossi had a dispute: one said whoever can take, can acquire [for someone else]. And the other said whoever can give -- has acquired. He who said whoever can take, how much more so he who can give! And he who said whoever can give -- but not take.
The Mishnah disputes he who said whoever can receive, as we teach: "Give this bill of divorce to my wife" -- [no, this is not an issue,] for the messenger could accept a bill of divorce on behalf of his daughter. "this deed of manumission to my slave" -- [no, this is not an issue, for he is a slave who can accept his own deed of manumission]. And we further teach: "[with regard to one who says] "Accept this bill of divorce on behalf of my wife," or, "Bring this bill of divorce to my wife," he may take it back if he wants."
