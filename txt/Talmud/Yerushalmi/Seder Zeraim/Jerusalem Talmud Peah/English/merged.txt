Jerusalem Talmud Peah



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> These are the matters that have no measure<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These are obligations spelled out in the Torah, so one has to fulfill them; but the Torah did not specify either minimum or maximum obligation. However, there are rabbinic minima and sometimes maxima established for all obligations.</i>: Peah<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In harvesting a field, one is not permitted to harvest the last corner (פאה); that must be abandoned to be harvested by the poor (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:9" href="/Leviticus.19.9"><i>Lev</i>. 19:9</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:22" href="/Leviticus.23.22">23:22</a>). There is no minimum mentioned in the Torah; the Talmud will discuss whether one may declare one’s entire field as <i>Peah</i>.</i>, first fruits<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There is an obligation to bring the first fruits of one’s land to the Temple, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:19" href="/Leviticus.23.19"><i>Lev</i>. 23:19</a>, 34:26; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 10:36" href="/Nehemiah.10.36"><i>Neh</i>. 10:36</a>. No amount has been specified. This obligation is the subject of tractate <i>Bikkurim</i>.</i>, appearance<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There is an obligation to appear in the Temple on the three holidays of pilgrimage (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:17" href="/Exodus.23.17"><i>Ex</i>. 23:17</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:23-24" href="/Exodus.34.23-24">34:23–24</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 16:16" href="/Deuteronomy.16.16"><i>Deut</i>. 16:16</a>). It is forbidden to appear in the Temple emptyhanded (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:15" href="/Exodus.23.15"><i>Ex</i>. 23:15</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:20" href="/Exodus.34.20">34:20</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 16:16" href="/Deuteronomy.16.16"><i>Deut</i>. 16:16</a>), i. e., without bringing a sacrifice. The Torah does not directly spell out the value of the sacrifice, but the verse in <i>Deuteronomy</i> requires it to be “proportional to the blessing that the Eternal has bestowed on you.” The Talmud will discuss which of the two obligations (appearance or sacrifice) is meant here.</i>, works of kindness<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Charity has two aspects: one is giving money and valuables to the needy; this has no explicit lower and upper limit, but it does have rabbinic limits in both directions. This, in addition to the laws of <i>Peah</i>, is one of the topics of the tractate. The other aspect is giving one’s time to attend funerals, weddings, visiting the sick and mourners, to work for the public good, and similar deeds. That aspect has no limits, upper or lower, expressed anywhere.</i>, and Torah study<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is written of the Torah (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 1:8" href="/Joshua.1.8"><i>Jos</i>. 1:8</a>): “You should meditate upon it day and night.” Hence, there is no upper limit. The obligation of Torah study can be fulfilled by the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>, but that recitation is also an independent obligation. Hence, Torah study <i>per se</i> has no lower limit.</i>. These are the matters whose product a person eats in this world and whose capital remains for him<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As deeds which merit reward in the future life.</i> in the future world: Honoring father and mother, works of kindness, making peace between people; the study of Torah is worth all of these.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Benjamin ben Levi<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As deeds which merit reward in the future life.</i> said: Rebbi Isaac and Rebbi Immi<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He is Rebbi Ammi.</i> were sitting and asking: Why did they not state <i>terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The gift to the Cohen from the harvest, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.1"><i>Berakhot</i>, Chapter 1, Note 3</a>. There are two kinds of <i>terumah</i>. The first one, <i>terumah gedolah</i> “the great <i>terumah</i>” must be given to the Cohen as absolutely first gift after the completion of the harvest. Then a tithe of ten percent, <i>maäser</i>, must be given to the Levite who in turn has to give ten percent, one percent of the original, to the Cohen. The two <i>terumot</i> must be eaten in ritual purity by the priestly families; in contrast the tithe is a civil obligation and is profane food in the hands of the Levite. An infraction of the rules of purity for <i>terumah</i> is a deadly sin. One speaks here about <i>terumah gedolah</i> for the quantity of which the Torah does not give any rules; hence, one grain may be given for an entire silo full of grain. Today, this grain, being ritually impure, has to be burned.</i> with these? Rebbi Immi said, because of the disagreement<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 3:5 we find a disagreement between Tannaïm. Rebbi Eliezer is of the opinion that one may not give more than 10% of the crop as <i>terumah gedolah</i>. Rebbi Ismael gives 50% as upper limit, and Rebbis Aqiba and Tarphon permit one to give as much as one likes on condition that some profane food be left over. Hence, one cannot say that <i>terumah gedolah</i> has no upper limit from the Torah, at least not according to Rebbis Eliezer and Ismael.</i>. Rebbi Yose said<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Yose (the fourth generation Amora) explains that even according to Rebbis Aqiba and Tarphon, who are followed in practice, <i>terumah</i> has no place in the Mishnah.</i>, one may declare one’s entire field first fruits but one may not declare one’s entire field <i>terumah</i>. They objected: Look, it mentions <i>peah</i>, but nobody may make his entire field <i>peah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>.</i>, but it was stated! Rebbi Yose said: The cutting of the first ear is compared to smoothing<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In harvesting grain, the last operation is smoothing the heap of grain (so that theft could be easily detected. In modern terms, the equivalent would be storing the grain in a silo.) <i>Terumah</i> is not due before the end of the harvesting process since it is an obligation only for food. The implication is that workers may eat from the kernels before the end of the harvesting process (cutting, threshing, winnowing, and storing); after that one may not eat from it before <i>terumot</i> are separated.</i>. Before he cut the first ear, the field was not obligated for <i>peah</i>. After he cut the first ear, the entire field became obligated for <i>peah</i> and if he then wants to declare his entire field as <i>peah</i> he may do so<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is not “the entire field,” only “the entire field that is obligated for <i>peah</i>;” hence, the Tosephta that forbids the entire field will permit the field minus one stalk.</i>. But here, before he smoothed his grain heap, the heap was not obligated for <i>terumah</i>. When he wants to declare his entire heap as <i>terumah</i>, he may not do so since we have stated there (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 1:5:5-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.1.5.5-8"><i>Ḥallah</i> 1:9</a>): “He who says: My whole threshing floor shall be <i>terumah</i> or my entire dough shall be <i>ḥallah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ḥallah</i> is the obligatory gift to the Cohen from a (large enough) batch of bread dough, discussed in tractate <i>Ḥallah</i>. It has the status of <i>terumah</i>; hence, today is must be burned.</i> did not say anything unless he reserves part of it<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the remainder may be a single grain; the difference to <i>peah</i> is in the theoretical basis, not the practical side.</i>.”
Is the first ear obligated for <i>peah</i>? It is impossible to say that it obligated the entire field for <i>peah</i> and itself should be obligated for <i>peah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the preceding paragraph.</i>. If he cut the first ear and it was burned, does he have to cut another one a second time<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">If he wants to give his entire field to the poor as <i>peah</i>, must the ear he cut first be in existence at the moment of dedication?</i>? Let us hear it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A statement similar to this <i>baraita</i> is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 1:9" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).1.9">Tosephta 1:9</a>; the reference is to Mishnah 2:7: “If he cut half the field and sold the other half, the buyer gives <i>peah</i> for everything. If he cut half the field and dedicated the other half, the one who redeems it gives <i>peah</i> for everything.” In both cases, the field is given or dedicated as is, with all obligations on the harvest, since <i>peah</i> must be given at the last corner to be harvested.</i>: “If he cut half the field and sold the other half, or he sold what he had cut, if he cut half the field and dedicated<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">To the Temple, the proceeds to be used for the upkeep of the Temple. While the material is in the hands of the Temple authorities, any private use of it is forbidden.</i> what he had cut, he gives from the leftover for everything.” If it is dedicated is it not as if it was burned<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since no benefit whatsoever may be derived from it at this stage.</i>? This says that if he cut the first ear and it was burned, he does not have to cut a second time<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Because if he dedicated the first half and cut the second half for himself, he must give <i>peah</i> for the entire field from his part. If we replace the dedicated half by the burned ear, we have exactly the case that we are dealing with.</i>.
If he finished the field<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He harvested the entire field without leaving <i>peah</i> for the poor. The reference is to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 1:5" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).1.5">Tosephta 1:5</a>: “If he did not give from standing grain, he must give from sheaves. If he did not give from sheaves, he must give from stacks. If he did not give from stacks, he must give from the grain heap. If he did not give from the grain heap before it was smoothed, he must first give <i>terumah</i> and tithes and only then <i>peah</i>.” See also Mishnah 1:6, Halakha 7:2, 4:1; an extended version is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 94a" href="/Bava_Kamma.94a">Babli <i>Baba qama</i>94a</a>.</i>, you say that <i>peah</i> devolves on the sheaves. Would <i>peah</i> turn back to the first ear<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">That the first cut also may be <i>peah</i> from its sheaf if the entire field was cut.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, let us learn <i>peah</i> of sheaves from <i>peah</i> of standing grain. Since <i>peah</i> from standing grain does not return to the first ear<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the preceding paragraph, the first cut is not subject to the laws of <i>peah</i> at all since it enables the laws to be applied.</i>, <i>peah</i> of sheaves likewise should not return to the first ear.
<i>Peah</i> has a minimum measure but no maximum measure. First fruits and appearance have neither minimum nor maximum measures. There are those who state: <i>Peah</i>, first fruits and appearance have no measure, neither minimum nor maximum. What is the difference between them, is it not one in sixty<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 2 states that the rabbinic minimum for <i>peah</i> is one sixtieth of the field, 1 2/3 percent. In both formulations it is agreed that <i>peah</i> has no minimum from the Torah but it has a minimum by rabbinic usage.</i>? According to him who says that <i>peah</i> has a minimum measure but no maximum measure: What he gave<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">When he harvested but left less than 1 2/3% of the harvest standing on the field. The standing grain certainly has the status of <i>peah</i> and, no longer being the property of the farmer, is not subject to the requirement of <i>terumah</i> and tithes. [The interpretation of R. Simson of Sens is that, while as Biblical commandment there is no lower limit to what he must give, by rabbinic decree any gift of less than 1⅔% is not considered <i>peah</i> and is subject to the laws of tithes even though it is the property of the poor and not of the farmer.]</i>, he gave; if he had second thoughts and added to it, it is subject to tithes until he makes up for it<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Any amount he adds which together with the standing <i>peah</i> does not add up to 1 2/3% of the yield of the entire field, is a voluntary gift, rather than <i>peah</i>, and has the status of grain given after threshing and smoothing the heap. The farmer is obliged to separate from it <i>terumah</i> and tithes. Only if he reaches the rabbinic threshhold of 1 2/3% [according to R. Simson of Sens, only if he gives all of 1 2/3% at one time] does the rule of <i>peah</i> apply again and the produce may be taken by the poor without further obligation.</i>. According to him who says <i>peah</i>, first fruits and appearance sacrifices have no measure, neither minimum nor maximum: What he gave already freed from the obligation; if he has second thoughts and adds, that is subject to tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">To the Temple, the proceeds to be used for the upkeep of the Temple. While the material is in the hands of the Temple authorities, any private use of it is forbidden.</i>.
Rebbi Berekhiah asked: Why did we not state the dust for the straying<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The straying wife who was seen in a secret rendez-vous with another man. The jealous husband may bring his wife to the Temple where she has to drink water mixed with some dust from the Temple floor as an ordeal (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5" href="/Numbers.5"><i>Num</i>. 5</a>). There is no minimum amount of that dust prescribed.</i>? Why did we not state the ashes of the heifer<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The ashes of the red heifer must be strewn on the water with which people defiled by contact with a dead body could be purified for entrance to the Temple (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19" href="/Numbers.19"><i>Num</i>. 19</a>). Since these ashes are extremely valuable, using more than a minimum amount is a misdeed.</i>? Why did we not state the spittle of the sister-in-law<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The childless widow who is not married by her brother-in-law becomes free to marry outside the family only by removing a shoe from the foot of the unwilling brother-in-law and spitting out before him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:9" href="/Deuteronomy.25.9"><i>Deut</i>. 25:9</a>). The spittle falling to the earth must be seen by the court but no minimum is established.</i>? Why did we not state the blood of the bird for the “leper”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The bird needed for the ritual cleansing of the “leper” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:1-7" href="/Leviticus.14.1-7"><i>Lev</i>. 14:1–7</a>).

Simson of Sens and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Chagigah 7a" href="/Tosafot_on_Chagigah.7a">Tosaphot <i>Ḥagigah</i> 7a</a>, this is a statement of the Amora R. Yose mentioned in the previous paragraphs, contemporary of R. Berekhiah.</i> Mishnah deals only with things to which he may add and adding is a worthy deed. As for those, even though he may add to them, doing so is no worthy deed.
“Appearance”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from the Mishnah that introduces a new subject.</i>. Our Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simson of Sens already noted that this is a scribal error and that the subsequent discussion shows that it is the value of the obligatory sacrifice which has a fixed minimum. Hence, one should read: “Our Mishnah is about appearance with a sacrifice but appearance in person has no measure.”</i> is about appearance with a sacrifice, but appearance in person has a measure. This agrees with what R. Joḥanan said: “One silver obolus and two silver coins are words of the Torah”<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.2.1">Mishnah Ḥagigah 1:2</a> fixes the minimum amount to be spent on the two obligatory sacrifices as, respectively, one silver obolus and two silver coins. [The two sacrifices are the holocaust for the altar and a family sacrifice of which only a small part was burned on the altar. The houses of Shammai and Hillel disagree on the distribution of these sums but not on the principle that the first has to be a silver obolus and the second two silver coins.] According to most commentators, the “silver coins” mentioned also are oboli [6 oboli equal one drachma (denar) and four drachmas equal one tetradrachma (סלע)]. In the Roman empire only the emperor could mint silver coins. The Eastern mint was at Tyre; hence, silver coins are also called Tyrian money. Before the inflation of the military anarchy, local coinage was of copper and worth one eighth of the corresponding silver coinage.<br>The following discussion will determine whether these minimal amounts have rabbinic or biblical status.</i>.
Rebbi Yasa stated before Rebbi Joḥanan: The appearance is with anything<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">One may appear in the Temple with one sacrifice for the appearance and one for the family holiday; no minimal expenditure is required. The monetary minimum is purely a rabbinic one.</i>; the sages only said: “One silver obolus, two silver coins.” He said to him: Is there anything like<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi כן is contracted from כְּעֵין “in the kind of.”</i> that? Rebbi Jonah said, are not all measures determined by the sages<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">There are many biblical precepts that are applied only to some minimal amount and volume. None of these are spelled out in the Torah; they are all rabbinic formulations.</i>? They said: “The volume of an olive from a corpse<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">All rules of defilement by parts of a corpse apply only if a minimum size of the volume of one olive is present. Hence, somebody in a house in which less than that volume of a corpse is present may go to the Temple without the purification procedure of the ashes of the red heifer even though going there in impurity is a strict biblical prohibition.</i>, the volume of an olive from a cadaver<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">To bring a sin offering for having eaten from a cadaver needs this minimum amount; the same minimum applies to the impurity caused by touching or carrying pieces of the cadaver of an otherwise kosher animal.</i>, the volume of a lentil from a dead reptile<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The minimum volume from a carcass that causes the severe impurity incurred by touching dead reptiles.</i>.” The question here is only what Rebbi Hoshaia stated: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:15" href="/Exodus.23.15"><i>Ex</i>. 23:15</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:20" href="/Exodus.34.20">34:20</a>) “They should not be seen before Me empty-handed,” with anything<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">No minimal amount required.</i>; the sages only said: “A silver obolus, two silver coins.” The difficulty is that this<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Two verses (and an additional one in <i>Deut</i>.) insist that one may not appear empty-handed; this must mean that a negligible amount is counted as nothing and, therefore, forbidden by the Torah.</i> is support for the opinion that [the rule] is based on words of the Torah. He said that only the sages instituted<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The text in parentheses is the one of the Venice print here; the text in brackets is from the word-by-word parallel in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:2:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.2.2-4"><i>Ḥagigah</i> 1:2</a> (fol. 76b). The translation is that of the <i>Ḥagigah</i> text which alone makes sense. It may be assumed that the copyist of the manuscript used for printing had before him a manuscript in which the entire sentence was only indicated by “etc.” and the copyist chose the wrong statement to complete.</i>: “One silver obolus, two silver coins.” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said: Rebbi Johanan follows his own opinion since Rebbi Joḥanan said that all measures<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Including those stated by R. Jonah and all similar ones.</i> are practice taught by Moses at Sinai;
he says that “one obolus and two silver coins are the word of the Torah.” Rebbi Hoshaia follows his own opinion since Rebbi Hoshaia said: He who eats forbidden food in the present time has to note down the quantities<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since one is required to bring a sin-offering only if he ate more than the volume of an olive, he is forbidden to bring one if he ate less than that volume. Hence, the determination of that volume is essential. The statement of R. Hoshaia here is attributed to R. Eleazar, student and colleague of R. Johanan, in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 80a" href="/Yoma.80a">Babli <i>Yoma</i> 80a</a>. There, the interpretation is that not the rule of “volume of an olive” might change but rather its interpretation. A. Y. Greenfield, in his article “The Connection Between the Measures of an Olive and an Egg,” תחומין 14 (5754) 396–411 shows that modern interpretations of the “volume of an olive” vary on a scale of 1 to 30. Hence, once the Temple is rebuilt, an authoritative interpretation is needed even according to R. Joḥanan.</i>; maybe a new court will arise and change the measures for him; then he will know what measure he ate.
They said, Rebbi Joḥanan changed his mind about this. Rebbis Jonah and Yose said, he did not change his mind; additionally, Rebbi La said in the name of Rebbi Ammi: Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Joḥanan disagreed. Ḥizqiah said, a man may split his obligation for two animals<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">He has to spend an obolus and two silver coins on animals for his pilgrimage but, since this is a rabbinic ordinance, it does not matter if the amount is split to pay for several animals.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, nobody may split his obligation for two animals, but for each one he has to have two silver coins in his hand<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is the practice from the days of Moses to spend two silver coins for one sacrifice of the larger kind, this has the status of a biblical command and cannot be abrogated. Similarly, a full obolus must be spend on one animal of the smaller kind.</i>.
Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish in the name of Ḥizqiah: A person adjoins an animal to an animal but no person may adjoin money to money<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chagigah 8a" href="/Chagigah.8a">Babli <i>Ḥagigah</i>8a</a> (and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:2:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.2.2-4">Yerushalmi <i>Ḥagigah</i> 1:2</a>). In the Babli, it is explained that the obligation to spend an obolus and two silver coins must be satisfied by unencumbered money. Now four years out of seven there is a second tithe on agricultural produce of the Land of Israel. That second tithe is the property of the farmer but it must be consumed in Jerusalem; it also may be redeemed by money and the money taken to Jerusalem and there spent on food to be consumed in Jerusalem. In addition, the tenth newborn calf or lamb in a herd must be taken to Jerusalem and offered as a sacrifice (only some blood is sprinkled on the altar, the rest is to be eaten by the family of the rancher.) So one may assume that many people on their pilgrimage for the holiday have money and animals of the tithe that they want to eat in Jerusalem to absolve themselves at the same time of the obligations of pilgrimage and (second) tithe. According to Ḥizqiah, on the first day of the holiday one may bring small and cheap animals as obligatory sacrifices and then use the money or the animal of tithes for additional <i>ḥagigah</i> offerings but one may not add the money of second tithes to profane money to buy one large animal for any of the two obligations.<br>In the text, the corresponding statement by R. Joḥanan is missing, viz., that one may add money (if only the basic amount is profane) but not animals (since no animal worth less than two pieces of silver is acceptable as <i>ḥagigah</i>). The statement appears in <i>Ḥagigah</i>.</i>. What may be done<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">A rhetorical introduction to the main question, corresponding to: “They asked themselves” in the Babli.</i>? There were before him ten animals, he sacrificed five of them on the first holiday. May the remainder push aside the last holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">If these animals retain the status of <i>ḥagigah</i>, they may be sacrificed on the last day of Pesaḥ or Sukkot which are also full holidays. If, however, they have only the status of sacrifices in fulfillment of a vow (since any dedication as sacrifice is a vow to bring the animal to the Temple), then they may be slaughtered only during the intermediate days of the holiday or after its conclusion, and they do not push aside holiday prohibitions.</i>? Rebbi Crispus said, Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish have differing opinions. One said, they push; the other one said, they do not push. We do not know who said what. Rebbi Zeïra said, we may explain the words of the rabbis through the words of Rebbi Joḥanan, who<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Aramaic דּוּ is a contraction of דְּהוּא.</i> said: A person may adjoin coins to coins but not animals to an animal. He must say, they push<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since each animal was bought with money dedicated for <i>ḥagigah</i>, they all have the status of <i>ḥagigah</i>.</i>. But Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, a person adjoins an animal to an animal but no person may adjoin money to money. He must say, they do not push<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since one may not adjoin money, only the first animal was <i>ḥagigah</i>, the rest are not and cannot be used for holiday sacrifices.</i>. Simeon bar Abba came in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: He adds<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Even during the intermediate days of the holiday, when one’s biblical obligation of appearing in the Temple with a sacrifice has already been satisfied, he can add money to the original money and still the animals bought will fall under the category of <i>ḥagigah</i>. But when he declares that it is enough, the next money spent will no longer buy <i>ḥagigah</i> sacrifices. This extension of R. Joḥanan’s statement is not a logical consequence of his earlier one.</i> and pushes the holiday further until he says: I do not intend to add further.
“Works of kindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from the Mishnah, introduction of the next subject.</i>” That means with his person<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Charity has two aspects: one is giving money and valuables to the needy; this has no explicit lower and upper limit, but it does have rabbinic limits in both directions. This, in addition to the laws of <i>Peah</i>, is one of the topics of the tractate. The other aspect is giving one’s time to attend funerals, weddings, visiting the sick and mourners, to work for the public good, and similar deeds.

If it should come to pass that someone is beaten, it is better that it should happen to me rather than to you. It turns out that he binds his father to the grindstone and inherits paradise.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One never gives <i>peah</i> less than one in sixty<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">1 2/3% of the yield of the field.</i>. Even though they said that <i>peah</i> has no measure, everything is according to the size of the field, the poor, and the humility<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rome manuscript הענבה “the size of the berries;” in the Munich manuscript of the Babli as well as the Code of Maimonides, הענייה “the answer” (of the field to the farmer’s effort.) Both Maimonides and R. Simson explain that if one part of the field has a large yield and another part a meager one, one should not give all of <i>peah</i> from the meager part. The two readings imply that the religiosity of the farmer is no matter to consider here.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated: One does not say to him, bring camels and load up. The <i>baraita</i> speaks if he wants to give more than the measure<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">The measure is the amount fixed by the rabbis, 1 2/3%. If there is a large field and only one poor person one tells the poor to bring camels and load up the <i>peah</i>. The restriction on more than 1 2/3% is introduced because <i>peah</i> is not subject to the laws of <i>terumah</i> and tithes; hence, what is given to the poor diminishes what is given to priests and Levites. On the other hand, one does not allow the farmer to get away with less than 1 2/3% <i>peah</i>.</i>, but if he gives according to the measure then one says to the poor to bring camels and load up. If his field is large and the poor few, he gives according to the field. His field is small and the poor many, he gives according to the poor. Rebbi Simeon explained two things to make it easy for the owner: If his field is large and the poor few, he gives according to the poor; if his field is small and the poor many, he gives according to the field. The Mishnah does not say so, but “everything is according to the size of the field, the poor, and the humility (yield).<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that the Mishnah, which is followed in practice, requires the farmer to give more than the minimum 1 2/3% unless there is only one poor person and he would need a camel to remove the <i>peah</i>. This is also the interpretation of Maimonides (<i>Mattenot ‘Aniïm</i> 1:16).</i>”

Some would understand it from here: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:21" href="/Deuteronomy.24.21"><i>Deut</i>. 24:21</a>) “When you harvest your vineyard.” How do you understand this<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">The entire verse reads: “If you harvest your vineyard, you should not go back to pluck the single berries; it should be for the convert, the orphan, and the widow.” The definition of a single berry is given in Mishnah <i>Peah</i> 7:4. The question is about the meaning of the word עוֹלל “to go over it a second time”. The root עלל means “go over a second time, do anything a second time.” In Arabic, علل means “to harvest fruits a second time”. For example, עלילה means doing something following a well thought-out plan. Rebbi Jonah reads the verse in Lamentations as: “May all their evil come before You and may You <i>repeatedly</i> punish them, just as You <i>repeatedly</i> punished me for all my sins.” One is not allowed to go over the vines a second time after one has harvested the bunched grapes; that is the equivalent of <i>peah</i> for vines, (מתעלל is usually translated “to abuse, to mistreat,” it should be taken to mean “to mistreat repeatedly” with emphasis on the repetition of abuse.)</i>? Rebbi Jonah said, do not be punctilious, as you say (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Lamentations 1:22" href="/Lamentations.1.22"><i>Lament</i>. 1:22</a>) “to punish them repeatedly.” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:21" href="/Deuteronomy.24.21"><i>Deut</i>. 24:21</a>) “When you shake your olive tree.” How do you understand this<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads: “If you shake your olive tree, do not investigate every branch afterwards; it should be for the convert, the orphan and the widow.” The way of harvesting olives for pressing oil is to shake every branch, then the ripe olives will fall off and are collected under the tree in a cloth [translation of R. Saadiah Gaon]. The root פאר appears only here in the meaning “to glean”; usually it means “to appear in splendor”. The first meaning reappears in the nouns פֻּארָה “crown of the tree”, פֹֹּארוֹת “tree branch”. Rebbi Jonah identifies first and second meanings, and reads: “Do not remove its splendor.” Then he compares the splendor of the tree, פֻּארָה, to the splendor of one’s head, the hair, that in the second verse also is called <i>peah</i>; hence it follows that the remaining olives on the tree have the status of <i>peah</i> and go under its rules. Accordingly, the rules of <i>peah</i> apply both for olive trees and vines.</i>? Rebbi Jonah said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:27" href="/Leviticus.19.27"><i>Lev</i>. 19:27</a>): “Do not round off the <i>peah</i> of your head.” Since olive and vineyard are special in that they are harvested at one time for storage, so also everything that is harvested at one time for storage is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">By the principle בנין אב משני כתובים “principle established by two verses”.

From<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">This is a second version of the proof that the two verses are really needed, that they are not “two parallel laws” which by their parallelism indicate that they express only these two cases and no general principle. The argument is: If the mention of <i>peah</i> for the olive tree alone would allow one to infer the duty of <i>peah</i> for all trees then from the verse in <i>Lev</i>. the duty of not collecting single fruits would apply to all trees. That is patent nonsense since most trees do not produce bunches of fruit but only isolated fruits. The sentence in parenthesis is dittography, or it may have been an attempt to explain the argument in a marginal note which subsequently entered the text.</i> the olive tree one may infer <i>peah</i> for all trees. From the vineyard one should infer the rule of isolated berries for all trees. (Just as from the olive tree one infers <i>peah</i> for all trees so one should infer the rule of isolated berries for all trees from the vineyard.) Rebbi Abun said, any property that is common to both yields an inference but any property that is [not<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Missing in the Venice print but clearly a scribal error already corrected by R. S.

It is fine according to the opinion of Rebbi Ismael. Since Rebbi Ismael established: Everything that was in a set and left the set to be applied to a new rule, is removed from the set and forms a new one<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">This is the formulation of the Yerushalmi. In the Babylonian version, (Introduction to <i>Sifra</i> and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Zevachim 49a" href="/Zevachim.49a"><i>Zebaḥim</i> 49a</a>), the reading is: “Anything that was in a set and was taken out for an additional law, cannot be returned to its set except if the verse returns it explicitly.” The example there is about different kinds of sacrifices (חטאת, אשם) which in some respect follow the same rules, while in other aspects they do not. Therefore, a special verse is needed for taking the two kinds together to imply that they form one set of sacrifices with common rules. Here, the rule of the single berry clearly separates the vine from all other trees. Hence, it is necessary that there be a separate verse to apply the rule of <i>peah</i> to vines.</i>; it is necessary that <i>peah</i> should be mentioned for the vineyard. But for the rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">These rabbis are not mentioned in the Babli.</i> who say, it remains in its set and keeps its special status, why is <i>peah</i> mentioned for the vineyard?

Just<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the discussion of the conditions imposed on produce that should be subject to <i>peah</i>.</i> as you say for the harvest that its collection must be at one time in order to qualify for <i>peah</i>, should one say that the same is true for the laborer<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">The hired agricultural laborer, who is poor, may eat while harvesting or working in the field.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Forever<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">A person who cuts his entire field without leaving <i>peah</i> has later to give <i>peah</i> to the poor. “Smoothing" is a technical term that designates the end of processing the grain harvest, when after threshing and cleaning from chaff, the grain is put into orderly heaps to be stored. The Mishnah states that the obligation of giving <i>peah</i> must be fulfilled as long as the relevant produce is in the hand of the farmer, but if it is given before smoothing then it is free from <i>terumah</i> and the two tithes. If <i>peah</i> is given later, the farmer has first to give <i>terumah</i> and tithes before he can discharge his obligation for <i>peah</i>. [In the Mishnah manuscripts there is a second sentence, that he who declares part of his crop as abandoned is freed from the relative <i>terumah</i> and tithes if it is abandoned before smoothing. This sentence is missing in the Yerushalmi and in the Munich manuscript of the Babli.]<br>The Halakhah takes the expression: “Forever he gives,” as meaning that he can give under the rules of <i>peah</i> until he has smoothed the heap, even if he gave <i>peah</i> from grain standing on the field, and avoid the obligation of <i>terumah</i> and tithes for that amount. That seems to contradict our understanding of Mishnah 3.</i> he gives as <i>peah</i> and it is free from tithes until he smoothes.

If a Cohen or a Levite bought all the grain of a threshing floor, the tithes belong to them until it was smoothed<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">There is nothing in the Torah which states that a Cohen could not give his own <i>terumah</i> and tithes to himself. But the rabbis ordained that Cohen and Levite have to give their tithes away in order to create a level playing field, lest Cohen and Levite farmers could drive the others out of business since they have a built-in 10% advantage in costs over the non-Levitic farmer. In the opinion of Maimonides, the rule was established in order to prevent the monopolizing of tithes by a few wealthy priests. However, if a priest bought produce before it was obligated for tithes, he may keep the tithe but not <i>terumah</i>.</i>. He who dedicates<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">His crop or his field.</i> to the Temple and then redeems is obligated for tithes unless it was smoothed by the Temple administrator<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">Temple property is not subject to the laws of tithes.

The first <i>terumah</i> is called the <i>great terumah</i>.) It is now asserted that First Fruits, which are brought to the Temple and will be eaten there by the priests, are not subject to <i>terumah</i> even though <i>peah</i>, which is eaten by the poor, can no longer be separated from the heap before the farmer separates the two <i>terumot</i> from his grain.</i>, it is free from the great <i>terumah</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai said before Rebbi Yose: Does not the Mishnah say so: “Forever he gives <i>peah</i> and it is free from tithes until he smoothes.” Hence, if he smoothed he is obligated, but this does not apply to <i>terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah speaks only of the obligation of tithes, not <i>terumah</i>.</i>? It should say that he also is obligated for first fruits even though he did not smooth yet<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">This is the answer of R. Yose to R. Haggai, refuting his argument: If the Mishnah is supposed to mention every detail, it certainly should have mentioned First Fruits since they are really supposed to be designated when grain or fruits are still on field or tree. Hence, “tithes” is a catchword for all obligations and the Mishnah does not prove anything for the rule under discussion.</i>! But he<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Abbahu or Rebbi Joḥanan, whoever is the author of the statement about First Fruits, referred to the Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 3:7: “From where do we know that First Fruits precede <i>terumah</i>? Each of them is called (in the Torah) <i>terumah</i> and <i>beginning</i>’, but First Fruits should precede everything because they are first before everything.”</i> is the one who said this: “Why are they called firstlings? Because they are first before everything else.” And anything which precedes something else, the latter is obligated for it<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general principle which will be discussed at length in <i>Demai</i> 5:1. The fixed order of Biblical obligations is First Fruits (where applicable), <i>terumah</i>, First Tithe, Second Tithe. Hence, if somebody gave First Tithe before he gave <i>terumah</i>, he has to separate <i>terumah</i> from this First Tithe and he may not include <i>terumah</i> for the First Tithe in the <i>terumah</i> that he will give from the remaining grain, but <i>terumah</i> carries no obligation of tithe. As a consequence, First Fruits carry no obligation of <i>terumah</i> and even the fact that the heap now is under the obligation of <i>terumah</i> and tithes has no influence. This is the justification of R. Joḥanan/Abbahu.</i>.
Our Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah declares that “forever one may give as <i>peah</i>,” meaning even after the prescribed 1 2/3% have been given. But earlier, it was agreed that once this amount is given, there is no more <i>peah</i> to be given separately. Hence, one must consider that the amount given before the heap was smoothed was given as property abandoned to the poor. Even for the House of Shammai, calling this <i>peah</i> strictly speaking would be a misnomer but, since for the House of Shammai property abandoned to the poor follows exactly all the rules of <i>peah</i>, it is free from all obligation of <i>terumah</i> and tithes; this is an admissible freedom in the use of language.</i> is from the House of Shammai, since the House of Shammai say (Mishnah 6:1): “Property abandoned to the poor is ownerless property.”
It turns out that Rebbi Aqiba<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the part of the Mishnah in which R.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, they fined them so that they should not run after wine presses and threshing floors<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence refers to the statement of the Mishnah that a Cohen or a Levite, who had received or bought grain before it was made a staple in a smooth heap, has to give <i>terumah</i> to another Levite or Cohen, even though from the Torah there seems to be no reason to assume that the Cohen cannot eat his own <i>terumah</i>. The reason given is that we do not want Cohen or Levi to go and help with the harvest in order to exert moral pressure on the farmer to give <i>terumah</i> and tithes to him personally, since the Torah declares (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:10" href="/Numbers.5.10"><i>Num.</i> 5:10</a>): “Everybody shall have control over his own Holy Things.” The prohibition for a Cohen to exert pressure to force a non-Cohen to give him the required gifts is emphasized in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 5:20" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).5.20">Tosephta (<i>Demai</i>5:20</a>) and in both Talmudim stating that <i>terumah</i> and tithes may not be given to the Cohen or Levi as payment for helping in the harvest.<br>One does not really talk about fines here but about preemptive rules to avoid monopolization of priestly emoluments in the hands of a few individuals.

Paths in use only as shortcuts on fields that have been harvested do not count. The Halakhah will discuss why public roads and paths have to be mentioned when private paths and roads already make an interruption. (In most Mishnah manuscripts, private paths are mentioned after public ones, so that the singular הקבוע applies only to private paths. The discussion will show that this is not the Yerushalmi tradition.) In the opinion of Maimonides, private roads are at least 4 cubits wide, public roads at least 16 cubits, while paths are narrower. In this he adopts the definitions of the Babli. In the opinion of R. Abraham ben David, roads are used for travelling, paths for local agricultural use, independent of their width. This latter opinion agrees better with the discussions in the Yerushalmi.</i> or a public path open both summer and winter, a fallow field, a ploughed field<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A field that has been harvested and the stubbles ploughed under while on both sides of it grain is still standing.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The following separate regarding <i>peah</i>.” Because it has been said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:9" href="/Leviticus.19.9"><i>Lev</i>. 19:9</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:22" href="/Leviticus.23.22">23:22</a>): “Your field<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the singular, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Kedoshim" href="/Sifra,_Kedoshim"><i>Sifra</i> Qedošim 1:22</a>.</i>,” that he should not give from one field for another.
It cannot be connected<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">One now deals with the features that separate a field from its neighbor, such as a water canal.

If you would say that it is connected, it should separate even a field of trees<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">An orchard where trees are planted far enough apart that a plough drawn by a pair of oxen may pass between them.</i>, but we have stated there (Mishnah 3): “Everything separates for seeds but only a fence separates for trees.” Hence, by a fence it is connected and not connected!

If you say it is connected then it should separate if it is one-sided, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In a <i>baraita</i>.</i>: “If the hair was pressing down from both sides it does not separate.” Hence, from one side only it separates<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, it is undecided whether the role of the fence as divider is undisputed (unless there are “hairs” from both sides, last argument) or whether it is not better than those of the Mishnah (first argument).

Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina: If someone gave <i>peah</i> from one field for another one<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The other field being separated from the first by one of the obstacles enumerated in the Mishnah.</i>, it does not acquire holiness<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is not <i>peah</i> and, hence, subject to the laws of <i>terumah</i> and tithes.</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yasa: If he intended to let them acquire from the boundary strip<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Every field is surrounded by a strip, mostly of grass, usually slightly elevated over the cultivated area. On this strip one may walk between fields and also deposit agricultural implements. Rebbi Zeïra asks what is the rule if some grain grew on the boundary strip and the owner of the field wants to fulfill his duty by abandoning this grain which cannot usually be harvested. Rebbi Yasa (Rebbi Assi in the Babli) avoided answering, perhaps because he did not know the answer.<br>There is a similar problem in <i>Baba Batra</i>, dealing with real estate left by a convert to Judaism who failed to start a Jewish family. Since by conversion the convert severed his ties to his former family, in the absence of a will his property becomes ownerless at his death and can be acquired by actual possession. Then the question is whether two adjacent fields can be acquired if one performs an act of possession (such as weeding) on one of them. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 3:1:2-7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.3.1.2-7">Yerushalmi (<i>Baba Batra</i> 3:1,</a> fol. 13d), R. Yasa states in the name of R. Joḥanan that if one weeded on one of two adjacent fields with the intention of thereby acquiring both fields but did not have the explicit intent to acquire the boundary strip also, he acquired only the field he weeded but no more. Then it is reported that R. Zeïra asked R. Yasa about somebody working on the boundary strip only (whether he would acquire both fields), and R. Yasa avoided answering. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 55a" href="/Bava_Batra.55a">Babli (<i>Baba Batra</i> 55a</a>), R. Assi states in the name of R.

Joḥanan that it is not a divider for <i>peah</i>. For the Yerushalmi, R. Assi himself was not sure whether R. Joḥanan followed the opinion ascribed to himself in the Babli, or that ascribed to R. Abun.</i>? He avoided answering him. The opinions of Rebbi Yasa are contradictory since we have stated there (Mishnah 3:2): “The sages agree with Rebbi Aqiba about someone who sowed dill or mustard in three places<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah deals with someone who spot-harvests his field, cutting at separate places and letting the rest grow for an extended period of time.

Samuel said, because the first of them does not wait for the last<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, one plot is harvested at one time; otherwise, there would be no obligation for <i>peah</i>.

And here he says so<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, he refuses to say what he should say, viz., that the boundary strip is never sown intentionally and therefore cannot be counted as <i>peah</i>.</i>?

But did we not state (<i>Mishnah</i> 3:3): “He who strips moist onions for the market and stores dry ones<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">He has to give <i>peah</i> two times; this rule cannot be deduced from the stated practice regarding two kinds of wheat since one deals here with only one kind of onion.

Hence, neither the statement of R.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> The Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Dealing with the first case, if the field was harvested by Gentiles.</i>, if they cut for themselves, but if they cut for a Jew it is obligated. And we have formulated regarding this<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 3:1" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).3.1">Tosephta <i>Peah</i> 3:1</a>).

The Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Dealing with the second case, if the field was harvested by Jewish robbers.</i>, if they cut to destroy it. But if they do not cut to destroy it, it is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Since the robbers, while they are Jewish, are not expected to follow Jewish law and give <i>peah</i> from what they are cutting, the farmer has to give <i>peah</i> from any grain that he manages to obtain from the field. This might apply in particular to the next case, discussed in the next paragraph, when he harvested the first half of the field, in which case the language of the Mishnah may be read to mean that the farmer is totally freed from his obligation.</i>. Rebbi Hoshaia ben Shammai<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">A fifth generation Galilean Amora from Caesarea Philippi (קצרין), a colleague of R. Mana II.</i> said, even if you say that they do not cut to destroy it, it is free since <i>peah</i> is given from standing produce and real estate cannot be robbed<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">This is a principle repeated many times in both Talmudim, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 7:4:2-5:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.7.4.2-5.4"><i>Kilaim</i> 7:5</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sukkah 30b" href="/Sukkah.30b">Babli <i>Sukkah</i> 30b</a>. The reason is that ownership of real estate is always documented; hence, real estate taken by force in a time of anarchy can always be recovered in court when the rule of law is reestablished.<br>According to R. S. Cirillo, since the robbers are not owners of the field, they are not owners of the grain as long as it stands. It is true that they become owners of the grain as soon as they cut it; the legal owner then has a claim for damages against them but not a claim to the actual grain. Hence, when the robbers cut the grain, there is no obligation of <i>peah</i> incurred by the farmer since neither he nor his employees are doing the harvesting. There also is no obligation on the robbers since the grain comes into their possession only after it is cut and the obligation of <i>peah</i> is already a past event. As a consequence, the field is cut without anybody incurring the obligation of <i>peah</i>.</i>.
Because<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah must deal separately with the cases of robbers cutting the entire field or only part of the field because the obligation of <i>peah</i>, once incurred, may be discharged also from cut grain as explained in Mishnah and Halakhah 1:6.</i> he separates<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning that he sets aside as <i>peah</i> for the poor.</i> from cut grain for standing grain and from standing grain for cut grain but he does not<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">If everything is done correctly.</i> separate from cut grain for either cut or standing grain. Sometimes he has to separate from cut grain for standing grain. How can this be? If he finished his field and left something standing on it for <i>peah</i>, at the moment he cuts the first stalk from this, <i>peah</i> returns to the sheaves; he has to give from cut grain<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Since he stole from the poor by his action, some obligation is transferred to the grain already harvested as explained in Mishnah 1:6.</i>. Not only if he finished his field but even if he cut some and said: “From here and further on I give for <i>peah</i>,” at the moment he cuts the first stalk from this, <i>peah</i> returns to the sheaves and he separates from cut grain for standing grain.
May the seller get the <i>peah</i> which permits the sheaves<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the case when the farmer cuts half the harvest and then sells the field with the remaining crop. If the seller is legally below the poverty line, may he take from the <i>peah</i> the buyer is obligated to give also for the grain he himself cut? The problem is that nobody is permitted to take his own <i>peah</i>.</i>? Let us hear it from the following (Mishnah 5:4): “<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah deals with the case of the sharecropper who is not permitted to take from the <i>peah</i> of the field he is working on. Then Rebbi Jehudah explains (nobody dissenting) that this is only true for the sharecropper who has leased the field and has property rights to 50%, 33%, or 25% of the crop. But if the landlord acts as the owner of the field at all times and the sharecropper has no property rights to the crop except that he will receive 50%, 33%, or 25% of the harvest after it is harvested, then the <i>peah</i> was never his and, being poor, he may go and collect from the <i>peah</i> with the rest of the poor.</i> Rebbi Jehudah said: When is this, if he received it for a half, a third, or a quarter.” What is the difference between this and the first case<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Of the usual sharecropper.</i>? It must be, “if you cut it, a third will be yours<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Only after the harvest is completed does the sharecropper have a claim.</i>.” Rebbi Abin bar Ḥiyya said, this implies that the seller may get the <i>peah</i> which permits the sheaves<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Since at the moment of the actual obligation of <i>peah</i> the field is already sold, the <i>peah</i> was never the seller’s and he may take his part among the other poor who come to collect.</i>. Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">He shows that the argument of R. Abin bar Ḥiyya is faulty. While the actual obligation of <i>peah</i> arises during the buyer’s harvest, the potential obligation started with the seller’s harvest. Hence, the seller should be barred from taking his part of the <i>peah</i>. In contrast, the sharecropper who is given ownership only of a part of the harvest, not of the standing grain, has nothing at all to do with the obligation of <i>peah</i>.</i> said, there the obligation of the field did not come during his ownership, but here the obligation of the field started during his ownership. It is correct that if he cut half of the field and sold what he cut, the buyer<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is poor and never acquired any ownership of the real estate, he may take everything a poor person is entitled to. This sentence is R. Yose’s analysis of the correct parallel to the Mishnah of the sharecropper.</i> is allowed gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>peah</i>. May the buyer get the <i>peah</i> which permits the sheaves of the seller<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">If the buyer is legally poor, may he take for himself the <i>peah</i> that he will give for the seller’s harvest? The answer might be yes, unless we are afraid of unfair competition. This is the essence of the last argument in the quarrel between Rebbi and Rebbi Jehudah II the Prince as explained at the end of Halakhah 1:6.</i>? That is the disagreement of Rebbi and Rebbi Jehudah the Prince.
Rebbi Phineas asked<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the discussion of the last case of the Mishnah, if part of the field was dedicated to the upkeep of the Temple.</i>: Can a harvest outside of the Land become subject to <i>peah</i>? Could you not say that a dedicated crop is exempt and (a crop) outside the Land is exempt; just as a dedicated crop may become obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the Mishnah, if the field is sold by the Temple officials with the crop still standing.</i>, so from outside the Land it may become obligated? He found it stated: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:9" href="/Leviticus.19.9"><i>Lev</i>. 19:9</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:22" href="/Leviticus.23.22">23:22</a>) “When you harvest the harvest of your Land,” and not the harvest outside of the Land<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Under any circumstance.</i>.
If the treasurer cut half of the half but did not finish to harvest the rest before somebody redeemed everything, he gives from the harvest for what was harvested<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the Mishnah, the buyer has to give <i>peah</i> also for the harvest of the original owner. However, since the verse speaks to individuals, “when you cut the harvest of <i>your</i> land”, the obligation is only on private individuals. It does not apply to the Temple which is the collective property of all of Israel.</i> but all that was harvested in the possession of the Temple is already exempted.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rectangles<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the interpretation of Maimonides. R.

They agree<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The House of Shammai accept the position of the House of Hillel.</i> that one gives one <i>peah</i> for all of them if the edges of the rows are touching.<br>If someone harvests his field in spots and leaves moist stalks, Rebbi Aqiba says, <i>peah</i> from each spot, but the Sages say, from one for all of them. The Sages agree with Rebbi Aqiba that he who sows dill or mustard at three different places gives <i>peah</i> from each spot<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 2:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.2.1.5">Chapter 2, Notes 17–19</a>.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> We have stated: “between olive trees.” In the House of Rebbi they stated “between fruit trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Rebbi edited the generally accepted Mishnah, either later generations changed the wording or, more likely, Rebbi insisted in his Yeshivah that in addition to the official Mishnah one would retain a more general version.</i>” Our Mishnah needs the one of the House of Rebbi and that of the House of Rebbi needs our Mishnah. If we had stated, but not the House of Rebbi, we would say that it said only “between olive trees”, which in themselves are subject to <i>peah</i>, but for those which are free from the obligation of <i>peah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since only the trees enumerated in Mishnah 1:5 are subject to <i>peah</i>, a general statement “fruit trees” includes (as a majority) those that are not subject to <i>peah</i>.</i> even the House of Shammai will agree that he gives one <i>peah</i> for all of them. Hence, our Mishnah needs that of Rebbi. Or if there were the declaration of the House of Rebbi but we had not stated ours, we would say that it refers only to those which are between trees free from the obligation of <i>peah</i>, but for trees which in themselves are subject to <i>peah</i> even the House of Hillel will agree that he gives <i>peah</i> from each single one. Hence, both our Mishnah and the <i>baraita</i> of the House of Rebbi are needed.
What are we dealing with? <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This text is self-contradictory; it is the confluence of two contradictory texts. The text of Maimonides (<i>Hilkhot Mattenot Aniïm</i> 3:9) seems to have been: “If they are widely spaced, also the House of Hillel will agree that he gives one <i>peah</i> for all of them. If they are densely planted, the House of Shammai will agree that he gives <i>peah</i> from each single one. But we deal with the case of 10 plants on a <i>bet se’ah</i>. The House of Shammai compare it to widely spaced, the House of Hillel compare it to densely planted,” inverting the roles of Shammai and Hillel in the first clause. But the version of R. Abraham ben David (<i>loc. cit</i>.) is: “If they are widely spaced, also the House of Shammai will agree that he gives one <i>peah</i> for all of them. If they are densely planted, the House of Hillel will agree that he gives <i>peah</i> from each single one. But we deal with the case of 10 plants on a <i>bet se’ah</i>. The House of Shammai compare it to densely planted ones, the House of Hillel compare it to widely spaced,” inverting the statements in the second clause. There is no direct manuscript evidence of any Yerushalmi manuscript for one reading over the other.</i> If they are widely spaced, even the House of Shammai will agree that he gives one <i>peah</i> for all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Following R. Abraham ben David, the House of Shammai will agree that there are too few trees to make a difference; it is one field with some holes.</i>. If they are densely planted, the House of Hillel will agree that he gives <i>peah</i> from each single one<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since there are few open places large enough to allow wheat to be sown (which by the laws of <i>kilaim</i> must be well separated from the trees); hence, each patch is a separate field.</i>.

The House of Shammai compare it to widely spaced<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the text of Maimonides who argues that with widely spaced trees the owner could have sown one field.

R. David ben Zimra, in his commentary to Maimonides, points out that this argument supports Maimonides’s reading in the preceding paragraph. “Seeds” usually refers to grain.</i>.
What is the reason of the House of Shammai? People do not usually introduce seeds between trees<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, each spot sown is a separate field. R. David ben Zimra, in his commentary to Maimonides, points out that this argument supports Maimonides’s reading in the preceding paragraph. “Seeds” usually refers to grain.</i>. Does it turn out that the House of Shammai are like Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since Rebbi Yose (ben Ḥalaphta) was the leading authority of his generation in the tradition of the House of Hillel, this would be remarkable indeed.</i>? Just as Rebbi Yose said that people do not usually introduce onions between vegetables<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the second part of Mishnah 4 in this chapter: “Rectangular beds of onions planted among other vegetables, R. Yose says: <i>Peah</i> from each bed, but the Sages say: From one bed for all of them.” According to R. Yose, onions are detrimental to other vegetables growing near them.</i>, so the House of Shammai say that people do not usually introduce seeds between trees! It is reasonable to say that the House of Shammai will agree with Rebbi Yose but Rebbi Yose will not agree with the House of Shammai<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In a poor country, the land between trees is much too valuable to be left lying fallow. Hence, everybody will sow between the trees if at all possible.</i>. The House of Shammai will agree with Rebbi Yose that people do not usually introduce onions between vegetables. Rebbi Yose will not agree with the House of Shammai because people usually introduce seeds between trees.
If there was a fence there, it is like a tree<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If each tree has 250 square cubits around it, one follows the House of Hillel’s opinion in the Mishnah.</i>. How about two<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If there are two fences, do the House of Hillel still allow one <i>peah</i> for all?

“He who harvests his field in spots,” etc. Like a spotted field<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The leopard is נמר in Hebrew; the Mishnah means: He who makes his field look like a leopard. The Talmud notes that a field which is fertilized unevenly and, hence, whose growth is spotty, is called in agricultural terminology נימרה "leopard-like." It is not clear whether we talk only of a field that is growing at different rates at different points (and, therefore, cannot be harvested at one time) or also of a field that looks normal but whose owner harvests in spots so that it looks "leopard like" at harvest time.</i>; the place where fertilizer makes plants grow early is called “spotted.”
So far if it was dry on both sides and moist in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since grain usually is harvested when dry, in the case contemplated the farmer will legitimately harvest the dry sides and leave the green patch in the middle for a later harvest.

How about being moist on both sides and dry in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, access to the ripe grain is difficult and one may wonder whether R.

Rebbi Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The tradents are R. Abba bar R.

He could argue even like the Rabbis since we have stated there (<i>Mishnah</i> 3:3): “He who rips out<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See the lexical explanation in the next Mishnah.</i> moist onions for the market and keeps dry ones for storage<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">He has to give <i>peah</i> twice.</i>!” Rebbi Yose answered: We understand that market and storage make two kinds, are moist and dry two kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who rips out<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is tentative; according to Maimonides it simply means “cuts”, based on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 41:7" href="/Isaiah.41.7"><i>Is</i>. 41:7</a>.

Simson of Sens, it means either “leaves a bald spot” where the onions have been taken out or it means “splits” his field into two parts; it is possible that the expression is intentionally ambiguous. [In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Arakhin 1:3" href="/Mishnah_Arakhin.1.3">Mishnah <i>Arakhin</i> 1:3</a>, the word means “to finish, to play the final coda.”] In Arabic, חלק means “to shave”; this supports the first interpretation of R.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> So far when he started harvesting beforehand<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">If the seller started harvesting, the first cut establishes the obligation of <i>peah</i> (see Halakhah 1:1).

Or because he sold to him, excluding his obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Unless explicitly stated, the buyer does not acquire the obligations attached to the property bought.

What is the reason of Rebbi Joshua? It says here “your field” and it says further on (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:19" href="/Deuteronomy.24.19"><i>Deut</i>. 24:19</a>): “You might forget a sheaf on the field.” Just as the field mentioned there means two<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 6:5 states that a forgotten sheaf is for the poor only if it is less in volume than two <i>seah</i>.

Rebbi Joshua seems to argue that anything that is not a field for the definition of <i>leqeṭ</i> (collecting grain forgotten be the farmer) and <i>šiḵḥah</i>(collecting forgotten sheaves) cannot be a field for the definition of <i>peah</i> since all three obligations always go together.</i>, so here also two.

R. Eliezer either is of the opinion that no vegetables are grown for storage or that onions grown for storage are such a rare case that one may take grain fields as the standard for everything. R. Ṭarphon seems to think that the smallest plot used to grow any plant for storage is the standard for all crops.</i>. “Rebbi Joshua ben Bathyra says, if it is enough to cut and cut a second time, and practice follows his words.” Does “harvesting” mean following the technique of harvesters, or is it any amount<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joshua ben Bathyra argues that the verse: “When you harvest the harvest of your land,” means all kinds of harvest and that therefore any plot which can be harvested is subject to <i>peah</i>. The question is only whether the harvest has to be professional or whether simple plucking is enough. The verse from Psalms is taken to mean that only a cut that will fill at least the hollow of one’s hand qualifies for “harvesting.” This argument is the base of the first discussion in Halakhah 1:1.</i>? Since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 129:7" href="/Psalms.129.7"><i>Ps</i>. 129:7</a>): “The harvester did not fill his palm with it, nor the binder of sheaves his bosom,” that means that one follows the technique of harvesters.

Prozbol was instituted by Hillel as a way to circumvent the annulment of debts in the Seventh Year in cases when that annulment would only be a rabbinic ordinance. Since only debts due to real persons are annulled by the Seventh Year, the creditor may deliver the debt to the court to be collected.

However, since buying real estate is a stronger form of contract, a contract or understanding to buy real estate can be extended to include movables. In that case, the moment of transfer of property rights to the real estate is determining also for the movables. The ways of acquiring real estate are either a contract witnessed by two witnesses, or payment of cash in front of witnesses, or a court ruling confirming squatters’ rights. The general theory of these matters is discussed in tractate <i>Qiddušin</i>; the exact and restrictive definition of enforceable squatters’ rights is one of the topics of tractate <i>Baba Batra</i>.</i>.<br>If someone signs over his properties<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">In a gift document.</i> when bedridden and reserved for himself any real estate, his gift is permanent<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Since he reserved property, the document is a gift and not a will, on condition that it was executed under all conditions of a valid gift.</i>; if he did not reserve any real estate for himself, his gift is not permanent<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">If he did not reserve anything for himself, it is clear that he did not expect to survive.

If he signs over his properties to his sons and signs over some real estate for his wife, she lost her <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>ketubah</i> is a mortgage on the husband’s entire property, to be paid to the wife at the termination of the marriage, after divorce or after the husband’s death. It represents the financial obligation of the husband to his wife; without such an obligation, any sexual relations between man and wife are considered illicit. The value of the obligation was fixed at 200 <i>zuz</i>(800 silver denars) for a virgin and 100 <i>zuz</i> (400 silver denars) for a previously married woman. A measure of the intended value of these sums is found in Mishnah 8:8,9, viz., that anyone with 200 <i>zuz</i> investment capital or 50 <i>zuz</i> business capital is living above the poverty line and barred from receiving charity.<br>The Halakhah explains the circumstances under which the wife may agree to be co-heir to the sons. The Mishnah appears in the context of the power of contracts involving real estate; the first part belongs to the matters treated in <i>Baba Batra</i> and <i>Giṭṭin</i>, the second part to <i>Ketubot</i>.</i>. Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The Tanna, ben Ḥalaphta.</i> says, if she accepted it, even if it was not in a written document, she lost her <i>ketubah</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Immi<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">He is Rebbi Ammi, cf. <i>Berakhot</i>, pp. 76,85.</i> asked in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Think of it, if there were only one ear!

If the plot is only big enough for one plant, there can never be an obligation since this would fall on the harvest, not on the bare earth. Hence, R. Aqiba also should be giving a minimal size of the plot which might carry an obligation of <i>peah</i>. The answer is that there might be a plant with multiple ears which is not cut but an ear of which is plucked. Then something is left on which the obligation might fall and R. Aqiba is justified. (Cf. the second paragraph in Halakhah 1:1.)</i> Rebbi Ḥananiah in the name of Rebbi Phineas: Explain it if there was one stalk with five ears!
Rebbi Mana asked: Why does he not say: “Any crop is subject to <i>peah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">This is a continuation of the previous question. If <i>peah</i> is not a tax on the soil but on plants which grow on it, should not the principle be formulated in terms of the crop? The answer is that then one would need two separate sentences, one for <i>peah</i> and one for first fruits since only fruits of “your land” may be brought (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 1:2:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.1.2.2-3"><i>Bikkurim</i>1:2</a>). Since the Mishnah was transmitted orally, that would make memorization much more difficult; a slight deviation from purely logical organization is therefore justified.

It was stated: “And the appearance<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">In the Temple, see Mishnah 1:1, note 4.</i>.” Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: He who owns no real estate is freed from the appearance.

Since tithes are due also from a tenant farmer or a sharecropper and, in case the farmer did not give tithes, even from the buyer of grain, and, in addition, the text does not require “tithes from your land,” there is no place for this clause in the Mishnah.

For in general a person might give property rights only in writing, and here even orally. In general, a person might give only if real estate and movables are at the same place, but here the real estate even was at one place and the movables elsewhere.

Since the master is now dead, nobody else can be forced to write a document of manumission for the slave. R.

When these words were said before Rebbi Yose, he said: : “He who answers correctly should be kissed on his lips.” R. Simson has in addition: “Even if the estate contains only this hamlet or that field,” meaning that the slave acquires himself (his freedom) even if he acquires no other property from the estate of his dead master.

The answer is that there is no exception; it may well be that the name <i>peah</i> has to be given when the fruits are still hanging on the tree, but this does not change the fact that the owner must pay for taking them down.</i>? He calls it by the name <i>peah</i> when it is on the tree<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since produce is not exempt from tithes and may not be taken by the poor until the farmer has designated it as such, giving it the name “<i>peah</i>”.</i>.

The Halakha notes that one does not listen to <i>him</i>, i. e., if the farmer is part of the agreement (and presumably its originator, but in any case a person of overriding influence over the poor) then the agreement is void.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If he<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A poor man entitled to collect <i>peah</i>.</i> took some of the <i>peah</i> and threw it on the rest<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In order to claim possession.

If he fell on it or spread his talith on it, one removes him from it<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For the reasons given above.</i>. The same is valid for gleanings and the forgotten sheaf.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated in the name of Rebbi Meïr: “One punishes him and takes away from him both the cut and the standing produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 2:1" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).2.1">Tosephta <i>Peah</i> 2:1</a> reads: “If he took some of the <i>peah</i> and threw it on the rest, he has no claim to it. Rebbi Meïr says, one punishes him and takes away from him both the cut and the standing produce.” This proves that the language of the Mishnah, the first sentence of the Tosephta, implies that he does not lose the <i>peah</i> he previously collected. Maimonides, who in his commentary to the Mishnah writes that he loses that <i>peah</i> also, explains the Halakhah, not the Mishnah.</i>” That refers to intentional misconduct; does it apply even to action in error or even to small sheaves<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">If the poor collector already had made a small sheaf of his <i>peah</i>.

Since the Mishnah obviously declares that principle inoperative with regard to <i>peah</i>, there seems to be a contradiction between two rabbinic principles. The Babli (<i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 10a/b) resolves the problem by restricting the principle of Abba Cohen to the public domain; it does not apply to private property such as a field. The Yerushalmi disagrees; since <i>peah</i> is abandoned property, as proved in the preceding Halakhah, it must be assumed that the ground on which <i>peah</i> grows is temporarily also abandoned to the poor.<br>The expression “himself” will be given special importance in the following discussion.</i>.

The 14 g silver <i>sheqalim</i> from the Jewish revolt were “sacred <i>sheqalim</i>” of double weight, or four civil denars. Honest silver denars or drachmae from the early principate weigh about 3.5 g.

Rebbi Jacob bar Idi objected before Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. Did we not state: (Mishnah <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 1:4) “If somebody saw a find and fell on it, when another person came and grabbed it, he who grabbed it had the rights to it?” He answered him: Explain it if the first one did not say that his four cubits should acquire it for him<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Babli (<i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 10b) explains that deeds speak louder than words and that by falling on the object the finder showed that he did not wish to acquire it by simple speech.

The Yerushalmi does not go so far; it only requires that an object should be within four cubits of the finder and that the latter should clearly express his intention of acquiring the object.

Similarly, if the creditor asks the debtor to throw to him the amount owed, if the debtor did that and it landed within the creditor’s four cubits in the public domain, the debtor has discharged all his obligations.

And one mentions them approvingly because they insisted on collecting along a rope and were giving <i>peah</i> from every strip.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">There are parallels in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 1:6" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).1.6">Tosephta <i>Peah</i> 1:6</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Kedoshim" href="/Sifra,_Kedoshim"><i>Sifra Qedošim</i> 1:10</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 23a" href="/Shabbat.23a">Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 23a</a>. In all these parallels, there are four reasons given, meaning that R. Simeon explains the reason of the Biblical law. In the Babli, R. Simeon is reputed to deduce laws from the reasoning behind Biblical precepts; the Yerushalmi does not seem to accept this but gives reasons separate from the verse. (The Tosephta in our hands is essentially a Babylonian compilation; <i>Sifra</i> is Palestinian material edited in Babylonia.) It is clear that R. Simeon supports here his argument in Mishnah 1:3 that <i>peah must</i> be given at the end, because of Biblical precept and rabbinical ordinance.</i> in the name of Rebbi Simeon: For five reasons one should give <i>peah</i> only at the end of one’s field, because of robbing the poor, because of idling the poor, because of cheats, because of bad impression, and because the Torah said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:9" href="/Leviticus.19.9"><i>Lev</i>. 19:9</a>): “Do not finish off the corner of your field.” Because of robbing the poor, that no man should see a free hour and say to his poor relative: Come, and take this <i>peah</i> for yourself. Because of idling the poor, that the poor should not sit around, watch the entire day, and say: Now he is giving <i>peah</i>, now he is giving <i>peah</i>, but rather they should go, collect on another field, and come at the moment of finishing. Because of the cheats, that one should not say: I already gave, and then he chooses the good and brings out the bad<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">We are not concerned here with people who willingly transgress the ordinances of the Torah. Rather, we speak about so-called pious people who find ways to minimize their obligations. In this case, the farmer harvests the entire field without giving <i>peah</i>. Then he is obligated to give <i>peah</i> from the cut grain but here he has the possibility to select stalks with small kernels for the poor, whereas he has no such control if he refrains from cutting the last corner.</i>. Because of bad impression, that the passers-by should not say: Look, this man harvested his field and did not leave <i>peah</i> for the poor. And because the Torah said: “Do not finish off the corner of your field.”

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A Non-Jew who harvested his field and later converted is free from gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>peah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>peak</i> and gleanings it is written: “At <i>your</i> harvesting,” and for the forgotten sheaf it says: “If <i>you</i> harvest <i>your</i> harvest,” and at the time of the harvest he still was an outsider.</i>. Rebbi Jehudah obligates him for forgotten sheaves because that applies only at the time of binding the sheaves<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">To refrain from going back to collect a forgotten sheaf cannot apply as long as there are no sheaves. Hence, if the man converts between cutting the grain and binding the sheaves, the obligation comes to him as a Jew and he is bound by it.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Jehudah said it well, what is the reason of the Rabbis? Rebbi Yose in the name of Rav, Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rav Jehudah in the name of Samuel: It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:19" href="/Deuteronomy.24.19"><i>Deut</i>. 24:19</a>): “If you forget a sheaf on the field.” If you forget the standing grain<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads: “If <i>you</i> cut <i>your</i> harvest on <i>your</i> field and then you forget a sheaf on the field, do not return to collect it.” The obligation attaches not to sheafmaking but to harvesting. The <i>Sifri Debarim</i> 282 reads: “‘Your harvest,’ except if it was cut by Gentiles. From that they said: A Non-Jew who harvested his field and later converted is free from gleanings, forgotten sheaves and <i>peah</i>. Rebbi Jehudah obliges him for forgotten sheaves because that applies only at the time of binding the sheaves.”</i>. What applies to forgetting while it is standing also applies to forgetting sheaves, but what does not apply to forgetting while it is standing, does not apply to forgetting sheaves.
If a Jew and a Gentile were partners in the standing grain, the part of the Jew is obligated but the part of the Gentile is free. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rav Jeremiah: If it was divided up<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 2:9" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).2.9">Tosephta <i>Peah</i>2:9</a> reads: “If a Jew and a Gentile were partners in the standing grain, the part of the Jew is obligated but the part of the Gentile is free. Rebbi Ismael said: If a Jew and a Gentile were partners in standing grain, it is free from <i>peah</i>. When is that? Only if the Gentile has veto power; if the Gentile has no veto power then it is obligated for <i>peah</i>.” This means that if the Jew may harvest his part without getting the Gentile’s permission, it is not a partnership as far as harvest is concerned but only a partnership for the growing period; accordingly, it is totally the Jew’s harvest and is obligated. The Yerushalmi seems to apply the expression “when is that?” and the following to the beginning statement, not to the opinion of Rebbi Ismael.</i>.

Regularly collected <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves are exempt from heave and tithes.</i> are obligated for tithes, except if the Non-Jew declared it to be abandoned property.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Joshua ben Levi says: They disagree about a rich owner<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Since he may not take <i>peah</i> for himself, he may not take it for others. The Babli (<i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 9b) explains that R.

But a poor owner, since he has the right to take it<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">For himself; he may acquire it legally even according to the Sages. That the poor farmer may not keep his own <i>peah</i> is a rabbinic institution that does not influence the status of the <i>peah</i> taken by any poor person.</i>, the other person acquired it.
Rebbi Zeïra said: Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The Amora.</i> (about one’s friend), Rebbi Joḥanan, and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said the same thing. Rebbi Eleazar, as Rebbi Zeïra said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: A man may acquire a find for his friend<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">If a man finds abandoned or lost property, he may pick it up to acquire it for another person. This essentially is giving a gift of something that is not his property while it was lying in the street, and he picked it up with the intention of not acquiring it himself. It is enough that he could have picked it up for himself to empower him to give it directly to the beneficiary. This is the exact parallel to the poor farmer collecting <i>peah</i>, not to give later to somebody else, but so that the other should be the immediate owner of every collected stalk. [Later in this Halakhah and in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 10a" href="/Bava_Metzia.10a">Babli (<i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 10a</a>), this appears as a statement of R. Joḥanan.

Rebbi Redifa<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">An Amora of the last generation of Galilean Amoraïm who collected sayings of the Sages of the preceding generation.</i>: Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose disagree.

He who says “he who may take” certainly includes him who may give. He who says “he who may give,” excludes him who may take.
A Mishnah disagrees with him who says that he who may take may acquire, since we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:5:2-9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.5.2-9"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 1:6</a>. This paragraph is elliptic and almost incomprehensible. The Mishnah reads: “If someone says, give this divorce document to my wife or this document of manumission to my slave, and then wants to change his mind in either case, he may do so in the opinion of R. Meïr. But the Sages say, in the case of a wife, but not in the manumission of slaves since one may favor a person without his knowledge.” Since the divorce is considered bad for the wife, it can become valid only with her knowledge. R. Meïr thinks that manumission also may be bad for the slave who will have to accept all duties of a free Jew; the Sages consider manumission always to be good. With the wife’s knowledge, however, the emissary, a man, can acquire the divorce document for her. But as a man, he is not in a position ever to receive a divorce document.</i>: “Give this divorce document to my wife …,” because he may receive the divorce document of his minor daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">The minor daughter who was formally betrothed (קידושין) but not yet actually married, can become free to marry another man only by divorce.

If the woman said: Receive the divorce document for me, if he {the husband} wants to change his mind {after handing over the document}, he may not do so {since the transaction was done with the wife’s knowledge.}” That is the case if the emissary of the wife is a free man; she is divorced the moment the document comes into her emissary’s hand. But since a slave has no “hand” in the legal sense, how can this Mishnah be reconciled with the one quoted first?</i>: “Receive this divorce document for my wife or bring this divorce document to my wife; if he wants to change his mind … he may not do so.” Is a slave empowered to bring a divorce document?

The following Mishnah disagrees with him who says that he who may take may acquire, since we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maäser Šeni</i> 5:9. The Mishnah discusses the case of a man who was away on a trip at the time (Passover Eve) when the tithes must be given. Rabban Gamliel, Rebbi Joshua, Rebbi Aqiba, and Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah were travelling on a ship on that day (probably to or from Rome on official business) when Rabban Gamliel designated the first tithe to Rebbi Joshua, a Levite, and the tithe of the poor to Rebbi Aqiba. In order not to transgress the Biblical command of distributing the tithes, Rebbi Aqiba must have been able to let the poor acquire their tithe while on the ship.</i>: “One tithe that I will measure in the future is given to Aqiba ben Joseph that he should let the poor acquire it, and its place is rented to him.” But is Rebbi Aqiba entitled to take? Explain it, before he got rich<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">When he was a student, his wife supported him because she wanted him to become a scholar.

The word of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi is that he who may take may acquire, since Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: They disagree about a rich owner. But in the case of a poor owner, since he has the right to take it, the other person acquired it.
Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Jeremiah, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the discussion of the last part of the Mishnah: Gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>peah</i> of a Gentile are obligated for tithes, except if the Gentile declared it to be abandoned property.</i>: <sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Add: “The Mishnah is only understandable …”</i> According to him<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">The opinions of R.

Meïr. The Yerushalmi clearly accepts the opinion of RR. Jedudah and Simeon. Cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 5:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.5.8.1"><i>Demay</i>, Chapter 5, Note 102</a>.</i> who says that a Gentile may acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">It is explained in <i>Demaï</i>(<i>loc. cit</i>.) and elsewhere that the Biblical duties of heave and tithes ceased with the Babylonian exile. The returnees from Babylonia took these duties upon themselves and future generations in a solemn covenant with God (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 10:1" href="/Nehemiah.10.1"><i>Neh</i>. 10:1</a>) in those regions (Judea, the Southern Plains, Galilee, and Golan Heights) settled by the returnees; hence the problem is not one of Biblical precepts but of the meaning of this covenant. According to the position taken here, the obligation of <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves is a later Rabbinic obligation on the land as far as Jews are concerned (<i>Demaï</i> 3:4, fol. 23d). Since the Gentile has no obligation to give to the poor, he cannot designate anything under these names. But since he is the owner, he may legally abandon the produce just as a Jew might abandon it.</i>. But according to him who says that a Gentile may not acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithes, even if he declared it abandoned property it is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Meīr, the obligation is on the Land, not on the owner. If the agricultural real estate is owned by a Gentile, the obligation obviously cannot be enforced since the Gentile has no obligation to abide by the covenant. However, if the produce is then bought by a Jew, it will be a deadly sin for him to consume anything from it before he has given the heave and, at least, the priest’s part of the tithe. The only exception is abandoned property (by Mishnah 6:1, this must be abandoned to any taker, not just the poor.) Now, <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves also are free of heave and tithes but these can be given only by persons obligated to give. Hence, <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves designated by Gentiles do not have the legal status of <i>peah</i>, gleanings, and forgotten sheaves, and are not exempt; neither does abandoning the property help since nothing the Gentile does can possibly influence the duties upon the produce.</i>. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Note that “in the name of” always implies an indirect transmission of statements; it might be that R.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Here you say that “one estimates what amount of gleanings that would have yielded, and he gives that to the poor.” But there, you say “all ears that touch the ground are for the poor.” Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: They fined him because he put the stack on the gleanings of the poor.

On the other hand, abandoned property is not “your harvest,” and as such is free from heave and tithes. In Chapter 6, the House of Shammai rule that property abandoned only to the poor, such as <i>peah</i> and gleanings and grain given in lieu of <i>peah</i> and gleanings, is considered legally abandoned. The House of Hillel disagree and restrict the notion of abandoned property to things abandoned to everybody, rich and poor alike.

Rebbi Lia said, they disagree explicitly: Rebbi Joḥanan said, this abandoning is legal abandoning. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, this abandoning is not legal abandoning.
Rebbi Abin bar Ḥiyya said, that which was said, if it was abandoned to the poor but grabbed by the rich is a difference between Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The main source is <i>Nedarim</i>, Babli 43a ff., Yerushalmi 4:10. The Mishnah speaks of a person A who made a vow not to use anything belonging to another person B. According to R. Meïr, B may abandon some property which A may take, but according to R. Yose, the abandoned property still belongs to B (who is also responsible for any damage caused by or on this property) until someone picked it up; hence, A may not take up the abandoned property.</i>. According to Rebbi Meïr, who asserts that [it is legally abandoned] as soon as a person abandons anything from his property, [in our case] it is legally abandoned<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The rich person, while acting in an improper way, nevertheless acquired the abandoned article.</i>.

So far<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">These two words belong to <i>Nedarim</i>, not here. The question is, whether a person may abandon real property on condition that it automatically revert to the previous owner unless picked up by another person in a certain interval of time.

But if he abandoned only for a short time? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The two passages in quotation marks are from a text close to Tosephta <i>Ma‘serot</i> 3:11; see also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 43b-44a" href="/Nedarim.43b-44a">Babli <i>Nedarim</i> 43b–44a</a>.</i>: “If he abandoned his field, he may cancel his action during two or three days<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">But after that, the renunciation becomes absolute.</i>.” Rebbi Simeon Dima stated before Rebbi Zeïra: Even after three he may cancel his action. He said to him, since you say after three days, is it the same after three or after many? The language of a <i>baraitha</i> supports Rebbi Zeïra: “About when is this said<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">That after two days the act becomes irrevocable.</i>? If he abandoned in an unspecified way. But if he said: My field shall be abandoned one day, one week, one month, one year, a sabbatical period, as long as nobody took it over, either he or another person, he may cancel. But after somebody acquired it, either he or somebody else, he cannot cancel.” This means that short or long periods are the same. It also means that they were not worried about dishonesty<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Since the probability that nobody else took the property is very small.</i>. That obviously answers Rebbi Zeïra’s question, since Rebbi Zeïra had said, are short and long times the same?
What are we discussing<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This deals with the last part of the Mishnah, quoted by R.

Rebbi Jonah: That goes by proportionality; “if all sheaves of a field are of one <i>qab</i> each, except one which is of four <i>qab</i> and they forgot about that one,” if all sheaves of a field are of two <i>qab</i> each, except one which is of eight <i>qab</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A sheaf that was near a closure<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Where an opening in a fence was closed with wood or other materials. This is the concurrent explanation of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rashi on Bava Metzia 25b" href="/Rashi_on_Bava_Metzia.25b">Rashi (<i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i>25b</a>), Rabbenu Ḥananel (<i>loc. cit</i>.), and Maimonides (Commentary on the Mishnah) and, therefore, Geonic tradition. Ben Jehudah derives the word from the root גוף, גפף “to close an opening.” For example, מגופה is a clay block with which the top of an amphora containing wine or olive oil is sealed. The deviating explanation of R. Simson of Sens, “a stone fence made without mortar,” is preferred by modern Talmudic dictionaries. Schwab translates: “fence of pales,” close to the Modern Hebrew acception: “fence made of a weave of reeds or rods.”</i>, a stack, cattle<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Cattle rather than horses were used to draw agricultural implements.</i>, or vessels, if it was forgotten, the House of Shammai say, it is not a forgotten sheaf, but the House of Hillel say, it is a forgotten sheaf.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It is difficult about the House of Shammai; closure and stack are definite things, and they say it is not a forgotten sheaf. It is difficult about the House of Hillel; cattle and vessels are not definite things, and they say it is a forgotten sheaf<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The background of the question is not clear. It is stated in the paragraph after the next that in one interpretation the Mishnah deals only with the case that the sheaf was already taken up to be brought to the threshing floor but then was deposited somewhere and forgotten. It is stated as a general principle of the House of Shammai that the farmer already acquired final possession of the sheaf by taking it up. The House of Hillel is of the opinion that the Biblical ordinance of the forgotten sheaf overrides everything until the grain is removed from the fields. The operating term in this respect is (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:19" href="/Deuteronomy.24.19"><i>Deut</i>. 24:19</a>) “and <i>you</i> will forget,” i. e., it must be you who forgets. We have to assume that the House of Shammai in principle also will agree to such an interpretation. Then we would say that it is difficult to forget something deposited near a landmark; hence, if it is forgotten, the House of Shammai are not justified not to declare it a forgotten sheaf. On the other hand, if the sheaf was deposited near movable objects and is not easily found again, the House of Hillel should have accepted the action of prior acquisition. (Interpretation of <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> on the Mishnah.)<br>But the position of this set of questions before the interpretation of the Mishnah seems to indicate that the question is asked in a general way, rather than about a sheaf which was already taken up. Therefore, most commentators, from R. Simson to R. Z. Frankel, prefer to change the text and switch the names of Hillel and Shammai. There is no textual basis for this. The best interpretation of the text as it stands is the one of R. Moshe Margalit, who explains as follows: “It is difficult about the House of Shammai; (<i>if their reason is that</i>) closure and stack are definite things (<i>location not easily forgotten</i>), and they say (<i>even for cattle and vessels</i>,<i>which are easily moved</i>) it is not a forgotten sheaf! It is difficult about the House of Hillel, (<i>if their reason is that</i>) cattle and vessels are not stationary, and they say (<i>even for closure and stack</i>) it is a forgotten sheaf!”</i>.
“By its place, if it was standing beside the wine press or beside a breach in the fence<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is a quote from Mishnah 7:1: “Every olive tree which has a special name on the field, for example ‘a dripping olive tree’ at harvest time, if it was forgotten, is not subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf.

Joshua disagrees with the Mishnah which is formulated in the tradition of R. Eliezer, or there is a scribal error. While in general, the opinion of R. Joshua prevails against that of R. Eliezer, here R. Eliezer’s opinion is endorsed in the strongest terms by R. Eleazar ben Azariah and should determine practice (Maimonides <i>Mattenot Aniïm</i> 5:3).</i>. But when I came to Rebbi Eliezer, he told me that the Houses of Shammai and Hillel did not disagree that a sheaf near a closure, a stack, cattle, or vessels, if it was forgotten, was a forgotten sheaf.

The first, <i>qiddushin</i>, which for lack of a better English equivalent was translated as “betrothed,” requires the groom to hand over to the bride an object of value (today, a gold ring) and to declare before two witnesses that the woman is betrothed to him. From that moment on they are married as far as penal law is concerned. In antiquity, the propective bride (who probably was in her early teens) did not prepare any trousseau. Hence, after <i>qiddushin</i> she was given adequate time to prepare and then was married to live with her husband in a second public ceremony, <i>nissuïn</i>, the execution of the <i>ketubah</i> document, in which the groom mortgages all his possessions and earnings for the upkeep of his wife and the care of his children, followed by the public recitation of seven benedictions (in the presence of 10 adult males).

But the form נְטִיפָה in the Halakhah requires נְטוּפָה here. The addition “in its time” can only mean that the olives start dripping even on the tree, at the end of the growing season, for a short time every year.</i>” in its time, if it was forgotten, is not subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf. When does this apply? For its name, its production, and its place. By its name, if it was dripping<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “pouring” or “from a town Shipkoun”.</i> or from Beth Shean. By its production, if it produced much. By its place, if it stood next to the wine-press or near a hole in the wall. For all other olive trees, two are subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf, three are not. Rebbi Yose says, there is no law of the forgotten sheaf for olive trees.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi La said, it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:19" href="/Deuteronomy.24.19"><i>Deut</i>. 24:19</a>): “You will forget a sheaf on the field,” a sheaf you forget forever; this excludes one you certainly will remember after some time<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Because it has a specific name or property.</i>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> An olive tree standing between three rows of two rectangles, when forgotten, is not subject to the law of forgotten sheaves<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides explains in his Mishnah commentary that the trees are planted in checkerboard fashion, that each “white” square has a tree while the “black” squares are planted with vegetables; we still say that the middle one is obscured by the surrounding trees, disregarding the vegetable beds. R. Isaac Simponti accepts this explanation but takes the rectangles to denote distance, not necessarily that they are planted. [However, in his Code (<i>Mattenot Aniïm</i> 3:25) Maimonides accepts the explanation, also given by R. Simson, that the olive tree is a single tree surrounded on three sides by three rows of trees, each row consisting of two trees, so that the surrounding trees hinder the access to the single tree. R. Simson rejects the idea that the tree should not be subject to the law because of difficulty of access.]</i>.

R. Simson and R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A vineyard in its fourth year<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to harvest a newly planted vineyard the first three years.

There are two kinds of removal the vineyard of the fourth year may be subject to; if it is compared to the Second Tithe it must be removed from the house at the end of the third and sixth years of every Sabbatical period; if the produce was that of a Sabbatical year, one may take it but only as long as wild animals find similar food on the field (in this case, in other unharvested vineyards) and it must be removed by being consumed before that time.

Rebbi Bibi said before Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: According to the opinion of Rebbi, the statement of Rebbi Jehudah turns out to be like the statement of the House of Shammai.

The number of required loaves is not specified. The first heave has no fixed amount from the Torah; in the words of Samuel, one grain is enough for an entire silo. But since the number 1 is spelled out here and it is called heave, the natural inference is that the heave is the heave of the tithe given to the Levite, of which the Levite has to give 10% to the priest (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:26" href="/Numbers.18.26"><i>Num.</i> 18:26</a>). Hence, 1 is 10% of the required amount, and from each kind of bread 10 loaves have to be brought to the Temple (<i>Sifra Ẓav</i> 7:1).</i> only from the heave of the tithe; since you say that there was no heave of the tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Since there were no tithes during the 40 years in the desert; tithes are only imposed in the Land of Israel.</i> in the desert, will it follow that there was no heave of the thanksgiving sacrifice in the desert?

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">A son of R.

Rav Ḥisda said, it turns out that the argument of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah is identical with that of his father Rebbi Jehudah. Just as Rebbi Jehudah said that they learned the rules of the vineyard of the fourth year only from the Second Tithe, since you say that the Second Tithe started only after 14 years, similarly there was no fourth year after planting until after 14 years. Rebbi Yose said, he follows his son’s argument; Syria was inferred from “after 14 years<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">If they were not obligated while they were in the Land before its distribution, then certainly they are not obligated in Syria which was conquered only by a king, not by the community of tribes, held only temporarily, and never was distributed among the tribes.</i>;” “after 14 years” was not inferred from Syria.
It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:25" href="/Leviticus.19.25"><i>Lev.</i> 19:25</a>): “In the fifth year, you shall eat its yield<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">This verse following the one which declares the yield of the fourth year of a new vineyard “holy for praises” reads: “But in the fifth year, you shall eat its fruit, to increase its yield to you.” Hence, the harvest is directly given to the owner of the vineyard.

Just as the fruits of the fifth year are for the proprietors, so the fruits of the fourth year are for the proprietors. Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Yasa, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It turns out that Rebbi Yose the Galilean argues like Rebbi Jehudah.

Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: According to those who declare it his property, should it not be subject to tithes?

For “property of dowry” נכסי מלוג the ownership resides with the wife. “Iron cattle” צאן ברזל becomes the husband’s property completely in exchange for an obligation to return full value in case of dissolution of the marriage. In the Halakhah, the Mishnah is interpreted to mean that <i>her servants</i> are “property of dowry” servants, but “iron cattle” servants are <i>his</i> and entitled to eat <i>terumah</i> since only their value has to be returned. She herself may not eat <i>terumah</i> unless and until she gives birth to a male child. On this, R. Abin says in the name of R.

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A vineyard that produces only gleanings, Rebbi Eliezer says, they are for the proprietor, Rebbi Aqiba says, for the poor. Rebbi Eliezer said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:21" href="/Deuteronomy.24.21"><i>Deut.</i> 24:21</a>): “When you gather your grapes … do not take the gleanings after it.” If there is no vintage, where are the gleanings? Rebbi Aqiba told him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:10" href="/Leviticus.19.10"><i>Lev.</i> 19:10</a>): “Do not take gleanings from your vineyard,” even if it is all gleanings. If that is so, why does it say “when you gather your grapes … do not take the gleanings after it;” the poor have no right to the gleanings<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Nor to enter the vineyard before the time of the harvest.

Rebbi Aqiba certainly explains both verses. How does Rebbi Eliezer explain “do not take gleanings from your vineyard”?

If no third person is with them, A puts the food up on a fence or a rock and says: This is abandoned to anybody who wants it. B may take and eat it, but Rebbi Yose forbids it.” On this, R. Joḥanan notes in Halakha 4:10 that R. Yose forbids only because the food was forbidden to B before it was declared abandoned; the abandonment is invalid relative to B. But if something was abandoned before any vow was made, R. Yose agrees that the vow cannot retroactively influence the status of abandoned property.

Rebbi Eleazer from the South<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A fifth generation Amora from the South, the region around Lod, student of the Galilean R.

Eliezer. But the Sages say, if he can be trusted for the First, he can be trusted for the Second, but if he can be trusted for the Second, he cannot yet be trusted for the First.” Eating First Tithe without separating its heave of the tithe is a deadly sin. Eating unredeemed Second Tithe is a transgression but no deadly sin. For the Sages, essentially everybody can be trusted in matters of the heave of the tithe but only people checked out for trustworthiness can give reliable information about the Second Tithe.</i>, if he can be trusted for the Second, he can be trusted for the First? Rebbi Yose said, it is everybody’s opinion. Here it is different since nobody fools around with deadly sins<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">There is no question of minor transgression; eating food that is not a gift to the poor without separating out “great” heave and heave of the tithe is a deadly sin and people will not knowingly engage in it or lead others into a deadly sin.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia: Just as Jews are not suspected in matters of the great heave<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The first heave given from the harvest before tithes.</i>, so Levites are not suspected in matters of the heave of tithes.

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, the Levite may be trusted if he says, this is certainly tithe, to free it from Second Tithe. But if he says: It was given to me<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As a gift, not as obligatory tithe.</i>, or if he says that it is from his own crop<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Of which he is not entitled to take the gifts to the poor.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Should the poor be trustworthy if they say: It was given me as grain and I turned it into flour, it was given me as grain and I turned it into bread?

Rebbi Ḥinena bar Pappai used to distribute his charity in the night. Once the prince of spirits encountered him.
