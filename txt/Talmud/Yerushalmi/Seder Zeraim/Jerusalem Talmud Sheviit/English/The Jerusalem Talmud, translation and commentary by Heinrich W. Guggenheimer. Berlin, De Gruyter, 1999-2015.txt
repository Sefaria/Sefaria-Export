Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Until when may one plough an orchard in the year preceding the Sabbatical? The House of Shammai say, as long as it helps the fruits, the House of Hillel say, until Pentecost. Their words do not differ by much.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Until when may one plough, etc.” It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Shortened versions of this discussion are in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 9b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.9b">Babli, <i>Roš Haššanah</i>9b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Makkot 8b" href="/Makkot.8b"><i>Makkot</i> 8b</a>. In both places, the argument is attributed to the school of R. Aqiba. In <i>Mekhilta deR</i>.<i>Simeon bar Ioḥai</i> to 34:22, it is attributed to R. Jehudah. Practice noted in the next paragraph follows the school of R. Ismael as explained in Mishnah 5.</i> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:12" href="/Exodus.23.12"><i>Ex</i>. 23:12</a>): “Six days you shall do your work but on the Seventh Day you shall rest.” And it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:21" href="/Exodus.34.21"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a>): “You shall rest from ploughing and harvesting.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is somewhat elliptic. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:12" href="/Exodus.23.12"><i>Ex</i>. 23:12</a> reads: “Six days you shall do your work but on the Seventh Day you shall cease, so that your donkey and your ox may rest and the son of your bondsmaid and the stranger may recuperate.” <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:21" href="/Exodus.34.21"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a>: “Six days you shall work; on the Seventh day you shall rest, from ploughing and harvesting you shall rest.” It would seem more natural to quote the second verse <i>in toto</i>; this is the approach of the commentaries which emend the first quote away but such an approach is impossible since our text clearly quotes two different verses. The explanation is in the <i>Mekhiltot</i>(<i>deR</i>.<i>Ismael</i>,<i>Massekhta dekhas pa</i>, p. 331; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:1-24:18" href="/Exodus.21.1-24.18"><i>deR</i>.<i>Simeon bar Ioḥai</i>,<i>Mishpaṭim</i>, p. 217</a>): It says in the Ten Commandments, that “six days you shall labor and do <i>all</i> your work.” Hence, one could think that the Sabbath has to be kept only if <i>all</i> work is permitted on weekdays. This would exclude the Sabbath days of the Sabbatical year since most agricultural work is forbidden in the Sabbatical. Hence, the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:12" href="/Exodus.23.12"><i>Ex</i>. 23:12</a> is necessary to include the Sabbath days of the Sabbatical years; this only makes sure that <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:21" href="/Exodus.34.21"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a> is redundant as far as both Sabbath day and Sabbatical year are concerned.</i>” Where do we hold? If one speaks about the Sabbath of Creation<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath day.</i>, was it not already said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 20:9" href="/Exodus.20.9"><i>Ex</i>. 20:9</a>): “Six days you shall labor and do all your work?” If one speaks about Sabbatical years, was it not already said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:3" href="/Leviticus.25.3"><i>Lev</i>. 25:3</a>): “Six years you shall sow your field and six years you shall prune your vineyard?” If it cannot refer to the Sabbath of Creation nor to Sabbatical years, let it refer to the prohibition of the first two terms<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The “two terms” are the two periods during which agricultural work has to cease before the onset of the Sabbatical year, one for orchards and one for fields.</i>. “You shall rest from ploughing and harvesting,” from ploughing when harvesting is forbidden; what is this? This is ploughing in the year preceding the Sabbatical in preparation of the Sabbatical. And from harvesting when ploughing is forbidden, what is this? That is the harvest of Sabbatical growth after the Sabbatical.
If it is so, why was it said: One ploughs until the New Year<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">From some <i>baraita</i>. The statement of R. Joḥanan is a Tosephta (<i>Ševi‘it</i> 1:1). In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 3b" href="/Moed_Katan.3b">Babli (<i>Mo‘ed qaṭan</i>3b</a>) the statement is attributed to R. Joshua ben Levi; in neither Talmud is it presented as a tannaïtic statement.</i>? Rebbi Crispus in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rabban Gamliel and his court abolished the prohibition of the first two terms. Rebbi Joḥanan asked: Did we not state: No court may annul the words of another court unless it is greater in wisdom and numbers<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 1:5" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.1.5">Mishnah <i>Idiut</i> 1:5</a>. Rabban Gamliel and his court are inferior to the Men of the Great Assembly both in stature and in numbers.</i>? Rebbi Crispus in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If they wanted to plough, they may plough<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since the institution of the Sabbatical year is interwoven with that of the Jubilee year and the Jubilee is possible only if the Twelve Tribes are living on their ancestral lands, the Sabbatical in the times of the Second Commonwealth is not a biblical but a rabbinic institution. It is a general rule in dealing with institutions of the Men of the Great Assembly that one is restrictive in interpretation while the Temple exists and lenient when the Temple does not exist. Since one hopes that the Temple will be re-established, the rules have to be stated in the Mishnah for future generations (Interpretation of Rav Ashi in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 4a" href="/Moed_Katan.4a">Babli <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 4a</a>).</i>. Then it should have been eliminated from the Mishnah! Rebbi Crispus in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If they wanted to re-establish it, they may do so.
Rebbi Jonah objected: There is the chapter on the induction and the chapter on the generation of the deluge which will have no future use<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The induction of Aaron and his sons into the priesthood is decribed twice in the Torah, once as commandment (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 29" href="/Exodus.29"><i>Ex</i>. 29</a>) amd once in its execution (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 8-9" href="/Leviticus.8-9"><i>Lev</i>. 8–9</a>). The rules given there have no future application since the priesthood of the descents of Aaron is permanent. Similarly, since God has sworn that there will be no more global deluge (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 9:11" href="/Genesis.9.11"><i>Gen</i>. 9:11</a>), the story of the deluge has no future applications.</i>. Should they have been eliminated from what is studied? They are there to inform you. So here also to inform you. Rebbi Mana said, as we stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 1:6" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.1.6">Mishnah <i>Idiut</i> 1:6</a>, explaining why the Mishnah also transmits opinions which are rejected in practice. The information about rejected opinions is necessary for the future.</i>: “If a person says, so is my tradition, one will say to him, you heard the opinion of Rebbi X.” And so, if somebody should say, I heard that it is forbidden to plough until the New Year, they will say to him, you heard the prohibition of the first two terms.
Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: When they forbade it, they were inspired by Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is not claimed that the rules of the Sabbatical year in the Second Commonwealth are biblical, only that they are inspired by the interpretation of biblical verses.</i>, and when they permitted it, they were inspired by Scripture. When they forbade it, they were inspired by Scripture, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:3" href="/Leviticus.25.3"><i>Lev</i>. 25:3</a>): “You shall rest from ploughing and harvesting,” from ploughing when harvesting is forbidden; what is this? This is ploughing in the year preceding the Sabbatical in preparation of the Sabbatical. And from harvesting when ploughing is forbidden, what is this? That is the harvest of Sabbatical growth after the Sabbatical. When they permitted it, they were inspired by Scripture, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 20:9" href="/Exodus.20.9"><i>Ex</i>. 20:9</a>): “Six days you shall labor and do all your work,” just as on the eve of the Sabbath of Creation<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath day.</i> one may do work until sundown, also before the start of the Sabbatical year one may work until sundown<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Sundown of the eve of New Year’s Day.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 3b-4a" href="/Moed_Katan.3b-4a">Babli (<i>Mo‘ed qaṭan</i> 3b–4a</a>) has another interpretation, based on R. Ismael’s opinion in Mishnah 1:5. It cannot accept the interpretation here since in the theory of the Babli one is obliged by biblical decree to start Sabbath and holidays some time before sundown (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 82b" href="/Yoma.82b"><i>Yoma</i> 82b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 9a" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.9a"><i>Roš Haššanah</i> 9a</a>).</i>.
Why until Pentecost? Until then it is good for the fruits, from there on he degrades his fruits. But did we not state: Both for a useless tree<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the definition of “useless tree”, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 6:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.6.3.1"><i>Kilaim</i> Chapter 6, Note 40</a>.</i> and a fruit tree, until then<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Pentecost. After that time, any ploughing makes sense only as preparation for the next season, the Sabbatical.</i> it fortifies the stem, from there on it weakens its force. Let him plough! Because he knows that he will weaken the tree, he does not intend to work the ground.
Why did we not state this with the leniencies of the House of Shammai and the stringencies of the House of Hillel? Sometimes there is no rain and no moisture and he would plough only before Pentecost following the House of Shammai<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ploughing in a time of draught robs the ground of moisture. In that case, the House of Shammai is more restrictive than the House of Hillel.</i>. The House of Hillel say, until Pentecost.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> What is an orchard? Any three trees on a <i>bet seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">2500 square cubits, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:9:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.9.5"><i>Kilaim</i> Chapter 1, Note 195</a>.</i>; if they may produce a fig cake in the weight of a talent of 60 Italic minas<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since an Italic denar weighed <sup>1</sup>/<sub>96</sub> of a Roman pound, or 3.59 g, 60 minas or 6000 denar are approximately 21.5 kg. Maimonides estimates this as 62.48 <i>rotl</i>. He declares (<i>Terumot</i> 4:10) a <i>rotl</i> to be a Roman pound (the common apothecary’s weight in the Middle Ages); in Roman measures, 60 minas are 62.5 Roman pounds.</i> one ploughs the entire <i>bet seah</i> because of them. If it is less, one ploughs for them only to accomodate the harvester and his basket beside him.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rav Jehudah in the name of Samuel, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A very shortened version of this statement is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 5:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.5.2.2"><i>Baba Batra</i> 5:5</a> (fol. 15a), a parallel is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 82b-83a" href="/Bava_Batra.82b-83a">Babli <i>Baba Batra</i>82b–83a</a>, where the allowable distances are determined in a lengthy discussion. Probably the statement in (Caesarean) Yerushalmi <i>Baba Batra</i> is the original one; the extended (Tiberian) version here must be the result of a derivation parallel to the arguments of the Babli. The rules established in <i>Baba Batra</i> deal with transactions without special stipulations; the parties in a sale are free to specify exactly what is sold and what is not sold but if the details are not mentioned in the contract of sale then the rules given here are valid by default.</i>: If somebody buys three trees on another person’s property, spaced so that ten trees could be planted in a <i>bet seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is the minimum of trees in a <i>bet seah</i> that constitutes an orchard. If the trees are planted in a regular pattern, each tree is the center of a square of 250 square cubits. Hence, the distance of two trees is 250<sup class="footnote-marker">½</sup> = 15.811 cubits. (In the Babli, the distance is required to be “less than 16 cubits.”)</i> and that the ox and its harness could pass between them<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This is defined as “working space” of 4 cubits in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 5:3:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.5.3.2-4"><i>Kilaim</i>, Halakhah 5:3</a>. In all cases, the stems of the trees are not included in the measurements, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:6:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.6.2-4"><i>Kilaim</i>, Halakhah 4:8</a>.</i>, then he acquired the ground under them, the ground between them, and outside the space for the harvester and his basket. Rav said, if they form a group<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">If the trees form a triangle. The correct version is in a Genizah fragment, בעשויין ציבה, referring to צובה “tripod”. The Venice text has the word in <i>Eruvin</i> 5:2, in a rule concerning three villages close one to another, where Rav requires them to be built “like a tripod” and Samuel allows them to be aligned.</i>. Samuel says, also if they are in a straight line. Rebbi Yose said, this refers to there but not to here<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The minimal and maximal distances apply to civil contracts, not to the laws of the Sabbatical.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, it refers even to here, if they are close<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Fruit trees planted less than four cubits apart cannot grow; they are planted either in a tree nursery to be transferred later to genuine agricultural use or they are grown for their wood and will be cut down. In no case is ploughing the field for them justified.</i>. Rebbi Mana said to him, did we not state “that the ox and its harness could pass between them”? Come and see, if the ox and its harness can pass between them, the roots can expand laterally, but if the ox and its harness cannot pass between them, the roots cannot expand laterally.
Rebbi Eliezer asked, from one to the other sixteen and on the sides twenty five<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If the three trees are planted in a straight line (following Samuel), almost 16 cubits apart (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 1:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.1.2.2">Note 18</a>), is it necessary to assume that the trees are exactly in the middle of the field and that in the perpendicular direction there are 25 cubits on both sides? One has to assume that the question also is whether there have to be 9 cubits between any extremal tree and the border of the field. It seems that instead of “R. Eliezer” one should read “R. Eleazar”, but there is no ms. evidence to back this up.</i>? Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac asked: If they were next to a fence, does one plough the entire <i>bet seah</i> because of them<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A question in opposition to R. Eliezer’s. If the three trees are close to a fence, if one may plough a field even if the trees are not in the center, may one then plough both sides of the fence to a distance of 50 cubits if the fields on opposite sides belong to the same owner?</i>? Rebbi Yose said, if you want that, we should give them their four <i>bate seah</i>, two <i>bate seah</i> here, two <i>bate seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">If it is possible to plough a <i>bet seah</i> because of a row of trees somewhere on it, one would be able to define a cross-shaped area to be ploughed, four partially overlapping <i>bate seah</i>. If the distance between two trees is <i>a</i>, one has two fields 50 wide and 50 long on each side of the trees and two fields 50 wide and 25-<i>a</i> long on each side straddling the line on which the trees are planted. One has to assume that in each direction there is a <i>bet seah</i>, a 50-by-50 field, but the four fields have a considerable area in common so that the total area is &lt; 4 <i>bate seah</i>. This interpretation is necessary because even the two lateral fields must have in common the strip carrying the trees and be wide (8 + width of the stems); it agrees with the very careful formulation of the sentence that lead those copyists astray who understood what they were copying. The argument shows that the question must be answered in the negative.</i> there. Rebbi Jeremiah asked, if there was one vine drawn over two <i>seah</i>, do you plough the ground under it and outside it for the harvester and his basket<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, one ploughs much more that a <i>bet seah</i> but there is no reason to see in this situation a contradiction to our Mishnah.</i>?
Regarding the prohibition of the first two terms, those above plough downwards and those below plough upwards<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Following R. Eliezer, one ploughs 25 cubits on both sides of a row of trees, even if the trees are planted on a slope. The problem is that one may plough the entire field because the roots of the trees have the entire field to expand in, but we do not expect the roots to expand upwards as much as they expand downwards.</i>. It seems reasonable that those above plough downwards but not that those below plough upwards. Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 2:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.2.10.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Batra</i> 2:11</a>. The chapter deals with the obligation of every citizen to avoid damaging his neighbor’s property. If a tree is planted too close to a cistern, the roots might penetrate the wall of the cistern. The full Mishnah reads: “One removes a tree 25 cubits from a cistern, and a sycomore tree fifty cubits, both higher or on the same level.” In some Mishnah mss. one reads “both higher and lower”, cf. <i>Diqduqe Soferim Baba Batra</i> p. נו Note ס.</i>: “One removes a tree 25 cubits from a cistern.” We have stated on that: Both higher and lower. Or let us say both if the tree is higher and the cistern lower or if tree and cistern are on the same level. In this sense, we stated<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>baraita</i> is quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 25b" href="/Bava_Batra.25b">Babli <i>Baba Batra</i> 25b</a> as current practice.</i>: “Whether the tree is higher and the cistern lower or the tree lower and the cistern higher”; is that reasonable? If the tree is higher and the cistern lower<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is understandable.</i>; but the tree lower and the cistern higher, do roots climb? Rebbi Ḥanina said not because of the roots [climbing], but they loosen the earth and damage the bottom of the cistern<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli, this reason is given by R. Ḥaga (Ḥaggai).</i>. A case came before Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">About a tree planted near a cistern; he rejects the argument of R. Ḥanina and decides following R. Yose.</i>; he said that is a single opinion and we do not rely on it, for we have stated on this: “Rebbi Simeon says, just as they said higher so they said lower.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Batra (Lieberman) 1:12" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Batra_(Lieberman).1.12">Tosephta <i>Baba Batra</i> 1:12</a>. The opponent of R. Simeon is R. Yose (ben Ḥalaphta) who insists that agricultural land is meant for agricultural use and the owner of the cistern should not have built it too close to the border of his domain. In general, R. Yose is a higher authority than R. Simeon. In the Babli, R. Yose’s opinion is not mentioned; practice follows R. Simeon. In Yerushalmi <i>Baba Batra</i>, Halakhah 2:11/12, no position is taken between R. Yose and the rabbis.</i>”

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Any useless<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the definition of “useless tree”, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 6:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.6.3.1"><i>Kilaim</i> Chapter 6, Note 40</a>.</i> or fruit trees are considered as if they were fig trees<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A fig tree of the size of the tree in question.</i>.

He declares (<i>Terumot</i> 4:10) a <i>rotl</i> to be a Roman pound (the common apothecary’s weight in the Middle Ages); in Roman measures, 60 minas are 62.5 Roman pounds.</i> one ploughs the entire <i>bet seah</i> because of them.

The Halakhah will explain the meaning of “from three to nine”.</i>. If there are ten or more than ten one ploughs the entire <i>bet seah</i> because of them, whether they produce or not, since it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:21" href="/Exodus.34.21"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a>): : “You shall rest from ploughing and harvesting.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Without good reason, one may not plough.</i>”<br>One does not have to mention ploughing and harvesting of the Sabbatical, but it refers to ploughing in the year preceding the Sabbatical in preparation of the Sabbatical, and harvesting of Sabbatical growth after the Sabbatical. Rebbi Ismael says, just as ploughing is voluntary so harvesting is voluntary; this excludes the harvest of the ‘<i>omer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This belongs to the discussion of the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:21" href="/Exodus.34.21">Ex. 34:21</a>): : “You shall rest from ploughing and harvesting,” as given in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.1.1">Halakhah 1, Notes 1–4</a>. The only addition is the statement of R. Ismael, that the verse refers to the Sabbath day, on which all ploughing is forbidden; this has no definite date assigned to it. For him, while the verse is formulated as a prohibition, it implies the commandment to cut the sheaf of barley “on the day after the day of rest” following Passover (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:15" href="/Leviticus.23.15"><i>Lev</i>. 23:15</a>), even if that day should be a Sabbath (the 16th of Nissan for Pharisees, the 22nd of Nissan for the author of the book of Jubilees.) Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:22" href="/Exodus.34.22"><i>Mekhilta deR</i>.<i>Simeon bar Ioḥai</i> to <i>Ex</i>. 34:22</a>.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Any useless tree, etc.” Why did they mention fig trees? Because their fruits are large and they produce many. The Etrog tree<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Citrus medica</i>.</i> has large fruits but it produces few of them. Olive trees produce much but its fruits are not large. But these produce much and its fruits are large. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, all trees produce one year less<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Latin <i>parum</i>, cf. Demay p. 521.</i> than another year but the fig tree produces every year.
“If one tree yields, etc.” Rebbi Vivian in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: Only he should not diminish from the computation of triads. Zeïra bar Ḥinena said, only he should not diminish from the computation of nonads<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first opinion, it must be possible to split the trees into groups of trees, each of which produces a talent. According to the second opinion, all nine trees together have to produce three talents.</i>.
If there were four and the ox may pass between them with its harness and two where the ox cannot pass with its harness, you consider it as if there were five. If there are five, we have the disagreement of Rebbi Simeon and the rabbis, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 5:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.5.2.1">Mishnah <i>Kilaim</i> 5:2</a>, cf. there, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 1:2:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.1.2.3">Note 27</a>. Here also, the ox and its harness need four cubits. The rabbis disregard the additional trees and only require one group yielding a talent. R. Simeon forbids ploughing unless one group produces a talent and the remaining three trees (of which two are planted too close together) produce ⅔ of a talent.</i>: “A vineyard planted less that four cubits apart, Rebbi Simeon says that it is no vineyard. But the Sages say that it is a vineyard and one disregards the ones in the middle as if nonexistent.”
“One ploughs the entire <i>bet seah</i> because of them since it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:21" href="/Exodus.34.21"><i>Ex</i>. 34:21</a>): ‘You shall rest from ploughing and harvesting.’ ” That refers only to the first part, “one ploughs for them only as necessary because it is said ‘you shall rest from ploughing and harvesting.’ ”.
“One does not have to mention, etc.” Rebbi Ismael is consistent since Rebbi Ismael said the ‘<i>omer</i> may not come from Syria; the harvesting of the ‘<i>omer</i> is different, it is a commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The main place of this argument is in <i>Šeqalim</i> 4:1. For the definition of Syria cf. <i>Peak</i> Chapter 7, Note 119.<br>Since R. Ismael holds that the barley of the ‘<i>omer</i> is intrinsically holy, he holds that the cutting of the barley is an action of the Temple and paid for by the yearly Temple tax, hence relative to the Sabbath it has the status of a sacrifice and must be performed on the Sabbath if necessary. For him, the prohibition of ploughing before the Sabbatical has no scriptural base.</i>.

R. S.

The verb שמט in classical Arabic means “to spread out the foliage (of a tree)”. There is an Arabic technical term מסמט “vine prop” fitting the context. [R. S.

The meaning of both versions is the same: One may make dungheaps on his field only after those who work their fields in the regular manner have stopped doing so, when it is too late to fertilize for this year’s crop. One may not spread out the manure on the field but it should be stored in heaps of 150 <i>seah</i>.</i> stop, the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Jehudah says, when the colocynth<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Definition of the Halakhah. Colocynth (<i>citrullus colocynthis</i>, in Pliny <i>cucumis colocynthis</i>) is a gourd used as laxative; [מתוֹק “sweet” is a euphemism.]</i> dried up. Rebbi Yose says, when it forms its fruit<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Interpretation of Maimonides. An exact translation would be “when it forms nodes.” The colocynth, a relative of the cucumber, has no thickened parts except the fruit developing from the female flower.</i>. How much manure may one use? Up to three dungheaps for a <i>bet seah</i>, each one containing ten boxes of a <i>letekh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">15 <i>seah</i>. A <i>bet seah</i> is 2500 square cubits, cf. <i>Peah</i> p. 89.</i> each. One may add boxes but not dungheaps; Rebbi Simeon says, also dungheaps.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “When may one bring out,” etc. Is it permitted to assemble a dungheap at the door of one’s courtyard before the agricultural workers stop? Silanus asked Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and he forbade it to him. Rebbi Ḥanina<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He is the fifth generation Amora R.

Ḥiyya bar Abba was a Cohen and Silanus, a rich land owner, used to give him his tithes. The people gossipped that R. Ḥiyya was bending the law to please his benefactor. R. Ḥiyya, a Babylonian, returned to Babylonia the following year, in order not to profit from the yield that his ruling produced. We know from the Babylonian Talmud that R. Ḥiyya bar Abba sometimes argued inperson with Baby-lonian Sages.</i>. He instructed himself to leave the Land, so that he could not take the tithe. Then should it be forbidden even after the agricultural workers did stop because of the bad impression, that they would not say, he brings it out to his irrigated field? The people of one’s town know whether he has an irrigated field or not. Rebbi Yose said, this means that they did not worry about a bad impression on passers-by<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is in line with the position of the Yerushalmi in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 9:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.9.1.8"><i>Kilaim</i>, Chapter 9, Notes 32</a> ff.</i>.

How long may one fertilize? Anytime one may plough one may fertilize.”<br>Since the agricultural Sabbatical is certainly rabbinic, if there is no Jubilee year and no Temple the Samaritans are not bound by its rules. The language of the Tosephta binds the prohibition of fertilizing to that of ploughing; when the two terms were abolished for ploughing they automatically were abolished for fertilizing.</i>: “One may sell and transport manure with those who work during the Sabbatical year until the New Year, with a Gentile and a Samaritan even during the Sabbatical year on condition that he not unload the boxes.” It said only, “on condition that he not unload the boxes,” hence he is permitted to transport.

“When the colocynth dried up.” <i>Citrullus colocynthis</i>. Rebbi Mana said, that means the colocynth of the open field<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Not the colocynth of a watered garden plot which may grow throughout the entire year.</i>.

Rebbi Yose questioned, if he uses fewer boxes, then two should be forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A possible interpretation of the Mishnah is that one may not start dungheaps on the field (for next year’s use) unless the total amount is 30 <i>letekh</i>, 450 <i>seah</i>.

The text is that of the Leyden ms. In the Rome ms., some Mishnah mss., and the standard printed Mishnah the text reads יתר מכן מחציב דברי ר׳ שמעון “more than that he chisels, the words of R. Simeon”; that text makes no sense at all. Most Mishnah mss. read simply יתר מכן דברי ר׳ שמעון; one Genizah fragment reads ויתיר, which seems to be the reading underlying the Yerushalmi Halakhah and the commentaries of Maimonides, R. Simson of Sens and R. Isaac Simponti: “even more, the words of R. Simeon.” This is the only text compatible with the opinion of R.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Why is this stated twice<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since R. Jeremiah inferred from the preceding Mishnah that the Sages will not permit more than three dungheaps, why does this have to be stated here explicitly? The answer is that the Sages will not permit any dungheap of less than 150 <i>seah</i>; the Mishnah is needed to give the background of R. Simeon’s statement.</i>? Rebbi Jeremiah said, there if he used fewer boxes, but here if he makes it according to the measure. We have stated thus about Rebbi Simeon: “On condition that he use no less than three boxes per dungheap.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Even R. Simeon will not permit any dungheap to contain less than 45 <i>seah</i>.</i>”
“But the Sages forbid.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from the correct Mishnah, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.3.2.1">Note 21</a>. The Sages will permit 450 <i>seah</i> of manure directly on one field (of at least one <i>bet seah</i> surface area) in one, two, or three places.</i>” When he brings more than the measure.

What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah? Maybe there will be no more manure and it will turn out that he fertilizes that place. [This is identical with the second scenario both here and in <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i>. The only difference in both explanations is that in the first case, R. Eleazar ben Azariah is said to accept the opinion of R. Yose (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 5:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.5.6.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 5:8</a>) who forbids short sales of manure because manure always is in short supply.]</i>, he may continuously add to it after the agricultural workers stopped; Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah forbids it.

Maybe there will be manure and it will turn out that he fertilizes that place<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">If the manure is added in small portions, the soil under the dungheap will be thoroughly fertilized next year when the manure is spread out over the entire field.</i>. One may give another explanation: If he had little [manure] in his house before the Sabbatical year and he wants to transport it to his field during the Sabbatical, he may continuously add to it after the agricultural workers stopped; Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah forbids it. What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah? Maybe there will be no more manure and it will turn out that he fertilizes that place.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not build steps<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">This is the standard meaning of the word; Maimonides explains it by Arabic דדג “staircase”. The explanation given by the classical commentaries is that hewn stairs down the ravine make it easier to draw water for manual irrigation. It seems to me that a better interpretation would be: “One does not build terraces out of ravines.” There is nothing in the Halakhah that would contradict this interpretation. If the Mishnah permits building terraces during the dry season of the Sabbatical year, it makes sense that one may not fill the terraces with earth since that clearly would be agricultural work.

Rebbi Jehudah says, the Sabbatical of Persian figs is the year after the Sabbatical since they need two years to produce. One said to him, they mentioned only white figs.

But trees making only one threshing floor per year, such as olive trees, date palms and carob trees, even if they budded before this day, belong to the future.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, people use to follow Rebbi Neḥemiah for carobs. Rebbi Simeon objected before Rebbi Joḥanan: Did we not state that “the Sabbatical of white figs is the second year since they produce after three years”?

He said to him, the first third is slow in coming; afterwards it grows rapidly. Rebbi Abba said, Rebbi Zeїra learned that from a competent sharecropper. Samuel said, sixty days for six leaves, six days for sixty leaves.

As we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 9:8. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:6-7" href="/Leviticus.25.6-7"><i>Lev</i>. 25:6–7</a> reads: “The Sabbatical of the Land shall be food for you, for you, your male and female slaves, your employees and the non-citizens who dwell with you. All its yield shall be eaten by your domesticated animals as well as the wild animals of your land.” As explained in Mishnah 7:1, this is taken to mean that people may eat Sabbatical produce only as long as wild animals can find that particular produce on the fields. When nothing more is left for the wild animals, the produce may no longer be stored; all produce harvested and stored has to be distributed for immediate consumption; this is called <i>removal</i>.</i>: “Poor persons eat after the removal but not rich ones, the words of Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since R. Jehudah’s father, R. Illaï, was one of the few known students of R. Eliezer, it is reasonable to assume that R. Eliezer’s opinion here underlies the later statement of R. Jehudah. It will be stated in Mishnah 7:1 that only the leaves of arum are subject to removal; the roots are hidden from the wild animals and not subject to removal. Since the poor have the right to harvest the leaves (as vegetables) after the time of removal, any leaves remaining after the Sabbatical are the property of the poor. If the leaves grow again in the following rainy season, the farmer who harvests the leaves as vegetable during that year has to compute the share of the poor and separate it from his harvest.</i>. Rebbi Yose says poor and rich persons may eat after the removal.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since everybody may take the leaves after the time of removal, the poor have no claim to anything the next year. Cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 9:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.9.6.1">Chapter 9, Note 116</a>. One has to assume that the Mishnah deals with minute amounts since there would be no removal if considerable amounts were available on the fields.</i>”
Rebbi Ammi asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: Does our Mishnah go back to the time before they decreed about spontaneous growth<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:5" href="/Leviticus.25.5"><i>Lev</i>. 25:5</a> reads: “The spontaneous growth of your grain you should not harvest …” On this, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar" href="/Sifra,_Behar"><i>Sifra Behar</i>1(3</a>) comments: From here the Sages found support to forbid spontaneous growth in the Sabbatical. The verse forbids only commercial harvest of grain. R. Ammi notes that the leaves of Arum whose roots were in the earth long before the Sabbatical must have the status of spontaneous growth of vegetable.</i>? He said to him, where you there on the upper floor<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In all cases where details of the enactment of rabbinical prohibitions have come down to us, the vote was taken on the upper floor of some house. R. Joḥanan notes that no record of such a vote is available.</i>? Rebbi Ammi inferred that the prohibition of spontaneous growth is from the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The different positions in this matter will be described in Chapter Nine.</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah said, the Mishnah deals with the leaves of false arum<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">A plant looking like arum but without a bulb. Its leaves are pure vegetable (if they are young and not bitter, Mishnah <i>Uqeẓin</i> 3:4).</i>. Rav Hoshaiah brought a <i>baraita</i> of Bar Qappara from the South and stated<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bar Qappara’s version of the Mishnah supports R. Jonah, that arum and onion follow the same rules. False onions do not exist.</i>: “The leaves of arum or of onions.” Can you speak of leaves of false onions? The word of Rebbi Jeremiah implies that anything subject to removal found inside something not subject to removal is subject to removal<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jeremiah does not want to apply the rules of the Mishnah to genuine arum; he must be of the opinion that the entire arum plant is subject to removal since its leaves, being sold as leaf vegetables, are subject to removal. This would contradict the statement of the Mishnah which explicitly excludes the roots and speaks only of the leaves.</i>. How does Rebbi Jeremiah deal with this? He explains it if he trampled on the leaves<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since no non-bulbous plant has leaves like onions, he must explain that the onion leaves in the <i>baraita</i> of Bar Qappara had been trampled down before the start of the Sabbatical and, therefore, do not grow any longer from the bulb.</i>.
Rebbi Yose explains the Mishnah before the New Year of the Sabbatical: If one planted before the New Year of the Sabbatical, it formed a bulb before the Sabbatical; he pressed [the leaves] down during the Sabbatical and tore them out after the Sabbatical. If you say that pressing down is like tearing out<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since breaking petioles of the leaves in bending them will stop the growth. R. Yose explains only the position of R. Eliezer. It is implied that R. Joshua is sure that pressing down is not like tearing out.</i>, everything is for the poor. If you say that pressing down is not like tearing out, not everything is for the poor. Because of this doubt, he should settle with the poor.
Rebbi Ḥizqiah explains the Mishnah as referring to the eve of New Year’s Day of the Sabbatical. If he planted on the eve of New Year’s Day of the Sabbatical, it grew a bulb at the start of the Sabbatical; then he pressed [the leaves] down during the Sabbatical and tore them out after the Sabbatical. If you say that pressing down is like tearing out, everything belongs to the farmer<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Since there will be no more growth, the farmer is under no obligation.</i>. If you say that pressing down is not like tearing out, not everything belongs to the farmer<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">That means, nothing is for the farmer; the poor take all without computation, even that which grew in the sixth year of the Sabbatical cycle.</i>; therefore, the poor have no settlement with the farmer.
“If it was in the ground three years, he gives one quarter to the poor.

“Arum of the year before the Sabbatical” etc. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Zeїra: Is it not so also in the other years of the cycle<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The argument seems to refer not to our Mishnah here but to the explanations of Rebbis Yose and Hoshaiah of the difference between R.

This implies that bending down is like tearing out!<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This contradicts the prior statement that the question is unsettled.</i> Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi La: Explain that he tore them out before they started to grow.

“When may a person buy” etc. What is the reason of Rebbi Jehudah? They made a decree regarding arum but not regarding vegetables<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 4 requires that arum be harvested during the Sabbatical with indequate tools.

He told him, you know to read but you do not know to make a homily. “The passers-by did not say,” these are the nations of the world who pass out of the world, they did not say to Israel “the blessing of the Eternal is on you.” What does Israel say to them, “we bless you in the Name of the Eternal.” All blessings that come into the world because of us are not enough for you, you do not say, come and take from these blessings for yourselves, but you roll over us pro-rated contributions and fines, head taxes and <i>annonae</i>.

Still we say obligations depending on the Land apply only in the Land, but we might think that obligations not depending on the Land also should apply only in the Land. The verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 11:16-18" href="/Deuteronomy.11.16-18"><i>Deut</i>. 11:16–18</a>) “Guard yourselves, lest your heart be seduced … And the Eternal’s rage be inflamed against you, etc. Put these words on your hearts, etc.” Even if you are exiled.

V. 17 then declares that the punishment for idolatry will be exile from the Land. Verses 18, 19, which now must be talking about the obligations of a Jew in exile, contain the obligations of <i>tefillin</i> and the study of Torah. Therefore, it is impossible that no obligations at all should be imposed on Jews in exile.

A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Zeïra as we have stated (<i>Terumot</i> 9:4): “A growth from heave is heave but the growth from its growth is profane. But the growth from <i>ṭevel</i>, First Tithe, aftergrowth of the Sabbatical, heave of the tithe, <i>dema‘</i>, and First Fruits is profane.” We have stated on this: “When is this true?

But did we not state: “Calamint, hyssop, and thyme he brought to the courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">These plants grow as weeds in Galilee, but if they are collected as spices and stored they are subject to tithes (Mishnah <i>Ma‘serot</i> 3:9).</i>, (but) if it was from the second year into the third they belong to the third; from the sixth year into the Sabbatical they belong to the sixth?” Here, you count the past [year], there the coming!

But did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: There is no “from the sixth year into the Sabbatical they belong to the sixth” but they belong to the Sabbatical?

About leaves preserved with sprouts, some Tannaïm state: both of them are subject to removal. Some Tannaïm state: neither of them is subject to removal. Leaves are subject to removal, sprouts are not subject to removal. He who says [both] are not subject to removal is Rebbi Joshua; he who says [leaves] are subject to removal but sprouts are not subject to removal is Rabban Gamliel<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Mishnah 9:5: “If somebody preserves three kinds in one barrel, R.

Rebbi Simeon says, all kinds of vegetables have the same status; one eats purslain until <i>sinariot</i> disappear from the Bet Neṭofa valley.” R. Eliezer demands that all be removed if one of the kinds has to be removed. In our case, he requires that the sprouts be removed if the leaves have to be removed. R. Joshua requires that all kinds be removed together when the last has to be removed. Since sprouts do not have to be removed, nothing has to be removed. Rabban Gamliel thinks that the requirement of removal is on the produce, not on its taste. The taste of one absorbed by the other is irrelevant; therefore, each kind has to be removed in its time: Leaves have to be removed but not sprouts.</i>.
Rebbi Pedat, Rebbi Assi, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Simeon follows that of Rebbi Joshua, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Orlah</i>: 1:7; its topic is the use of any part of an <i>orlah</i> plant (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 5:7:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.5.7.4"><i>Kilaim</i> Chapter 5, Note 93</a>).</i>: “Rebbi Joshua said, I heard that making curds<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">To make cheese with vegetable rennet.</i> with the sap of leaves or roots is permitted, with the sap of unripe fruits it is forbidden because that is a fruit.” Rebbi Zeïra said to Rebbi Pedat, since we say there that practice follows Rebbi Joshua, would you have to say here that practice follows Rebbi Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">The opponent of R.

In the parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 8b" href="/Niddah.8b">Babli, <i>Niddah</i> 8b</a>, the disagreement is explained that for R. Eliezer sap has the status of fruit and for the Sages who oppose R. Simeon in the Mishnah here, sap of a tree which produces no edible fruit has the status of fruit, whereas for R. Joshua no sap has the status of fruit. Therefore, the Babli accepts the position of R. Pedat which here is questioned. The verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:23" href="/Leviticus.19.23"><i>Lev</i>. 19:23</a>) restricts the holiness of <i>orlah</i> to fruits only.</i>? Rebbi Jonah said, are the situations similar?

The holiness of the Sabbatical falls on animal feed, but the holiness of <i>orlah</i> never falls on it. Rebbi Abun said, there is another one: Rebbi Joshua quoted it as a tradition, Rebbi Simeon said it in his own name<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Since he gives a reason, it is his own argument and not one he was taught by his teachers.</i>.
Sap may be fruit, unripe fruits may be fruit<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the statement of R. Joshua in Mishnah <i>Orlah</i>.

Why? Because usufruct of heave is permitted but usufruct of <i>orlah</i> is forbidden.
In the first case, you say “the roses should be taken out”, in the second case “all is subject to removal”? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: This is from two [different] Tannaïm. Rebbi Yose said, I can explain those roses by two conditions: “If new roses are preserved in old oil”, Sabbatical roses preserved in oil of the sixth year; “old in new”, Sabbatical roses preserved in eighth year’s [oil].

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> They established a comprehensive principle for the Sabbatical: Nothing that is exclusively food for humans may be used for a wound dressing<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Or any other medical use except medicines that are ingested.</i> for humans or, it goes without saying, for animals. Anything that is not exclusively food for humans may be used for a wound dressing for humans but not for animals. Anything that is not exclusively food, for humans or for animals, if intended as food for humans or animals one puts on it all restrictions regarding humans or animals; if intended as wood then it is wood. Examples are calamint, hyssop<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 7:1:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.7.1.9">Chapter 7, Note 51</a>. These plants grow as weeds.</i>, and thyme.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “They established a comprehensive principle for the Sabbatical,” etc. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Human and animal food is mentioned in the paragraph<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:6-7" href="/Leviticus.25.6-7">Lev 25:6–7</a> “The Land’s Sabbath shall be for you (<i>pl</i>.) as food, for you (<i>sing</i>.), your slave, and your handmaid, your hired hand and your sojourner who are dwelling with you. Also for your (<i>sing</i>.) domestic animals, as well as the wild animals in your land, shall all its yield be food.”</i>. What reason do you have to say that from human food one cannot make a wound dressing but from animal feed one may make a wound dressing? He said to him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:6" href="/Leviticus.25.6"><i>Lev</i>. 25:6</a>): “The Land’s Sabbath shall be for you as food”, an exclusion. It excludes human food that cannot be made into wound dressing. It also excludes animal feed! Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, any interpretation you give which contradicts the prior interpretation is not valid<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Bun bar Ḥiyya refutes the arguments of R. Zeïra and R. Yose: Since “for you, your slave, and your handmaid,” is a necessary addition, as explained above, to permit the rich person to eat, it cannot be treated as an exclusion. The explanations are invalid.</i>. Rebbi Yose did not say so, but (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:6" href="/Leviticus.25.6"><i>Lev</i>. 25:6</a>): “The Land’s Sabbath shall be for you as food”, an exclusion, “for you, your slave, and your handmaid”, an exclusion after an exclusion, to add that human food cannot be made into wound dressing<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Here we find an essential difference between the exegesis of Babli and Yerushalmi. In the Babli, a double restriction always means an addition, no restriction at all. For the Yerushalmi, any exclusion remains an exclusion; one adds exclusions that otherwise would not be thought of. The verse really contains more exclusions and inclusions: “The Land’s Sabbath shall be for you (<i>pl</i>.)”, not for the Gentile (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Sheviit (Lieberman) 5:21" href="/Tosefta_Sheviit_(Lieberman).5.21">Tosephta 5:21</a>) but for all your needs (Mishnah 8:2), “as food”, not for industrial use and not for sacrifices [<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar" href="/Sifra,_Behar"><i>Sifra Behar</i> 1(10</a>)]. “For you (<i>sing</i>.), your slave, and your handmaid,” seems to be an addition since this allows rich people to eat Sabbatical produce [<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar" href="/Sifra,_Behar"><i>Sifra Behar</i> 1(10</a>)], even though it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:11" href="/Exodus.23.11">Ex. 23:11</a>): “Abandon the yield of the Sabbatical, so it may be eaten by the destitute of your people …” The verse here permits slaveholders, i. e., people of means, to eat Sabbatical produce. According to <i>Mekhilta Mišpaṭim</i> 20, still only poor people may eat Sabbatical produce under the obligation of removal. It follows that “you, your slave, and your handmaid,” is stated on condition that there be food for the wild animals, and can be considered a restriction. “Your hired hand and your sojourner who are dwelling with you” are Gentile employees hired for a period of time (“dwelling with you”), not hourly workers. They are exempt from the ban to give Sabbatical fruit to Gentiles. “Also for your domestic animals, as well as the wild animals in your land, shall all its yield be food,” domestic animals can be fed stored food in the stable only as long as they could find it in the fields by themselves.<br>The argument in the Halakhah seems to be the following: Since Sabbatical produce is “for you”, one could think that this (1) only excludes the Gentile, but a Jew may use Sabbatical produce for anything he needs. It is specified “for you, your slave, and your handmaid,” which (2) excludes use of Sabbatical produce for any but human use. Wound dressings (as well as emetics) are used for human needs. If there were only one exclusion, I would include medical uses. But since there are two, one has to give an expansive interpretation of the exclusion; the only uses permitted are those needed equally by master and slave, the healthy and the sick. Therefore, medical (non-food) uses are forbidden, washing and heating is permitted. This argument is diametrically opposed to any Babylonian argument which treats two consecutive exclusions as inclusion.</i>. He added animal feed! As Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, any interpretation you give which contradicts the prior interpretation is not valid<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Bun bar Ḥiyya refutes the arguments of R. Zeïra and R. Yose: Since “for you, your slave, and your handmaid,” is a necessary addition, as explained above, to permit the rich person to eat, it cannot be treated as an exclusion. The explanations are invalid.</i>. Rebbi Mattaniah said, when you did exclude, you excluded from human food; when you included, you included animal feed<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is enough to have one exclusion mentioned for humans; since there is no similar exclusion for animals, which have the right to Sabbatical produce whether owned by a Jew or not, it is reasonable to have a restrictive tradition for human food but not for animal feed.</i>.
May one make dyes<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cosmetics. They fill a need equal for all humans.</i> for humans from animal feed? Since one may make dyes for humans from human food even though one may not use human food for a wound dressing, one certainly may make dyes for humans from animal feed since one may use animal feed for a wound dressing. May one make dyes for humans from materials for wound dressings? Since one may make dyes for humans from human food even though one may not use human food for a wound dressing, one certainly may make dyes for humans from wound dressing materials since one may use wound dressing materials for a wound dressing. The only question<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The previous argument about wound dressing materials was trivial.</i> is: May one make animal dyes<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Probably to paint owner‘s marks on animals.</i> from human food? Just as you say for human food that one may use it to make human dyes even though one may not use it for wound dressing, similarly animal feed, though one may not use it for animal wound dressing, should be usable for animal dyes. Rebbi Yose said, why may one make dyes from human food? Because human dyes have holiness<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since they fill a genuine human need, they fall under all restrictions of the use of Sabbatical produce and cannot be exported or sold to Gentiles.</i>. Should one be able to make animal dyes from animal feed when animal dyes have no holiness<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The answer to the question is negative.</i>?
We understand “one puts on it all restrictions regarding humans and animals” that it is forbidden to boil them to a pulp<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the discussion of the third part of the Mishnah about produce used both as food (human or animal) or as wood.</i>. We have stated: If the seller sells as food and the buyer buys as wood, the latter is not determining. If the seller sells as food and the buyer buys as food and then thinks of them as wood, the latter is not determining. If the seller sells as wood<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">While wood usually costs less than food, the seller has an interest in selling as wood since then the proceeds are not under Sabbatical restrictions and can be used for any purpose (R. H. Kanievski).</i> and the buyer buys as food and then thinks of them as wood? Where do we hold? If he gave him the money and afterwards took it up, he paid for wood<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is agreed that by rabbinic practice, handing over the money does not transfer property rights to the buyer; only taking possession (either actual or symbolic) can do that. However, the <i>baraita</i> slates that the opinion of the seller counts. Since the seller is not a party to the buyer’s taking possession, his opinion can be determining only if he is the owner at the moment of payment.</i>. If he took it up and afterwards gave him the money, he paid for food. We must hold that he gave him the money and afterwards took it up; this is the disagreement between Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to one opinion, since לוקח “to take” also means “to buy”, rabbinic practice simply follows the biblical decree. In this case, ownership is vested in the seller until the buyer actually takes possession. The other opinion notes that Abraham bought the field of Makhpela by paying money; it follows that the Torah recognizes payment as effecting transfer of ownership. According to this opinion, rabbinic practice was introduced to cut down on fraudulent transactions, so that the seller could not sell non-existing goods and later claim that they did exist at the time of payment but before delivery were destroyed in a fire.<br>The position ascribed here (and in Yerushalmi <i>Erubin</i> 7:11, fol. 24d) to R. Joḥanan is that of R. Simeon ben Laqish in the Babli (<i>Baba Meẓia‘</i> 46b–47a, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 81b" href="/Eruvin.81b"><i>Erubin</i> 81b</a>) and vice-versa. However, the Talmud of Caesarea (Yerushalmi <i>Baba Meẓia‘</i> 4:2, fol. 9d) states that R. Joḥanan asked (and followed) R. Yannai’s opinion in the matter and the latter stated that payment transfers property rights by Torah law and that rabbinic practice was only instituted to cut down on fraud. Since practice almost always follows R. Joḥanan against R. Simeon ben Laqish, Tiberian practice followed the opinion of R. Joḥanan in the text here, Babylonian and Caesarean that of R. Simeon ben Laqish.</i>. According to Rebbi Joḥanan, who said that [transfer of] money does not mean acquisition by Torah law, he paid for food. According to Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish who said that [transfer of] money does mean acquisition by Torah law, he paid for wood.
If each one keeps to his word, it should be treated as follows<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kiddushin (Lieberman) 2:9" href="/Tosefta_Kiddushin_(Lieberman).2.9">Tosephta <i>Qiddušin</i> 2:9</a>. “One says for 100, the other says for 200. Each went to his own house and then they sued one another. If the seller sues the buyer one follows the buyer, if the buyer sues the seller, one follows the seller.” This cryptic text was explained by Maimonides (<i>Hilkhot Mekhirah</i>20:1): “If somebody wants to buy from another person and the seller says I will sell for 200, the buyer says I shall buy only for 100. They separate without a deal and when they come together again, the buyer takes the article without saying anything. If the seller sues the buyer after he handed over the article, the latter has to pay only 100. If the buyer came and took the article, he has to give 200.”</i>: “If the seller sues the buyer one follows the buyer, if the buyer sues the seller, one follows the seller.” And here [one follows] the same [rule].

“The Sabbatical admits the additional leniency that its [oil] may be used for lighting”; that means it is permitted” May heave not be used for lighting?

From here, they said that “one does not cut Sabbatical figs with the fig-knife but he may cut with a dagger. One does not tread grapes in the wine press but he may tread in a trough. One does not work olives in the oil press and with a roller.” Our teachers permitted to use a roller<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is used only for small quantities of grapes in the other years of the Sabbatical cycle.

Rebbi Joḥanan taught those of [the House of] Rebbi Yannai to grind in a mill following Rebbi Simeon, and to work with a roller, following the rabbis.

Then just as holy things become profane, Sabbatical produce should become profane. But the verse says <i>it is</i> {in a permanent state}, it remains in its holiness.” The details of the transfer to the last redeemed property are given in the Halakhah.

Rebbi Eleazar said, Sabbatical produce cannot become freed by redemption, only by sale. A <i>baraita</i> supports one, a <i>baraita</i> supports the other.

Let us hear from the following: “Rebbi Jehudah says, spontaneous growth of mustard is permitted because the unobservant are not suspected concerning it.” They said only “because the unobservant are not suspected concerning it.” These, because the unobservant are not suspected concerning them, will be permitted.
So far its greens; its seeds<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Probably one has to read: “So far its seeds, what about its greens?” However, there is no manuscript evidence for this. The question is about mustard that is collected, in general, only for its seeds. It should be obvious that R. Jehudah will permit Sabbatical mustard plants as vegetable without any restriction. Since the final decision will go against R. Jehudah, the problem does not have to be discussed in detail.</i>? Is it impossible to say that if its seeds are permitted, its greens not so much more?
Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish was in Ḥiqoq<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This place has not be identified.</i>. He saw them dealing with mustard plants.

Following Maimonides, טפיחין are fruits or grain that for some reason either do not ripen or ripen extremely slowly; therefore they are on the tree or in the earth for most of the year because nobody takes them. {The explanation of Arukh, in the name of his brother, that טפיחים are kernels collected by birds nesting in a טפיח, a clay or wooden container, is accepted by the commentators from R.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? The first kind gives taste to the last. What is the reason of Rebbi Joshua? The last kind gives taste to the first.

The teachers of the following generations do agree that the economic situation of the times required a device by which to avoid the consequences of removal but they are opposed to the informality of Ḥizqiah’s approach and require a formal declaration of abandonment. They therefore counsel to abandon the property in such a way that no other person has the opportunity to take the produce before its previous owners could repossess it.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The Sabbatical remits any loan<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The end of the Sabbatical year.</i>, with or without a document<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic tradition, there are three kinds of loan by document. If there is no surety given in the document, the status of the loan is the same as that of a loan given in front of two witnesses, without a written document. The standard loan contract establishes a lien by the creditor on all real estate the borrower may have. (Some tannaitic authorities hold that the absence of such a lien from a document is an error of the scribe; the existence of a lien may always be assumed.) Since the lien (known as “alienation of property”) is not specified, the lender can foreclose on such a loan only by lengthy court proceedings. If the loan is documented and given as a mortgage on a specific parcel of real estate, in the theory of the Yerushalmi it is a loan on a pledge and not remitted, as stated in Mishnah 2.</i>. Store credit is not remitted; if it is transformed into a loan it is remitted. Rebbi Jehudah says, any preceding one is remitted<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jehudah holds that any new credit given by a store to a customer automatically transforms any previous credit into a loan.</i>. Wages of a hired hand are not remitted; if they are transformed into a loan they are remitted; Rebbi Yose says, for any work that stops in the Sabbatical they are remitted; if it does not stop they are not remitted<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It is to be discussed whether the work has to stop <i>because of</i> the Sabbatical or only <i>during</i> the Sabbatical. The hired hand cannot be a day-worker because the wages of a person hired for the day must be paid that same day.</i>.<br>If somebody slaughters a cow and divides it up on New Year’s Day<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The butcher gives away meat both days of the New Year of the Sabbatical. It is forbidden to transact business on the holiday; therefore, the Mishnah avoids speaking about selling meat; the meat is distributed on the holiday, billed later by estimate.</i>, if the month was long it is subject to remission<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">If the month of Elul was 30 days, the first day of the New Year really was the 30th of Elul, the second day the first of Tishre. The debt incurred on the first day enters the Sabbatical and is subject to remission; the debt of the second day is contracted during the Sabbatical and not subject to remission.</i>, otherwise it is not subject to remission. The rapist, the seducer, the calumniator<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">These are all fines, and fines are never remitted. The fine for the rapist is spelled out in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:29" href="/Deuteronomy.22.29"><i>Deut</i>. 22:29</a>, the one for the seducer <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:16" href="/Exodus.22.16"><i>Ex</i>. 22:16</a>, the one for the calumniator who accuses his bride of adultery between the preliminary and actual marriages, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:19" href="/Deuteronomy.22.19"><i>Deut</i>. 22:19</a>.</i>, and all court documents are not subject to remission. If somebody gives loans on pledge<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The pledge is in the hand of the lender; the loan is not a claim on another person but the borrower must come and redeem his pledge.</i>, or deposits his documents<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The obligation of remission of debt is one on real persons only.</i> with the court, they are not subject to remission.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The Sabbatical remits any loan, etc.” <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 37a" href="/Gittin.37a">Babli, <i>Giṭṭin</i>37a</a>, Rav and Samuel explain the Mishnah that “with a document” means a document with the alienation clause, “without a document” means either a document without the alienation clause or an oral loan. R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish explain “with a document” as a loan with a document without the alienation clause, and “without a document” as a loan executed before witnesses but without any written document, but a loan on a correct document, with the alienation clause, is always like a loan on a pledge and never remitted. The opinion of Rav and Samuel is accepted as practice in the Babli; the reports there on the positions of Rav and R. Joḥanan are not totally in accordance with the Yerushalmi.</i> We can understand if it is without a document. With a document it should be treated similar to a loan on a pledge<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A loan on a pledge is not remitted in the Sabbatical, as stated in Mishnah 2.</i> and not be remitted. Rebbi Joḥanan said, explain it for a document from which alienation of property is missing, following Rebbi Meïr<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He states in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 1:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.1.6.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 1:6</a> that a document without an alienation clause cannot be foreclosed in court.</i>. A case came before Rebbi Joḥanan of a document without alienation of property and he instructed that it was remitted. Because we are interpreting the Mishnah, should we act on this<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since we reject R. Meïr’s opinion and hold that the court will force the borrower to pay for every loan proven by a valid document, and will even allow the lender to foreclose real estate if the borrower does not pay, we cannot consider the Mishnah here practice to be followed. The same argument is quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 37a" href="/Gittin.37a">Babli, <i>Giṭṭin</i>37a</a>, referring to a case brought by R. Assi before R. Joḥanan.</i>?
Rebbi Jeremiah said, it is only if he has no real estate<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since the alienation of property clause refers only to real estate, such a clause in a contract with a landless borrower is devoid of meaning and without legal consequences.</i>. Hence, if he has real estate it is not remitted. Rebbi Yose said, even if he has real estate it is remitted<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He takes the Mishnah to apply to all borrowings (except mortgaging a well-defined piece of real estate), following Samuel and Rav in the Babli; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 10:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.10.1.2">Note 5</a>.</i>. Rebbi Yose parallels Rav, since Rebbi Abba said in the name of Rav if he singled out real estate it is remitted<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">While this text appears in both mss., in this and the next sentences the expressions “singled out” and “did not single out” must be switched: “Rebbi Yose parallels Rav, since Rebbi Abba said in the name of Rav if he did not single out real estate it is remitted. They said only ‘if he did not single out’; therefore, if he singled out it is not remitted.” Everybody agrees that a mortgage written on a well-defined piece of real estate is no longer a debt owed by the borrower but a lien on the land.<br>The statement ascribed to Rav here parallels a <i>baraita</i> in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 37a" href="/Gittin.37a">Babli <i>Giṭṭin</i> 37a</a> and in content, but not in the formulation, a <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Sheviit (Lieberman) 8:6" href="/Tosefta_Sheviit_(Lieberman).8.6">Tosephta (8:6</a>, speaking about a document of <i>hypotheke</i>, mortgage, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 10:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.10.1.6">Note 22</a>). {The treatment of mortgages in Yerushalmi and Babli cannot be directly compared since the Babli admits irrevocable mortgages for which the lender obtains the right to all yield of the land for a fixed period, usually 20 years, after which the parcel reverts to the original owner without repayment of the capital. In the Yerushalmi, all mortgages are redeemable.}</i>. They said only “if he singled out”; therefore, if he did not single out it is not remitted.
“If somebody established a lien on a field for his wife but then went and sold it, if she wishes she collects from this field or she collects from any other property.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The lien is part of the marriage contract and covers the payments due the wife in case of dissolution of the marriage either by divorce or by the husband’s death. A parallel <i>baraita</i> in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 41a" href="/Gittin.41a">Babli (<i>Giṭṭin</i> 41a</a>) gives the option both to the wife and to any lienholder, both of whom have the choice of either going after unincumbered property of the husband or debtor or to choose the more complicated procedure of foreclosing the property from the buyer, letting the buyer then sue the seller to recover his damages. In the Babli, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel declares the original sale invalid if the lienholder is the wife since women cannot be expected to be willing to go through lengthy and complicated court proceedings.</i>” Rebbi Hila said, Rebbi Eleazar instructed following this <i>baraita</i>. The colleagues asked: Should she not collect only from the properties that are under the lien? Rebbi Yose said to them, there are unencumbered properties<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Which the wife can take with a minimum of legal steps.</i> and you say, those under the lien? The <i>baraita</i> [applies] if he did not say<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In all these statements, “to say” means “to write into the appropriate document.”</i> you shall be paid only from this. But when he said, you shall be paid only from this, she may collect only from this<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The piece of real estate on which she holds the lien.</i>.
If somebody established a lien for another person on his field and then went and sold it; Rebbi Aḥa said, it is temporarily sold<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In the time between the sale and the lienholder’s foreclosure, the buyer is the rightful owner in all respects. This is the unquestioned position of the Babli.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, even temporarily it is not sold<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since the sale does not break the lien, the sale is invalid as far as the lienholder is concerned. The lienholder has only to enforce his rights vis-à-vis the debtor but does not have to sue the buyer of the land.</i>. The strength of Rebbi Yose is from the following: He may induce his ox to flee; he cannot induce his field to flee<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the rule, not otherwise quoted in the Yerushalmi, and brought as a statement of fifth-generation Amora Rava (Rav Abba bar Joseph bar Ḥama) in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 11b" href="/Bava_Kamma.11b">Babli (<i>Baba Qama</i> 11b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 44b" href="/Bava_Batra.44b"><i>Baba Batra</i> 44b</a>), that a mortgage on cattle is not valid, since the disposition of animals is outside the control of the lienholder. This implies that a valid lien puts the mortgaged property at the disposal of the lienholder.</i>. Think about it, if [the field] was sold to a violent person<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The lienholder might be afraid of the consequences if he brings the buyer into court.</i>! Rebbi Yudan, the father of Rebbi Mattaniah, said: Violent persons are apt to fall<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the lien is temporarily unenforceable, nobody will give up his claim because of this.</i>.
It was stated: “If somebody mortgages<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Greek ὑποθήκη “mortgage”.</i> a field to a woman for her <i>ketubah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 3:7:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.3.7.8"><i>Peah</i> Chapter 3, Note 155</a>.</i> or a creditor for his claim and then sells it, that is sold and the buyer should beware for himself<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>baraita</i> seems to support R. Aḥa only. In <i>Yebamot</i> 7:1 (fol. 8a), Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel disagress and decrees that in the case of a <i>ketubah</i> the sale is void since we cannot require a woman to sue a third party for her rights.</i>” This <i>baraita</i> if he said to her: you should be paid from this. They disagree if he says, you should only be paid from this<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, R. Yose declares the sale invalid, which does not contradict the <i>baraita</i>.</i>.
Rav said, if she compromised [her <i>ketubah</i>], even if she did not extend credit, if she extended credit even though she did not compromise. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: Unless she would compromise it and extend credit<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Sheviit (Lieberman) 8:4" href="/Tosefta_Sheviit_(Lieberman).8.4">Tosephta 8:4</a>: “A woman’s <i>ketubah</i>, if she compromised it and extended credit, is subject to remission. If she compromised it but did not extend credit, if she extended credit but did not compromise, it is not subject to remission.” “Compromised” means that she obtained partial payment of the <i>ketubah</i> and now cannot use the original <i>ketubah</i> document for the remaining claim but must produce a new document from the husband (for a divorcee) or the heirs (for a widow) for the remainder. “Extending credit” means that she does not insist on immediate payment but on payment terms as if it were the repayment of a loan. The Tosephta text follows Rebbi Ḥiyya; Rav makes the <i>ketubah</i> subject to remission in the Sabbatical even if only one of the conditions is met. (In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 18a" href="/Gittin.18a">Babli, Giṭṭin 18a</a>, the position of R. Ḥiyya is ascribed to Rav and that of Rav to Samuel.)</i>.
Because he extends him credit a second time, is the first turned into a loan?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Mishnah, where R. Jehudah declares that the exemption of store credit from the laws of the Sabbatical only covers the last credit extended.</i> Rebbi Eleazar said, this follows Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This statement seems to be obvious since R. Jehudah only restricts the exemption of store credit. But the reference here is to Mishnah 2, where it is stated that store debt incurred on New Year’s Day may be subject to remission. While this Mishnah is anonymous, it is stated here (and in Halakhah 2) that it also is R. Jehudah’s and refers to a customer who took food from the store on both days of the New Year. For R. Jehudah this implies that the debt incurred the first day is subject to remission (at the end of the Sabbatical year.)</i>. But can he require payment on New Year’s Day<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since handling money is forbidden on a holiday, payment cannot be asked for.</i>? Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: About money for which he can believe him<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The prior argument is rejected. If the customer is creditworthy, extending credit is tantamount to asking for payment and extending credit is permitted on the holiday.</i>. And since he could ask him for payment, he should be able to give him money. And here, because he should have been able to give him money and he did not give, the first [debt] is turned into a loan<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The storekeeper is implicitly asking for payment by providing the food; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.10.1.1">Note 36</a>. Hence, non-payment automatically turns the credit into a loan and the farmer has a great incentive to ask for his money during the Sabbatical. The same argument applies to the butcher mentioned in Mishnah 2.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the last sentence in the Mishnah, where R. Yose declares that wages for an unfinished job are remitted if not paid during the Sabbatical. R. Joḥanan holds that this applies only if the Sabbatical is the cause of the interruption; R. Simeon ben Laqish disagrees.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan says, for ploughing. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, for building. In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan, any work that stops because of the Sabbatical. In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, any work that stops in any way. Does Rebbi Yose hold with Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Does R. Yose hold that payment for work done is turned into a loan the moment the work is finished and was not paid? This would parallel the opinion of R. Jehudah about store credit.</i>; does not Rebbi Yose say, for any work that stops in the Sabbatical they are remitted, if it does not stop they are not remitted? But Rebbi Yose does not hold with Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This probably should read: R. Jehudah does not hold with R. Yose. The statement of R. Jehudah is in Mishnah <i>Šebu‘ot</i> 7:5, that a banker never can be believed if he claims to have given change before he received the large coin.</i>; while “Rebbi Jehudah says that it is not the way of a banker to give an <i>as</i> unless he has received a <i>denar</i>,” he agrees that the wages of the hired man are due only at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The payment is due only during the Sabbatical and not subject to remission since only debts incurred before the Sabbatical must be remitted.

But in the Sabbatical, there is no commercial crop, and when the next crop grows, the debt already is remitted. Hence, the verse speaks of any loan given in the sixth year, and nothing can be implied about the 30 day rule. {In <i>Sifry Deut</i>. #117, R.

The fines for the rapist and the seducer are spelled out in the Torah only for the נערה, a minor. The fines have to be paid to the father if at the time of judgment and payment the girl was a minor, to the woman if she was an adult at the time of judgment.

The rabbis hold that the obligation is a civil one, a “loan”, the payment goes to the creditor of the loan, <i>viz</i>., the father, and is remitted in the Sabbatical. The position ascribed to R. Meïr in this Mishnah is that the status of the obligation is that of a loan which is not remitted in the Sabbatical. {R. Simson holds that the position of R.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody repays a debt in the Sabbatical, the Sages are pleased with him. If somebody borrows from a convert whose sons converted with him, he does not have to repay the sons but if he repaid, the Sages are pleased with him<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text in all Mishnah mss., whether Palestinian, Babylonian, or Maimonidean traditions. However, the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 17b-18a" href="/Kiddushin.17b-18a">Babli (<i>Qiddušin</i> 17b/18a</a>) quotes the Mishnah in the form “the Sages are displeased with him,” and the text here, “the Sages are pleased with him,” is given only as a <i>baraita</i>. The meaning of the distinctions made in the Babli is not clear; therefore, Maimonides omits the rule in his Code. The only coherent explanation of the Mishnah is that given by Rabbi Isaac in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Kiddushin 18a:1:1" href="/Tosafot_on_Kiddushin.18a.1.1">Tosaphot (<i>Qiddušin</i> 18a, s. v. כאן</a>) and R. Nissim Gerondi in his commentary to Alfassi (<i>Qiddušin</i> #596): Since a convert is like a newborn for Jewish law, the children converting with him are not legally his Jewish children and the law will not force the debtor to pay after the lender’s death. However, the children are his own children and not to pay the sons after their father’s death is reprehensible. If the convert has children after his conversion, they are his Jewish children and all laws of inheritance apply. The only problem arises if his pregnant wife converted with him. The Babli notes that in such a case, the Sages are displeased with any repayment to the child born after conversion. The reason given by the commentators is that the child is Jewish by birth; if the laws of inheritance did apply one would conclude that the child is legally a relative of his father and his older siblings. But the fact is that a Gentile father never can have a legal relationship with his child by a Jewish mother. For example, if a Jewish man marries his late father’s other wife, this relationship is incestuous and the marriage is non-existent; the woman can marry another man without a divorce. But if the child conceived as a Gentile would marry one of his late father’s wives other than his mother, while the marriage is not tolerated it is valid and would need a formal divorce. The Yerushalmi does not consider this unlikely case. {The <i>Šulḥan Arukh</i>,<i>Ḥošen Mišpaṭ</i> §127(2) decides otherwise, following what is reported in the name of Rashi.}</i>. Movables are acquired only by being drawn close, but the Sages are pleased with everybody who keeps his word<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">The rules of acquisition are spelled out in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.5.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 1:5</a>. The rule is that by rabbinic decree, transfer of movable property can be accomplished only by actual or symbolic possession. This means that if the buyer pays before he takes possession, the seller is legally free to return the money and sell the goods to a higher bidder. However, doing so is morally reprehensible and the tricked buyer may ask the court to declare (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 4:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.4.2.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 4:2</a>): “He Who made the generation of the Deluge and the generation of the Tower of Babylon pay, He will make him pay who does not stand by his word.”</i>.
