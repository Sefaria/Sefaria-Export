Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not sell Second Tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">One may not sell Second Tithe as such, that it should be Second Tithe in the hand of the buyer. One may exchange Second Tithe for money (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:25" href="/Deuteronomy.14.25"><i>Deut.</i> 14:25</a>), transfer its holiness to the money, and render the produce profane which then may be sold; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Maaser Sheni 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maaser_Sheni.4.1.1">Mishnah 4:1</a>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One does not sell Second Tithe.” One does not sell it because holiness is written for it<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:30" href="/Leviticus.27.30"><i>Lev</i>. 27:30</a>.</i>.

Taking a loan and giving a pledge is not a sign of blessing.</i>. “<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maaser Sheni (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>: “How may one not sell it? One should not say, here is 200 [<i>zuz</i>] worth, give me 100 in exchange.” If Second Tithe were sold, it would not be redeemed and the buyer would have to eat the produce in purity and sanctity in Jerusalem (assuming the existence of the Temple.)</i> How may one not sell it? A person should not say to his neighbor, here you have this mina’s worth of Second Tithe, give me 50 <i>zuz</i> profane for it.”
Who is the Tanna of “one does not sell it”? Rebbi Meїr<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">R. Meїr considers Second Tithe as property of Heaven given to the farmer for consumption in holiness. For R. Jehudah, Second Tithe is private property. Their disagreement is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.2.7.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 2:8</a>, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:3:24" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.3.24"><i>Demay</i> Chapter 1, Notes 185–186</a>.</i>! But for Rebbi Jehudah it should be logical that it be permitted to be sold, by an argument <i>a minore ad majus</i>: If it is permitted to sell heave<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned many times in Mishnah <i>Terumot</i>; e. g. Mishnah 4:1.</i> which is forbidden to lay people, since Second Tithe is permitted to lay people, one should certainly be permitted to sell it. No, if you assert this for heave which does not need an enclosure, what can you imply for Second Tithe which needs an enclosure<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:24" href="/Deuteronomy.14.24"><i>Deut.</i> 14:24</a> requires that Second Tithe be consumed “at the place chosen by the Eternal, your God.” This place must be designated somehow. We have no record that the sanctuary at Shilo was within walls, but some enclosure must have defined the sacred space. It is accepted that the ancient walls of Jerusalem defined the sacred space for Second Tithe. In contrast, heave may be consumed by the priests anywhere in the Land.</i>? First Fruits shall prove it which need an enclosure<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since they have to be brought to the Temple. The operative enclosure here is the courtyard of the Tabernacle or the outer wall of the Temple. The receiving priest is permitted to sell to another priest.</i> and one may sell them! No, if you assert this for First Fruits which do not implicate their monetary substitute<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The money is profane.</i>, what can you imply for Second Heave which implicates its monetary substitute<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The money must be taken to Jerusalem as Second Tithe, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:24" href="/Deuteronomy.14.24"><i>Deut</i>. 14:24</a>. The argument could have been formulated: The sale of First Fruits is a sale, the sale of Second Tithe is a redemption.</i>! The Sabbatical shall prove it which implicates its monetary substitute<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševi‘it</i> 8:8.</i> and it is permitted to sell it! Rebbi Yudan said, from this? The sale of Sabbatical produce is its redemption<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The sale of Sabbatical produce, as authorized in Mishnah <i>Ševi‘it</i> Chapter 8, cannot be characterized as a sale but is a redemption which does not impinge on the holiness of the produce which remains Sabbatical. But exchanged Second Tithe is totally profane. Therefore, there is no proof that R. Jehudah would permit the sale of unexchanged Second Tithe.</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah said, who is the Tanna of “one does not sell it”? Rebbi Meїr<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">R. Meїr considers Second Tithe as property of Heaven given to the farmer for consumption in holiness. For R. Jehudah, Second Tithe is private property. Their disagreement is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.2.7.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 2:8</a>, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:3:24" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.3.24"><i>Demay</i> Chapter 1, Notes 185–186</a>.</i>! But for Rebbi Jehudah it should be logical that it be permitted to be sold, by an argument <i>a minore ad majus</i>: If it is permitted to sell Sabbatical produce with which one may not liquidate one’s debts<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 3:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.3.1.4"><i>Demay</i> 3:1, Notes 13–14</a>.</i>, it is logical that it should be permitted to sell Second Tithe since with it one may liquidate one’s debts. We find that one may liquidate one’s debts with Second Tithe, following what we stated<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 4:6. The text quotes only the beginning of the Mishnah but the argument is from the second part: If the buyer took possession of the Second Tithe when it was worth 2 tetradrachmas but did not exchange it until its value decreased to 1 tetradrachma, he gives the seller one tetradrachma of profane money (for redemption); the second tetradrachma he may take out of his own Second Tithe money. This means that he may use his Second Tithe money to liquidate the debt he incurred when he took possession of the Second Tithe.</i>: “If he took from him tithe worth one tetradrachma and did not come to exchange it until it was worth two.” Rebbi Yose said, there is a difference since from the start the value of Second Tithe was due. If he had owed before, it would be an argument<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">There is no proof that Second Tithe money may be used for anything but Second Tithe or profane food to be turned into Second Tithe.</i>. Rebbi Yudan said, a Mishnah said that it is forbidden to sell it, as we stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.2.7.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 2:8</a>. The Mishnah states that no tithe may be used for the money due the bride at the preliminary marriage ceremony (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:3:24" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.3.24"><i>Demay</i> 1:3, Notes 185–187</a>; <i>Peak</i> 6:2 Note 46, 7:6 Note 135). R. Jehudah holds that if the groom criminally alienated Second Tithe from its intended use and used it as bridal money, the former Second Tithe now is his private property (for which restitution is due) which may be used as bridal money. But this implies that Second Tithe cannot be used in the absence of criminal intent since if it was used inadvertently, without criminal intent, Second Tithe is Heaven’s property and the preliminary marriage is invalid.</i>: “If intentional, he married, if in error, he did not marry.” If you say that he may sell it, he should be able to use it for marriage but anything he may not sell he may not use for marriage. But did we not state<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Sheviit 8:8" href="/Mishnah_Sheviit.8.8"><i>Ševi‘it</i> Mishnah and Halakhah 8:8, Notes 114</a>, 115, 118.</i>: “One does not buy slaves, real estate, and unclean animals from Sabbatical money. If he bought them, he has to eat their worth.” Rebbi Yose said, this means that it is forbidden to acquire a wife with Sabbatical money. Otherwise, what is the difference between one who acquires a wife and one who acquires a slave girl? Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Yudan in the name of Rebbi Ila, everybody agrees because of these arguments. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Aḥa, everybody agrees that all should need the enclosures<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The first opinion of R. Yose states that the previous arguments showed that R. Jehudah agrees that Second Tithe may not be sold but only exchanged. The second opinion states that this is not a biblical law but a rabbinic institution so that, if the Temple is rebuilt, everybody has an interest in seeing to it that the walls of Jerusalem will be in good shape.</i>.
“<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maaser Sheni (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>.</i> How does one not take it as a pledge? He who enters another’s house to take a pledge should not take his debtor’s Second Tithe as pledge.” It was stated: “One does not give it as a deposit and he should not give it to a grocer to receive food in its value.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maaser Sheni (Lieberman) 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).1.2">Tosephta 1:2</a>: One does not give it as a deposit; he should not say, keep this tithe in your hands and give me profane [produce] for its value.</i>” If one transgressed and took as pledge, trangressed and gave as deposit? It shall be as the following<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maaser Sheni (Lieberman) 3:9-10" href="/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).3.9-10">Tosephta 3:9–10</a>; the Yerushalmi text is parallel to the Erfurt ms.</i>: “If somebody eats his Second Tithe, whether in error or intentionally, he shall cry out to Heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">There is no replacement; his sin can be forgiven only by divine mercy.</i>, the words of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. Rebbi says, in error he shall cry out to Heaven, intentionally the money’s worth shall be restituted. If it was money, in error he shall cry out to Heaven, intentionally the money’s worth shall be restituted, the words of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. Rebbi says, whether in error or intentionally, the money’s worth shall be restituted.” Rebbi Zeriqa in the name of Ḥizqiah: Practice follows Rebbi for money and Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel for produce. Rebbi Ila said, there was a case about money and they instructed following Rebbi.
Or it may follow this: <sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The entire paragraph is in <i>Ševi‘it</i> 32:6, Notes 42–47.</i>“One does not plant, sink, or graft in the year preceding a Sabbatical year later than thirty days before the New Year; if he planted, grafted, or sank he has to uproot it.” If one did not uproot, what is with its yield? Rebbi Abba [and] Rebbi Immi<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ševi‘it</i>: Rebbi La. The next sentence shows that this is the correct text.</i> were sitting in Tyre when a case came before them. Rebbi La taught that the fruits should be thrown away. Rebbi Abba said, I was not counted with them on the upper floor. They said, let us go out and study. They went out and heard Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Isaac bar Tevele in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: One does not make a new restriction. Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Isaac bar Tevele in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: One does not add to an established practice.
Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: Since it was stated, “one does not take it as a pledge nor give it as a deposit”, this means that if one transgressed and took it as a pledge, trangressed and gave as a deposit, one fines him for it<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The court will remove pledge or deposit (Maimonides, <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 3:18).</i>.

May brothers who split [an inheritance] weigh one against the other<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">To split the Second Tithe money evenly. The questions are not answered but if the answer to the first question were in the negative, the second question could not have been asked. Therefore, the answer to the first question must be affirmative and by the parallelism of the questions one may infer that the second question also must be answered in the affirmative: Second Tithe money may be weighed for purposes of Second Tithe. {In the Babli, the questions would be put into a lengthy rhetorical frame centered on the expression תמצי לומר אם.}</i>?
We have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It should read תני; תנן is Babylonian Aramaic for a quote from the Mishnah.</i>: “One should not say to his neighbor in Jerusalem, here you have wine, give me its value in oil, here you have oil, give me its value in wine. But he may say to him, here you have wine since you have no wine, here you have oil since you have no oil<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maaser Sheni (Lieberman) 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).1.2">Tosephta 1:2</a>: “How does one not barter?

But he may say to him, here you have wine since <i>I</i> have no <i>oil</i>, <i>and the other one says</i>, here you have oil since <i>I</i> have no <i>wine</i>. It turns out that they exchange but do not barter; they do favors for one another.” With this text, the discussion in the paragraph becomes unnecessary.</i>.” Here you have wine since I have no oil, they wanted to say that this is forbidden. They found stated: “It is permitted.” Is it not forbidden because of barter? Since he cannot enforce it in a court, this is not barter. Why could he have said: Here you have wine since I have no oil? If I had oil, I would give you that also.
“But they may give free gifts to one another.” Our Mishnah is Rebbi Meїr’s since Rebbi Meїr says a gift is not like a sale<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma‘serot</i> 2:1, Note 5.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, here it is everybody’s opinion, following what was stated: A person says to his neighbor [in Jerusalem]: What did you eat today? If that one says summer figs<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Ekhah Rabbati</i> 1, in Jerusalem one always talked in hints.</i>, he knows that it was firstling. Just as summer figs are sold cheaply, so firstlings are sold cheaply<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A first-born animal becomes property of a Cohen. It may not be sold by weight or in a store and the buyers can only be Cohanim unless it is a blemished animal which may not be used as a sacrifice. Therefore, it can only be sold cheaply.</i>. If that one said manna, he knows that it was Second Tithe. Just as manna was given as a gift, so Second Tithe may be given as a gift. They objected: Everybody agrees that animal tithe cannot be sold<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Animal tithe (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:32" href="/Leviticus.27.32"><i>Lev</i>. 27:32</a>) must be eaten as a sacrifice; if without blemish its blood and fat are burned on the altar and the meat may be eaten by any pure person in the holy precinct (i. e., inside the walls of Jerusalem.) The rancher who brings the sacrifice may invite anybody to partake of the meat. Since it is holy it may not be sold; it follows that the meat may be given as a gift. It is impossible to distinguish between Second Tithe and animal tithe in this respect.</i>; do you say it can be given as a gift? This also can be given as a gift. Rebbi Mana did not say so but was following Rebbi Jehudah since Rebbi Jehudah said He made it one’s property<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.2.7.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 2:8</a>, quoted in the next Halakhah, notes that for R. Meїr, Second Tithe is Heaven’s property but for R. Jehudah it is the farmer’s property. Cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:3:24" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.3.24"><i>Demay</i> 1:3, Note 185</a>.</i>. They objected: Everybody agrees that animal tithe is not one’s property<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">By being counted as tenth animal, it becomes automatically dedicated as a sacrifice.</i>; do you say it can be given as a gift?

The animal tithe is the only sacrifice which is totally given to the rancher who brings it. The parts which go onto the altar, blood and fat, are those which may not be eaten even from a profane animal. The Cohanim do not receive any part, neither is any edible part burned on the altar.</i>.
Therefore, once it was slaughtered, is it permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Why does the Mishnah make a difference between unblemished and blemished animal tithe?</i>? It was stated by the House of Rebbi Yannai: There is no difference between alive and slaughtered, unblemished and blemished<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This is also a <i>baraita</i> in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 31b" href="/Bekhorot.31b">Babli <i>Bekhorot</i> 31b</a>.</i>. For what did we state then “live but not slaughtered?” For example, what was stated after this: “One may sell a firstling unblemished alive<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">To a Cohen, and certainly when it was slaughtered and its blood and fat brought to the altar.</i>, blemished alive or slaughtered<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">To a Jew, not necessarily a Cohen. The animal may be sold to a Gentile only slaughtered since it has to be slaughtered ritually.</i>.”
Rebbi Abba bar Jacob in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 32a" href="/Bekhorot.32a">Babli (<i>Bekhorot</i> 32a</a>) this is quoted in the names of R. Joḥanan and Rav and rejected. For Tannaїtic sources, cf. <i>Sifra</i> <i>Beḥuqotay</i> <i>Pereq</i> 13(4), quoted <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 31b" href="/Bekhorot.31b">Babli <i>Bekhorot</i> 31b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Temurah 5b" href="/Temurah.5b"><i>Temurah</i> 5b</a>, 40a.</i>: It is said here (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:33" href="/Leviticus.27.33"><i>Lev</i>. 27:33</a>): “It may not be redeemed.” It has been said about Cohanim‘s bans (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:28" href="/Leviticus.27.28"><i>Lev</i>. 27:28</a>) “It may not be sold or redeemed.” Since “it may not be redeemed” for Cohanim’s bans includes sale, so “it may not be redeemed” here includes sale. Rebbi Jacob the Southerner asked before Rebbi Yose: Is it not written about a firstling (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:17" href="/Numbers.18.17"><i>Num</i>. 18:17</a>) “it should not be redeemed?” About a blemished animal<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:17" href="/Numbers.18.17"><i>Num</i>. 18:17</a> refers only to unblemished animals. No restrictions are put on blemished firstlings other than that they have to be given to a Cohen.</i>. For animal tithe, the Torah made no difference between living and slaughtered, unblemished and blemished.
“One may not use it for preliminarily marrying a woman.” But one may use its sinews, bones, horns, and hooves for preliminary marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This is not mentioned in the Babli or in Maimonides’s Code. The inedible parts of a sacrifice, totally stripped of their meat, are profane after the meal.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar said, because a blessing is mentioned for it<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 12:15" href="/Deuteronomy.12.15"><i>Deut</i>. 12:15</a>: “But for all your desire you may slaughter and eat meat, by the blessing the Eternal, your God, gave you in all your gates; the impure and the pure should eat it, like deer and gazelle.” This deals with dedicated animals which developed a blemish or the blemished animal which became tithe (<i>Sifry Deut</i>. 71). On this, the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 32a" href="/Bekhorot.32a">Babli (<i>Bekhorot</i> 32a</a>) elaborates: “What is the sacrifice in which there is blessing only after slaughter? This is the animal tithe.” As Rashi explains, dedicated sacrifices which developed a blemish may be exchanged and returned to profane status. The blemished firstling may be sold when alive. Only animal tithe remains holy even if blemished until it is ritually slaughtered and used as human food.</i>. Why can one not use its meat for preliminary marriage? Rebbi Yose said, they learned tithe only from Cohanim’s bans. Since one may not use Cohanim’s bans for preliminary marriage, one may not use any sacrifices for preliminary marriage. Then one should not be able to use its sinews, bones, horns, and hooves for preliminary marriage. One needs what Rebbi Eleazar said, because a blessing is mentioned for it.
Rebbi Yudan asked: If somebody said to a woman, draw this animal tithe to you from me<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This is an act of acquisition. But since animal tithe cannot be alienated while alive, the acquisition will be completed only upon ritual slaughter of the animal.</i> and be preliminarily married to me by it after slaughtering<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 2:1:1-9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.2.1.1-9.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 2</a> that conditional betrothals are valid under certain conditions. In this case, one has to assume that either the animal is unblemished and the discussion takes place in the outer courtyard of the Temple or the animal is blemished. In both cases, the animal could be slaughtered immediately and all questions avoided. Therefore, no answer is needed.</i>. Since it is in his hand to slaughter, is she immediately preliminarily married or only after slaughtering?
Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal: If someone steals someone else’s animal tithe, if it still exists he returns it as is, if he ate it, he ate what he ate<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Since the living animal tithe is property of Heaven, he does not have to pay the fines imposed on the thief of private property (cf. <i>Terumot</i> 6, end of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Maaser Sheni 1:3:2-7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maaser_Sheni.1.3.2-7">Halakhah 4</a>).

Rebbi Jehudah said, if in error, the marriage is not valid, if intentional, the marriage is valid.” Rebbi Meїr declares that holiest sacrifices, the Cohen’s share of simple sacrifices, and the Second Tithe are all Heaven’s property offered, as the case may be, to the Cohen, his family, or the layman and his family for consumption in Jerusalem. Hence, for R. Meїr, the basic conditions for a valid marriage are not satisfied.<br>R. Jehudah agrees that under normal circumstances, Second Tithe in Jerusalem cannot be exchanged.

Anything auxiliary to food is considered food.
<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The text is difficult. The parallel in <i>Ševu‘ot</i> is almost unintelligible.

Rebbi Yose said to them, we say after this, “an oath that I shall neither eat nor drink, when he ate and drank he is guilty on two counts.” It is as if somebody had two loaves before him when he said: [I swear] an oath that I shall not eat this one, and then he said: [I swear] an oath that I shall not eat that one, would he not be guilty on two counts?

Similarly, if one illegimately ate and drank heave one should be responsible for two separate fifths. Since in both cases the Mishnah treats eating and drinking together, the verse cannot express a separate status for drinking; the addition of anointing and drinking is rabbinic interpretation but not biblical law and there is no reason to exclude anointing.</i>!

Perfumed wine of Second Tithe may not be used for anointing. Perfumed oil of Second Tithe may be used for anointing. What is the difference? For the latter it is customary, for the former it is not customary.

However, he holds the owner of Second Tithe oil may not ask another person to massage him because the latter’s hand also will be rubbed with oil and this is akin to paying for the massage with Second Tithe oil, a rabbinic transgression.

Rebbi Mana said: Does there exist obfuscation for prohibition? Is bread not like Gentile cooking? So we say: At a place where no Jewish cooking is to be found it is logical that Gentile cooking should be permitted, but they obfuscated the matter and forbade it.

There happened to be produce<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">They obtained <i>ṭevel</i> produce and had to dispose of it according to the rules in the absence of a Temple.</i> for them; they wanted to redeem it in the countryside<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Take it outside the city as <i>ṭevel</i> and redeem the Second Tithe there, which they counld not do in the city.</i>. An old woman<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The mss. read here סבא “an old man” but since the discussion is about the opinions of the old woman, one has to read סבתא here also.

The Babli (<i>Sebaḥim</i> 107b) tentatively disagrees, but then must hold that the enclosure of the Temple domain is merely cosmetic, a position not accepted in other parts of the Babli. The relationship of the positions of RR. Joshua and Eliezer to the problem at hand is tenuous since permanent sanctity is asserted only for the Temple domain on the Temple Mount, not for the rest of Jerusalem. See also the discussion of this problem in the author’s <i>Seder Olam</i> (Northvale NJ, 1998), pp. 257–259.<br>The text here is difficult; as R. M. Margalit points out it would seem that the old woman follows R. Joshua and the rabbis R. Eliezer. But that would put the rabbis on the wrong side of the law, a most unlikely situation. One has to conclude that the reference to a disagreement between RR. Joshua and Eliezer is to some <i>baraita</i> unknown to us.</i>.

But the House of Hillel say, they are similar to chambers; those open to the inside are like inside, those open to the outside like outside.”<br>It is impossible to correct the text by the Tosephta (except for “eat” instead of “slaughter”) since the statement of R. Yose is quoted in a different context at the end of the Halakhah. Also, to extend the prohibition both of eating sacrifices and of redeeming tithe to the entire space would do violence to the text; in that case there would be no difference between being open to the inside or the outside. One must conclude that the place where one restricts to exclude the activities both outside and inside the walls is the place under the wall itself.<br>Maimonides (<i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 2:16) formulates as follows: “Houses by the wall which open inside the wall but extend outside, under the wall and inside it is like inside the city in all respects, but under the wall and outside one does neither eat nor redeem as a restriction. If they were built inside but open to the outside, from the wall to the outside one redeems, to the inside one neither redeems nor eats as a restriction. The thickness of the wall and the loopholes are like the inside.” The last sentence is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 7:12:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.7.12.1">Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i>7:10</a>.</i>: “Oil presses whose doors are open inside but which extend to the outside, under the wall and inside is like inside, under the wall and outside is like outside. One does not slaughter there simple sacrifices as one would inside and one does not redeem Second Tithe as outside. If their doors are open outside but extend to the inside, under the wall and outside is like outside, under the wall and inside, one does not slaughter there simple sacrifices as one would inside and one does not redeem Second Tithe as outside.”

(12) The Cohen should appraise it, whether it is good or bad; the Cohen’s appraisal shall stand.” (27) “If it is an unclean animal, he should redeem it for its appraisal ..” Since an unclean (nonkosher) animal <i>never</i> can be a sacrifice, the “unclean” animal of v. 11 must be a kosher animal with a blemish, which <i>now</i> cannot be a sacrifice. V. 27 therefore details the rules of nonkosher animals dedicated to the Temple. The rabbis hold that the parallel expressions “unclean animal” indicate that the rules of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:11-12" href="/Leviticus.27.11-12">vv. 11–12</a> can be transferred to v. 27 but R. Simeon holds that in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:27" href="/Leviticus.27.27">v. 27</a> no “standing” is mentioned, therefore it is not needed. (Details in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Temurah 32b" href="/Temurah.32b">Babli <i>Temurah</i>32b</a>).<br>The rabbis hold that any dedicated animal which cannot stand before a Cohen cannot be appraised and, therefore, cannot be redeemed. R. Simeon holds that animals which never can be sacrifices, nonkosher animals and kosher wild animals, do not need standing; they can be redeeemed even if dead.</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Does an unclean animal need standing and appraisal? He said to him, if Rebbi Yose had said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan that a pure wild animal does not need standing and appraisal, an unclean animal would not need it. Rebbi Hila said, we have stated thus (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:21" href="/Leviticus.27.21"><i>Lev</i>. 27:21</a>)<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Beḥuqotay Paras̊ah</i> 4(3), a similar text; quoted in Babli <i>Baba Meẓiʻa</i> 54b.</i>: “If an unclean animal, he should redeem it as appraised<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">The verse adds: “He has to add its fifth”.</i>.” Just as an unclean animal is particular in that it is the same at the time of its redemption as at the time of its dedication<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">It could not be a sacrifice in either case; it was alive in both cases.</i>, so I am adding the dead animal which is the same at the time of its redemption as at the time of its dedication, and I exclude the one for which he said, this is dedicated, and then it died, which is not the same at the time of its redemption as at the time of its dedication<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Even according to the Sages, it can be redeemed without standing and appraisal.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, a Mishnah said so<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">This is the operative rule.</i>: “One commits larceny with a donkey and its milk<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meїlah</i> 3:5.

With all that needs redemption one can commit larceny<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">It was not there at the moment of dedication and, being a fluid, it cannot stand.</i>. You cannot explain it as giving the rules of dead [animals] since we stated “a donkey”<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">A live one.</i>. Rebbi Ḥanina said before Rebbi Mana, explain it following Rebbi Simeon since Rebbi Simeon said, dedications for the upkeep of the Temple do not need standing and appraisal. He said to him, if it is following Rebbi Simeon, why a donkey and not any animal<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">It could even have been a blemished kosher animal.</i>?
Rebbi Zeïra said, the Torah said, spend it in the Holy Place and assemble it in the countryside. Just as in the holy place the flask is profane<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Maaser Sheni 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maaser_Sheni.1.2.1">Mishnah 1:4</a>, if wine is bought in Jerusalem with tithe money, the value of the flask does not have to be estimated and an equivalent value eaten in the holiness of tithe. The argument gives the rationale for the first clause of the Mishnah.</i>, in the contryside can the flask be grasped by tithe?
Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, so is the Mishnah: “If before he sealed the top with clay he gave it its name<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">He declared the contents of the flask to be Second Tithe.</i>, tithe did not acquire it; if after he sealed the top with clay he gave it its name, tithe acquired it. If before he sealed the top with clay he gave it its name, one may lift by 101, if after he sealed the top with clay any one sanctifies. If before he sealed the top with clay he gave it its name, he gives heave from one for all, if after he sealed the top with clay he gave it its name, he has to give heave from each single one.”
<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maaser Sheni (Lieberman) 2:18" href="/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).2.18">Tosephta 2:18</a> enumerates fish sauce, vinegar, <i>muries</i>, oil, and (date) honey. Fish sauce and <i>muries</i> cannot be subject to tithe. Maimonides in his Code (<i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i>8:5) copies the entire list. In both mss. and the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Tosephta, “tithe acquired it”; but Maimonides (<i>loc. cit.</i>) copies “tithe did not acquire it.” It is impossible to determine whether or not the Tosephta is corrupt in this passage.</i> When has this been said? For wine; but for oil, whether he closed the top with clay or did not close the top with clay, tithe did not acquire it. Whether he closed the top with clay or did not close the top with clay, he may lift by 101. Whether he closed the top with clay or did not close the top with clay, he gives heave from one for all.
Rebbi Ḥananiah said, it is difficult about the House of Shammai! What is the difference between this and five sacks on a threshing floor? For five [separate] sacks on one threshing floor, can one not give heave and tithe from one for the other?
Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, it refers back to the first [part]. Rebbi Ba said, to the second<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody agrees that Mishnah 14 refers to Mishnah 13. The question is only, does it refer to the first part, do the House of Shammai oppose the statement that a prior declaration leaves the flask as tithe money unless the wine was entirely put in order in the vat, or does it refer to the second part, that the wine was poured without any specification.</i>.
“If he said, a <i>quartarius</i> of profane is in this barrel, the barrel is profane<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">A similar statement is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maaser Sheni (Lieberman) 2:18" href="/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).2.18">Tosephta 2:18</a>: “When was it said that [the flask] became tithe money?

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody transports Second Tithe produce,” etc. Rebbi Mana said, they said only “if somebody transports”; therefore originally it is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">. If people were encouraged to transport heave from place to place (except on the way to Jerusalem), the Mishnah would have been formulated: מוליכין פירות “One transports produce”. The formulation: If somebody does it, then … is only used for actions which are disapproved of but which are not actually forbidden.</i>. This is about Second Tithe produce, but for produce which is <i>ṭevel</i> for Second Tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Produce for which heave and First Tithe had already been given.</i> it is originally permitted, following this: Rebbi had produce here and in Batanaia<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Ma‘serot</i> 4, Note 82.</i>; he fixed the tithes of here there and redeemed them according to the going price there.

We understand “expensive and became cheap<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since in this case, the price of redemption is the actual price at the time of redemption.</i>”. “Cheap and became more expensive”?

If you say, because it may not be returned to its place, did it not increase in value? If you say, because it always may be sold cheaply also in this case it can be sold cheaply.

But we have to hold that he said to him, redeem for me of your property, or redeem for yourself of my property. We have stated thus: “Redeem for me of your property, or redeem for yourself of my property, he does not add a fifth.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, for any tithe, where neither it nor its redemption money is his, he does not have to add a fifth.

It was stated: Rebbi says, the House of Shammai said this only for the Sabbatical year, but in all other years of the Sabbatical cycle, the House of Shammai say that it is subject to a fifth and subject to removal. According to that Tanna, they learned the rules of the fourth-year orchard only from Second Tithe; since you say that there is no Second Tithe in the Sabbatical year, so there is no fourth-year orchard in the Sabbatical year. But then should there be no holiness in it? Its holiness comes from the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:24" href="/Leviticus.19.24"><i>Lev</i>. 19:24</a>): “Holy for praises,” it has the status of those holy fruits over which praises are said. And should it be permitted to the fresh mourner? It is stated: This implies that it is forbidden to the fresh mourner. And should it be subject to removal? Following Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon frees it from removal. And should it be redeemed while still connected to the ground?
Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel stated: Both in the Sabbatical year and in the rest of the years of the Sabbatical cycle, the House of Shammai say, there is no fifth and no removal. According to that Tanna, they did not at all learn the rules of the fourth-year orchard from Second Tithe. But then should there be no holiness in it? Its holiness comes from the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:24" href="/Leviticus.19.24"><i>Lev</i>. 19:24</a>): “Holy for praises;” it has the status of those holy fruits over which praises are said. And should it be permitted to the fresh mourner? It is stated: This implies that it is forbidden to the fresh mourner. And should it be subject to removal? Following Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon frees it from removal. And should it be redeemed while still connected to the ground?
Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Abbahu: From where that it needs redemption? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:24" href="/Leviticus.19.24"><i>Lev</i>. 19:24</a>) “Holy for praises,” holy for redemption. The rabbis never refrain from explaining ה by ח.
Rebbi Ayvu bar Naggari stated before Rebbi La following Rebbi Ismael (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:31" href="/Leviticus.27.31"><i>Lev</i>. 27:31</a>): “If a man redeems part of his tithes, he should add their fifth to it.” That excludes the fourth-year orchard; one is not obligated by it for a fifth. Then he turned around and stated: There are two terms of redemption, one for the Second Tithe and one for the fourth-year orchard.
There we have stated: Rebbi Jehudah says, there is no vineyard in the fourth year for the Gentile, but the Sages say there is. Rebbi Eleazar said, so says the Mishnah: There is never a vineyard in the fourth year for the Gentile. Rebbi Bibi said before Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: According to the opinion of Rebbi, the statement of Rebbi Jehudah turns out to be like the statement of the House of Shammai. Since the House of Shammai said that they learned the rules of the vineyard of the fourth year only from Second Tithe; since you say that there is no Second Tithe in the Sabbatical year, so there is no fourth-year orchard in the Sabbatical year. Similarly, Rebbi Jehudah said that they learned the rules of the vineyard of the fourth year only from Second Tithe; since you say that there is no Second Tithe in Syria, so there is no fourth-year orchard in Syria. He said to him, look what he said! He said only, it is not subject to a fifth and is not subject to removal, hence, it is subject to all other rules; Rebbi Jehudah says, there is no vineyard in the fourth year for the Gentile in Syria.
Samuel bar Abba asked: Since the House of Shammai said that they learned the rules of the vineyard of the fourth year only from Second Tithe; since you say that there is no Second Tithe in the Sabbatical year, there is no fourth-year orchard in the Sabbatical year. Similarly, in the third and sixth years of the Sabbatical cycle, since there is no Second Tithe, there should not be any fourth-year orchard. Rebbi Yose said, even though there is no Second Tithe in the third and sixth years, there are the tithes. In the Sabbatical year, there are no tithes at all.
Ḥeipha asked: Since Rebbi Jehudah said that they learned the rules of the vineyard of the fourth year only from Second Tithe; since you say that there is no Second Tithe in Syria, there is no fourth-year orchard in Syria. Similarly, they learned the rules of the heave of the thanksgiving sacrifice only from the heave of the tithe; since you say that there was no heave of the tithe in the desert, will it follow that there was no heave of the thanksgiving sacrifice in the desert? Rebbi Yose said, they learned from it only in regard to quantities.
It was stated: Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah said, Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon said, Israel did become obligated for the fourth-year orchard only after 14 years, seven during which they conquered and seven during which they divided up the land. Rav Ḥisda said, it turns out that the argument of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah is identical with that of his father Rebbi Jehudah. Just as Rebbi Jehudah said that they learned the rules of the fourth-year orchard only from Second Tithe, since you say that there is no Second Tithe in Syria, so there is no fourth-year orchard in Syria. Similarly, Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah said that they learned the rules of the fourth-year orchard only from Second Tithe, since you say that they did become obligated for the fourth-year orchard only after 14 years,, similarly there was no fourth-year orchard until after 14 years. Rebbi Yose said, he follows his son’s argument; Syria was inferred from “after 14 years;” “after 14 years” was not inferred from Syria.
It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:25" href="/Leviticus.19.25"><i>Lev</i>. 19:25</a>): “In the fifth year, you shall eat its yield to add for you, etc.” Rebbi Yose the Galilean says, here one adds the fruits of the fifth to the fruits of the fourth year. Just as the fruits of the fifth year are for the proprietors, so the fruits of the fourth year are for the proprietors. Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Yasa, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It turns out that Rebbi Yose the Galilean argues like Rebbi Jehudah. Just as Rebbi Jehudah makes it his property, so Rebbi Yose the Galilean makes it his property.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: According to those who declare it his property, should it not be subject to tithes? He said to him, according to what Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, as Rebbi Abin said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, not only this practice, but in any practical question which is weak in court and you do not know how to decide, go out and see how the public acts, and act accordingly. And we see that they do not give. Rebbi Mana said, that is, if the practice would follow the House of Shammai. But is there any public that acts according to the House of Shammai? Rebbi Abin said, they learned the rules of the vineyard of the fourth year only from Second Tithe; just as you say that Second Tithe is not subject to tithes, so the yield of the fourth year is not subject to tithes.
Rebbi Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: A dough of Second Tithe in Jerusalem, following Rebbi Meïr, is free from <i>ḥallah</i>, following Rebbi Jehudah it is subject to <i>ḥallah</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, they said this only for Jerusalem, but not for the countryside.
Rebbi Abba bar Cohen asked before Rebbi Yose: Does he who declares it obligated for single berries also declare it obligated for <i>ḥallah</i>? He said to him, is that not Rebbi Jehudah? And it is our opinion that in all this practice, Rebbi Jehudah follows the House of Shammai.

“In that year” you take it out from impure for pure but in other years you do not take it out from impure for pure.

Since Second Tithe, as long as it is not redeemed, has to be kept in purity (for consumption in Jerusalem), it follows that First Tithe also, which is to be given to the Levites, has to be kept in purity in these years. But this implies that in other years it may be left to become impure (alter heave was taken). This is taken to mean that in other years it should not be given to the Cohen together with the heave.</i>” This statement of Rebbi Eleazar follows the opinion that one does not give tithe to Cohanim.

The second argument notes that the verse declares tithes to follow the laws of inheritance. If somebody in his will gives some special part to a son before the general distribution, that son is not excluded from taking part in the division of the inheritance. Therefore, the fact that the Cohanim got heave and the heave of the tithe does not exclude them from the ranks of “descendants of Levi”.

The other said, even if it were only written “to the descendants” one would give tithes to Cohanim. If somebody would say, my son X shall take property Y [before distribution] and the rest of my properties my sons shall inherit, does he not participate with them?

One says, he who may take may acquire; the other says, he who may give may acquire. He who says “he who may take” certainly includes him who may give. He who says “he who may give,” excludes him who may take.
The following Mishnah disagrees with him who says that he who may take may acquire, since we have stated: “Give this divorce document to my wife,” because he may receive the divorce document of his minor daughter. “And the document of manumission to my slave,” since he may receive his own document of manumission. But did we not state: “Receive this divorce document for my wife or bring this divorce document to my wife; if he wants to change his mind … he may do so.” Is a slave empowered to bring a divorce document? Explain it by different cases contained in the Mishnah.
A Mishnah disagrees with him who says that he who may take may acquire, since we have stated there: “One tithe that I will measure in the future is given to Aqiba ben Joseph that he should let the poor acquire it, and its place is rented to him.” But is Rebbi Aqiba entitled to take? Explain it, before he got rich. And even if you say, after he became rich, when he was an administrator, and the hand of the administrator is equal to the hand of the poor.
The word of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi is that he who may take may acquire, since Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: They disagree about a rich owner. But in the case of a poor owner, since he has the right to take it, the other person acquired it.
