Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish in the name of Rebbi Ismael. Rebbi Mana said, I went to Caesarea and heard Rebbi Aḥava ben Rebbi Zeïra<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The son of R.

Since bread mentioned in a discussion of Passover is something that can be either <i>maẓẓah</i> or leavened, bread mentioned for <i>ḥallah</i> must be something that can be either <i>maẓẓah</i> or leavened. They checked and found that only the five kinds can be either <i>maẓẓah</i> or leavened; all others cannot be <i>maẓẓah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rice cakes, while unleavened, cannot be called <i>maẓẓah</i> since rice bread (not containing gluten) does not qualify as leavened bread.

It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Challah (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Challah_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 2:17" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).2.17">Tosephta <i>Pesaḥim</i> 2:17</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 35a" href="/Pesachim.35a">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 35a</a>.</i>: “Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said, <i>qeramit</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 33" href="/Pesachim.33">Geonim (<i>Oẓar Hageonim Pesaḥim</i> p. 33</a>) a grain growing wild among reeds in swamps, used as human food in times of famine.

Latin <i>gramen, -inis</i>, n. “grass, dog’s grass” (<i>Plin. Hist. Nat</i>. 24,19,118, #178) (E.

They disagree about the outcome of the checking. Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said, they checked and found it can be either <i>maẓẓah</i> or leavened, but the rabbis say, they checked and did not find that it can be either <i>maẓẓah</i> or leavened.
There<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumot</i> 10:2. The paragraph is explained there, Notes 15–19.</i>, we have stated: “If a mashed apple is added to dough which soured, [the dough] is forbidden” It was stated: Rebbi Yose says, it is permitted. Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: They disagree when it becomes sour from the juice [of the apple]. But if it becomes sour from its solid substance it is permitted according to everybody. Rebbi Yose stays with his opinion; just as he says there, its cooking is not clearly cooking, so he says here, its souring is not clearly souring.
And just as you say only the five kinds can become <i>maẓẓah</i> and leavened, so only wheat and barley can be dragged with anything<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">They can be dragged to be subject to <i>ḥallah</i> even if only a small part of the dough is grain and the rest is filler. The reference is either to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 3:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.3.5.1">Mishnah 3:6</a> or <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Challah (Lieberman) 2:1" href="/Tosefta_Challah_(Lieberman).2.1">Tosephta 2:1</a>, a cake made from rice and wheat is subject to <i>ḥallah</i> if it tastes like bread. The question is whether “wheat” stands for any grain or only for wheat itself and the grains closely related to it.</i>. Rebbi Hila said in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, we have only stated: “He who makes dough from wheat and rice;” only wheat can be dragged in.
Is one guilty because of new grain<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">New grain is forbidden until the sheaf of barley is brought to the Temple on Passover; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:9-14" href="/Leviticus.23.9-14"><i>Lev</i>. 23:9–14</a>. It is stated here that the definition of “bread” established for Passover and <i>ḥallah</i> is valid for the prohibition of new grain also.</i> when it is roasted? Rebbi Zeïra said, it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:14" href="/Leviticus.23.14"><i>Lev</i>. 23:14</a>): “Bread, parched or fresh grain you should not eat.” Anything for whose bread you would be guilty because of new grain you are guilty for parched grain because of new grain; but anything for whose bread you would not be guilty because of new grain you are not guilty for parched grain because of new grain.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked before Rebbi Zeïra: One mixed four <i>qab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.2.3.1">Mishnah 2:6</a> states that dough made from <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup>/<sub>4</sub> <i>qab</i> of flour is subject to <i>ḥallah</i>, it is clear that one has to read here “quarter <i>qab</i>” instead of <i>qab</i>.

Rebbi Jonah parallels Rebbi Jeremiah, just as Rebbi Jeremiah says, only if it is called bread, so Rebbi Jonah says, only if it is called bread<sup class="footnote-marker">15,</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text <i>Sifry Num</i>. 110.

R. Zeïra in that Halakhah is quoted as stating that R. Hila got the names of the Tannaïm wrong in his <i>baraita</i>.</i> even though he disagrees with him.
Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥman understood it from the following verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 28:25" href="/Isaiah.28.25"><i>Is</i>. 28:25</a>): “He puts wheat, <i>śorāh</i>, barley; <i>nismān</i> and spelt are its limit.” “He puts wheat”, that is wheat<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbinic equivalents to the biblical Hebrew names are given for all five kinds.</i>. “<i>Śorāh</i>” is foxtail and why is it called <i>śorāh</i>? Because it is made in a line<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The expression חטה שׂוֹרה probably means “ripe wheat”, cf. Accadic <i>šer‘u</i> “ripe grain”. All expressions are explained here as names of grains. The interpretation of שׂורה as שׁורה shows that in Talmudic times in Galilee, <i>š</i> was heard as <i>s</i>, under the influence of Greek. Cassuto in his biblical commentary accepts the interpretation as genuine.</i>. “Barley”, that is barley. “<i>Nismān</i>” is oats. “Spelt” is spelt. “Its limit”, bread: So far the definitions of bread. Does one infer anything from tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The common name for Prophets and Hagiographs.

Rebbi Simon said, since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 28:26" href="/Isaiah.28.26"><i>Is</i>. 28:26</a>): “He instructs in the law, his God will teach him,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation, in contrast to that of the next paragraph, follows the masoretic division of the text.</i>” it is as if it were a word of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">But the next paragraph immediately contradicts this statement; there is no source of biblical law other than the Torah. {Prophets and Hagiographs are used as basis for rabbinic decrees.}</i>.
Rebbi Simon said, those women who say: we shall not send our sons to the communal school; if he is good at learning he will learn [by himself]; they do not act well, but (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 28:29" href="/Isaiah.28.29"><i>Is</i>. 28:29</a>): “He shall be instructed in his God’s law, it will teach him.”
Rebbi Jehudah bar Pazi in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: This<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah which forbids harvesting any of the five kinds of grain before the <i>‘omer</i>. The statement of R. Ismael ben R. Joḥanan ben Beroqa is in <i>Sifra Wayiqra Paršata</i> 13(5). The problem is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 2:14-16" href="/Leviticus.2.14-16"><i>Lev</i>. 2:14–16</a>, speaking of the cereal offering of first fruits. The verse cannot speak of individual first fruits (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:1-11" href="/Deuteronomy.26.1-11"><i>Deut</i>. 26:1–11</a>) since no cereal offering is connected with these. For any other cereal offering, the flour is specified. It is always wheat except for the <i>‘omer</i> sheaf (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:9-14" href="/Leviticus.23.9-14"><i>Lev</i>. 23:9–14</a>) and the offering for the wife suspected of infidelity (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:15" href="/Numbers.5.15"><i>Num</i>. 5:15</a>). <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 2:14" href="/Leviticus.2.14"><i>Lev</i>. 2:14</a> does not specify the kind of cereal for the offering. The cereal offering of first fruits is identified as the <i>‘omer</i> offering; this determines the flour as barley flour.</i> is from Rebbi Ismael the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa, as Rebbi Joḥanan stated; “Rebbi Ismael the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa said, I could think you could bring spelt, foxtail and oats. But is it not logical: If wheat which is usable for all other cereal offerings is not acceptable for the <i>‘omer</i> offering, spelt, foxtail and oats which are not usable for any other cereal offerings certainly are not acceptable for the <i>‘omer</i> offering. No; you might say about barley from which the offering of the straying wife<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sifra</i>, the second argument also refers to the <i>‘omer</i>.</i> is brought; what can you say about spelt, foxtail and oats which are not usable for the offering of the straying wife? Wheat is excluded by the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The nature of the grain cut for the <i>‘omer</i> is not specified in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:9-14" href="/Leviticus.23.9-14"><i>Lev</i>. 23:9–14</a>. But since the “new grain” for the cereal offering of the 50<sup>th</sup> day is specified as fine wheat flour, the earlier offering cannot possibly be wheat.</i>; spelt, foxtail and oats are excluded by a reasoning <i>a minore ad majus</i>.”
Rebbi Yose said, who would think that Rebbi Jehudah ben Pazi could think that the cereal offering of the <i>‘omer</i> could come from spelt, foxtail, or oats? If somebody said, black figs are [forbidden] to me, is he not permitted white ones? But “black ones” he said, “white ones” he did not say. And here, “milky white barley” was said<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 9:31" href="/Exodus.9.31"><i>Ex</i>. 9:31</a>. The first-grain cereal offering is described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 2:14" href="/Leviticus.2.14"><i>Lev</i>. 2:14</a> as “milky white, parched in fire.” The argument shows that the Mishnah can be the opinion of everybody. A similar argument is attributed in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 68b" href="/Menachot.68b">Babli, <i>Menaḥot</i> 68b</a>, to R. Eliezer.</i>, “milky white foxtail” was not said.
But for the rabbis they are three kinds! Oats are a kind of spelt, foxtail are a kind of barley<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.1.1">Mishnah <i>Kilaim</i> 1:1</a>, oats and spelt, barley and foxtail, are described as “not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other.” Therefore, they must be counted as one botanical species.</i>. The rabbis of Caesarea asked: Did we ever state: Five species? No, five kinds. Two times two kinds are one species.

Wheat does not go together with anything but spelt. Barley goes together with everything except wheat.” Rebbi Yose said it without attribution, Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: “There if it bites<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">If different doughs are placed together so they touch one another and, if separated again, small parts of one dough will cling to the other. Then all pieces together form one dough for <i>ḥallah</i> if made from compatible flours.</i>, here if it was mixed<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If there is only one dough made from mixed flour, it is subject to <i>ḥallah</i> as if it were of homogeneous flour.</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: All those which he mixed as grains, flour, or dough, go together.” If he mixed the ends of doughs together? Rebbi Yose said, is biting not like mixing together? You say they do not go together, so here they do not go together<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Since biting is a weak form of mixing, the rule of the Mishnah here applies only if the entire doughs are mixed, following R.

However, since leftover meat already is forbidden in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:17-18" href="/Leviticus.7.17-18"><i>Lev</i>. 7:17–18</a>, פגול is defined as meat from sacrifices which were slaughtered with the intention of eating them outside the holy precinct. Similarly, “leftover” does not really denote leftover meat but meat from sacrifices slaughtered with the intention of eating them after the allotted time. Eating פיגול is a deadly sin, eating leftover meat a sin, and both invalidate the sacrifice. If the sacrifice was slaughtered correctly, then an accidental leftover or piece outside the precinct is still forbidden but does not invalidate the sacrifice.</i> and leftover [sacrificial meat], Rebbi Joḥanan said they do not cancel one another, but Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said they do cancel one another<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody makes chopped meat out of <i>piggul</i> and leftover in approximately equal amounts and then eats the volume of an olive of the mixture, for R. Joḥanan he ate a punishable amount of forbidden meat and committed a crime. For R. Simeon ben Laqish, he ate less than an olive-sized piece of either <i>piggul</i> or leftover and cannot be punished for either one.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, the cases are not similar<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible that R. Joḥanan agrees with R. Simeon ben Laqish about <i>ḥallah</i>.</i>. There, one says this is forbidden and that is forbidden. But here, two kinds are more than the third and cancel it; they cancelled it before it became forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Eating from dry flour is not forbidden. The prohibition comes only with the obligation of <i>ḥallah</i>, with the production of dough ready to be baked. Therefore, the case here involves no competition of laws. However, if the dough is large enough that one single kind already would induce the obligation of <i>ḥallah</i>, then everybody agrees that eating the bread without taking <i>ḥallah</i> is a criminal act.</i>. If one made five doughs<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Each one large enough to induce the obligation of <i>ḥallah</i>.</i> from five different kinds and then mixed them, if Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish would say that one cannot whip because of their <i>ḥallah</i> as a biblical law, then the argument would be correct.

If the barley cut for the Temple became impure before presentation, it cannot be used and its cutting retroactively is invalid. {While the barley and its flour never became wetted, putting the flour in a Temple vessel prepares it for impurity.}</i>, cutting permits to cut.

Rebbi Jonah said, before presentation. Rebbi Yose said, before cutting.

But the expression “milky white” specifies which plants are sufficiently ripened to be candidates for cutting. Therefore, the verse must speak of the time of cutting.</i>?

Chapter 2



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Foreign produce imported into the Land is obligated for <i>ḥallah</i>. If it was exported, Rebbi Eliezer declares it obligated but Rebbi Aqiba declares it free. [Growth of] earth from outside the Land which came to the Land in a ship is under the obligation of tithes and Sabbatical. Rebbi Jehudah said, when is this? When the ship touches the ground. Dough kneaded with fruit juice is subject to hallah which can be eaten with unclean hands<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Pure fruit juice, without addition of water, does not make food susceptible to impurity (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1"><i>Demay</i> 2, Notes 136-137</a>.) Therefore, <i>hallah</i> from such a dough cannot become impure and may be eaten by a pure Cohen without washing of his hands (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 8:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.8.2.2"><i>Berakhot</i> 8, Note 46</a>)</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Foreign produce,” etc. It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:17" href="/Numbers.15.17"><i>Num</i>. 15:17</a>) “To the Land into which I am bringing you.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“When you come into the Land into which I am bringing you, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:18" href="/Numbers.15.18">v. 18</a>) it shall be that on the occasion of your eating from the bread of the Land you shall lift a heave for the Eternal.”</i>” There you are obligated, you are not obligated outside the Land. It was stated: These are the words of Rebbi Meïr. But the words of Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Who is a better authority than R. Meïr. The same statement in <i>Sifry Num</i>. 110. In <i>Ma‘serot</i> 5:4 (Note 83), R. Jehudah’s interpretation of the position of R. Aqiba is presented as genuine.</i> are: Foreign produce imported into the Land, Rebbi Eliezer declares it free but Rebbi Aqiba declares it obligated. What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:18" href="/Numbers.15.18"><i>Num</i>. 15:18</a>) “From the Land’s bread,” not foreign bread. What is the reason of Rebbi Aqiba?

How does Rebbi Eliezer explain the reason of Rebbi Aqiba, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:17" href="/Numbers.15.17"><i>Num</i>. 15:17</a>) “To the Land into which I am bringing you?” The colleagues in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: So did Rebbi Aqiba object to Rebbi Eliezer: Do you not agree that when Israel entered the Land and found there coarse and fine flour<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simson and R. Solomon ben Adrat read: “(coarse) flour and doughs”. This is from a textual tradition different from our mss.; it is very likely a late change since (a) in talmudic Hebrew, קמח means only “coarse flour”; the re-emergence of the biblical meaning “flour” (irrespective of quality) is definitely Medieval rabbinic; (b) only R. Aqiba (later in this Halakhah and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 3:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.3.4.1">Mishnah 3:5</a>) moves the obligation of ḥallah from kneading the dough to baking it. It is unreasonable to expect R. Eliezer to accept this position.</i> that this was subject to <i>ḥallah</i>? Did it not grow while exempt? He accepted that<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As seen later, without giving up his interpretation of the verses for current practice.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, I am wondering how could Rebbi Aqiba object to Rebbi Eliezer and how could the latter accept it? There, before they entered they had inherited it retroactively, as Rebbi Huna said in the name of Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥman: It is not written “to your posterity I shall give” but (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 15:18" href="/Genesis.15.18"><i>Gen</i>. 15:18</a>): “to your posterity I gave”, I already gave it.
How does Rebbi Aqiba explain the reason of Rebbi Eliezer, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:18" href="/Numbers.15.18"><i>Num</i>. 15:18</a>) “From the Land’s bread?” About a ship which entered the Land. If it made a crust in the oven inside the line<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The imaginary line drawn from the Northernmost point on the coast of the Biblical Land of Israel to the Southernmost, which defines the territorial waters of the Land according to the majority opinion; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 6:1:22" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.6.1.22"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 6:2, Notes 92–94</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 4:4:6-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.4.4.6-8"><i>Ḥallah</i> 4:8</a>.

In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba, the same rule applies to a ship, Gentile’s dough<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Which is exempt if baked by a Gentile, obligated if baked by a Jew.</i>, and their entry; everything depends on forming the crust in the oven. The Sages agree with Rebbi Aqiba when it enters the Land that everything depends on forming the crust in the oven. This is implied by what Rebbi Aqiba objected to Rebbi Eliezer and the latter accepted it.
Rebbi Jonah asked before Rebbi Jeremiah: When Israel entered the Land and found there green grain standing, would that have been forbidden as new<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Before the ‘<i>omer</i>, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 1:1:18" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.1.1.18">Chapter 1, Notes 3–5</a>.</i>? He said to him, why not? So far green, even dry? He said to him, even dry, even cut. Then even grain in storage! So I am saying, Israel should not have eaten <i>maẓẓot</i> in the Passover nights<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">But they observed <i>Pesaḥ</i> on the 14th (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 5:10" href="/Joshua.5.10"><i>Jos</i>. 5:10</a>); how could they have fulfilled the commandment to eat the meat “with <i>maẓẓot</i> and bitter herbs” when all grain was forbidden as new since the preceding year there could not have been any ‘<i>omer</i> and, according to the argument of the preceding paragraph, the laws were applicable retroactively?</i>! Rebbi Jonah said, after I left there, I wondered that I did not say to him, it is different because a positive commandment overrides a prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is the position accepted everywhere in the Babli where, however, the principle is severely restricted (<i>Yebamot</i> 3b/4a).</i>. In the opinion of Rebbi Jonah who said, a positive commandment overrides a prohibition even if it is not written next to it, it is understood. But according to Rebbi Yose who said, a positive commandment overrides a prohibition only if it is written next to it<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The disagreement between Rebbis Jonah and Yose is also discussed <i>Yom</i> <i>Ṭov</i> 1:3 (fol. 60b, bottom) and commented upon by <i>Or Zarua</i>‘ vol. 2, #234.

“If it was exported<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Outside the Land of Israel.</i>, Rebbi Eliezer declares it obligated but Rebbi Aqiba declares it free.” They said, Rebbi Eliezer [is explained] from his quote, Rebbi Aqiba from his quote. Rebbi Eliezer from his quote; what is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:18" href="/Numbers.15.18"><i>Num</i>. 15:18</a>) “From the Land’s bread,” wherever it may be. Rebbi Aqiba from his quote; What is the reason of Rebbi Aqiba?

The rabbis of Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: The disagreement: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 11:24" href="/Deuteronomy.11.24"><i>Deut</i>. 11:24</a>) “Any place<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In the masoretic text: כל המקום. כל מקום is in the parallel <a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 1:3" href="/Joshua.1.3"><i>Jos</i>. 1:3</a> which cannot be the verse quoted here.</i> your foot will tread on shall be yours,” the general statement contains only the detail<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The full verse reads: Any place your foot will tread on shall be yours, from the prairie and the Lebanon, from the river Euphrates to the Western Sea shall be your border region.

Rebbi Yose said, the statement is reasonable on Sabbath eves; since everybody is bringing, it is as if she separated from what is obligated for what is obligated.

Rebbi Jonah said, it is only reasonable on weekdays, but on Sabbath eve she would have to say “all, including the impure.” Why?

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Even if the Jew’s was a full measure, can it not be considered like a <i>qab</i> here, a <i>qab</i> there, and a Gentile’s <i>qab</i> in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Why should the dough of a Jew made in partnership with a Gentile ever be subject to <i>ḥallah</i>?

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody makes dough from wheat and rice, if it has the taste of flour it is subject to <i>ḥallah</i> and a person may satisfy his Passover obligation with it. If it does not have the taste of flour it is not subject to <i>ḥallah</i> and a person may not satisfy his Passover obligation with it.<br>If somebody takes sourdough from a dough from which no <i>ḥallah</i> was taken and adds it to dough from which <i>ḥallah</i> was taken<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">This is now <i>ṭevel</i> for <i>ḥallah</i> but most of it is exempt from <i>ḥallah</i>.</i>, if he can provide for it from another place<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">From a third dough which is obligated for <i>ḥallah.</i> Since <i>ḥallah</i> as a heave must be given from what is earmarked, the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Challah (Lieberman) 2:2" href="/Tosefta_Challah_(Lieberman).2.2">Tosephta (2:2</a>) requires that one make a <i>new</i> dough and put it in the same place as the problematic <i>ṭevel</i> dough to earmark it and take there the full <i>ḥallah</i> for the new dough and a proportionate amount for the offending sourdough. Maimonides in his Commentary follows the Tosephta but in his Code (<i>Bikkurim</i> 7:11) he requires simply that the second dough be subject to <i>ḥallah</i>.

Even though in general it is forbidden to give heave from what already is freed from the obligation, it is stated in the next Mishnah that the dough in question is only rabbinically <i>ṭevel</i>; for biblical standards the sourdough has disappeared in the dough whose obligation was already satisfied. Therefore, the <i>ṭevel</i> extended to the entire dough is rabbinic in character and the rabbinic obligation of <i>ḥallah</i> overrides the, in this case rabbinic, requirement to give from obligated dough.</i>.

In its own kind; not in its own kind if it can be tasted.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> The Mishnah follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel since<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Challah (Lieberman) 2:1" href="/Tosefta_Challah_(Lieberman).2.1">Tosephta 2:1</a>. Since, in general, “imparting taste” needs only minute quantities (as discussed in <i>Terumot</i> 10), it is stated here that in the Mishnah a substantial amount is needed and “having the taste” does not mean “it tastes like rice cake but an admixture of wheat is noticeable” but “it actually tastes like wheat bread.” Since Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel is the only author reported to have quantified this statement, we have to follow him.</i> “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says it is never obligated unless it contain the measure of grain.” Rebbi Jacob bar Idi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Practice follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. Rebbi Hila said, both following the rabbis here or the rabbis there, they say not unless the greater part be grain and the taste that of grain. Rav Huna said, the taste of grain even if the greater part is not grain. A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rav Huna: If he mixed other kinds in, not unless the greater part be grain and the taste that of grain. He explains it for other kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Other than rice and millet which substitute for grain.</i>. A Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 3:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.3.5.1">Mishnah 3:8</a>.</i> disagrees with Rebbi Hila: “If somebody takes sourdough from grain dough and adds it to a rice dough, if it imparts the taste of grain<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Sourdough is used in small quantities.</i> it is subject to <i>ḥallah,</i> otherwise it is exempt.” Because it was stated after that<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The problem addressed is that of active sourdough taken from dough subject to <i>ḥallah</i> but of which <i>ḥallah</i> was not yet taken. That sourdough is <i>ṭevel</i> for <i>ḥallah</i> and subject to more restrictive rules. In this case, “can be tasted” means the minute amounts discussed in <i>Terumot</i> 10, Halakhot 7–10; the quote is irrelevant for the discussion here.</i>: “<i>Ṭevel</i> is forbidden in the most minute amount in its own kind. Not in its own kind if it can be tasted.”
Rebbi Yose was supporting Rebbi Zeïra. He heard the voice of Rebbi Hila who was sitting and stating: Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: the taste of grain even if the greater part is not grain; Rebbi Assi in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The greater part grain and the taste that of grain. He said, he got it wrong: we had a note that Rebbi Assi teaches like Rav Huna.
Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rome ms. “R. Yose ben Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya”; this is unlikely to be correct.</i> asked before Rebbi Zeïra: If a cereal offering was mixed with profane flour, may [the Cohen] take a fistful and permit the remainder to be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">On the face of it, it would seem that the question does not even start since if the two kinds of flour are mixed it seems impossible to take out a fistful of the offering and burn it on the altar since it is forbidden to burn profane material on the altar. On the other hand, the remainder may be eaten only after the fistful was brought to the altar (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:9" href="/Leviticus.6.9"><i>Lev</i>. 6:9</a>). Even the explanation by R. H. Kanievski, that at some place the original offering is still recognizable, does not work since the fistful may be taken only out of the Temple vessel in which the offering was dedicated. One must conclude that the question of practical use is considered a technicality which can be left to the Sages at the time of the Messiah.<br>Since flour offerings before the lifting of the fistful are forbidden to everybody, Cohen and layman, it is reasonable to compare the laws of these offerings to those of <i>ṭevel</i>,</i>? Do I read for this (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 2:3" href="/Leviticus.2.3"><i>Lev</i>. 2:3</a>): “The remainder of the offering is for Aaron and his sons?” He said to him: If <i>ṭevel</i> was mixed with profane, do I read (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:28" href="/Numbers.18.28"><i>Num</i>. 18:28</a>) “you shall give <i>from it</i> the Eternal’s heave to Aaron the Cohen”<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 7 states clearly that in absence of other produce, the <i>ṭevel</i> mixed with profane flour can be put in order by taking the heave <i>from itself.</i></i>? He answered him, did I say to you that he cannot take from itself for itself and not from it for another place? If it is clear to you that he cannot take from it for another place<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Nobody accepts that <i>ṭevel</i> mixed with profane can be used to put certain <i>ṭevel</i> in order!</i> then even from itself for itself he should not be able to take! The Mishnah said that he can take from itself for itself as we have stated: “Otherwise he should take <i>ḥallah</i> for everything”.
They said, Rebbi Zeïra’s is no answer to Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya’s question. What is the difference between him who takes from itself for itself and him who takes from it for another place? When he takes from itself for itself, since this <i>ṭevel</i> is not qualified to become heave for anything similar, the profane admixture makes it disappear<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the Mishnah, if the amount of <i>ṭevel</i> in the profane is small, it has disappeared by biblical standards and it is not legally <i>ṭevel.</i> In this case, <i>ṭevel</i> and profane, even if consisting of similar material, are considered two distinct kinds and the rules of annulment apply. The requirement to give heave from the entire heap is purely rabbinical; any reference to a biblical source is inappropriate.</i>. When he takes from it for another place since this <i>ṭevel</i> is qualified to become profane for something similar, it cannot disappear<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, the <i>ṭevel</i> is genuine; part of it is destined to become heave. If a minute amount of it fell into heave, it would fall into its own kind and could not disappear.<br>In the Genizah fragment, the cases have been telescoped into one: בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁהוּא מוֹצִיא מִמֶּנּוּ עָלָיו הוֹאִיל וְאוֹתוֹ הַטֵּבֵל רָאוּי לְהֵעָשׂוֹת חוּלִין כְּיוֹצֵא בוֹ לֹא בָטַל.. The scribe left out from להעשות to להעשות.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, that means that if <i>ṭevel</i> was mixed with heave, since this <i>ṭevel</i> is qualified to become heave for something similar, it cannot disappear<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">This is the inverse case, in which a minute amount of heave fell into <i>ṭevel.</i> Since part of <i>ṭevel</i> is going to be heave, this also is falling into its own kind and no part of it can be disregarded.</i>.
But Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya’s is no answer to Rebbi Zeïra<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The case introduced by R. Abun bar Ḥiyya must be that profane flour fell onto a flour offering that was in a Temple vessel. Flour dedicated for an offering but not yet placed in a Temple vessel is not yet a flour offering. Since flour is not fluid, we have to assume that the offering is at the bottom and the flour on top with an unrecognizable boundary in between. If the upper flour is assimilated to the lower then there is no offering since the upper flour was not dedicated. If the lower part remains an offering then the upper becomes suspended unusable since it was sanctified by the Temple vessel but is not an offering because it is not dedicated. Therefore, the entire flour is invalid for any use.</i>. As you take it, if the upper disappears then the lower has disappeared. If the lower did not disappear, neither did the upper since it was already sanctified.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first case in the Mishnah, <i>ṭevel</i> sour dough in a dough which already is fully profane. A similar statement is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Challah (Lieberman) 2:2" href="/Tosefta_Challah_(Lieberman).2.2">Tosephta 2:2</a>: “If somebody takes sourdough from a dough from which <i>ḥallah</i> was not taken, he brings flour from another place and adds to obtain four quarters to make it obligated in proportion.” In the formulation of the Halakhah, the <i>ṭevel</i> dough is made from exactly one quarter. Therefore, if one makes a new dough of exactly one <i>qab</i> which is made to “bite” the profane dough, one has a total of 5 quarters of obligation and may take only <i>ḥallah</i> of the obligated, not from the already exempt. This means in general that if the amount of sour dough is <i>x</i>, the amount needed to avoid giving <i>ḥallah</i> for everything is (5 quarters - <i>x</i>). In this way, neither does one take <i>ḥallah</i> from another place nor does one have to take <i>ḥallah</i> for everything.</i>: Otherwise, he brings four quarters and makes it bite. Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: This means that one quarter of sour dough which became <i>ṭevel</i> at its place makes four other quarters <i>ṭevel</i>.

According to the House of Hillel, the touch of a <i>Ṭevul Yom</i> disables the <i>ḥallah</i>-heave in one loaf only.</i>: “If somebody collects loaves in order to separate [<i>ḥallah</i>] and they bit, the House of Shammai say it is a connection for a <i>ṭevul yom</i> but the House of Hillel say it is not a connection.” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, since we stated it is no connection, that means that nobody can become guilty under the heading “impure person eating pure [food]”<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:7" href="/Leviticus.22.7"><i>Lev</i>. 22:7</a>.

This is obvious for those who hold that <i>ṭevel</i> is like profane in matters of contamination with impurity.<br>The commentators who did not have the Genizah text before them either omitted the words אוכל טהור with R. S. Cirillo’s ms. or switched טמא אוכל טהור into טהור אוכל טמא. In any case, the implication is that while the House of Hillel accept biting as a conduit for impurities other than that of the <i>Ṭevul Yom,</i> these derivative impurities can never be biblical.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said to him, that is different for a <i>ṭevul yom</i> because for him is written both pure and impure<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:6-7" href="/Leviticus.22.6-7"><i>Lev</i>. 22:6–7</a>.</i>; pure for profane food during daytime hours and for heave after dark.

Therefore, he says biting is biblical. And Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish is he who says it is not biblical since he says biting is not biblical. But did we not state: “Otherwise, he brings four quarters and makes it bite?” Rebbi Hoshaia said, explain that it was part of the dough which was bitten<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">If the sour dough only became <i>ṭevel</i> because of another dough biting the one it was taken from, the <i>ṭevel</i> is only rabbinical and nothing can be inferred about the biblical status of biting (R.

Rebbi Zeïra asked: Do Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish differ if it bites by itself but if he made it bite with his hand everybody agrees that biting is biblical? Even if you say that the disagreement arises if he made it bite with his hand, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish sticks with his opinion since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of Ḥizqiah: <i>ṭevel</i> disappears in a plurality<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 4:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.4.1.5"><i>Terumot</i> 4:1.

Rebbi Abba bar Mamal and Rebbi Hila brought a case before Rebbi Assi; they wanted to say that two form a majority against one.

Rebbi Yose said, everybody agrees that he separates. Where do they differ? To worry about a second taking.

Since, in principle, rabbinic ordinances are valid only as “fences around the Law”, there can be no reason to take heave a second time. For R. Joḥanan, if all agricultural commandments in the Land are biblical the second mixture is <i>dema‘</i> and the heave has to be lifted.</i>. For him who says <i>ṭevel</i> does not disappear in a plurality, if one lifted it out but if fell into another place, he worries to take it out a second time.
Rebbi Abba said: Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish differ about <i>ṭevel</i> by biblical standards. But for <i>ṭevel</i> which is <i>ṭevel</i> only by rabbinic decree, everybody agrees that <i>ṭevel</i> disappears in a plurality. Rebbi Abba bar Cahana objected before Rebbi Yose: Did we not state: “Similarly, if harvested olives were mixed with plucked olives, or harvested grapes with gleanings,” is that not <i>ṭevel</i> only by rabbinic standards<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Biblical heave is due only for grain, wine, and olive oil.</i>? Rebbi Mana said, I confirmed it: If oil from harvested olives was mixed with oil from plucked olives!

Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, he harvests and computes as is usual for him.” They wanted to say, for him who says up to here is heave, up to here is heave, <i>ṭevel</i> disappears in a plurality but for him who says he harvests and computes as is usual for him, <i>ṭevel</i> does not disappear in a plurality<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">This would prove that there is disagreement also for heave which is purely rabbinical.</i>.

One would assume that amphoras full of wine are in a מרתף, a wine cellar, not in a בור, which is either a cistern or the vat into which the pressed grape juice flows and where it is turned into wine. In addition, one has to separate the prospective heave from the amphora before turning it into heave, otherwise it would diffuse in the entire amphora and turn everything into <i>dema‘</i>. Since the statement is the continuation of the one about pumpkins, one has to say that an amount of <i>ṭevel</i> wine sufficient for the entire cistern was first taken out, put in a separate vessel, but not declared to be heave. Then the wine in the cistern is taken out by filling it into amphoras one by one. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, who in the first part did not require that the place of heave be indicated, permits here successive declarations that a certain part of the separated wine should be heave. Rebbi, who in the first part did require that the place of heave be indicated, permits only giving heave for all together since in a fluid no parts can be indicated.</i> If he had to give heave for four or five amphoras in a cistern, he lifts the first one to the mouth of the cistern and says, this is heave. The same for the second and third, the words of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. Rebbi says, he lifts all of them to the mouth of the cistern and says, this is heave.” They wanted to say, for him who says he lifts the first one to the mouth of the cistern, <i>ṭevel</i> disappears in a plurality but for him who says he lifts all of them to the mouth of the cistern, <i>ṭevel</i> does not disappear in a plurality<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">All commentators, from R.

The meaning is that giving piecemeal, even if the amphora to be put in order touches the vessel containing the potential heave, might not be considered earmarked since the wine which becomes heave is undefined.</i>.

A <i>qab</i> of wheat, a <i>qab</i> of barley, a <i>qab</i> of spelt, he takes heave from each one for what is needed.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Challah (Lieberman) 2:4" href="/Tosefta_Challah_(Lieberman).2.4">Tosephta 2:4</a>: “A <i>qab</i> of wheat, a <i>qab</i> of barley, a <i>qab</i> of spelt do combine. If he takes heave, he takes from each one separately since one does not give heave from one species for another.” In this version, the rules for <i>ḥallah</i> and heave are different; the discussion shows that this is not the position of the Yerushalmi. It follows that the <i>baraita</i> represents a tradition different from the Tosephta. It is not necessary to assume with Maimonides that the <i>qab</i> here is a larger measure, equal to 5/4 standard <i>qab</i> which causes separate obligations of <i>ḥallah.</i> As R. Eliahu Fulda explains, the barley in the middle is also subject to <i>ḥallah;</i> it is not different from dough of which <i>ḥallah</i> already was taken. Therefore, the obligation of <i>ḥallah</i> exists and has to be satisfied following the rules of heave.</i>” He said only, a <i>qab</i> of wheat, a <i>qab</i> of barley, a <i>qab</i> of spelt, therefore this is not about a <i>qab</i> of wheat, a <i>qab</i> of barley, and a <i>qab</i> of spelt in the middle. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, Rebbi Ḥanina the colleague of the rabbis asked: what is the difference whether spelt or barley is in the middle? Rebbi Cohen in the name of the rabbis of Caesarea: Spelt combines with wheat not because it is the same kind but because it looks similar. Since it is far from it, it does not look similar.
Rebbi Jonah asked: Is it the same for animal tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:32" href="/Leviticus.27.32"><i>Lev.</i> 27:32</a>; from the verse it is clear that the minimum number of newborn animals subject to tithe is 10. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Bekhorot 9:7" href="/Mishnah_Bekhorot.9.7">Mishnah (<i>Bekhorot</i> 9:7</a>) states that animals are close to one another to be counted together for tithes if they are within grazing distance of one another; this is fixed at 16 <i>mil.</i> It is stated that the distance from Kefar Ḥananiah to Sepphoris is 16 <i>mil,</i> from Sepphoris to Kefar Othnai also 16 <i>mil.</i> <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bekhorot 7:2" href="/Tosefta_Bekhorot.7.2">Tosephta (<i>Bekhorot</i> 7:3</a>) and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 55a" href="/Bekhorot.55a">Babli (<i>Bekhorot</i> 55a</a>) state that there is an obligation of animal tithe if the total number of newborn animals of a single owner in Kefar Ḥananiah, Sepphoris, and Kefar Othnai is at least ten with at least one being at Sepphoris. R. Jonah now asks whether it is sufficient that the owner had animals at Sepphoris which were in the past counted for tithe, similar to the situation described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 4:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.4.2.1">Mishnah 3</a>.</i>? As you say there, if he had five obligated ones in Kefar Ḥananiah, five obligated in Kefar Othnay, and five free ones in Sepphoris? As you say there, if something of which <i>ḥallah</i> was taken is between them, they do combine; is it the same in this case? If you say that <i>ḥallah</i> is different since there it bites, are these 16 <i>mil</i> not as if it did bite? We find <i>ḥallah</i> from practice, we do not find animal tithe from practice<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The rule of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 4:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.4.2.1">Mishnah 3</a> is rabbinic; for animal tithe only biblical standards apply. R. Jonah’s question is answered in the negative.</i>.
Is Rebbi Ismael not correct? Spelt and wheat are two species. Since they are similar, you say they combine; new and old not so much more? Rebbi Hila said, the reason of the rabbis is that spelt and wheat are two species and people will not err to say that one may give heave and tithes from one for the other<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumot</i> Mishnah 2:4.</i>. New and old are one species and if you say so, one will think that one may give heave and tithes from one for the other<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This is forbidden, <i>Terumot</i> Mishnah 1:5. It follows that the prohibition of the rabbis is rabbinic, not biblical. R. Eliahu Fulda points out that the argument is weak since even R. Ismael requires that <i>ḥallah</i> be taken in such a way that dough from both sides is taken; the difference between him and the rabbis is only whether <i>ḥallah</i> can be taken together or must be taken separately.</i>.
Rebbi Aqiba compares it to not fully processed produce; if one transgressed and gave heave from it it is heave<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:10.</i>. But the rabbis compare it to produce not yet one-third ripe; if one transgressed and gave heave from it it is not heave<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.1.3.1">Mishnah <i>Ḥallah</i> 1:3</a>, following R. Eleazar.</i>. They had second thoughts and said, it is similar neither to not fully processed produce nor to produce not yet one-third ripe<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since it also must follow the majority opinion in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.1.3.1">Mishnah <i>Ḥallah</i> 1:3</a>.</i>! But Rebbi Aqiba compares it to the case of him who says, this is heave for these fruits when they will be taken, and they were taken; but the rabbis compare it to the case of him who says, this is heave for these fruits when they will be taken<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody agrees that produce tentatively designated as heave cannot be heave if there is nothing it can be given for. Similarly, they will hold that <i>ḥallah</i> tentatively designated for the case the dough will reach critical size cannot be <i>ḥallah</i> if no obligated dough is available at the time of designation.</i>.
They wanted to say what Rebbi Aqiba said, <i>ḥallah</i> may be taken from a <i>qab</i> from practice, not as a biblical standard. Since we have stated: “Rebbi Aqiba exempts but the Sages obligate,” this implies that it is by biblical standards<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since the combined dough of 2 <i>qab</i> is subject to biblical <i>ḥallah</i> in everybody’s opinion, R. Aqiba must declare <i>ḥallah</i> from a single <i>qab</i> as biblical <i>ḥallah.</i><br>In R. Aqiba’s statement, “one <i>qab</i>” must be taken litterally; it is not an expression meaning “less than 5/4 <i>qab</i>” since in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 1:2" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.1.2">Mishnah <i>Idiut</i> 1:2</a>, Shammai is reported to fix the obligation of <i>ḥallah</i> at one <i>qab</i> (and Hillel at 2 <i>qabim</i>). R. Aqiba must hold that any amount which is declared <i>ḥallah</i> in any tradition must be recognized as biblical <i>ḥallah</i> (Maimonides in his Commentary.)</i>.
“It turns out that the severity becomes a leniency.” Some Tannaїm state: “The leniency becomes a severity”. He who says the severity becomes a leniency, [refers to] Rebbi Aqiba; he who says the leniency becomes a severity, [refers to] the rabbis.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A person may take for <i>ḥallah</i> from a dough prepared in purity and from which <i>ḥallah</i> has not yet been taken, to use it continuously for <i>ḥallah</i> of <i>demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">It is not very clear what “<i>ḥallah</i> of <i>demay</i>” is since <i>ḥallah</i> has the status of Great Heave which everybody is supposed to have given. It seems, with R. Simson, that “<i>ḥallah</i> of <i>demay</i>” is <i>ḥallah</i> taken for bread bought from an untrustworthy baker, as described in Mishnah <i>Demay</i> 5:1. According to Maimonides, in his Code and the later version of his Commentary, “<i>ḥallah</i> of <i>demay</i>” refers to any <i>ḥallah</i> whose status as biblical obligation is in doubt.</i> until it decays, since <i>ḥallah</i> of <i>demay</i> may be taken from pure for impure and from what is not earmarked<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since dough or bread bought from an untrustworthy person always has the status of ritual impurity, the pure dough set aside for <i>ḥallah</i> cannot be combined with the impure for which it is designated. Therefore, the procedure described here is restricted to the case where the heave (i. e., <i>ḥallah</i>) does not have to be earmarked.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> What means “until it decays”?

This means<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah which permits using dough close to being spoiled as <i>ḥallah</i> (i. e., heave) for freshly prepared dough.</i> that one may give heave from bad for good.

Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, I saw Simeon ben Cahana drinking heave wine in Acco<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">This in itself is problematic since part of Acco belongs to the Land, part to Syria (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 6:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.6.1.8"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 6:1, Note 30</a>).</i>.

They passed by a fence. He said to him, bring me a sliver as a toothpick. He changed his mind and told him, do not bring me anything; if everybody would do that, the fence of this man would be gone. Rebbi Ḥaggai was supporting Rebbi Zeïra. A person passed by who was carrying a load of chips. He said to him, bring me a chip as a toothpick. He changed his mind and told him, do not bring me anything; if everybody would do that, the load of this man would be gone. Is not Rebbi Zeïra particularly pious? No, he told us that we should observe the words of our Creator.

The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 93a" href="/Pesachim.93a">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 93a</a> quotes a Tosephta which includes women impure because of childbirth in the list of persons obligated to observe the Second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.</i>.

There seems to be no reason why the people from Hyena Mountain should not be permitted to bring their first fruits early.
