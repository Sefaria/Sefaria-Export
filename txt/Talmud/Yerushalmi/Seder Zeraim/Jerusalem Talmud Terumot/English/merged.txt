Jerusalem Talmud Terumot



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Five [persons] cannot give heave and if they gave it is not heave: the deaf and dumb<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He is excluded only if he has no way of communicating with others.</i>, the insane, the minor, and one who gives heave from what is not his. The Gentile who gave heave for a Jew’s property, even with the latter’s authorization his heave is not heave<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">But a Gentile may voluntarily donate heave from his own produce.</i>.<br>A deaf person who speaks but cannot hear should not give heave, but if he did, his heave is heave. A “deaf person” mentioned anywhere by the Sages is a deaf-mute.<br>Rebbi Jehudah says, the heave given by a minor who has not yet grown two pubic hairs is heave. Rebbi Yose says, before he came to the time of vows<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 5:6: “The vows of a girl 11 years and one day of age are investigated (one inquires whether she understands the notion and severity of vows; if she does, her vows are valid.) If she is 12 years and one day old, her vows are <i>prima facie</i> valid but one investigates them during all of her thirteenth year. The vows of a boy 12 years and one day old are investigated; if he is 13 years and one day old, his vows are <i>prima facie</i> valid but one investigates them during all of his fourteenth year. Before that time, even if they say we know before Whom we made the vow and to Whom we dedicated a sacrifice, their vows are not vows and their dedications not dedications.” According to Rashi, “the time of vows” is when the vows are investigated; according to Maimonides [in his Code (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 11:3:2-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.11.3.2-6"><i>Nedarim</i> 11:3</a>) and in the first and third versions of his Mishnah Commentary] it is the time when all vows are automatically valid. {Rashi’s opinion and the similar one of Maimonides in the second version of his Commentary are the only ones compatible with the Yerushalmi; Maimonides’s other opinion can be justified by the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 46b-47a" href="/Niddah.46b-47a">Babli, <i>Niddah</i> 46b–47a</a>.}</i>, his heave is not heave. After he has reached the time of vows, his heave is heave.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Five [persons] cannot give heave,” etc. Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman understood all of these from here (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 25:2-3" href="/Exodus.25.2-3"><i>Ex</i>. 25:2–3</a>)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">While the verses deal with the voluntary heave for the Tabernacle, it is assumed that the word “heave” always has the same meaning (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:20" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.20"><i>Berakhot</i>, Chapter 1, Note 70</a>) and, therefore, is under the same restrictions.</i>: “Speak to the Children of Israel that <i>they</i> should give heave for Me”, excluding the Gentile, “from every man”, excluding the minor, “whose intention is to volunteer”, excluding the deaf-mute and the insane. “The following is the heave you shall accept from <i>them</i>”, except from one who gives heave for what is not his.
Should not their<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Speaking of deaf-mute, insane, and minor.</i> action be proof of their intentions<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">One should allow non-verbal communication of “intention to volunteer”.</i>? As we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Makhshirin 6:1" href="/Mishnah_Makhshirin.6.1">Mishnah <i>Makhširin</i> 6:1</a>: “If somebody brings his produce up to his roof because of worms and dew descended on it, it is not under the category of ‘when given’ but if he intended this {that the produce should be wetted by dew}, it is under the category of ‘when given’. If a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person brought them up, …”. As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.2"><i>Demay</i>, Chapter 2, Note 141</a>, produce is not susceptible to impurity unless it came into contact with water (or any other fluid causing impurity, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1"><i>Demay</i>, Chapter 2, Note 136</a>) and that contact was desired, since the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:38" href="/Leviticus.11.38"><i>Lev</i>. 11:38</a>: “If produce got wetted by water … it will be impure” can also be read as: “If water was given on produce …”. It is inferred that the wetting, even if happening by a passive process, must have an active ingredient, <i>viz</i>., that the moistening of the produce must be agreeable to the owner.</i>: “If a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person brought them up, they are not under the category of ‘when given’ because they have action but no intention.” What is their action? Rebbi Ḥuna said, when he grabs it while full of dew<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 13a" href="/Chullin.13a">Babli, <i>Ḥulin</i> 13a</a>, R. Joḥanan explains that he turns the produce over in order to distribute the moisture evenly. This is professional action. R. Simson conjectures that the action envisaged by R. Ḥuna is the same as explained by R. Joḥanan.</i>. We also have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Makhshirin 3:8" href="/Mishnah_Makhshirin.3.8">Mishnah <i>Makhširin</i> 3:8</a>. It is explained in that Chapter that water drawn intentionally will make produce susceptible to impurity even if the contact of the produce with it was unintentional. The example described in Mishnah 8 is that of cattle whose feet have to be washed, either because the animal was used for threshing and now is all dusty, or because of some medical condition. Then the water drops clinging to the animal after it was washed in the river will make produce susceptible to impurity unless the animal was driven to the river by “a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person.” Here again, if the cattle are not only driven to the river but actively washed, intention is clearly shown.</i>: “If a deaf-mute, insane, or minor person brought them down, even if he thought that [his animals’] feet should be doused, it is not under the category of ‘when given’ because they have action but no intention.” What is their action? Rebbi Ḥuna said, when he rubs them with water. We should also say here, let their action be proof of their intentions! Rebbi Samuel, Rebbi Abbahu, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan; Rebbi Zeïra in the name of the rabbis (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:27" href="/Numbers.18.27"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>): “Your heave will be credited to you.” When thought is mentioned in the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The root both of “thought”, מחשבה, and “being accounted for”, נחשב, is חשב.</i>, his action cannot prove his intentions; when thought is not mentioned in the verse, his action can prove his intentions. Since here thought is mentioned in the verse, his action cannot prove his intentions.
Rebbi Yose said, I questioned before Samuel: But with bills of divorce, thought is not written and his action cannot prove his intention! As we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.5.1">Mishnah <i>Giṭṭin</i> 2:5</a>.</i>: “Everybody is permitted to write a bill of divorce, even an insane person, a deaf-mute, and a minor.” Rebbi Huna said, if a sane person directs him. Rebbi Joḥanan asked, is that (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut</i>. 24:1</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:3" href="/Deuteronomy.24.3">3</a>): “he writes for her”, for her personally<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is an echo of the very short discussion in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 2:5:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.2.5.2"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 2:5</a>. Rebbi Joḥanan points out that the divorce document must be written specifically for the woman in question. If two men with identical names are married to two women who have the same name, and both want to divorce them on the same day, the two divorce documents will have identical wording. Nevertheless, if the husbands switch the documents before they are handed to the respective wives, both divorces will be invalid. In both Talmudim, Samuel narrows down the meaning of the Mishnah in that he allows the incompetent only to write the formulaic portion under the direction of a competent person; but the data which make the document valid, date and names of the two persons involved, must be written by a competent person as agent of the husband. The argument here does not consider this restriction, except that R. Yose (Rav Assi of the first generation Amoraïm in Babylonia) is of the opinion that, since a document containing only date and names cannot be signed by witnesses and is not a divorce document, the writing of the incompetent is necessary for the validity of the document and one has to wonder why this is accepted.</i>? Rebbi Yose came back and said, there one person writes<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Writing a valid divorce document and using it for the divorce are two distinct actions; one may be valid without the other. But taking heave is valid only if the taking is intended for heave; the action itself needs thinking; this parallels the action of divorce, not the writing of part of the document.</i> and another person divorces. But here, the same person thinks and takes heave. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, there, if he<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A competent person. Even if he writes all by himself there are two actions. This argument is valid only for R. Eleazar (ben Shamua, the Tanna) who holds that a divorce is validated by handing over the document before two witnesses. But according to R. Meїr who holds that a document is invalid if it has not been signed by two trustworthy witnesses, the writing of the document is not important, only the signing is, and this must be done by two competent persons unrelated to the husband.</i> would write himself and divorce, would that not be a divorce? But here, he thinks and takes heave.
Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: One disagrees with this Mishnah teacher<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that incompetents may separate heave under the direction of a competent person.</i>. How is that? It turns out that Rebbi Joḥanan concerning heaves parallels Rebbi Ismael, the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa concerning sanctification, and Rebbi Joḥanan concerning divorces parallels the rabbis concerning sanctification, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Parah 5:5" href="/Tosefta_Parah.5.5">Tosephta <i>Parah</i> 5:7</a> reads: “Everybody is able to sanctify except the deaf-mute, the insane, and the minor; but R. Jehudah approves of the minor. R. Ismael, the son of R. Joḥanan ben Beroqa says that the sanctifications of a deaf-mute person, an insane, and a minor, who sanctified in the presence of others, are valid. The sanctification by a sexless person is invalid, for he is possibly uncircumcised, and an uncircumcized person cannot sanctify. The sanctification by a hermaphrodite is valid but R. Jehudah declares it invalid since he possibly is a woman and a woman does not qualify for holy matters.”<br>All this refers to the purification from the impurity of the dead, which needs sprinkling with fresh water to which a minute amount of the ashes of the red heifer must be added. The act of taking the ashes and putting them into a vessel filled with fresh water is called “sanctification.” It is a sacral act (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19:17" href="/Numbers.19.17"><i>Num</i>. 19:17</a>) and as such needs the intent of the person executing it. R. Ismael, the son of R. Joḥanan ben Beroqa, applies the principle that for obligations for which “thought” is implied by the verse but not spelled out explicitly, actions may prove intent.<br>{A sexless person is one without testicles or female sex characteristics. He might be a male with undescended testicles. The hermaphrodite has a penis and testicles as well as female breasts and a vagina; he must be circumcised. The exclusion of women by R. Jehudah is rejected by the rabbis; women nevertheless may not sprinkle since the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:18" href="/Leviticus.19.18"><i>Lev</i>. 19:18</a>) requires this to be done by “a pure male.”}<br>The seeming inconsistency in the positions of R. Joḥanan is not resolved. {If one assumes that R. Joḥanan agrees with the position of Samuel (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.1.1.4">Note 14</a>) there is no inconsistency since he will agree that the incompetent may write only the inconsequential parts of the divorce document.}</i>: “The sanctifications of a deaf-mute person, an insane, and a minor who sanctified are no sanctifications. Rebbi Ismael, the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa says, if they are alone, their sanctifications are no sanctifications. Together with others, their sanctifications are sanctifications.”
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A similar statement is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta <i>Terumot</i> 1:1</a>, quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 71a" href="/Gittin.71a">Babli <i>Giṭṭin</i> 71a</a>.

Cf. also Mishnah and Halakhah 2.</i>: “If a deaf-mute person gave heave, it is not heave. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, when was this said? If he was born deaf-mute. But if he was normal and became deaf and dumb, he writes and others confirm his signature. <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).1.2">Tosephta (1:2</a>) and the Babli, the formulation is: “If he hears but does not speak, he is mute; if he speaks but cannot hear, he is deaf; both have the status of normal persons.” The sentence is missing in the Rome ms.</i> If he hears but cannot speak, he is like a normal person.”
Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: One disagrees with this Tanna<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel.</i>. They say, does not a Mishnah disagree<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 14:1:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.14.1.2-5">Yebamot 14:1</a>: “If a normal man married a normal woman and she became deaf-mute he may divorce her or keep her, but if she became insane he may not divorce her; if he became deaf-mute or insane he may never divorce.”</i>: “If he became deaf-mute or insane, he may never divorce.” Why can he not write and have others fulfill his written instructions<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabban Simeon, even if he became deaf-mute it should not make any difference since he may give written instructions.</i>? They upheld it, if he is illiterate. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal objected, does not a <i>baraita</i> disagree<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Gittin (Lieberman) 2:8" href="/Tosefta_Gittin_(Lieberman).2.8">Tosephta <i>Giṭṭin</i> 2:8</a>. The text there ends: “it is no divorce unless they hear his voice say to the scribe ‘write!’, and to the witnesses ‘sign!’ ” That Tosephta clearly disagrees with Rabban Simeon and disqualifies handwriting by a mute.</i>: “If he wrote himself, or he told the scribe to write and the witnesses to sign, even though the scribe wrote, the witnesses signed, they gave him [the document] and he in turn gave it to her, it is no divorce.” Rebbi Assi said, complete the sentence and there is no disgreement: “it is no divorce unless they hear his voice.” But even if he gave a sign with his head you say it is invalid<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 7:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.7.1.1">Mishnah <i>Giṭṭin</i>7:1</a>: “If somebody lost his speech and they said to him, shall we write a divorce document for your wife? if he gave a sign with his head one checks him out three times; if he indicated ‘yes’ when it was expected, and ‘no’ when it was expected, they should write and hand it over.” The Tosephta also seems to contradict this Mishnah.</i>, here also it is invalid. Rebbi Mana said, it is valid: hearing the voice has the same status as seeing him nod his head<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Tosephta contradicts Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel but not the Mishnah. A written authorization is invalid but a direct authorization by the husband to scribe and witnesses, by speech for a normal person and sign language for a mute, is valid. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 71a" href="/Gittin.71a">Babli (<i>Giṭṭin</i> 71a</a>), Rav Cahana in the name of Rav accepts the position of Rabban Simeon, against the Tosephta.</i>!
Rebbi Ezra<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">He is Rebbi Azariah, a student of R. Mana (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:25" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.25"><i>Berakhot</i>, Chapter 1, Note 90</a>).</i> asked before Rebbi Mana: Just as you say that three times he must give a sign with his head, must one equally hear his voice three times? He said to him, hearing his voice once, giving a sign with his head three times.
Rebbi Yudan said, there, if he said I did such and such, here, if he says do such and such<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">“There” refers to the statement of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel that written testimony of a deaf-mute is valid, “here” refers to the Tosephta that a written command by a deaf-mute is invalid for a divorce.</i>. Rebbi Benjamin ben Levi inquired: If he has understanding for the past, he should have understanding for the future; ifhe has no understanding for the past, he would not have understanding for the future<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The argument of R. Yudan makes no sense; R. Benjamin supports R. Joḥanan (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 1:1:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.1.1.7">Note 21</a> ff.)</i>! Rebbi Eudaimon said, here we deal with a mute; there is no agency for a mute<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">He rejects the statement of Rabban Simeon and implies that the Mishnah in <i>Terumot</i> also applies to any deaf-mute, whether his disability be congenital or acquired. Since the heave of a deaf-mute is no heave even if the deaf-mute acts for a sane person, it follows that a deaf-mute cannot be an agent and, therefore, cannot appoint an agent. A divorce document must be written by an agent of the husband’s since the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:1" href="/Deuteronomy.24.1"><i>Deut.</i> 24: 1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 24:3" href="/Deuteronomy.24.3">3</a>) requires that “he writes her a scroll of divorce”. If nobody can be an agent of the deaf-mute, he cannot divorce since even if he himself writes the document he cannot ask the witnesses to sign.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, we deal with a sane person<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">He accepts the statement of Rabban Simeon and shows that R. Joḥanan is wrong; there is no disagreement between Rabban Simeon and the Mishnah in <i>Giṭṭin</i>. A congenital deaf-mute cannot marry or divorce, while a hearing person who is mute is considered normal and can divorce by giving written directions, following Rabban Simeon and R. Mana. The only reason we require a triple confirmation of the will to divorce is to ascertain that the husband really wants the divorce, not that he wants to have a document ready should he want to divorce.</i>. Why is there no divorce? Because I say, he was occupied with his documents. We also stated so: “When was this said? When he explained it in his regular state. But if he was paralyzed by sickness, once is enough<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Sick persons have to be treated with consideration and only the necessary legal forms have to be observed, not formalities that are not stricly necessary.

Who states “the deaf-mute?” Not Rebbi Jehudah, since it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>; the remark about abent-mindedness is missing there.</i>: “Rebbi Jehudah said, it happened that the sons of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Gudgada<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A Tanna of the first generation.

“ ‘You’ excludes one who gives heave from what is not his.” What is the interpretation, one who gives heave from what is not his own, or one who gives heave from what is somebody else’s? Let us hear the following: If he declared his heap as ownerless and then smoothed it and took possession again, if you refer to one who gives heave from what is not his own, his heave is not heave, if you refer to one who gives heave from what is somebody else’s, his heave is heave<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ma‘serot</i> 1:6 states that tithes and heave are due after threshing, when the grain kernels have been assembled into a heap and the heap was smoothed. It is shown in <i>Ma‘serot</i>, Halakhah 1:1, that property which was ownerless at the moment when heave was due is exempt from heave. This seems to contradict the statement here that if a person declared his grain ownerless before it was smoothed, then gave heave, and only after that again took possession, his heave might be heave. The entire argument is possible only for R. Meïr, since R.

As the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 44b" href="/Nedarim.44b">Babli notes (<i>Nedarim</i> 44b</a>), any heave given from the repossessed grain must refer to the heap itself; it cannot possibly be given for unabandoned grain which is obligated by biblical decree (if we assume that heave is a biblical obligation after the Babylonian exile, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 7:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.7.1.1"><i>Ševi‘it</i> Chapter 7, Notes 11</a> ff.).</i>.

Rebbi Assi wanted to say that the Gentile cannot appoint another Gentile as agent, but he can appoint a Jew. Rebbi Zeïra said, from the <i>baraita</i> itself: You appoint an agent: does that not mean Jews? Similarly, the Gentile cannot appoint an agent: not even a Jew. Rav Hoshaia objects: Does the <i>baraita</i> support Rebbi Joḥanan? “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said: If the Gentile does not wish to give heave from his produce, he cannot give heave.” Therefore, if he wants to, he may give heave.

One may also explain it following Rebbi Yose, as “Rebbi Yose said: If the owner gave heave from the tithes, what he did is done.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 1:9" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).1.9">Tosephta 1:9</a>.

Rav Ḥisda said: The deaf-mute person is not mentioned; it is a formula. In which Mishnah?

Hence, even if grain is given as heave after threshing, the Cohen might have some additional work to do. The same argument applies to the next question. Since grain is mentioned, Maimonides (<i>Terumot</i> 5:18) decides that cut grain cannot be given as heave for threshed grain. The parallel in <i>Sifry</i> (<i>Num</i>. 121) mentions only grain and wine.</i>? People willingly will pound something. Think about it, if it were in ears? So far goes our question.

Ḥizqiah said, they mentioned only olives for oil and grapes for wine, hence not for any other produce. Rebbi Joḥanan said, not only olives for oil and grapes for wine but also any other produce<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Ḥizqiah cannot mean that only oil and wine are covered by Mishnah 4, everything else by Mishnah 10, since grain was added to the list both by the Yerushalmi and the <i>Sifry</i>.

Joḥanan, any produce undergoing a manufacturing process, such as date honey and date beer from dates, is covered by Mishnah 4 for the House of Shammay (explanation of R. J. I. Kanievski).</i>.

Rebbi Ḥananiah the son of Rebbi Hillel<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">A fifth generation Galilean Amora, quoted only in the Yerushalmi.</i> said, it is simultaneous.

It was found stated in the name of Rebbi Yose: “One may not give olives as heave for oil or grapes for wine. If one did, the House of Shammai say it contains their own heave, but the House of Hillel say his heave is not heave.” Rebbi Yose contradicts himself. There he says, what he did is done; here he says, his heave is not heave. There, impurity is infrequent<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">For dry produce, even the produce of the vulgar will not be prepared for impurity. For wine and oil, the product in the hand of the vulgar is impure and the question does not arise; in the hand of the fellow it will be shielded from impurity (cf. <i>Demay</i>, Introduction).</i> and people will not err to say that one may give heave from the impure on the pure produce. But olives for oil and grapes for wine is frequent; if you say so, one will say that one may give heave of olives for oil and grapes for wine.

However, it has just been stated that the first part is necessary to show that “gleanings, forgotten sheaves, <i>peah</i>, and ownerless property all have the same rule”. Similarly, one may make a point that the last case, concerning produce of the Land and of foreign countries, is necessary since if we hold that heaves now are only a rabbinical obligation, it is difficult to see what should be the difference between the heave of the Land and that of the surrounding countries where heave is rabbinical all the time. The only questionable part therefore remains that about standing and harvested produce which seems totally superfluous since nobody would ever think that standing produce was subject to heave. The answer is that “standing” does not really mean standing, but produce harvested at a time in its development when it is not yet human food and should have remained standing.</i>? Thus you have to understand the Mishnah: [One may] not [give] from produce one third ripe for produce not yet one third ripe, and when he gave heave, it is not heave.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 10, contradicting our Mishnah here since in Mishnah 10 no obligation is stated to give heave a second time.</i>: “One does not give heave from incompletely processed produce for completely processed produce,” and here you say so? Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Because of a “fence” for the purification water, lest purification water become useless<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">“Purification water” is fresh water with some ashes of the red heifer, used to purify people from the impurity of the dead (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19" href="/Numbers.19"><i>Num</i>. 19</a>). It is true that heave must be eaten by the Cohen in purity but normally immersion in a ritual bath is enough and sprinkling with purification water is not always necessary. All commentators, from the Gaonim to R. S. Lieberman, explain that “fence for the purification water” simply means that one tries to force the olive or wine grower to produce his oil and wine in ritual purity, for if one would permit giving heave from oil (wine) on oil olives (wine grapes), he either would make only a small amount in purity until he has given heave, or he would buy a small quantity of pure olives (grapes) from a fellow and pay the fellow to give heave in his name from his pure fluids. While this explanation seems pertinent, it does not explain the expression “fence for purification water”; it also contradicts the general tendency, clearly apparent in Tractate <i>Demay</i>, not to force the vulgar to conform to standards of observance he could not honestly sustain. But there seems no better explanation.</i>. What is more serious, robbing the tribe<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">The Cohen must himself turn the olives into oil, the grapes into wine, but the verse says that heave is given as (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:27" href="/Numbers.18.27"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>) “grain from the threshing floor and complete produce from the (oil or wine) press.”</i> or [breaching] the “fence” for purification water? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 3:14" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).3.14">Tosephta 3:14</a>. In the first case, Mishnah 4, his heave was not heave but he has to give heave only once and has no monetary loss.</i>: “[If one gave heave of] olives for olives and in the future he will crush them, grapes for grapes and in the future he will press them, it is heave and he has to give heave a second time.” In this case there is both robbing the tribe and the “fence” for the purification water, but we have stated that it is heave and he has to give heave a second time. This proves that the “fence” for the purification water is more serious than robbing the tribe.
What would Rebbi Yose say here? Since Rebbi Meïr takes “robbing the tribe” lightly but takes the “fence” for purification water seriously, Rebbi Yose who takes “robbing the tribe” seriously, certainly must take the “fence” for purification water seriously! It was found stated in the name of Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">A quite different version is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 3:14" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).3.14">Tosephta 3:14</a>: “One does not give oil as heave on crushed olives, nor wine on pressed grapes. If one gave, it is heave and he has to give another heave. The first one creates <i>dema‘</i> and is subject to the fifth, but not the second one. From the latter one has to remove the tithes. Rebbi Yose says …” This Tosephta cannot be the source of the discussion here (as asserted by R. Eliahu Wilna and R. Moses Margalit) since the implication for R. Yose would be the opposite of what is asserted here and it is seen in the next paragraph that in the opinion of the Yerushalmi, R. Yose considers the second heave conditional and real heave. A Tosephta text closer to the Yerushalmi is reported in מלאכת שלמה (R. Solomon Adani) on the Mishnah.</i>: “One may not give olives as heave for oil or grapes for wine; if one did, his heave is heave and he does not have to give heave [a second time], the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yose says, the House of Shammai say one gives heave but the House of Hillel say one does not give heave. Everybody agrees that if he gave heave, he does not have to give heave a second time.” There is proof that Rebbi Meïr takes “robbing the tribe” lightly but the “fence” for purification water seriously<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">While Mishnah 4 cannot be R. Meïr’s, it is assumed that Mishnah 8 is.</i>, Rebbi Yose takes “robbing the tribe” seriously<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">It is obvious that originally, the Yerushalmi must have read in R. Yose’s <i>baraita</i>: “he must give heave a second time”, but there is no supporting manuscript evidence.

There<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 5:2" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.5.2">Mishnah <i>Idiut</i> 5:2</a>. The other four examples refer to Mishnaiot in <i>Kilaim</i>,<i>Ḥallah</i>,<i>Miqwaot</i>,<i>Pesaḥim</i>.</i> we have stated: “Rebbi Yose says, in six matters are the House of Shammai lenient and the House of Hillel restrictive: Fowl may be served on the table together with cheese but cannot be eaten together according to the House of Shammai, but the House of Hillel say it may not be served or eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody agrees that fowl meat is not meat in the biblical sense since it says: “You may not cook a kid goat in its mother’s milk” and birds have no milk. Nevertheless, as rabbinic “fence”, one may not eat birds’ meat with any milk product.</i>. One gives heave from olives on oil and from grapes on wine according to the House of Shammai, but the House of Hillel say one may not.” Rebbi Mana said, it cannot be “from olives on oil” but “from oil on olives” because this is Rebbi Yose’s! For Rebbi Yose says it is heave and he has to give another heave; that is, if the first [heave] does no longer exist but if the first exists he gives it its name and that is enough<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">If the heave given first can be extended to cover the oil produced from the olives after heave was separated, it follows that R. Yose assumes that olives which were started in purity will be kept in purity until the last drop of oil has been extracted and the heave is legitimate as given from “pure on pure.” It follows that R. Yose rejects any consideration of a “fence for purification water”; he requires a genuine second heave only if either the first one was eaten or if the additional oil was made impure; in the latter case one may not use the first heave following Mishnah 2:1.</i>.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">This now refers back to the Mishnah, not the <i>baraitot</i> discussed in the meantime. A similar text appears in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 3:14" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).3.14">Tosephta 3:14</a>. Since the Great Heave was already taken the first time, “heaves” here must refer to the heave of the tithe.</i>: “The second [heave] should not be eaten until one takes from it heaves and tithes.” What is the status of the first? From what was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">In the same Tosephta, though not the origin of this <i>baraita</i>, the full text is: “If one gives heave of olives on olives which will be crushed or from grapes which will be pressed, it is heave and he has to give a second one. The first creates <i>dema‘</i> but not the second. The first is subject to the fifth but not the second; but one has to give it a name. If he came back and made the first olives into oil or the grapes into wine, he does not have to give a second heave.” “To give a name” means to make a declaration that heave or tithes should be valid for such and such produce. Since one really should give heave and tithes from the finished product, if the oil is produced from the olives for which heave (or tithes) were taken, the name may be extended later to the finished oil or wine.</i>: “If he came back and made the first olives into oil or the grapes into wine, he gives it a name and does not have to give a second heave.” That means that he has to give a name to his tithes.
We have stated after this<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 10.</i>: “One does not give heave from finished produce for unfinished;” there it is for the past, therefore not to start<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">In Mishnah 10, it is stated: “If one gave heave, it is heave”, which means that it is legitimized after the fact but cannot be accepted if done in defiance of the law.

What is the basis of his giving heave<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">While there is no measure of heave indicated in biblical law, Mishnah 5:3 indicates the rabbinical standard of an estimated 2% of the volume for which heave is to be given.

It was found stated: “Rebbi said, by a <i>quartarius</i>; Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, by the size of a dried fig.”
Rebbi Ḥananiah said in the name of Rebbi Hillel: We have stated in support of the statement of Rebbi Hoshaiah<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 3:14" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).3.14">Tosephta 3:14</a>.

Therefore, if he did not change his mind he has to give a second heave.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi Yannai: This is one of three obvious inferences in the Torah. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:12" href="/Numbers.18.12"><i>Num</i>. 18:12</a>): “All the best of olive oil, all the best of cider and grain<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This is the description of heave; the description as “best” is the basis of the position of R. Jehudah. In the verse, olive oil is treated separately from cider and grain. Everybody agrees that heave of olive oil must be kept separate from that of cider and grain. The argument, known as בנין אב מכתוב אחד, is that if two different species of trees are treated as distinct then two species belonging to completely different families of plants certainly must be treated as distinct.</i>.” Where do we hold? Is it to conclude that one may give heave from cider for grain and from grain for cider? One must object that cider and olive oil come from two different species of tree and one may not give heave or tithe from one for the other! This means that cider and olive oil are paradigms for two species of trees, in which case one may not give heave or tithe from one for the other. Then I have to add two species of grain, two kinds of produce of which one may not give heave or tithe from one for the other.

Since Rebbi Joḥanan said, Rebbi Jehudah inverted his reasoning but Rebbi Eleazar said, Rebbi Jehudah did not invert his reasoning, there for the Cohen, here for the owners, it follows that Rebbi Joḥanan said because he reduces the number of drinkers<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Since cooked wine is not to everybody’s taste, the vintner might have difficulty in finding a Cohen willing to drink his heave and the heave might have to be destroyed.

Rebbi Abun bar Cahana said in the name of Rebbi Hila (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:32" href="/Numbers.18.32"><i>Num</i>. 18:32</a>): “You should not carry sin because of it.” Since he is subject to carrying sin, you know that what he did is valid<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">The verse declares irregularities in giving heaves as sinful.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Partners who gave heave one after the other, Rebbi Aqiba says both of their heaves are heave.

Rebbi Yose says, if the first one gave the full measure<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The measure to be applied is discussed in the Halakhah but not determined. Partnership cannot apply to the heave of the tithe since the tithe must be given to an individual Levite.</i> of heave, then his heave is heave, but if the first one did not give the full measure of heave, then the heave of the second is heave.<br>Where was this said<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the preceding Mishnah of two partners giving heave and confirms Maimonides’s interpretation of that Mishnah. It is stated here that for heave the relationship between partners is like that between a person and his family.</i>? When he did not say anything. But if he empowered a member of his family, his slave, or his slave girl, their heave is heave. In case he revoked, if he revoked before heave was given, his heave is not heave. But if he revoked after heave was given, his heave is heave. Workers have no right to give heave except for those who press grapes because they make the wine press impure<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The winepress cannot become impure since it is built into the earth, but the contents of the vat into which the juice flows will become impure if it is touched by an impure person. It is assumed that the grapes have not become prepared for impurity by the juice lost from crushed grapes in the transport to the press since that juice is lost, against the will of the vintner. If either one of the workers or the vintner is not a Fellow (as defined in the Introduction to Tractate <i>Demay</i>), heave must be given before pressing starts. If the vintner is not present, the workers have implied authorization to give heave.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Where do we hold? If they assigned<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows Maimonides. R. Simson explains: If they were competent [in the laws to be applied.] It is difficult to accept this interpretation in the Halakhah.</i>, even Rebbi Aqiba agrees.

In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba, the <i>seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Assuming that the amount of heave given each time is a <i>seah</i>. Since R. Aqiba designates both as heave, neither one can be totally heave.

The <i>seah</i> of the second is half heave and half total <i>ṭevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since no heave comes after this.</i>. That does not seem necessary: may the half <i>seah</i> of the second free the half <i>seah</i> of the first? Let us hear from the following: Ariston brought produce, left some in the sack, and gave heave.

Does this not disagree with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish? As Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, nobody may revoke his agency by words. Explain it that he said, go and fix it to the North and [the agent] went and fixed it to the South<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The disagreement between R. Simeon ben Laqish and R.

The Babli explains the problem away; its opinion is that R. Simeon ben Laqish disallows verbal revocation only in matters of marriage and divorce which never can be executed by words alone. The Yerushalmi disagrees and holds that R. Simeon ben Laqish always requires an action (in the case of authorization to proceed with a divorce, a court action) to terminate duly established agency. In our case here, he permits a shortcut for termination only if the agent deviates from his instructions. On the other hand, the Yerushalmi notes that in case of an action of divorce, agency can be terminated only in the presence of the agent or by written document delivered to the other party even for R. Joḥanan since any other course of action would have unforseeable consequences.</i>.
Rebbi Joḥanan said, one makes the vat impure the moment the press men went over it warp and woof<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In both wine and oil presses, the vat is covered by wooden planks; the workers stand on the planks and pound on them walking crosswise over them.</i>.

But if the vat was small and others <i>were using</i> it, their heave was heave.” If the vat has to be emptied because of other uses, then time is of the essence and the workers have implicit authorization for heave.</i>: “If workers gave heave from a vat, their heave is not heave. But if the vat was small or if the owners or others stir it, their heave is heave.” Because others stir it, but if others do not stir it, their heave would not be heave! What is this? One statement for wine, the other for oil. But are not wine and oil the same?

Jehudah, which is undecidable and may stem from an abbreviation ד״י, the reading of the Yerushalmi is superior in every detail.<br>The problem discussed here and in the next paragraphs is, when may one give finished wine (or olive oil) which happens to be in the building of the press for wine (or oil) to be made from the grapes (or olives) newly brought into the press. The underlying principle is that the fruits must be crushed with some fluid oozing out, so that the fruit can no longer be used as fruit.</i>: “When does one start to give heave from grapes? From the moment one went over it warp and woof. When does one start to make them impure? The House of Shammai say, after one removed second [tithe], the House of Hillel say, after one removed first [tithe]. Rebbi Yose said, practice should follow the House of Shammai but the public follow the House of Hillel. Rebbi Simeon says, the words of the House of Shammai were reasonable in the time of the Temple, the words of the House of Hillel are reasonable in the present time.

Is not wine under the same rules as oil? What would be the difference between wine and oil? Wine is frequently impure, oil is not frequently impure. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, both are frequently impure but impurity is found with wine more often than with oil.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Simeon goes with the House of Shammai since the House of Shammai say it is sanctified as <i>dema‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">While this statement is repeated in Halakhah 4:5, it is difficult to find its origin. The commentaries refer to Mishnah 1:4, which is inapplicable since there no <i>dema‘</i> is created.</i> and so Rebbi Simeon says it is sanctified as <i>dema‘</i>.
So far if he says “contained in it”. What if he said “in it”? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 3:17.</i>:“The second tithe in this property shall be redeemed by those coins” and he did not specify<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In the Tosephta: He did not specify its place.

The words of the Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the sentence of the Mishnah starting “but the Sages say.”</i>. Rebbi Zeїra in the name of Rebbi Eudaimon from Haifa in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:27" href="/Numbers.18.27"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>): “Your heave will be thought of;” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:26" href="/Numbers.18.26"><i>Num</i>. 18:26</a>) “you shall lift.” Just as thought has to be definite, so your giving heave has to be definite<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The order of the verses should be reversed: Because your heave is thought of, it must be parallel to what you would do if you lifted the heave out of the produce.

If he said, the heave of this and that heap should be in this one; Rebbi Joḥanan said, the place where the heave of the first ended, there the second also ends<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Since this follows the rules of the Sages for whom no <i>dema‘</i> is created, it is understood that both times he indicated that the heave should be, e. g., in the Northern part of the heap. Then we assume that he intended to lift the two heaves together; the two heaves must be contiguous. The rules of lifting in this case of vague determination are spelled out in the next paragraph.</i>. Rebbi Isaac ben Eleazar asked: If a <i>seah</i> of heave fell into a heap<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Here it is assumed that the original volume of the heap is at least 100 <i>seah</i>. In that case, no <i>dema‘</i> is created but the original heave or its equivalent may simply be lifted out as explained in Chapter 5. If the argument of R. Joḥanan is correct, here also the new heave should be adjacent to the heave to be lifted.</i> and he said, the heave of this heap is contained in it<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Assuming that the heave fell into the center of the heap; in that case the declaration is acceptable also to the Sages.</i>, does the heave of the heap end at that <i>seah</i>?

Everybody agrees that “the Northern part” is not specific enough to denote the place of heave; the reasonable thing would be to remove the grain for heave first and then give it a name; in that way only 2% has to be given.</i> If he said, the heave of this heap shall be in its Northern part, the Northern half is <i>dema‘</i>, the words of Rebbi;” he takes one half. “But the Sages say, like a X<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Capital Greek letter χ.</i>;” one quarter. “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, he takes its heave from the Northernmost part;” one eighth<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">It is assumed that the heap is in the form of a perfect cone with circular base. It is easy to understand the positions of Rebbi and the Sages. Rebbi draws a plane perpendicular to the base plane in East-West direction through the center. Anything in the Northern half of the heap now may be heave; therefore, the entire Northern half is <i>demaʻ</i>. The Sages draw a plane perpendicular to the base plane in North-South direction through the center and then two planes perpendicular to the base plane, making ±45° angles with the North-South plane, cutting the base plane in two lines forming a χ. The volume cut out by the Northern half of these planes is 1/4th of the entire volume.<br>It is more difficult to reconstruct the Talmud’s interpretation of the argument of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. If the idea is that in the base plane one draws a chord of the base circle so that it cuts off 1/8th of the area of the circular disk, let 2α be the angle of the circular sector subtended by the segment measured in radians and choose the radius of the circle as unit of measurement. Then the area of the segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle from the center:<br><i>A</i> = α - sin α cos α = π/8<br>or α = .8832 rad = 50.63°. In that case, the height <i>h</i> of the segment is 1 - cos α = .365 of the radius of the base circle. However, if the idea is that the volume cut off from the cone by a plane, perpendicular to the base plane, through the chord, should be one eighth of the total volume then the problem is indeterminate since the ratio of radius of the circle to the height of the cone is not given. If this is assumed to be 1, the equation to be solved is<br>(α - sin α cos α)(1-cos α) = 3 π/8<br>or α = 1.4526 rad = 83.22°. However, the most likely explanation seems to be that in a heap of base radius <i>r</i> and height <i>H</i>, the total volume is computed as 1/3 π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>H</i> and one eighth of this is taken from the northernmost part of the heap.</i>.
What if the heave of two heaps [was given] together<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">He gave heave for two heaps together which is perfectly legal.

Rebbi Ḥama bar Uqba in the name of Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina: Since he transgresses a prohibition it follows that what he did is valid.

When does he transgress?

If he brought Second Tithe from his house, one treats it as <i>ṭevel</i> and Second Tithe, the words of Rebbi; Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, he needs only to separate Second Tithe.” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi worries that maybe he gave from one kind on another<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, the heave and tithes would be invalid.</i> but Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel worries thay maybe he inverted the order<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">He does not have to worry, but if the Gentile might have separated tithe before heave nothing bad has happened since heave and tithes are valid by Mishnah 6 and the Gentile is not subject to the rabbinic prohibitions.</i>.
“The Gentile’s heave creates <i>dema‘</i> and one is obligated to a fifth<sup class="footnote-marker">3,</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Rebbi Abbahu said to me in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, the disagreement is about the latter case. It is difficult according to Rebbi Simeon, does he free his <i>ṭevel</i> from the Torah and you say so<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">If the Gentile bought produce after threshing, obligated for heave but before heave was taken, then his heave will free the grain for consumption by Jews.

In all these texts, R. Simeon is quoted as freeing from punishment and R. Yose as declaring guilty. This is also a necessary reading here since the argument is that R. Simeon considers the Gentile’s sacrifice to be a genuine sacrifice acceptable to Heaven but not subject to any of the restrictions imposed on Jewish sacrifices; in parallel, the Gentile’s heave is heave but subject to its rules. (In some Mishnah mss. and editions, “R. Simeon” is replaced by “R. Meїr.”) Maimonides, both in his Commentary and his Code (<i>Pesule Hammuqdašim</i> 18:24) follows R. Simeon, against the rule that R. Yose prevails over R. Simeon. As R.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody separates parts of heave or tithes, he takes from this its own heave or tithes but not for another place<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simson explains: If somebody desires to give the full amount of heave (Mishnah 3) but at the moment takes only a smaller amount, or if he does not take the full 10% as tithes, then what he took is heave or tithes but the remainder is profane food and <i>ṭevel</i> mixed together and he may take the rest of his obligation from the same heap since, in this case, we say that what he takes out is <i>ṭevel</i> and not profane. {For heave he must have the intention to give more since there is no biblical minimum for heave.} But for another heap we do not allow him to take heave or tithes from what is partially profane. R. Meїr’s position is that we accept that heave taken in any permissible way retroactively turns its material into <i>ṭevel</i>, so that in any case only correct heave or tithes were taken (cf. <i>Demay</i> Chapter 5, Notes 45,63.).<br>Maimonides explains the Mishnah as stating that partial heave or tithes possibly remain <i>ṭevel</i> and therefore one must give heave or tithes from the separate produce. It cannot be returned to the original heap because possibly it is heave. R. Meїr considers it certain <i>ṭevel</i>. R. Abraham ben David (<i>Ma‘aser</i> 1:15) declares “I have no idea where he or his teacher could have picked up such an idea,” but the correct explanation is that given by R. Simson.</i>. Rebbi Meїr says, he may even take it for another place.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody separates parts of heave or tithes,” etc. Our Mishnah [is said] in case he separated and it is his intention to separate more. Rebbi Samuel in the name of Rebbi Zeїra, our Mishnah [is said] if he did not say anything. Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yudan: Do they disagree? He said to him, if he did not say anything, it is as if it were his intention to separate more<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The only case where an amount of heave smaller than the rabbinic minimum is accepted as full heave if the person giving heave says so explicitly.</i>.
What is the difference between taking from itself for itself and taking from itself for another place? When it is from itself for itself, what comes into his hand is<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Retroactively, it turned out to be heave. But if used for another heap, there is no retroactivity and heave and <i>ṭevel</i> are indistinguishable.</i> all <i>ṭevel</i>. If he separates from it for another place, both together come into his hand. That is difficult<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Clause missing in Rome ms., but quoted by R. Simson.</i>: If he took [produce] with the intention of taking from itself for itself, what comes into his hand is all <i>ṭevel</i>. If he changed his mind to use it for another place, both together come into his hand! If he took [produce] with the intention to use for another place, both together come into his hand. If he changed his mind to take from itself for itself, all that came into his hand is <i>ṭevel</i>! If he gave too little, all that came into his hand is <i>ṭevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is the case of our Mishnah. The clause is missing in the Leyden ms.</i>. If he added, both together came into his hand<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If we speak of heave, what he separated was more than he intended. If we speak of tithe, his produce is in order but his tithe is not, as stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 5:2:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.5.2.5"><i>Demay</i> Chapter 5, Note 40</a>.</i>.
Also if he is in error it is so. If he thought that two <i>se’ot</i> were due but he owed only one, Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: That [extra] <i>seah</i> which he separated he gives as heave for another place. But did we not state: “but not for another place”? Explain it if he increased the heave<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah is irrelevant here since it deals with the case that too little heave was given. It is permissible to give too much heave since its amount is not determined in biblical law, in contrast to tithes. Since the extra <i>seah</i> was declared as heave, it must remain in the sanctity of heave.</i>. It is acceptable if he increased the heave, but what about tithes? Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish did not state about tithes. But the reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish must be that, since we say that all the <i>ṭevel</i> is now in his hands, what is the difference between taking from it its own heave or that for another place<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If the reason given above, that we declare that all produce in his hand the second time around was genuine <i>ṭevel</i>, then this <i>ṭevel</i> should be usable for heave in all possible ways. He will restrict the use of the second batch only for freeing its own produce for tithes and heave of the tithe.</i>?
That is<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If the heave given was more than 50% of what was due, one follows R. Simeon ben Laqish. If less than 50% was given, one follows R. Eliezer ben Jacob in this paragraph. The Mishnah therefore is valid only in case exactly 50% were given.</i>, if most of the heap was put in order. If most of the heap was not put in order, there is disagreement between Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Joḥanan. As Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of Ḥizqiah, <i>ṭevel</i> becomes voided by plurality<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He disagrees with the generally accepted statement that by rabbinic decree, the prohibition of anything that can be put in order is not voided if it becomes an indistinguishable part of other produce or food; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 6:3:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.6.3.4"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 6:3, Notes 117–121</a>. It is agreed that in biblical law, the prohibition of any food becomes void by a plurality of permitted matter. Cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 8:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.8.2.2">Halakhah 8, Note 71</a>.</i>, but Rebbi Joḥanan said, <i>ṭevel</i> does not become voided by plurality. Since it was his intention to give, each single grain of wheat was labelled at its place<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As noted before, if it was the farmer’s intention to put in order only part of the heap, then the remainder is <i>ṭevel</i> and no one knows which grains are profane and which <i>ṭevel</i>.</i>. Some want to explain following Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob, as Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob stated, that he cannot separate either for itself or for another place<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If humans cannot distinguish between profane and <i>ṭevel</i>, humans cannot use the remainder of the heap for heave or tithes.</i>. This parallels the following<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The following text is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 2:1:10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.2.1.10">Chapter 2, Notes 26–28</a>.</i>: If there were before him two heaps and from each of them he took part of heave or tithes, may he take heave or tithe from one for the other? The students of the elder Rebbi Ḥiyya asked the elder Rebbi Ḥiyya and he said to them (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 4:5" href="/Ecclesiastes.4.5"><i>Eccl</i>. 4:5</a>): “The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.” Rebbi Eleazar in the name of the elder Rebbi Ḥiyya: He may not give heave or tithe from one for the other.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody’s produce was in a storage bin and he gave a <i>seah</i> to a Levite and a <i>seah</i> to a poor person, one may separate another eight <i>se’ot</i> and eat them, the words of Rebbi Meïr.

Isaac Simponti each give three explanations. Maimonides and R. Simson in his last explanation assume that the Mishnah speaks only of the farmer who is a Fellow. He gave the gifts to the Levite and the poor without saying anything; later he declares them to be tithes. R.

If he was seen giving one <i>seah</i> to a Levite and one (or at least 9/10 of a <i>seah</i>) to the poor (in a year when tithe of the poor was due), we may assume that they were given as tithes, or the farmer, when interrogated, may retroactively declare them to be tithes; eight <i>se’ot</i> (or exactly 8 1/10) are now in order and any of his workers who is a Fellow (as defined in the Introduction to <i>Demay</i>) may eat up to that amount, in the opinion of R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The rate of heave<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As rabbinic decrees; without a special declaration heave is not valid unless it complies with these guidelines.</i>: A generous person one in forty, the House of Shammay say, one in thirty.

He now is an unrelated person and his heave is not heave by Mishnah 1.

If he knew the intentions of the owner but [the owner] did not tell him: go and give heave following my intentions?

The answer is that intention to diminish within the legal bounds does not disqualify the agent.</i>! Rebbi Ḥanina ben Rebbi Hillel<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">He is R.

Rebbi Ḥaggai asked before Rebbi Yose: There<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Meilah 6:1" href="/Mishnah_Meilah.6.1">Mishnah <i>Me‘ilah</i> 6:1</a>, also quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 98b" href="/Ketubot.98b">Babli <i>Ketubot</i> 98b</a>. The case discussed is of a host who invited guests, told his agent to give each guest a piece of meat, the agent told each one to take two pieces, and each guest took three. Then it turned out that the meat was sacrificial meat illegally taken. The problem is, why should the host be liable for the action of an agent who clearly overstepped his authority, when the Mishnah here declares the agency to be null and void. One would infer that the host should not be guilty of larceny. In the Babli, the owner is held liable only if the agent told the guests to take one piece from the host and one from himself. This cannot be the interpretation of the Yerushalmi.</i>, we have stated: “If he said to him, give them one piece, but he said, take two each, and they took three each, all committed larceny;” but here you say so? He said to him, there the agency of the owner stopped after the first piece<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">But the owner bears the responsibility for the first piece, while in the case of heave for grain the responsibilities cannot be neatly divided; the agent either acts for the owner or he does not.</i>, but here each single grain of wheat is under the agency of the owner.

Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Rebbi Eliezer follows the House of Shammai; just as the House of Shammai say, it is sanctified as <i>dema‘</i>, so Rebbi Eliezer says it is sanctified as <i>dema‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For the statement of the House of Shammai, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 3:3:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.3.3.2">Chapter 3, Note 55</a>. According to R. Eliezer, if more than 11% is given as heave, then 10% are heave, 1% heave of the tithe, and the remainder is <i>ṭevel</i> as long as its tithes have not been given. Then one has the disagreement between Ḥizqiah and R. Joḥanan (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 1:1:22" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.1.1.22">Chapter 1, Notes 10–12</a>); following Ḥizqiah, a small amount of <i>ṭevel</i> can be disregarded, but not following R. Joḥanan.</i>.
In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan, it is simple. One tenth in it is holy as heave, of the remainder one tenth is heave and the rest is <i>ṭevel</i> for tithes. Therefore, he must declare: “The excess he should make heave of the tithe for another place<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The end of the paragraph shows that one must read here: “but not for another place.” Since in the opinion of R. Joḥanan even irregular heave eliminates all <i>ṭevel</i>, the excess over 11% can be separated and used for tithes from which heave of the tithe has already been given.</i>.” In the opinion of Ḥizqiah, it is difficult. One tenth in it is holy as heave, of the remainder one tenth is heave and the rest is <i>ṭevel</i> for everything<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ḥizqiah, <i>ṭevel</i> disappears in a plurality of other produce. If the amount given as heave is &lt; 20%, then the <i>ṭevel</i> part is less than the heave part and all is heave; one cannot give heave of the tithe since there is no more <i>ṭevel</i>. If the amount given is &gt; 20%, then the excess over 10%, if separated, remains <i>ṭevel</i> since heave was given to put the heap in order, not what was lifted as heave. That means that of the rest one first has to give heave and then he may lift heave of the tithe; this explains the involved statement in the next sentence. Ḥizqiah in Halakhah 1 of this Chapter holds that heave is determined only when it is actually taken; it is not predetermined which grain will be heave. Since everything is given as heave, it turns out that the problem is solved if Ḥizqiah reads the Mishnah in the version of his father R. Ḥiyya, that if the amount taken is &gt; 20% he may use the excess for any heave of any of his produce. Since Great Heave can be given only from earmarked produce, the natural thing to do is to use it for heave of the tithe which can be given from one place for another. (Explanation hinted at in מיכל המים.)<br>Since R. Ḥiyya was the teacher of Rav, it is indicated here that the version in the Mishnah found in most mss. is the Babylonian Mishnah.</i>. But we have stated: “The excess he should treat as heave of the tithe,” he should make it heave of the tithe for another place. Hizkiah holds with what Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, as Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: “The excess he should treat as heave of the tithe for another place.”
What is the reason of Rebbi Ismael? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:4" href="/Deuteronomy.18.4"><i>Deut</i>. 18:4</a>) “The beginning of your grain,” it is sufficient for the beginning to be like the grain<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">More than 50% cannot be called “beginning”.</i>.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> For three periods one calibrates the measuring box<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The basket used to collect figs.

He who counts is praiseworthy, he who measures is more praiseworthy, and he who weighs is the most praiseworthy of the three.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> He is praiseworthy relative to whom? Rebbi Huna said, praiseworthy relative to one who estimates heave.

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rebbi Eliezer says, heave is lifted<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">If heave falls into profane food it creates <i>dema‘</i>. If the amount of heave is small, it is possible to remove (“lift”) an amount equal to the heave and transfer the holiness to that food; the remainder of the food then returns to profane status. R. Eliezer states that in this respect “small” means at most 1 in 100 (1 part heave in 101 overall). R. Joshua requires that the amount be strictly less than 1 in 99+ε; ε&gt;0 being arbitrarily small. R. Yose ben Meshullam requires that the amount of heave be at most 1 in 99.1666̄; if the amount of heave is one <i>seah</i>, the amount of profane grain has to be 99 <i>seah</i> plus one sixth of the amount causing the trouble, i. e., 99 1/6 <i>seah</i>.</i> at the rate of one in 101. Rebbi Joshua says by 100 and more. This “and more” has no measure; Rebbi Yose ben Meshullam says “and more” is one <i>qab</i> per one hundred <i>seah</i>, one sixth of what makes <i>dema‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since 1 <i>seah</i> makes permanent <i>dema‘</i> in 100 <i>seot</i>, one sixth is a <i>qab</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> From where that they are not lifted? Rebbi Jonah said, it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:29" href="/Numbers.18.29"><i>Num</i>. 18:29</a>): “From all its best its sanctifying part from it.” Something from which you lift it, so that if this falls into anything it sanctifies it<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This argument proves only that heave creates <i>dema‘</i>, not that <i>dema‘</i> containing a minute amount of heave may be repaired.

However, in one opinion in the Babli, R. Simeon ben Laqish would exclude figs from this argument.</i>: If there were before him 150 amphoras which were opened: One hundred are permitted, fifty are forbidden, and the remainder will be permitted if they were opened.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> The reasoning of Rebbi Eliezer is inverted: There<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In Mishnah 10.</i>, he says that the lower ones help to lift the upper, and here he says “if the congealed contains”, therefore not the bottom ones.

What is the difference between boxes and storage bins? Boxes are usually moved around, storage bins are not.
Rebbi Zeїra, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Simeon: If two boxes were before him, in each one 50 <i>seah</i>, and one <i>seah</i> of heave fell into one of them but it is not known into which of them, if he wants to lift from any one of them he may do so, or he may lift half from this one and half from the other<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 6:12" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).6.12">Tosephta 6:12</a>, reading of the Erfurt ms. only.</i>. Similarly, if there were two gatherings of water<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">A gathering of water becomes a ritual bath if it contains 40 <i>seah</i> of natural water, i. e., water that never was in a vessel which can become impure.

It is stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Mikvaot 3:1" href="/Mishnah_Mikvaot.3.1">Mishnah <i>Miqwaot</i> 3:1</a> that the place of this water can be refilled with natural water for a ritual bath if slightly more than the original content was taken out.

Then in the worst case, if all water drawn out was good water, there are &lt; 3 <i>log</i> of disqualified water left and the place may be filled with 40 <i>seah</i> of natural water.

Rebbi Simon in the name of Bar Pedaiah: “If before him there were two boxes of fifty <i>seah</i> each; one <i>seah</i> of heave fell into one of them and it is known into which one it fell, then a second [<i>seah</i>] fell and it is not known into which it fell, one says that the second fell into the place of the first.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 6" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).6">Tosephta 6</a>:13 (both parts); a similar statement also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Mikvaot 2:2" href="/Tosefta_Mikvaot.2.2">Tosephta <i>Miqwaot</i> 2:3</a>.</i>” Why? Because one attaches the damage to the damaged. If in error he added to the known one and made [the heave] disappear, he lifts and makes it permitted. The second [<i>seah</i>] returns to be proven<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">If the first box contained 101 <i>seah</i>, one is lifted as replacement heave.

But the two boxes together now contain 150 <i>seah</i>, and this is more than enough to lift a second <i>seah</i> and eliminate <i>dema‘</i> altogether.</i>. It turns out that two <i>seot</i> may be lifted from 150 <i>seah</i>. “If there were two boxes of fifty <i>seah</i> each; one <i>seah</i> of heave fell into one of them and it is not known into which one it fell, then a second [<i>seah</i>] fell and it is known into which it fell, one does not say that the first fell into the place of the second<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">The declaration of damage cannot be retroactive.</i>.” If in error he added to one and made [the heave] disappear, he lifts and makes it permitted, but the second one remains forbidden until he would add to it in error.
If he said, what is below is heave, above all is profane, or what is below is all profane, above is heave, it depends on his opinion. Also for a <i>miqweh</i> it is the same: If he said, all water below is usable, above is unusable, or all water below is unusable, above is usable, it depends on his opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the statement of R. Simon, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 4:8:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.4.8.4">Note 111–112</a>. It is explained that not only may one choose which box (or water pool) to choose to remove heave (or water) from, but he may also choose the place from where to draw.</i>.
You say, one may lift from boxes but not from storage bins<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the statement at the beginning of the Halakhah, Note 111, which refers only to boxes.</i>. How is this? Two storage bins in two attics and a <i>seah</i> of heave fell into one of them, both are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">For the layman.</i>. If he added to one of them and made [heave] disappear in error, he lifts and makes permitted; the second bin, once he would accidentally add to it, will be permitted and does not need lifting since heave was already lifted.

The questioner assumes that all questionable heave is suspended; R. Yose points out that there are instances in which questionable heave is burned.</i>?

Rebbi Abbahu said, all our days we were groping about this as with a blind man’s stick until we learned it from mathematical computation. How much is in a <i>qab</i>? 24 eggs<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This is standard; a <i>qab</i> is 6 <i>log</i> and a <i>log</i> 4 eggs.

But since the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:21" href="/Numbers.15.21"><i>Num</i>. 15:21</a>) reads: “<i>From</i> the beginning of your dough you shall give …” the dough made for <i>ḥallah</i> cannot be exactly the volume of four eggs since something profane must be left over.</i>. One sixth of it are 16 eggs. If he makes a dough of six, it contains an impure egg<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">It is assumed that the flour was thoroughly mixed and homogenized.

He makes a dough from five and takes four.
The statement of Ḥizqiah says, on condition that no impurity the volume of an egg touch the indentation<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of this word depends on the interpretation of Mishnah <i>Ṭahorot</i> 1:10: “Loaves of sacrificial bread which have water in their גוּמוֹת, if one of them became impure by a crawling thing, they all are impure; for [loaves of] heave they make impure two stages and disqualify a third. If there is damp fluid between them, even for heave all is impure.” According to Maimonides, the indentations are depressions in the bread that still contain fluid. (It seems that for this reason, he wrote in the first version of his Commentary: “Indentations left on top of the bread at the time of cooking”, which in the last version he changed into: “at the time of baking.”) According to R. Simson, followed by R. Asher ben Ieḥiel, the baking sheet has depressions into which the dough is placed to obtain loaves of uniform size. The explanation of R.

What is an indentation in the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Under which circumstances does he admit that the situation envisaged by Ḥizqiah leads to impurity?</i>?

Abbahu’s interpretation of his position. The interpretation is rejected because it presupposes that pure and impure flour can be completely mixed, with a constant percentage of impure flour in the pure. Since presumably the two kinds are indistinguishable to the eye, mixing can not be assumed to be perfect. As a rough estimate, R. Joḥanan will admit R. Abbahu’s solution if not more than the volume of 17 eggs are mixed with 2 <i>seah</i> of pure flour (somewhat below 9%) and thoroughly mixed.</i>.
Rebbi Abba bar Mamai asked: Does this not contradict Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina?

If a piece of carcass meat is mixed up with pieces of slaughtered meat, probably it touched a piece belonging to the pure majority, but when all are carried, certainly the carcass piece also was carried.

The Tanna of the Mishnah assumes that it is impossible that in all these processes only heave be lifted; even in the worst case some profane grain will be lifted. Therefore, he does not have to say “permitted as long as the volume of heave is less than that of profane grain.” The grain is permitted unless the amount of heave which fell in is larger than half the original amount of profane grain. This is the position of R. Simson and R. Abraham ben David.<br>Maimonides’s explanation is difficult to understand. He permits the mixture if at most 100 times 1 <i>seah</i> fell into the produce and was lifted. He gives no explanation. R. Joseph Caro explains that in the previous Mishnaiot, when the Sages assert that the heave counted in the remaining produce is computed proportionally, they assume that there was perfect mixing of heave and profane before the excess <i>seah</i> was lifted. But in that case, if <i>t</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>i</sub> are the amounts of heave and profane in the mixture after <i>i seah</i> fell in and were lifted,<br><i>h</i><sub>i</sub><i>=</i> 100(100/101)<sup>i</sup><br>and <i>h</i><sub>i</sub><i>&lt;</i> 50 for integer <i>i &gt;</i> 69. {The solution of 100(100/101)<sup>i</sup> = 50 is <i>i =</i>69.66 …} Since, by definition, <i>t</i><sub>i</sub> <i>+ h</i><sub>i</sub><i>=</i>100, by the explanation of R.

Intentional sins cannot simply be atoned for; the guilt is eliminated either by punishment through a criminal court or by Divine justice (assuming the intentional sinner does not sincerely repent, otherwise repentance and the Day of Atonement will induce Divine mercy to wipe the slate clean.)<br>As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 8:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.8.1.4"><i>Kilaim</i> Chapter 8, Note 9</a>, a criminal court can impose biblical sanctions only if criminal intent is proven by two witnesses. This means that two witnesses testify that the alleged criminal was warned about the criminality of the act he seems intent to commit. The situation here is that the perpetrator knew that eating fat (those fatty parts of domesticated animals which in a sacrifice have to be burned on the altar) was forbidden but did not know what the punishment would be. In the Babli, R. Joḥanan holds that if he knew that eating fat was forbidden but not that it was a deadly sin he committed an intentional sin but an unintentional deadly sin, just as described here by R. Abbahu. If duly warned, he can be punished for eating fat as a misdemeanor but in addition he has to bring a sacrifice for the aspect of deadly sin of which he was oblivious, as asserted here also. R.

If somebody said, I would not touch the volume of an olive, but I will touch half the volume of an olive, Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, he is like a person who eats half the volume of an olive unintentionally and half the volume of an olive intentionally<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody agrees that for any prohibition regarding solid foods, no punishment by an earthly court can be imposed if the quantity consumed was less than the volume of an olive.

In <i>Šabbat</i> 12:6 (13d), this position is ascribed to Rabban Gamliel and the question about two olive halves is not answered.</i>.

If he [the Cohen] forgave and after that he [the Israel owner] ate, there is disagreement between Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish since they disagreed: If he robbed heave from his maternal grandfather, a Cohen, Rebbi Joḥanan said, he has to pay to the tribe, but Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, he pays to himself<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The robber has to repay the robbery, not double the value he took as is the rule for the thief.

But the Sages permit the latter.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Now Rebbi Meïr says, they pay, and the Sages say, they pay, what is between them? Rebbi Joḥanan said, the meal itself is between them.

Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: To what can this be compared, to one who sells something to another person, but it turns out that it was not his [to sell]. Does he not have to replace his buy? If you hold with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, this is fine. But if you hold with Rebbi Joḥanan, who said, the meal itself is between them, and you say so? He said following Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: The value of the meal is between them. If he promised them to feed them profane honey-cakes but he fed them heave honey-cakes. Did they not eat already?

Practically, a girl is a minor if she is less than 12 years old and becomes an adult at 12 years 6 months.

If the perjury was in a civil case, the perjurer has to pay to the injured party the amount the latter would have had to pay if the testimony had stood. Since this is the only punishment decreed by the verse, the perjurer cannot be flogged. {In criminal cases, the perjurer is flogged or executed, as the case may be.}</i>, here also he pays and is not flogged. Rebbi Jonah said, the reason of Nathan bar Hoshaiah: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:2" href="/Deuteronomy.25.2"><i>Deut</i>. 25:2</a>): “The judge shall have him laid down and flogged in his presence.” It refers to one whose flogging frees him from his guilt, excluding one who is told: get up and pay.
Our Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish! Did we not state “If somebody eats heave in error”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For him, there should be no difference between error and intentional transgression. The answer is that there is a difference, only for the linkage between payment and flogging there is no difference: Either flogging and paying in all cases go together or in no case is there flogging and a fine. Since the Mishnah clearly states that there is a fine, R. Simeon must hold with R. Meïr.</i>? He explains it following Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said, he is whipped and pays. But did we not state: “If somebody eats heave intentionally”? In the opinion of Nathan bar Hoshaiah who said, when he pays he is not flogged, it is understandable. In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan who said, if he was cautioned he is flogged, but if he was not cautioned he pays, he explains it as intentional without cautioning. In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish there is no difference between intentional and unintentional, between cautioned or not cautioned. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish holds with Rebbi Meïr since Rebbi Meïr says, he is flogged and he pays.
Rebbi Ḥinena said before Rebbi Mana: If Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish thought the entire Mishnaiot were Rebbi Meïr’s, he would call them “the words of Meïr.” But is it not written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:14" href="/Leviticus.22.14"><i>Lev</i>. 22:14</a>): “If a person ate consecrated food in error, etc.”? But Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish must hold that the fifth is a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since every deadly sin committed in error needs a sacrifice for atonement.</i>. But even if he holds that the fifth is a sacrifice, can the principal be a sacrifice? Rebbi Yudan bar Shalom said, the Mishnah declares that the principal is a fine, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 6:1.</i>: “He does not pay in heave but in totally profane food which is turned into heave.” If he had to pay from what he ate, it would be fine.

Rebbi Ṭarphon said to him, how is that, Aqiba? I am comparing this to the son of a divorcee or of a woman who had performed <i>ḥaliẓah</i>, and you compare it to one with a bodily defect.

Rebbi Aqiba said to him, the <i>miqweh</i> is invalid because of an inherent defect; the one with a bodily defect is disqualified because of an inherent defect.

On the other hand, the mention of the pig must have fallen out in the Babli since that source points out that the verse permits only the consumption of ruminants with cloven hoofs found inside a slaughtered animal. It is therefore determined, according to R.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If he was eating a bunch of grapes and entered from the garden into the courtyard. Rebbi Eliezer said, he should finish, but Rebbi Joshua said, he should not finish. If it got dark on Sabbath eve, Rebbi Eliezer said, he should finish, but Rebbi Joshua said, he should not finish<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Commentary of Maimonides: We have a principle that <i>ṭevel</i> becomes subject to tithes by biblical law only when the produce sees the face of the house as it was said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:13" href="/Deuteronomy.26.13"><i>Deut</i>. 26:13</a>): “I removed the holy food from the house.” Any fruits eaten on the field or in the garden are not subject to tithes because that is a snack. Another principle is that the Sabbath brings the obligation of tithes; it is forbidden to eat even a snack from <i>ṭevel</i> on the Sabbath since the Eternal said, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 58:13" href="/Isaiah.58.13"><i>Is</i>. 58:13</a>) “you should call the Sabbath a pleasure”. Therefore, all one has is prepared so that he may eat or drink from it on the Sabbath; this will be explained in Tractate <i>Ma‘serot</i> (Chapter 4). And when Rebbi Eliezer says “he should finish”, the meaning is that he should leave the courtyard again and finish. But in the courtyard he may not finish eating. And so they said on the Sabbath “he should finish”, <i>i. e.</i>, he should leave it alone until the end of the Sabbath day and only then finish. But on the Sabbath itself he is forbidden to eat it. And when R. Joshua said “he should not finish,” it means he should not continue to eat before he tithed.</i>.

But if it grows in the courtyard, it is immediately in front of the house. R. Ṭarphon permits taking an entire bunch, or an entire water melon, for a snack. Rebbi Aqiba allows only a few grapes or a small piece of watermelon for a snack and requires taking heave and tithing for everything else.</i>, one may take an entire bunch, and similarly for pomegranate and water melon, the words of Rebbi Ṭarphon.” Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Ṭarphon says following Rebbi Eliezer. Rebbi Ṭarphon says, one makes the cut<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ma‘serot</i>: עוקצין, “the stalk”, what remains if everything else is eaten.</i> of food equal to its start.

What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? Because he started with permission.

Joshua and R. Aqiba are greater authorities than R. Eliezer and R. Ṭarphon and Maimonides is justified in deciding following R. Joshua.

If there is enough profane wine to let one lift heave according to the rules of Chapter 5, not much is lost since the wine remains usable. But if heave cannot be lifted because the profane is not more than 100 times the heave all becomes forbidden and, at most, can be used as ointment or to sprinkle on a dirt floor to eliminate dust.

They fined him that his field should be worthless under the heave<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since the yield will be heave, the farmer sowing intentionally will be deprived of the use of his field for the entire growing season.</i>.
Rebbi Samuel bar Eudaimon asked: Can he be trusted if he says, I did it intentionally<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If he prefers to have a field of heave to having to plough it under.</i>?
