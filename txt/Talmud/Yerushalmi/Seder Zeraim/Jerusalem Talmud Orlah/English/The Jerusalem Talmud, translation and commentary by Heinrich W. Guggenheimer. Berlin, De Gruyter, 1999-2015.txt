Jerusalem Talmud Orlah



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody plants for fences or building logs he is exempt from ‘<i>orlah</i>. Rebbi Yose says, even if he says the inner part is for food, the outer part for a fence<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A tree planted at the border between an orchard and the public domain. If he intends that the part facing the public domain should be integrated into a fence then the part facing the public is exempt from ‘<i>orlah</i> if he does not intend to harvest its yield in the future. But the inner part which will be harvested is obligated.</i>, the inner part is obligated but the outer is exempt.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody plants for fences or building logs he is exempt,” etc. It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:23" href="/Leviticus.19.23"><i>Lev</i>. 19:23</a>): “If you plant any food tree.” What is for food is obligated; for fencing, logs, or wood it is exempt. Then the one for food even if he intended it as a fence should be obligated! The verse says, “a food tree<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It says “a food tree”, not “a fruit tree” as in the Creation story (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 1:11-12" href="/Genesis.1.11-12"><i>Gen</i>. 1:11–12</a>); it must be intended for food; a fruit tree grown for its timber is exempt. A similar argument in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Kedoshim, Section 3 2" href="/Sifra,_Kedoshim,_Section_3.2"><i>Sifra Qedošim Parsha</i> 3(2</a>).</i>.”
Rebbi Yose understood the text from its beginning, from the meaning of what is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:23" href="/Leviticus.19.23"><i>Lev</i>. 19:23</a>): “Three years it shall be like ‘foreskin’ for you, it may not be eaten.” Does this not imply that the verse speaks about a fruit tree? Why does the verse say: “If you plant any food tree”? What is for food is obligated, for fencing, logs, or wood is exempt. Rebbi Jonah understood the text from its end, from the meaning of what is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:25" href="/Leviticus.19.25"><i>Lev</i>. 19:25</a>): “In the fifth year you shall eat its fruit, to increase its yield for you.” Does this not imply that the verse speaks about a fruit tree? Why does the verse say: “If you plant any food tree”? What is for food is obligated; for fencing, logs, or wood it is exempt.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Orlah (Lieberman) 1" href="/Tosefta_Orlah_(Lieberman).1">Tosephta 1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Kedoshim, Section 3 3" href="/Sifra,_Kedoshim,_Section_3.3"><i>Sifra Qedošim Parsha</i> 3(3</a>).</i>: “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, when has this been said? If he planted for fencing, logs, or wood, kinds appropriate for that use. If he planted an inappropriate kind it is obligated.” Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said it correctly, what is the reason of the rabbis? Rebbi Zeïra said, if he changed the way it is usually planted<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For the majority, a tree bearing edible fruit is exempt only if from the start it is treated so that any passer-by will see that the tree is not intended as fruit tree. In this version, the restriction of the rabbis is rabbinic. For Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel it all depends on the planter’s intention, an attitude rejected by R. Simeon ben Ioḥai in Mishnah <i>Ševi‘it</i> 2:1.<br>The Rome ms. does not read במשנה; then R. Zeïra’s is a straight declarative sentence: “The way it is usually planted: …” In this version, the rabbis eliminate the intention of the planter as a matter of biblical law.</i>: For wood tightly together, for logs cutting off branches, for a fence the location of the fence proves it.
It was stated in the name of Rebbi Meïr: “All trees can be exempted by intention except olive and fig trees.” Rebbi Meïr is consistent since he says<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 6:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.6.3.1">Mishnah <i>Kilaim</i> 6:6</a>. He holds there that any “futile” fruit-bearing tree may be planted in a vineyard to support the spreading vines without infringing on the prohibition of mixing species in a vineyard.</i> all trees are futile except olive and fig trees.
It was stated in the name of Rebbi Simeon: The only kinds admitting an intention of exemption are three: [buckthorn]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with R. S. Cirillo רימין for רימון, defined by Maimonides (<i>Demay</i> 1:1) by Arabic נַבק “buckthorn, lotus fruit.” Pomegranate trees (רימון) have valuable fruits and are not planted for their wood. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.1.1"><i>Demay</i> 1, Note 4</a>.</i>, sycamore, and caper bush. Are these obligated for tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with R. S. Cirillo רימין for רימון, defined by Maimonides (<i>Demay</i> 1:1) by Arabic נַבק “buckthorn, lotus fruit.” Pomegranate trees (רימון) have valuable fruits and are not planted for their wood. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.1.1"><i>Demay</i> 1, Note 4</a>.</i>? This is a dispute between Rebbi Abba bar Mamal and Rebbi Hila. They differed: If somebody kept his fruit trees for wood, Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said he is obligated, Rebbi Hila said he is exempted. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said he is obligated, from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma‘serot</i> 1:1, Note 20.</i>: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:29" href="/Deuteronomy.14.29"><i>Deut</i>. 14:29</a>) “The Levite shall come, because he has neither part nor inheritance with you.” You are obliged to give him from what you have but he has not<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since the fruits of the tree destined to be cut down as fire wood remain private property, they are subject to tithes. The next two sentences are irrelevant here; they are just copied from the source in <i>Ma‘serot</i>.</i>. This excludes abandoned property for which your and his hands are equal. Gleanings, forgotten sheaves, <i>peah</i>, and abandoned property are all equal.
Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Yose said he is exempt, from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ma‘serot</i> 4:5.</i>: “If coriander is sown for its seed, its greenery is free.” Coriander is different since it has a different threshing floor<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The seeds. Exempting the greenery is not exempting the entire plant.</i>. But he says from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma‘serot</i> 1:1, Notes 32–36. If somebody keeps an entire cabbage patch to grow seeds it does not exempt the patch from tithes even though the seeds are inedible.</i>: “If someone keeps cabbage for seeds, his opinion is inoperative; for single stalks it is not inoperative.” Rebbi Jonah said, only if he collected greens. But if he did not collect greens, do we say that wood is subject to tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Fruits from trees grown for their wood are subject to the laws of ‘<i>orlah</i> only if they are taken down. Since it is stated later that ‘<i>orlah</i> is forbidden for any use, declaring the fruits as wood makes them usable.</i>?
Are these forbidden because of robbery? Is wood not also forbidden because of robbery? What is his problem? For example, mulberry trees having no solidity<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">If a mulberry tree visibly is grown for firewood (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Orlah 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Orlah.1.1.4">Note 5</a>), is it permitted for strangers to take mulberries without paying for them since these cannot be used as firewood? The question is not answered. (Explanation of R. Eliahu Fulda.)</i>.
A buckthorn<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with R. S. Cirillo רימין for רימון, defined by Maimonides (<i>Demay</i> 1:1) by Arabic נַבק “buckthorn, lotus fruit.” Pomegranate trees (רימון) have valuable fruits and are not planted for their wood. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.1.1"><i>Demay</i> 1, Note 4</a>.</i> planted for buckthorn berries, a myrtle planted for myrtle berries<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">These trees are not usually planted for their berries.</i>, some Tannaïm stated: obligated, some Tannaïm stated: exempt. Rav Ḥisda said, he who said “obligated”, at a place where most are guarded<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The rare places where the berries of these bushes are eaten and valuable.</i>; he who said “exempt”, at a place where the majority do not guard. Rebbi Yose asked, if it is at a place where most do guard why does he have to think, even if he did not think! Are we saying: Olive trees and fig trees only if the thinks about them<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since these are always guarded and used for their fruit, nobody thinks that they are subject to ‘<i>orlah</i> only if expressly planted for their fruit. Therefore, at a place where myrtle berries customarily are used in food, the individual’s intent should be irrelevant.</i>? But even if one half do guard, one half do not guard<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, no preponderant use is established.</i>! Rebbi Matthew<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rome ms.: R. Mattaniah.</i> understood this from the final statement: “At a place where the majority<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">“The majority do not” means “strictly more than one-half”.</i> do not guard” even if he did not think it is exempt.
Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Joẓadaq: A vine growing in a copse is exempt from ‘<i>orlah</i>. Rebbi Yose said, even if he planted it. But did we not state: “If it grew by itself it is obligated for ‘<i>orlah</i>”? There, when it was planted in a cultivated place, but here if it was planted in a copse. Rebbi Eleazar said, this means if its yield is not worth its tending but if its yield is worth its tending it is obligated.
Rav Ḥuna asked: If an <i>etrog</i> tree<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>etrog</i> is identified as the “fruit of the splendid tree” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:40" href="/Leviticus.23.40"><i>Lev</i>. 23:40</a>) to be taken in procession on the holiday of Tabernacles. If ‘<i>orlah</i> did apply, then the fruits of the young tree would not be usable. The question presupposes that the <i>etrog</i> is edible, the fruit of <i>Citrus medica cedrata</i>, cf. <i>Ma‘serot</i> 1, Note 86, but it is not intended to be eaten.</i> was planted for its obligation, is it obligated for ‘<i>orlah</i>? Rav Ḥuna came back and said: An <i>etrog</i> tree planted for its obligation is obligated for ‘<i>orlah</i>. Did we not state there: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:40" href="/Leviticus.23.40"><i>Lev</i>. 23:40</a>) “You shall buy for yourselves” and not from the obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The “four kinds”, <i>etrog</i>, palm fronds, myrtle, and willow twigs, should be acquired for the holiday, not taken from what is already obligated for religious purposes; in the case of the <i>etrog</i> this refers to fruits of Second Tithe brought to Jerusalem for the holiday.</i>? There, “you shall buy <i>for yourselves</i>” with money, not from the obligation. But here, as you say in the matter of <i>shofar</i>, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:24" href="/Leviticus.23.24"><i>Lev</i>. 23:24</a>) “a day of blasts it shall be <i>for you</i>”, from anywhere<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since “religious obligations are not for usufruct”, a <i>shofar</i> can be used for blowing even if it is forbidden for usufruct.</i>. And here, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:23" href="/Leviticus.19.23"><i>Lev</i>. 19:23</a>): “Three years it shall be like ‘foreskin’ <i>for you</i>, it may not be eaten,” in any way. What is the difference between this<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Using the <i>etrog</i> for Tabernacles instead as food.</i> and him who guards his fruits to use as wood? He wants the tree itself just as he wants the fruits. But here, he wants the fruit and is not interested in the tree. In addition, as Rebbi Ḥanina said, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:40" href="/Leviticus.23.40"><i>Lev</i>. 23:40</a>) “fruit”; if you say it is part of the tree nobody can acquit himself of his obligation on the holiday! What can be compared to it? An olive tree planted for light on Ḥanukkah. Rebbi Yose bar Abun said, one is biblical, the other rabbinic! And you say so? What can be compared to it? An olive tree planted to light the candelabrum<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">An olive tree planted with the idea that its fruits should be used exclusively to produce oil for the candelabrum in the Temple. By the preceding argument, it is subject to the rules of ‘<i>orlah</i>.</i>; then both are biblical.
Rebbi Simeon ben Yaqim asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: If he planted the lower part as fence but the upper part for food, or the lower part for food but the upper part as fence? He said to him, one is like the other, whether the upper part for food but the lower part as fence, or the lower part for food but the upper part as fence<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden (corrected) זמודה, Leyden uncorrected and Venice ומודה “and agrees”.</i>. How does one know? He brings a string and ties it as a sign: So far as fence, the excess for food.
Rebbi Zeïra asked: One understands if the lower part is for a fence but the upper part for food, but the lower part for food but the upper part as fence? It grows out of something forbidden and you say so? Rebbi Zeïra follows his own opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 5:6:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.5.6.4"><i>Kilaim</i> 5:7, Note 76</a>.</i>, as Rebbi Zeira said in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: An onion from <i>kilaim</i> in a vineyard which he removed from the soil and planted anew is forbidden even if it increases manifold, since growth of what is forbidden can never justify forbidden produce.
If he planted as a fence and then thought to use it for food, it goes after his thought. [If he first thought to use it] for food and then thought to use it as a fence, his [intent] cannot be accepted<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">An obligation can be created by intent; it cannot be removed by intent.</i>. If he planted as a fence the first year and afterwards thought to use it for food, since he thought to obligate it is obligated. But did we not state: “Rebbi Yose says, even if the inner part is for food, the outer part as fence, the inner part is obligated but the outer is exempt”? There, what is for food is always for food, for a fence always for a fence, but here, since he proceeded with a thought of obligation, it is obligated.
If he planted as a fence for three years, afterwards thought to use it for food, and it grew more? Rebbi Jeremiah said the addition is exempt, Rebbi Abba said the addition is obligated. Rebbi Yose said, the opinion of Rebbi Jeremiah seems to be difficult but it is only reasonable, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma‘serot</i> 5:4, Note 66. It seems that R. Jeremiah follows R. Aqiba in holding that any branches grown after the first three years are exempt from ‘<i>orlah</i>.</i>: “If a field became one-third ripe in the possession of a Gentile and a Jew bought it, Rebbi Aqiba says the addition is exempt. But the Sages say, the addition is obligated.” In our case the stem is exempt and its addition should be obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This is R. Yose’s argument that R. Jeremiah’s position is reasonable: Grain one-third grown is only potentially subject to tithes, after harvesting and processing. Since usually grain is not harvested one-third grown, any additional growth after one-third is normally subject to tithes. But after three years, the stem of a tree has totally outgrown any obligation of ‘<i>orlah</i>.</i>?
Rebbi Joḥanan said, the words of Rebbi Ismael: Anything not subject to <i>‘orlah</i> is not subject to the fourth year<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The year following the three years of <i>‘orlah</i> when (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:24" href="/Leviticus.19.24"><i>Lev</i>. 19:24</a>) “in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy for praises of the Eternal.”</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan asked: Until it was subject to <i>‘orlah</i> for three years? Rebbi Jonah said, he asked about the principle of <i>‘orlah</i> and no principle of <i>‘orlah</i> is less than three years<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Jonah, no period of <i>‘orlah</i> less than three years can induce the holiness of the fourth year fruits.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, he asked about the principle of the fourth year; anything not having three years is not subject to <i>‘orlah</i> and not subject to the fourth year<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">According to him, any period of <i>‘orlah</i> which ends at the end of the third year after planting induces the holiness of the fourth year fruits; no plant not surviving a full three years can be subject to <i>‘orlah</i>.</i>.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Ma‘serot</i> 2:22. A different text in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 22a" href="/Gittin.22a">Babli (<i>Giṭṭin</i> 22a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 27b" href="/Bava_Batra.27b"><i>Baba Batra</i> 27b</a>; also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 59b" href="/Nedarim.59b"><i>Nedarim</i> 59b</a>) attributes to Rebbi the statement here of R. Joḥanan. “Outside the Land” excludes Syria, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Orlah 3:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Orlah.3.7.1">Mishnah 3:9</a>.</i>: “If a tree is partially planted in the Land and partially outside the Land, since it is partially planted in the Land it is as if completely planted in the Land, the words of Rebbi. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, the part planted in the Land is obligated, the part planted outside the Land is free.” Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It is as if <i>ṭevel</i> and tithed are mixed together<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that, for Rebbi, fruits from this tree cannot be used as heave and tithe for other trees, neither can any fruit from this tree be freed from the obligation of heave and tithes by anything but other fruits from the same tree. The reason is that each fruit is both obligated and not obligated; taking from another tree would be potentially tithing from what is obligated for what is not obligated.</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: An exempt root exempts. Is that following Rebbi who said roots live off one another? It is the opinion of everybody. Here, an exempt root exempts. When you say that an exempt root exempts, [you deal with] an old root that expanded from its own ground to that of another’s<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If an older fruit tree develops a new stem from an old root, the new stem is exempt from the rules of <i>‘orlah</i> since it is considered a branch of the old tree. This is important for “sinking” branches (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 7:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.7.1.1"><i>Kilaim</i> 7:1, Note 1</a>).</i>; but if it extended from outside the Land into the Land it<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The previous argument. An “exempt root” is not one exempt from the start but one that has outgrown its <i>‘orlah</i> status.</i> does not apply.
An exempt root exempts. But did we not state: “Rebbi Yose says, even if the inner part is for food, the outer part as fence, the inner part is obligated but the outer is exempt”? Should not the outer part make the inner exempt? Rebbi Zeïra said it anonymously, Rebbi La in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: He might think about it to obligate it.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The roots are not exempt; part of the tree is exempt by force of the (revocable) intention of the planter.</i>
Rebbi Assi in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Roots do not count. Rebbi Zeïra said to Rebbi Assi, did you hear that explicitly from Rebbi Joḥanan or did you discuss <i>‘orlah</i> and this came up relating to First Fruits when he said, roots do not count<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Since in presenting First Fruits to the Temple the farmer has to declare (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:10" href="/Deuteronomy.26.10"><i>Deut</i>. 26:10</a>): “Here I brought the first of the fruits of the land You gave me,” one might think that a tree on the farmer’s land whose roots extend under the land of another owner would be disqualified for First Fruits. Maybe the statement of R. Joḥanan means only that any tree on the farmer’s land qualifies, without implications for the rules of <i>‘orlah</i>?</i>? Rebbi Zeïra said, what we say, roots do not count, if the roots spread from outside the Land into the Land. But when they spread from the Land to outside the Land they do count<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Any tree in the Land is obligated, even if its root started growing outside the Land.

If one bound it to an old tree<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">“Binding” is an inexact expression (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 6:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.6.4.1">Mishnah <i>Kilaim</i> 6:9</a>); the young tree is grafted or otherwise made to be fed by the old tree.</i> it is exempt, to [a tree] outside the Land it is exempt. To a dedicated [tree] it is obligated, to the lower or upper part it is obligated. To a dedicated [tree] it is obligated because one might redeem it and make it obligated. To the lower part it is obligated because he might think about and obligate it<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The same argument as above, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Orlah 1:1:18" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Orlah.1.1.18">Note 41</a>.</i>.
Does Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In the Mishnah, Note 1.</i> follow Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In the Tosephta dealing with heave and tithes from a tree on the border line, Note 37.</i>? He might even hold with Rebbi! <i>‘Orlah</i> depends on one’s intention, tithes do not depend on his intention.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> When our forefathers came into the Land, what they found planted was exempt. If they planted even though they had not yet conquered, it was obligated. If somebody plants for the benefit of the public<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">But on his private property.</i>, it is obligated; Rebbi Jehudah exempts<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This is not discussed in the Yerushalmi.

The other cases of the Mishnah are discussed in the Halakhah.</i>, the robber who planted, and he who plants on a ship, are obligated for <i>‘orlah</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:21" href="/Leviticus.19.21"><i>Lev</i>. 19:21</a>) “When you plant,” this excludes what Gentiles planted before Israel came to the Land<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Kedoshim, Section 3 2" href="/Sifra,_Kedoshim,_Section_3.2"><i>Sifra Qedošim Parašah</i> 3(2</a>).</i>. Rebbi Huna in the name of Rebbi Abba, this implies that an exempt root exempts<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since a tree planted a day before Israel crossed the Jordan is permanently exempt.</i>.
“If they planted even though they had not yet conquered, it was obligated.” Following Rebbi Ismael who said all “comings”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Any command introduced by the words “it shall be when you come into the Land” applies only after the distribution of the Land to the tribes which by rabbinic tradition was 14 years after the crossing of the Jordan, cf. <i>Seder Olam</i> Chap. 11 (in the author’s edition, Northvale NJ 1998, Notes 3–5). Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 6:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.6.1.3"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 6, Note 10</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 2:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.2.1.5"><i>Ḥallah</i> 2:1, Note 12</a>. The statement of R. Ismael is discussed at length in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 37a-38a" href="/Kiddushin.37a-38a">Babli <i>Qiddušin</i> 37a–38a</a>; it is also quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:4:2-9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.7.4.2-9">Yerushalmi <i>Soṭah</i> 7:4</a> (fol. 21c), 9:1 (fol. 23c).</i> said in the Torah refer to after 14 years, seven when they conquered and seven when they distributed? Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Rebbi Ismael agrees in the cases of <i>ḥallah</i> and <i>‘orlah</i>. It was also stated thus: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:18" href="/Numbers.15.18"><i>Num</i>. 15:18</a>)<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This argument, directly attributed to R. Ismael in <i>Sifry Šelaḥ #110</i>, applies only to <i>ḥallah</i> where the usual form כבאכם is used. The rules for <i>‘orlah</i> start: וכי תבאו אל הארץ but it does not say וירשתם וישבתם בה “after you inherited and settled there.” This kind of argument is applicable only to the Babylonian version which insists not on “coming” but on “settling”.

How is this? One says, all sources of taste by one in 100; the other one says, all sources of taste by one in 60.

Since Rav Ḥuna said, the husks of what is forbidden combine to permit, that means waste of heave combines with profane to lift the heave.
Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: All I forbade to you at other places I permitted to you here.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Heave, heave of the tithe of <i>demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">All mss. of the Maimonides tradition and many of the better Mishnah mss. read: Heave, heave of the tithe, and heave of the tithe of <i>demay</i>. This text is understood in the Halakhah. By definition of <i>demay</i>, there is no heave of <i>demay</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Heave and heave of the tithe”, etc. For whom is this<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The statement that all the categories mentioned in the first statement combine.</i> needed? For Rebbi Simeon. Even though Rebbi Simeon says that two different names do not combine, he agrees that all items called “heave” do combine.
Who stated “heave of the tithe of <i>demay</i>”? Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr is as strict with their word as with the words of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since the institution of <i>demay</i> is rabbinic, the rules for heave of the tithe of <i>demay</i> are more lenient than those for biblical heave; cf. Introduction to Tractate Demay. Only R. Meïr does not recognize these differences.</i>. Where do we find that Rebbi Meïr is as strict with their word as with the words of the Torah? Rebbi Ḥanina said, the following which we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 6:13. A woman finding a blood stain on her underwear at a time when she does not expect her period does not know when to expect her next period since possibly the stain comes from menstrual blood. A woman is impure by flux if she has episodes for three successive days at a time when menstrual blood is excluded. In that case, she may not enter the Temple without bringing a sacrifice of purification (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:29-30" href="/Leviticus.15.29-30"><i>Lev</i>. 15:29–30</a>). R. Meïr requires a sacrifice because of the possibility of impurity but the sacrifice of purification may not be eaten by the Cohanim since possibly it was unnecessary.</i>: “A woman who sees a stain [on her clothes] is out of order and must consider the possibility of flux, the words of Rebbi Meïr. But the Sages say that stains do not imply flux<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:25" href="/Leviticus.15.25"><i>Lev</i>. 15:25</a>) requires “blood flowing”, the impurity of stains is purely rabbinical. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 52b" href="/Niddah.52b">Babli, <i>Niddah</i> 52b</a>, the position of the “Sages” is also considered a minority opinion, attributable to R. Ḥanina ben Antigonos. Since the later chapters of the Yerushalmi <i>Niddah</i> are lost, we do not know the position of the Yerushalmi in this matter.</i>.”
Rebbi Jonah asked: Why did we not also state “<i>ḥallah</i> of <i>demay</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Which one takes if he buys bread from an untrustworthy baker; <i>Demay</i> Mishnah 5:3.</i> as we did state “<i>ḥallah</i>”?

Rebbi Ḥanania in the name of Samuel: <i>Demay</i> does not need <i>ḥallah</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Julianus said to him, one takes its value from the tribe. He answered him, that is what Samuel said, one takes its value from the tribe<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This explains the cryptic first statement of R. Samuel. One has to take <i>ḥallah</i> if one buys bread from an untrustworthy baker but one may sell it to a Cohen. Since the Cohen has to eat even the <i>demay ḥallah</i> under the rules of purity of heave, he will not pay much for the <i>ḥallah</i>.</i>. Rebbi Mana in the name of Rebbi Yose: One does not take its value from the tribe; tomorrow he will bring certain [<i>ḥallah</i>] and say it is <i>demay</i> in order to take its value from the tribe!

If 200 [volume units] were left in the vat one [volume unit] of ‘<i>orlah</i> or vineyard <i>kilaim</i> fell into the vat, that they become insignificant by one in 200. “From the drink of Israel,” that all sacrifices should be from what is permitted to Israel, where all food is subsumed under the appellation of “drink”.</i>. It is difficult! It is written 200 and Rebbi Jehudah says 100<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This objection is not answered. It seems that the question depends on the definition of “Israel” in the verse. If “Israel” means “some of Israel”, then the verse does not deal with the case of heave because that is permitted to Cohanim, it would be “drink of Israel.” If “Israel” means “all of Israel”, then one would expect that heave also needs 200 for lifting.</i>. It is written alive<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">“A sheep” means a living sheep.</i> and Rebbi Jehudah says slaughtered.

The officiating Cohen receives one of these as gift added to the <i>nazir</i>’s well-being sacrifice; therefore, the loaves may be eaten by the Cohen’s family anywhere in the city of the sanctuary. If there is a mix-up of the oils, the anointed loaves can be eaten only by the Cohen in the Temple precinct.</i>; so we have stated, two drinks.

“ ‘<i>Orlah</i> and vineyard <i>kilaim</i> are lifted by one and 200.” It is written “the fulness, the fulness.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Heave is called “fulness” in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:28" href="/Exodus.22.28"><i>Ex</i>. 22:28</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:27" href="/Numbers.18.27"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>.

Rebbi Simeon says, two or three names from one kind, or two kinds of the same name, do not combine.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> We understand two names for one kind. But two kinds of one name? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: They taught this about sweeteners.
Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, there are three kinds of imparting taste. Anything a common person tastes and says, this dish is not missing anything, if it fell in, it may improve the taste but is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Since the person who is not a professional cook or food taster finds the dish perfect, the later addition of forbidden spice either does not add anything; then it will be permitted if it is less than 1/100 (or 1/200) of the whole; or it will spoil the taste and be permitted outright.</i>.

Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, all forbidden [food] is estimated as if it were onion, as if it were leeks<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 10:1:5-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.10.1.5-6"><i>Terumot</i> 10:1, Notes 8–12</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 97b" href="/Chullin.97b">Babli <i>Ḥulin</i> 97b</a>. Any foodstuffs usually estimated as if they were onion, as if they were leeks, are ingredients for cooking.

That is, anything usually estimated as if it were onion, as if it were leeks. Anything which is not usually estimated as if it were onion, as if it were leeks, how do you estimate it? How do you estimate cumin?
Rebbi Yudan said, did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, they taught this about sweeteners? Since sweeteners usually are estimated as if they were onion or leeks, one estimates them as if they were onion or leeks.

Rebbi Mana did not say so but: Did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, they taught this about sweeteners? Since sweeteners all taste the same, they are estimated as if they were onion, as if they were leeks.

That means that if he soaked grapes and then soaked his bread in that, if it<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The amount of water soaked up by the bread.</i> adds up to the volume of an olive, he is guilty.

The leather goods become impure but they can be purified by immersion; after they have been dried, the impure oil absorbed in the leather has no influence (unless the leather becomes wet and some impure oil starts to ooze out., <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 8:15" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).8.15">Tosephta <i>Terumot</i> 8:15</a>.)</i> were oiled first with impure oil<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Which is cheaper than pure oil.</i> and then with pure, or first with pure and then with impure, Rebbi Eliezer says I am going after the first, but the Sages say after the last<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">If the oiled leather becomes wet, R.

Joḥanan in a second version. In this first version, Ḥizqiah must hold that an inference from a verse is only valid if there is no second verse leading to the same result. The theoretical basis is the recognition that the legal texts in the Torah are incomplete and sometimes contradictory as a system. In addition, it is held that words do not change their meaning in legal contexts. Therefore, a mechanism of translation of the Torah text into a coherent and reasonably complete system must exist. The rule appealed to by Ḥizqiah is one of the translation rules; cf. H. Guggenheimer, <i>Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition</i>, in: Ph. Longworth (ed.), Confrontations with Judaism (London 1966) pp. 171–196.<br>Since here the torn limb and the carcass both lead to the same argument, one of them would be superfluous and, therefore, both must be needed for other inferences.

But is it not written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:23" href="/Leviticus.7.23"><i>Lev</i>. 7:23</a>): “Any fat of cattle, sheep, or goats you shall not eat”? Do you not have to understand the prohibition of usufruct from the prohibition of eating? There is a difference, for it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:24" href="/Leviticus.7.24"><i>Lev</i>. 7:24</a>): “But fat of a carcass and fat of a torn animal”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">“But fat of a carcass and fat of a torn animal may be used for any work, only you shall not eat it.” This paragraph discusses verses which present a difficulty for R. Eleazar.<br>In the opinion of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 23a" href="/Pesachim.23a">Babli, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 23a</a>, the verse is needed to permit <i>any</i> use of profane fat since otherwise one would argue that since fat is forbidden for humans but required for the altar, fat of animals unfit for the altar should be permitted for use in the Temple but forbidden for profane use. In the <i>Sifra</i>(<i>Ẓaw</i> <i>Paraša</i> 10), the argument of the Babli is attributed to R. Yose the Galilean; R. Aqiba concludes that fat of domesticated animals is not food and not subject to the impurity of food.<br>In the opinion of the Yerushalmi, since some fat is permitted for unrestricted use, no fat can be forbidden for usufruct in the absence of an explicit verse. For Ḥizqiah, this is a third verse that could be used for R. Eleazar’s argument; nobody will contest that three parallel verses invalidate the argument. In the second version of Ḥizqiah’s position (below, after <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Orlah 3:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Orlah.3.1.8">Note 33</a>), he needs the verse to permit use of fat for work on Temple property.</i>. But is it not written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 12:16" href="/Deuteronomy.12.16"><i>Deut</i>. 12:16</a>): “Only the blood”?

The argument of the Yerushalmi, and an argument that animal blood prepares for impurity in all cases, is in <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 73 and later here, in the second version of Ḥizqiah.</i> Since water is permitted for use, so blood is permitted for use. But is it not written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 32:33" href="/Genesis.32.33"><i>Gen</i>. 32:33</a>): “Therefore, the Children of Israel do not eat the sinew of the schiatic muscle”?

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> What is a doubtful case of <i>‘orlah?</i> An <i>‘orlah</i> vineyard and grapes are sold on the outside; in the Land of Israel it is forbidden, in Syria permitted. Rebbi Yudan said, in that doubtful case also it is forbidden in Syria. What is a doubtful case in Syria? A vineyard planted with vegetables, a vegetable field next to it, and vegetables are sold on the outside; in the Land of Israel it is forbidden, in Syria permitted. <sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta 4. “That also” is the scenario of the Mishnah regarding vineyard <i>kilaim.</i></i>“Rebbi Jehudah said, that also is forbidden in Syria. Which doubtful case is permitted in Syria? If a vineyard is planted with vegetables, a field of vegetables is nearby, and vegetables are sold on the outside, in the Land of Israel it is forbidden, in Syria permitted.”
“Outside the Land he goes, he harvests on condition that he not harvest with his own hands<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">He (the Gentile seller) harvests on condition that he (the Jewish buyer) not harvest himself, but the Jew may see the Gentile harvesting.</i>.” Rebbi Yudan said, that also should be equal to the first, “he turns in and buys on condition he not see him harvesting<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">On condition he (the Jewish buyer) not see him (the Gentile seller).</i>.”
“New grain is forbidden everywhere from the Torah.” The Mishnah is Rebbi Eliezer’s as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.8.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 1:9</a>. The parallel discussion is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 38" href="/Kiddushin.38">Babli, <i>Qiddušin</i> 38a/b</a>.</i>: “Any commandment not connected with the Land applies both inside and outside the Land. But any connected with the Land applies only inside the Land except for <i>‘orlah</i> and <i>kilaim.</i> Rebbi Eliezer says, also new grain.” What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">The end of this paragraph and the next one are also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:8:2-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.8.2-6"><i>Qiddušin</i> 1:9</a>, fol. 61d.</i>? Everywhere, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:14" href="/Leviticus.23.14"><i>Lev.</i> 23:14</a>) “in all your dwelling places,” both inside and outside the Land. How do the rabbis explain the reason of Rebbi Eliezer, “in all your dwelling places”? New grain from here which was exported.
Rebbi Jonah asked before Rebbi Yose: Why did we not state <i>ḥallah</i> with these<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Which applies outside the Land by rabbinic decree.</i>? He said to him, our Mishnah only deals with something which applies to Israel and the Gentiles<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Which is forbidden to Jews even if grown by Gentiles. For <i>kilaim</i>, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:7:3-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.7.3-5"><i>Kilaim</i> 1:7, Notes 122–140</a>.</i>. But <i>ḥallah</i> only applies to Israel, as it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:20" href="/Numbers.15.20"><i>Num.</i> 15:20</a>): The first of <i>your</i> dough,” not of Gentiles.
“ <i>‘Orlah</i> from practice”. Samuel said, practice of the country<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">The Jews in Bablylonia continued to practice the prohibition of <i>‘orlah</i> by consensus. The same disagreement is discussed in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 39a" href="/Kiddushin.39a">Babli, <i>Qiddušin</i> 39a</a>.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, practice from Moses on Sinai. Rebbi Assi asked before Rebbi Joḥanan, practice from Moses on Sinai, and you say so<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>‘orlah</i> outside the Land is of almost biblical status, why can the Mishnah permit all doubtful cases?</i>? He said, when practice was proclaimed, it was given in this way. He said, if I had come to the Land of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">R. Assi was a Babylonian. The opinion expressed in Tosephta 8 that <i>‘orlah</i> never applies outside the Land is quoted only in the Babli.</i> only to hear this it would have been been enough for me.
“And <i>kilaim</i> by rabbinic decree.” Samuel said, this refers<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbinic decree.</i> to vineyard <i>kilaim</i>. Therefore, <i>kilaim</i> of seeds<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Any vegetable <i>kilaim</i> except those growing in a vineyard.</i> are permitted. Rebbi Joḥanan said, this refers to vineyard <i>kilaim</i>. Therefore, <i>kilaim</i> of seeds are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">By biblical law. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 39a" href="/Kiddushin.39a">Babli, <i>Qiddušin</i> 39a</a>, this is the opinion of Samuel but practice follows what here is Samuel’s opinion.</i>. Rav Huna said, when Westerners descended from there<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Galilee.</i>, they said this in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan and proved it. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a>) “You must keep My basic Laws<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Kilaim</i> 1, Notes 122,124.</i>, your animals you should not mate <i>kilaim</i>, your field you shall not sow <i>kilaim</i>, …, <i>ša‘aṭnez</i><sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Cloth woven from wool and linen.</i> shall not come upon you.” It bracketed <i>kilaim</i> of seeds with <i>kilaim</i> of clothing and <i>kilaim</i> of animals. Since <i>kilaim</i> of clothing and <i>kilaim</i> of animals do not depend on the Land and apply inside and outside the Land<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.8.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 1:9</a>. The parallel discussion is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 38" href="/Kiddushin.38">Babli, <i>Qiddušin</i> 38a/b</a>.</i>, so also <i>kilaim</i> of seeds, while they depend on the Land, do apply inside and outside the Land.
A person<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">In Babylonia.</i> sowed his field with barley and turnips. Ḥanin from Gobya<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">A place on the Euphrates.</i> passed by and tore them out.
