Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

From when may one recite Shema in the evening? From the time the Kohanim go in to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption). Until the end of the first watch, says Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say: Until [astronomical] midnight. Rabban Gamliel says: Until the break of dawn. It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came from a house of feasting. They said to him: We have not recited Shema. He to them: If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it. And it is not only in this case that they said it! Rather, in all cases where the Sages said "only until midnight," the obligation remains until the break of dawn. [e.g.] Burning the fats and limbs [of the sacrifices, on the Temple altar] — the obligation is until the break of dawn. [e.g.:] All [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day — the obligation is until the break of dawn. If that is so, why did the Sages say, "until midnight?" To distance a person from transgression.
We recite [in our mishnah] "...from the time that the kohanim (Aaronide priests) enter to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption)." Rabbi Chiya taught [in Tosefta Berakhot 1:1]: "...from the time that people usually go in to eat their bread on the eve of the Sabbath." And there is a baraita that comments on this: "These opinions are close enough to be equal."Come and see, [let us test this hypothesis by implication from our mishnah]: "...from the time that the Kohanim go in to eat their terumah." It is [still close to] daytime. It is as soon as the stars come out!? [and the Tosefta says:] "...from the time when people usually go in to eat their bread on the eve of the Sabbath." That is an hour or two after nightfall! [These are obviously two very different times.] And yet you say: "These opinions are close enough to be equal!?" --Rabbi Yose said: "Let the problem be resolved [by claiming that the Tosefta refers only] to those small villages whose way is to go on up [home] while it is still day, to spare themselves from the animals."
It teaches in a Baraita: "The one who recites [the Shema] before this has not fulfilled their obligation. If so, why do we recite it [before nightfall] in the synagogue? Rabbi Yose said: 'We do not recite it in the synagogue to fulfill its obligation. Rather, [we recite it] so that we may stand up in prayer after a word of Torah." 
Rabbi Zeira in the name of Rav Yirmiyah: "If there is doubt whether he made the blessings after his food or not, he should make the blessings [even though he may be doing it a second time]. For it is written (Deut. 8:10) 'And you shall eat, and you shall be satisfied, then you shall bless [the LORD your God...]' If there is doubt whether he prayed or not, he should not pray [as he may have already done so.]" But he disagrees with Rabbi Yohanan. For Rabbi Yohanan said: "If  only a person could pray the entire day!" Why? For prayer is never a waste. If there is doubt whether he recited [Shema] or not, we may gather from this baraita: "The one who recites [the Shema] before this has not fulfilled their obligation." And is not before [nightfall] a time of doubt? And yet you say "he should recite [Shema]." This implies that if there is doubt whether he recited [Shema] or not, he should recite [Shema].
[From Tosefta 1:1] "The indicator of this is when the stars come out. And though there is no proof of it [from Scripture], there is a trace of it: (Neh. 4:21) '...we were doing the labor, and half of them were holding the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.' And he writes: '...it is guard-time for us by night and labor by day."
How many stars should come out so that it becomes night? Rabbi Pinhas in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Papa: "One star, surely day. Two, doubt. Three, surely night." "...two doubt," [really]? But is it not written, "...until the stars came out!?" Rather, [the plural] "stars" indicates two! [Not three!]--The first one doesn't count.
[An unattributed baraita:] "If he sees one star on the eve of the Sabbath and performs a creative task, he is exempt [from punishment]. Two, he brings a conditional guilt offering, Three, he brings a sin offering. On the departure of the Sabbath, if he sees on star and performs a creative task, a creative task, he should bring a sin offering. Two--he should bring a conditional sin offering. Three--he is exempt [from bringing a sacrifice of any sort.]”
Rabbi Yose bar Bon raised the question [thus]: “If you were to say that two [stars indicate] doubt [as to whether it is day or night, then] if one saw two stars on the eve of the Sabbath and [others] warned him [that it was the Sabbath, thus making him liable for its violation], yet he [nonetheless] performed a creative task; [and if he subsequently] saw two stars on the departure of the Sabbath and [others] warned him [that it was still the Sabbath], yet he performed a creative task; then either way you like [he is liable for a violation of the Sabbath]. If the first [set of stars] were [an indication that it was still] daytime [and not yet the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was still] daytime [and still the Sabbath], then he is liable [for a violation of the Sabbath] on account of the last set [of stars]. If the last [set of stars] were [an indication that it was now] night time [and the Sabbath had begun], then the first stars were also [an indication that it was now] night time [and no longer the Sabbath], then he is liable [for a violation of the Sabbath] on account of the first set [of stars]. [Another example:] If he saw two stars on the eve of the Sabbath and partially harvested a fig, [and] if he [subsequently returned] in the morning and harvested another part, and if he saw two stars on the departure of the Sabbath and harvested the [last] part of the fig, then either way you like [he is liable for a sin offering]. If the first [set of stars] were [an indication that it was still] daytime [and not yet the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was still] daytime [and still the Sabbath] and the morning harvest joins with that of the departure of the sabbath, and he is liable [for a sin offering] on account of the last set [of stars]. If the last [set of stars] were [an indication that it was] night time [and now the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was] daytime [and no longer the Sabbath] and the morning harvest joins with that of the night of the Sabbath, and he is liable [for a sin offering] on account of the first set [of stars].”
These [stars] that you are speaking of are [only] those whose way is not to appear in the daytime. However, we do not count those whose way is to appear in the daytime. Rabbi Yose bar Bon said: “Just so long as three stars may be seen aside from that [one we call] Kokhvata (prob. Venus).” (This may be a scribal error and the original version may have been: “Just so long as three stars may be seen [in one place, just] as one star [can be so seen.]”)
Rabbi Yaakov of Romana in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi: “One star, surely day. Two, night.” But does he [truly] have no [time period of] doubt!? He has doubt about [discerning] one star from another.
A baraita teaches: “So long as the eastern horizon is reddened, it is daytime.

Why do we read these paragraphs every day? Rabbi Simon said because it is written on them going to sleep and waking up. And Rabbi Levi said because the Ten Commandments are included within them.[The following pairs, the first phrase is from the Ten Commandments, and the second is from the Shema.][1] “I am the Lord your God” = “Hear Israel Ad-nai is our G-d”;[2] “You shall have no other Gods” = “Ad-nai is One”;[3] “Don’t take God’s Name in vain” = “You shall love” – one who loves the King won’t swear falsely in His Name;[4] “Remember the day of Shabbat” = “you will thus remember”; Rabbi says: this is the mitzvah of Shabbat that is equal in importance to all mitzvot of the Torah together, as it is written: "You made known to them Your holy sabbath, and You ordained for them laws, commandments and Teaching,[through Moses Your servant."](Neh. 9:14) - "to make known" that it is equal in importance to all other commandments of the Torah.[5] “Honor you father and mother” = “you and your children will long endure on the land”;[6] “Do not murder” = “you will rapidly vanish” – someone who murders will be murdered;[7] “Do not commit adultery” = “You will then not stray after your heart and eyes” - said Rabi Levi: the heart and the eyes are two middlemen of sin, as it is written: "my son, give me your heart and let your eyes observe my ways" (Prov. 23:26) - "the Holy One of Blessing said: if you give Me your heart and your eyes I will know that you are Mine. [8] “Don’t steal” = “you will have an ample harvest” – and not the harvest of your friend; [9] “Don’t bear false witness against your fellow” = “I am the Lord your God”. And it is written (Jer. 10:10) 'But Ad-nai G-d is Truth' [He is the living G-d, and the everlasting King; at His wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to abide His indignation.] What is 'Truth'? Said Rabbi Abun that 'He is the living G-d and the everlasting King'. Said Rabbi Levi - the Holy One of Blessing said if you witness falsely against your neighbor I consider you as if you witnessed that I did not create the Heaven and the Earth.[10] “Do not covet your fellow’s house” = “On the doorposts of your house” – your house and not on your friend’s house.
The Mishnah teaches: 'The appointed [priest] said to them: Bless one blessing [before the Shema] and they blessed.' What did they bless?Rav Matana said in the name of Shmuel: this is the blessing of the Torah. 'And they read the Ten Commandments, the Shema, Vehayah im shamoa and vayiomer. Rabi Ami in the name of Rabi Levi (?): this teaches that the blessings do not prevent [one from saying the Shema].

...This reinforces what Rabbi Yitzhak said about Rabbi Yohanan: that until the bath-keeper Yaakov came, he wore them [tefillin].
Rabbi Yirmiya asked before Rabbi Zeira: What if the bathhouse was used for bathing during the hot days (i.e., summer) but not used for bathing during the rainy days (i.e., winter)? He said to him: a bathhouse, even if not used for bathing, [is analogous to the rules] for a bathroom that does not contain feces. Mar Ukva said: a pig is like a moving bathroom. Rabbi Yonah inquired: what is [the law] for a pebble [with feces on it] that is on the sea shore? Rabbi Ammi the doctor said: Rabbi Yirmiya taught that one should pass it while covered in a scarf; this ruling is rejected.
Rabbi Zeira, in the name of Abba bar Yirmiya:  one may eat a snack with [tefillin] on, but not a meal. [Similarly, one may] take a nap, but not sleep with them on. There are tannaitic rabbis who teach: One says a blessing once. There are tannaitic rabbis who teach: One says a blessing twice. How is the one who said  once be correct? The one who said that one blesses twice [says so because] he ate and they aren't on him. Rabbi Zeira said that Abba bar Yirmiya [is referring] to a person that only eats snacks. 
Rabbi Zeira, in the name of Rabbi Abba: A person should not enter a urinal if a [holy] book and tefillin are in his hands. When Rabbi Yohanan had a book in his hand [and wanted to urinate] he would give it to someone else. When he had on his tefillin, he would stand with them. A baraita argues against Abba bar Yirmiya: a person may enter a urinal if a book and tefillin are in his hands. Rabbi Zeira said that Abba bar Yirmiya [is referring to two cases, one applies] to someone who can wear them, [and the other] to someone who cannot wear them. After all, why should he spoil them if cannot even fulfill the commandment?
Initially, people would give them [tefillin] to other people, but those people would take them and run away. So they decreed that they should be placed in holes [in the wall]. When it happened

Halakhah 2

Rabbi Nechonia son of the Kanah would pray a short prayer upon his entering the Beit Midrash and upon his leaving it (They) said to him, what is the nature of this prayer? He said to them upon my enterance I pray that an error should not occur due to me and upon my leaving I give thanks for my share:
Upon entering what does he say? May it be the will before you my God and the God of my forefathers that I will not be particular against my peers and my peers shall not be particular against me; that I will not deem the pure "Impure" and not the impure "Pure," nor permit the prohibitted and prohibit the permitted, and find myself embarrassed in this word and in the World to Come. And upon his exit he would say I am grateful before you Hashem, my God and the God of my forefathers that you placed my portion among the dwellers of the Beit Midrash and Synagogues and did not place my portion among the houses of Tartatyot and Circuses; As I toil and they toil, I act diligently and they act diligently: I toil to merit the Garden of Eden (Heaven) and they toil towards a desolate well.

Chapter 5



Halakhah 1



He teaches, one should not stand up to pray from within talk, laughter or levity and not amidst empty things, rather from within words of Torah. So too one should not take leave of their friend through talk, laughter or levity and not through empty things, but rather from within words of Torah. So we find among the first prophets who would seal their word with words of praise and consolation. R’ Elazar said ‘except Jeremiah who finished with words of rebuke. R’ Yochanan replied to him, he too sealed his word with words of consolation “…so shall Babylon sink and not rise…” (Jeremiah 51:64). Since Jeremiah goes back and prophecies on the destruction of the Holy Temple, perhaps he sealed his words with the destruction? That is why the verse continues “Until here are the words of Jeremiah,” (ibid.) - he sealed his words with the fall of those who destroyed it. And no one sealed their words with rebuke?! Isn’t it written, “…and they shall be an abhorring for all flesh.” (Isaiah 66:24)? That is dealing with the idolators. Isn’t it written, “For you have utterly rejected us…” (Eicha 5:22)?  “Restore us to You…” (Eicha 5:21) is written below “For you have utterly rejected us…” Even Eliyahu departed from Elisha from within words of Torah. “And it was that they were going, walking and talking…” (Melachim II 2:11) What were they occupied with? R’ Achva bar R’ Zeira said they were occupied with the reading of shema, this is what it says “and you shall speak of them…” (Devarim 6:7) R’ Yodah ben Pazi said they were occupied with the creation of the world, this is what it says “By the word of the Lord, the heavens were made…” (Tehillim 33:6) R’ Yodan b’rei R’ Ibo said they were occupied with the consolation of Jerusalem as it says “…speak to the heart of Jerusalem…” (Yeshayahu 40:2)The Rabbis said that they were occupied with the matter of the chariot, this is what it says “…and behold a fiery chariot and fiery horses…” (Melachim II 2:11)
