Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> When does one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah presupposes that everybody knows that there is an obligation to recite the verses <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:4-9" href="/Deuteronomy.6.4-9"><i>Deut.</i> 6:4–9</a> since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:7" href="/Deuteronomy.6.7">v. 7</a>) “You shall teach them to your children and speak about them when you sit in your house, when you go on the road, and when you are lying down and when you are getting up.” Since it says “when you are lying down” before “when you are getting up”, the obligation of the evening is discussed before that of the morning.</i>? From the time that the priests enter to eat<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The spelling of the Yerushalmi is largely phonetic, in contrast to the Babli whose Hebrew spelling is historical. Since the א was silent in Galilean speech of the time and had lost its role as glottal stop, the Mishnah in the Yerushalmi has לוֹכֵל for classical לֶאֱכוֹל in the Babylonian Mishnah.</i> their <i>Terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumah</i>, the heave, is the gift to the Cohen from agricultural produce (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:12" href="/Numbers.18.12"><i>Num.</i> 18:12</a>) and also the Cohen’s part of the tithes given to the Levites from produce (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:26" href="/Numbers.18.26"><i>Num.</i> 18:26</a>). These gifts must be eaten in ritual purity (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:13" href="/Numbers.18.13"><i>Num.</i> 18:13</a>: “every pure person in your family may eat it.”) There are several stages in the cleansing from ritual impurity. Serious impurities (defilement by a corpse, a leper, or a sufferer from gonorrhea) need special rituals. More common defilements, such as touching a dead animal or coming in contact with a more severely impure person, need immersion in the ritual bath (<i>miqweh</i>). This immersion removes impurity but does not yet allow a person to touch sanctified food or to enter the Temple before nightfall, as it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:6-7" href="/Leviticus.22.6-7"><i>Lev.</i> 22:6–7</a>): “He may not eat of sanctified food unless he immersed himself in water. When the sun leaves he shall be purified and after that he may eat of the sanctified food.” [For the more severe kinds of impurity, a sacrifice is needed before the Cohen may eat sacred food in the Temple; this does not concern us here.] The Halakhah will discuss the exact meaning of “the sun leaving” and its relation to sunset and nightfall.<br>Today, no Cohen may eat any <i>Terumah</i> and the minimal amount set apart for <i>Terumah</i> must be burned; it is ritually unclean from the start since nowadays everybody is defiled by the impurity of dead bodies. That impurity can be removed only by sprinkling with water treated with the ashes of the Red Heifer (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19" href="/Numbers.19"><i>Num.</i> 19</a>). The Mishnah was edited approximately between 200 and 220 C. E. It must be assumed that the rules of the Mishnah are intended to be practical. It follows that 130 years after the destruction of the Temple there were still places in Israel where the Cohanim could purify themselves by the ashes of the Red Heifer (in Galilee which was only minimally damaged by the two wars with the Romans.)</i>, until the end of the first night watch<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The night is divided either into three (Babylonian) or four (Roman) watches.</i> are the words of Rebbi Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The name of R. Eliezer is attached only to the statement about the night watch. The start of the time of the evening <i>Shema</i> is accepted by everybody. Rebbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was one of the foremost students of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, the founder of the Synhedrion of Jabneh after the destruction of the Temple. He was the most conservative of all teachers of his time and reputed to transmit old traditions most reliably.</i>. But the Sages say until midnight. Rabban Gamliel says until the first sign of dawn<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It will be seen that the difference between Rabban Gamliel and the other sages is practical rather than theoretical. They agree that “when you are lying down” means “all the time that you are lying on your bed” and not “when you are ready to go to bed”. The latter interpretation is that of R. Eliezer.</i>.<br>It happened that his (Rabban Gamliel’s) sons returned from a wedding feast and told him: We did not recite the <i>Shema‘</i>. He said to them: If dawn has not yet come then you are obligated to recite.<br>Not only that, but everywhere the Sages said “until midnight”, the obligation is to the start of dawn. The obligation of burning fats and limbs on the altar [and eating of the Passover sacrifice] is until the start of dawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">This entire Mishnah, and the following one, are still the words of Rabban Gamliel. In the Venice print and the Leyden manuscript, the Passover sacrifice is not mentioned in the Mishnah preceding the chapter but it is in the Mishnah repeated before the Halakhah. The Biblical precept is to burn the remaining parts of the sacrifices on the altar “the entire night until morning” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 6:1" href="/Leviticus.6.1"><i>Lev.</i> 6:1</a>).<br>In the interpretation of the Mishnah, there is a fundamental disagreement between Rashi and Maimonides. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rashi on Berakhot 2a" href="/Rashi_on_Berakhot.2a">Rashi (<i>Berakhot</i> 2a, <i>s. v.</i> להרחיק</a>) כדי writes: “Concerning burning of the fats, the Sages did not restrict it to ‘until midnight’ at all and it is mentioned here only to emphasize that everything that has to be done in the night is <i>kasher</i> the entire night.” Maimonides, in his commentary on the Mishnah, writes: “They said about all of these activities ‘until midnight’, even though there would be time until the first signs of dawn, as a ‘fence’ that no one should come to act under pressure and prolong his actions until after the start of dawn; that is what they said ‘In order to remove people from sin.’ ” And he formulates this in his code (<i>Maäse haqorbanot</i> 4:2): “In order to avoid wilful transgression, the Sages said to bring to the altar the parts that have to be burned only until midnight.”<br>Neither the Yerushalmi nor the Babli discuss the burning of sacrifices during the night. However, as Rebbi Ḥuna points out in the following paragraph, in his opinion the entire discussion in the Mishnah is about Rabbinic precepts, rather than Biblical commandments. This is compatible only with the point of view of Maimonides. It is a well known principle that Maimonides follows the Yerushalmi in all points in which there is no contrary opinion indicated in the Babli; he will take the silence of the Babli in this matter as an endorsement of the interpretation of the Yerushalmi.</i><br>All sacrifices that can be eaten during one full day only could be eaten until the first dawn. In that case, why did the Sages say, only until midnight? In order to remove people from sin.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> When does one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening?. We have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">תני is the translation of <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> for Hebrew הגד “to tell formally”. It is a technical term that implies a statement of Tannaïm, the teachers of the oral law who were active from Maccabean times to the death of Rebbi Yehudah the Prince, the compiler of the Mishnah. The insistence on this being taught, or formulated, repeatedly, shows that a statement introduced by תני is a formal statement, carefully formulated for oral repetition, and not just an <i>ad hoc</i> statement in a discussion. The vocalization תַּנִּי is the prevalent one in the Yerushalmi <i>Targumim</i>.</i>: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their <i>Terumah</i>”. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Ḥiyya is R. Ḥiyya bar Abba bar Aḥa Karsala from Kufra in Babylonia, the greatest of the students and colleagues of Rebbi (Yehuda, the editor of the Mishnah). Rebbi Ḥiyya is credited with collecting the tannaitic material that Rebbi left out of the Mishnah. The collection known as the <i>Tosephta</i> is probably based on his material even though in the current form it is a Babylonian rearrangement. Now the Tosephta (<i>Berakhot</i> I,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 1" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).1">1</a>) is quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 2b" href="/Berakhot.2b">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 2b</a>):מאימתי מתחילין לקרוֹת קרית שמע בערבית משעה שבני אדם נכנסין לאכוֹל פתן בערבי שבתוֹת דברי רבי מאיר וחכמים אוֹמרים משעה שהכהנים זכאין לאכוֹל בתרוּמתן. “When may one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening? From the time that people enter to eat their meals on Friday Evening, says Rebbi Meïr, but the Sages say from the moment that the Cohanim are allowed to eat their <i>Terumah</i>.” It seems that the Talmud does not indicate that R. Ḥiyya is reported here to quote the Tosephta but that there was a difference of opinion between Rebbi and Rebbi Ḥiyya about which opinion of those mentioned in the Tosephta should be accepted in the Mishnah as authoritative.<br>There is a fundamental disagreement between the two Talmudim in the interpretation of R. Meïr’s opinion. The Babli quotes a second version of R. Meïr, “from the time that the Cohanim immerse themselves in order to eat <i>Terumah</i>.” Since the Cohanim have to concentrate on their status of purity between immersion and eating, in order not to touch unclean matter inadvertently, it is clear that they will immerse themselves at or shortly after sunset, when it is still clearly day and no stars are visible, and start to eat at the earliest moment which can be declared to be night. Hence, the other version of R. Meïr, that people start to eat Friday nights, must also mean an early time. Since people return from work early on Fridays, being notified of the approaching Sabbath by the sounding of trumpets (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 35b" href="/Shabbat.35b">Babli <i>Šabbat</i>35b</a>), they will eat early. In particular in Babylonia, where synagogues were out in the fields, Friday evening services were held so that people could return to town before the unlit roads became completely dark. In Israel, on the other hand, synagogues were in towns and often the sermon was held on Friday evening. It is told in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Vayikra Rabbah 9:9" href="/Vayikra_Rabbah.9.9"><i>Lev. rabba</i> 9(9</a>) that R. Meïr was preaching Friday evenings and even women came to hear the sermon at that time. Hence, the Sabbath meal was late. In Israel, R. Meïr’s pronouncement was taken to indicate a very late time.</i>: “From the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal.” We have stated: “Their opinions are almost identical.” Come and see: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their <i>Terumah</i>” is still daylight and the stars start to appear<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As noted in the preceding comment, the Cohanim start to eat when it is no longer day, but before it is completely dark. The exact definition of “day,” “twilight,” “night” will be given later in the present section.</i>, “from the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal” is one or two hours into the night. You want to say that the two opinions are almost identical? Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This R. Yose is the late Galilean Amora R. Yose (probably, ben Zabida), not the Tanna R. Yose ben Ḥalaphta.</i> said: Explain it by people in hamlets who usually leave the roads when there still is some daylight because they are afraid of wild beasts.
It was stated: “He who recites (the <i>Shema‘</i>) before that time did not fulfill his duty.” If that is so, why does one recite (the <i>Shema‘</i>) in the synagogue? Rebbi Yose said: one does not recite it to fulfill one’s duty but only to stand in prayer after the study of Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This section is quoted by Rashi in his commentary of the Mishnah in the Babylonian Talmud. The old Ashkenazic ritual that has preserved the Israeli usages, in contrast to the Sephardic rituals coming from Babylonia, requires that afternoon and evening prayers be said consecutively in the synagogue any time after מִנְחָה קְטַנָּה, 5/4 hours before sundown (the hour computed as 1/12th of daylight hours.) Hence, evening prayers with <i>Shema‘</i> are recited in full daylight. R. Yose declares that after nightfall everybody has to recite the <i>Shema‘</i> for himself (without benedictions) to fulfill the duty of reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> at its proper time. In contrast to <i>Shema‘</i>, the daily prayers are not bound rigidly to their times, as will be explained later in the Talmud.</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Zeïra was a Babylonian who appears in the Babylonian Talmud as Rebbi Zera; he rose to be head of the Yeshivah of Tiberias after Rebbi Yoḥanan.</i> in the name of Rav Jeremiah<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Jeremiah appears in the Babylonian Talmud as Rav Jeremiah bar Abba, one of the outstanding students of Rav. He should not be identified with Rebbi Jeremiah, a Babylonian and student of Rebbi Zeïra in Galilee.</i>: One who is in doubt whether he said Grace after his meal or not, must say Grace, since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:10" href="/Deuteronomy.8.10"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise the Eternal<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">There is a problem how the Divine Name YHWH should be translated. The traditional “Lord”, taken from the Septuagint, is a translation not of the Name but of its substitute <i>ădōnāi</i>. The vocalization of the Name is unknown. The root is certainly הוה “to exist”. The form of the name indicates either <i>qal</i> or <i>pi‘el</i>, with a meaning “Eternal” or a <i>hif‘il</i>, meaning “Creator”. Probably it means both but for purposes of translation it is convenient to follow Mendelssohn and use the first meaning. [The so-called “scholarly” <i>hif‘il</i> vocalization, <i>yahweh</i>“Creator,” is certainly false since theophorous names show that the first syllable is vocalized either <i>yā, yô,</i> or <i>yĕ</i>, never <i>yah</i>, and, hence, as is to be expected, the Name does not follow any normative grammatical rule.]</i>, your God<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse quoted shows that saying Grace is a Biblical obligation (at least for people who ate to be satiated). For Biblical obligations, we always follow the rule that in doubt one has to follow the most stringent alternative.</i>”. One who who is in doubt whether he prayed or not, may not pray, against the opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Yoḥanan is the greatest authority among the Galilean Amoraïm of the second generation. It is rare to have a decision of later generations going against him.</i> who said: If only one would pray the whole day long, why? Because prayer is never in vain<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody agrees that praying the <i>Amidah</i> three times a day is a rabbinic obligation. The majority opinion, reported here by R. Zeïra and anonymously in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 21a" href="/Berakhot.21a"><i>Babli Berakhot</i> 21a</a>, is that one may not recite this prayer more than three times a day (at least on weekdays) and that, therefore, when in doubt one may not pray since rabbinic ordinances are interpreted leniently in case of doubt. The contrary opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan is also reported in the Babylonian Talmud (<i>loc. cit.</i>) but without the argument that prayer is never in vain. Rav Haï Gaon (<i>Otzar HaGeonim Berakhot</i>, Responsa p. 50, Commentaries p. 26) explains that Rebbi Yoḥanan thinks that prayer, as a supplication for Divine grace and in imitation of sacrifices, can be offered as fulfillment of a vow. It follows that, in his opinion, anyone who is in doubt whether he prayed already, should declare that his prayer should be counted as obligatory if he did not pray but as a voluntary offering if he already had fulfilled his obligation. This opinion is not acceptable to the Yerushalmi; since prayer is never in vain it does not need a prior declaration. There is a practical difference between the two Talmudim since according to Rav Haï’s interpretation, someone who started praying and remembered in the middle that he already had prayed, must stop in the middle even according to Rebbi Yoḥanan, but in the Jerusalem Talmud R. Yoḥanan is explicitly on record (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:3:2-4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.3.2-4.5"><i>Halakhah</i> 4:3</a>) that he goes on praying since prayer is never in vain.</i>! About one who is in doubt whether he recited (the <i>Shema‘</i>) or not we may hear from this: He who recites (the <i>Shema‘</i>) before that time did not fulfill his duty. And before that time is it not doubtful<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Later it will be discussed that sometime between sundown and nightfall there is a time of twilight when it is doubtful whether it belongs to day or night. Hence, someone who recites the <i>Shema‘</i> during twilight cannot be said to certainly have violated the rule that the evening <i>Shema‘</i> must be recited in the night and his case is equivalent to the one where the person is not sure whether he had recited the <i>Shema‘</i> already during the current evening.</i>? This means that one who is in doubt whether he recited (the <i>Shema</i>) or not must recite again<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Talmud has to prove indirectly that in reading the <i>Shema‘</i> one is stringent in case of doubt it seems that it is implied that the reading of <i>Shema‘</i> is a rabbinic institution (though it might leave in doubt the status of the first sentence or the first section.)</i>.
A sign for it (nightfall) is after stars have become visible<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is an extended quote from a parallel to the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta (1:1</a>) quoted in note 8. It is not from our Tosephta since the last sentence is missing there and the first sentence reads in the Tosephta, and in the Babylonian Talmud (2b), סימן לדבר צאת הכוֹכבים. Levi Ginzberg already has pointed out that the Biblical noun construction צאת הכוֹכבים “the emergence of stars” is never used in the Yerushalmi which prefers the verbal form. “It” referred to in this quote must be nightfall, the common time both for the criterion of R. Meïr and that of the Sages (Note 8).</i>. And though there is no proof, at least there is a hint<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This expression is found also in Yerushalmi <i>Sheviït</i> 9:2 (38d), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 1:1:2-17" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.1.1.2-17"><i>Pesaḥim</i>1:1</a> (27a), <i>Moëd Qaṭan</i> 1:4 (80c), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:11:2-10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.11.2-10"><i>Yebamot</i> 4:11</a> (6a), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 1:3:2-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.1.3.2-8"><i>Niddah</i> 1:4</a> (49a).</i> in (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 4:15" href="/Nehemiah.4.15"><i>Neh.</i> 4:15</a>): “We were working; half of them were holding spears, from the beginning of dawn to the visibility of stars.” And it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 4:16" href="/Nehemiah.4.16"><i>v.</i> 16</a>): “The night was for us for watch duty and daytime for work.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The argument goes as follows: Nehemiah’s people worked from dawn to dusk (in contrast to hired workers who labor from sunrise to sunset; <i>Baba meẓia‘</i> 7:1). The second verse, missing in the Tosephta, contains the proof: Neḥemiah declares that “day was for work” and, since he had defined his working day as dawn to dusk in the preceding verse, his definition at least for “day” is “dawn to dusk”. This is only a “hint”, not a proof, since his working day was irregular.</i>”
How many stars have to appear that it should be night? Rebbi Phineas<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">R. Pinḥas Hacohen bar Ḥama, an Israeli Amora of the fourth generation. His source R. Abba bar Pappus was a Babylonian of the second Amora generation immigrating into Galilee. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 35b" href="/Shabbat.35b">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a>), the criterion of three stars is attributed to Samuel, one of the two foremost Babylonian authorities of the first generation. This criterion is originally Babylonian since the criterion of Cohanim eating their <i>Terumah</i> was never applicable in Babylonia.</i> in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Pappus: one star (visible) is certainly daylight. Two are doubtful as night. Three is certainly night. Are two doubtful? Is it not written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 4:15" href="/Nehemiah.4.15"><i>Neh.</i> 4:15</a>): “To the visibility of stars?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The argument here is that Neḥemiah uses a plural in his definition of nightfall. So he talks about at least two stars. Now Talmudic interpretation of Scripture follows a principle that I have discussed repeatedly (“Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition” in: <i>Confrontations with Judaism</i>, ed. P. Longworth, London 1967, pp. 171–196; <i>Seder Olam</i>, Northvale NJ 1998, p. 6) that every Biblical statement must have a definite meaning. Since numbers do not have an upper bound, the only definite number indicated by a plural is 2. Hence, the plural must mean two unless it is accompanied by a description like “many”, etc. The description in the Babli is: תפסת מוּעט תפסת תפסת מרוּבה לא תפסת “If you grab the minimum you have something in your hand; if you grab more you have nothing in your hand.” It follows that Neḥemiah can talk only about two stars in his description of night.</i>” The minimum of “stars” are two! The first one does not count<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since Venus often is visible in daylight, it cannot count in the determination of nightfall. Later it is stated that no star visible during daytime hours can be counted for the determination of nightfall. This naturally seems to eliminate the count of stars as a practical procedure.</i>.
Friday night, if someone saw one star and did work (forbidden on the Sabbath), he is free from punishment. Two, he brings a trespass offering for a sin in doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The trespass offering described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:17-19" href="/Leviticus.5.17-19"><i>Lev.</i> 5:17–19</a> for somebody who without premeditation commits an act of which he later has doubts whether it was sinful or not. By the preceding statement, at the time when exactly two stars are visible it is impossible to know whether it is day or not. The sin offering for sins committed in error is described <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:27-35" href="/Leviticus.4.27-35"><i>Lev.</i> 4:27–35</a>.</i>. Three, he brings a sin offering. Saturday night, if someone saw one star and did (forbidden) work, he brings a sin offering. Two, he brings a trespass offering for a sin in doubt. Three, he is free from punishment.
Rebbi Yose bar Abun<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yose bar Abun was the colleague of R. Yose bar Zabida and one of the last editors of the Yerushalmi. The first conclusion of R. Yose bar Abun is reported in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 35b" href="/Shabbat.35b">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a>) by R. Yose bar Zabida. The names Abun, Abba are often contracted to Bun, Ba in the Yerushalmi.</i> investigated: If you say that two (stars) present a doubt, if someone saw two stars on Friday night, was warned, and did forbidden work, he also saw two stars on Saturday night, was warned, and did forbidden work, then it is logical to assert that if the first period was daytime the last period was also daytime and he would be guilty for the later work; if the last period was nighttime then the first period was also nighttime and he would be guilty for the first work<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As Rashi points out in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 35b" href="/Shabbat.35b"><i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a>, one has to assume that the person did work the entire period during which exactly two stars were visible. Since it is not determined when exactly the changeover from Sabbath to workday occurs during this period, one has to exclude the possibility that he did the work during daytime the first time and during nighttime the second time.<br>The first case discussed by R. Yose bar Abun deals with a criminal trial. In Jewish law, the Biblical penalties cannot be imposed unless the accused was duly warned by witnesses not to commit the crime that he was seen to start. However, such a warning must be given unconditionally. Since nobody can assert categorically that work in twilight is a Biblical prohibition on Friday night and Saturday night, R. Yose seems to assert that two conditional warnings, given in mutually exclusive circumstances which together make a certainty of the transgression, can be counted as an unconditional warning.</i>. If someone saw two stars on Friday night and harvested about (the volume of) half a fig, in the morning he harvested about half a fig, and he saw two stars on Saturday night and harvested about half a fig, then it is logical to assert that if the first period was daytime the last period was also daytime and one would combine daytime with Saturday night and he would be guilty for his last work; if the last period was nighttime then the first period was also nighttime and one would combine daytime with Friday night and he would be guilty for his first work<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Harvesting is forbidden on the Sabbath. Like all such work, the minimal amount of work that is punishable depends on the intention of the person acting. If the harvest is to clear the field for a new crop then the most minute amount of work is punishable. If the harvest is for human consumption then the minimal harvest punishable is the volume of a dried fig. If the harvest is for animal feed then the minimal amount is to fill the mouth of a lamb (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shabbat (Lieberman) 10:15" href="/Tosefta_Shabbat_(Lieberman).10.15"><i>Tosephta Šabbat</i> 10:15</a>). Here it is understood that one uses the example of one who harvests for human consumption. Any forbidden work on the Sabbath is sinful even in the tiniest of amounts; the minimal amounts determine only whether there is a criminal liability or not. If the work was done inadvertently or the person forgot that it was Sabbath, he may bring a sin offering in the Temple as soon as the Temple will be rebuilt. However, a sin offering can only be brought if the same action, done intentionally, would have been a criminal act. Hence, no sin offering can be brought as atonement for doing less than a minimal amount of work which would qualify as criminal act. For such an action there can be no warning and the formulation of the problem also leaves out mention of due warning; one may speak here only about the obligation (or possibility) of bringing a sin-offering.<br>It is spelled out in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:2-4" href="/Leviticus.5.2-4"><i>Leviticus</i> (5:2–4</a>) in respect to sin offerings for transgressions by speech (by oath, or non-speech, be refusing to be a witness) that the sin offering is brought if “(he did,) and it was forgotten by him, and he remembered and was guilty.” It is taken from here that in all cases there is one sin offering for all transgressions done in one forgetting; that any realization of the forbidden action in the time in between will cause a separate sin with a separate sin offering. Hence, it is assumed here that the person in question either was not aware that the day was a Sabbath or that harvesting on the Sabbath is forbidden, without any intermediate awareness of either Sabbath or the prohibition of harvesting. It is then asserted by R. Yose bar Abun that all acts committed during one forgetting do combine, since they will all be covered by one sin-offering.<br>The certainty of guilt on the Sabbath is then established by the same argument as in the first case under the same conditions, viz., that in both cases the action was performed exactly during the entire time that exactly two stars were visible. The practical determination of such an action is made questionable by the next action.</i>.
That means (we judge) by those stars that are not usually seen during the day. But by those stars that are usually seen during the day we do not estimate. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said: There must be three stars not counting Venus<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Here we take up the discussion from the penultimate section. The interpretation and the text are a matter of some controversy. Rabbenu Ḥananel (of Kairawan, 11th Century) in his commentary to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 35b" href="/Shabbat.35b"><i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a> reads in the statement of R. Yose bar Abun: וּבלחוּד דיתחמוּן תלתא כוֹכבים בר מן חד כוֹכבתא, this is close to our text. R. Eliezer ben Joel (Ravia, Rhineland, 12th-13th Cent., § 199) reads וּבלחוּד דיתחמוּ תלתא כוֹכבין בדמוּת חד כוֹכבתא “only that three stars should look like one star” and explains in the name of Rebbi Yehuda (either the Pious of Regensburg or Sir Leon of Paris) that three stars have to appear in a group like feet of a tripod. The same text is quoted by the 14th cent. R. Nissim Gerondi (Ran) as דדמיין לחדא כוֹכבתא “which are similar to one star” and his contemporary <i>Hagahot Maimuniot</i>(<i>Hilkhot Šabbat,</i> 5:4 Note 3) that three stars should be seen כמין חד כוֹכבא “in the manner of one star”, to which reading the explanation of Ravia applies well. In fact, R. Zachariah Frankel in his commentary on the Yerushalmi points out that the feminine כוֹכבתא makes sense only if it refers to Venus. A “star” in general is כוֹכבא, masculine, and it seems that the text of <i>Hagahot Maimuniot</i> has been corrected by German Jewish attention to grammatical correctness. However, if we accept the reading כוֹכבתא the statement of R. Yose bar Abun is a duplication of the earlier remark that “the first star does not count.” Ran explains that the earlier statement determines the moment of nightfall from Biblical sources but that the requirement that three stars should be seen close together is a rabbinic ordinance “to add from weekday to the holy day” and, therefore, has a different status and is a legitimate addition.</i>.

If the zenith is silver colored equal to the horizon, then it is night.” The text of the Yerushalmi is from a tannaitic source and supports Samuel’s reading.

Rebbi says: (When) the moon is at its turning point, and the sphere of the sun has started to disappear and the sphere of the moon to rise, that is dusk. Rebbi Ḥanina said: When the solar sphere finishes disappearing and the lunar sphere starts to rise. Samuel has a tannaitic statement: The moon does not shine at the moment of the disappearance of the sun nor does it go down at the moment that the sun shines<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi is Rebbi Yehudah the Prince, the editor of the Mishnah. R. Ḥanina probably is the Amora R. Ḥanina, the student of Rebbi.<br>The explanation of this section depends on whether one accepts that Rebbi and R. Ḥanina speak of the same tradition, only that R. Ḥanina insists that the correct tradition of Rebbi’s statement is that dusk starts only at the moment of the final disappearance of the sun and not at the moment of the disappearance of the lower rim of the solar disk as in the first tradition. This is the opinion of most commentators of the Yerushalmi; in the language of the Babli it means that two tradents, the first one anonymous and the second R. Ḥanina, give their versions of what Rebbi really said. [Nachmanides (<i>Writings of Rabbenu Moshe ben Naḥman</i>, ed. Chavel, Jerusalem 1964, <i>Torat Haädam</i>, p. 154–251) insists that R. Ḥanina only explains Rebbi’s statement in popular terms. Since the Talmud quotes a teaching accepted by Samuel the astronomer as confirmation of R. Ḥanina’s position, it is difficult to accept that the first tradent and R. Ḥanina should have completely parallel statements.]<br>A reasonable explanation of this section must start with a discussion of “the turning point of the moon.” Usually this is taken as the moment of the full moon, when the moon changes from increasing to decreasing. However, this interpretation is impossible since the orbit of the moon usually deviates from the ecliptic and only about every 223 months the full moon is in the ecliptic in opposition to the sun. Hence, the “turning point of the moon” is the only time when there is a possibility of a lunar eclipse and the full moon is directly opposite to the sun. R. Ḥanina and Samuel express the view of geometric astronomy, i.e., that the full moon cannot rise as long as the sun is still visible. The anonymous first tradent notes that in rare cases the refraction of the earth’s atmosphere can lead to a situation where the full moon starts to rise while the sun, geometrically below the horizon, is still visible. [In science, this phenomenon was first studied by Ibn al Haytham in the tenth Cent.; cf. R. Rashed, <i>Optique et mathématiques</i>, Variorum: Ashgate Publ. Co., Brookfield Vt, 1992] For practical purposes, both teachers seem to agree that in the consideration of “sundown” for Sabbath observance, the influence of refraction in the atmosphere should be disregarded.</i>.
Rebbi Samuel bar Ḥiyya bar Yehudah in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: When the solar disk starts to sink and a man is standing on top of Mount Carmel, he descends and immerses himself in the ocean, ascends and eats his <i>Terumah</i>, one may assume that he immersed himself during daytime<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, he was cleansed from impurity at nightfall and is justified in eating <i>Terumah</i>.</i>.

What is dusk?<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">While the first statement here was a homily by a late Amora, now we are dealing with a legal statement by two of the outstanding students of Rebbi Akiba, of the fourth generation of Tannaim.

Neḥemiah and R. Yose here, making the definition of dusk a triple disagreement. By contrast, it seems that the Yerushalmi accepts the criterion of the color of the Eastern sky as universally valid, only that Rebbi Neḥemiah qualifies it in time. The relationship between the statements of R. Neḥemiah and R. Yose is discussed in the next section. Since the standard for a normal person is to walk 10 <i>parasangs</i> [= 40 miles (<i>mil</i>)] in a day of 12 hours, the time allocated to a <i>mil</i> is 12/40 hours or (12×60)/40 = 18 minutes. [Maimonides counts the 10 <i>parasangs</i> from beginning of dawn to the end of dusk; his time for walking a <i>mil</i> is 24 minutes.] This refers to a day of 12 hours between sunrise and sunset, i.e., for the equinoxes if constant hours are used. In addition, the determination of time is valid only for the Land of Israel or other countries of the same latitude. For other latitudes, the length of dusk has to be determined by the angle of depression of the sun at the end of 9 or 12 minutes after sunset in Israel on March 21. The Babylonian Talmud (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 34b" href="/Shabbat.34b"><i>Šabbat</i> 34b</a>) replaces the time of ½ (Roman?) <i>mil</i> in Galilee by ⅔ Babylonian?) <i>mil</i> in Babylonia on the lower Euphrates.</i> From after sundown the time a man needs to walk half a <i>mil</i>, the words of Rebbi Neḥemiah. Rebbi Yose said: dusk is a moment and the sages could not determine it.

In the interpretation of the school of Hillel there are three stages in the uncleanness of a <i>zab</i>. If he had one episode, he is unclean but may cleanse himself by immersion in water as with any other defilement. If he had two episodes not separated by a full day, he can cleanse himself only by immersion in running water after being free of symptoms for a full seven days. If he had three episodes (again, not separated by a full day from dusk to dusk without incident) then he not only has to immerse himself in running water after seven days but he also has to bring a purifying sacrifice (if there is a Temple.) There is a standard duration that is counted as an episode and a continuous emission during a longer period is counted as two (or more, depending on length) emissions. The Mishnah here states that an episode during dusk will be counted as two even if it is relatively short if part of the episode happened during the previous day and part during the following night. Hence, the exact determination of the boundary between day and night is essential.</i>” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Josef<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">A Babylonian, student of Rab and Samuel at the start of the Amoraic period, who at an advanced age emigrated to Israel and became a member of the Academy of R.

Rebbi Yose says it is always counted as only one episode. However, Rebbi Yose agrees that if he had an emission during dusk, even though its duration was not long enough for immersion and drying himself, it is counted for two since it happened on different days. In this sense did R. Yose say: If he had an emission during twilight he is possibly defiled (unclean for seven days) but not obliged to bring a sacrifice. If he had two emissions during twilight he is possibly defiled and possibly obligated to a sacrifice. If he had one emission at another (certain) time and one during twilight or one during twilight and one at another time he is certainly defiled (for seven days) and questionable for a sacrifice. If he had two emissions at other times and one at twilight or two at twilight and one at another time he is certainly defiled and certainly must bring a sacrifice.”</i> I said to him: Here is your problem since you say that every single moment in the half a <i>mil</i> of Rebbi Neḥemiah is in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Up to here, everything is R. Mana’s question to R. Ḥizqiah: Since the Tosephta clearly states that the Mishnah quoted is R. Yose’s opinion, if every moment of R. Neḥemiah’s twilight is questionable for R.

In the first verse, the coming of Lot to Zoar is real coming, parallel to the going out of the sun. Hence, in the first verse coming and going out are the same. It would follow that, in the second verse also, coming must have the same status as going out since it is one of the principles of Rabbinic interpretation that Biblical expressions have the same meaning at every occurrence (a principle known as <i>gĕzērāh šāwāh</i>.)

Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Since Rebbi Eliezer in the Mishnah had defined the time of the recital of <i>Shema‘</i> as the first watch in the night, the discussion of the Mishnah now turns to the legal determination of the length of a nightwatch. The text here is composed of two sources. The statement about the number of watches in a night according to Rebbi and Rebbi Nathan is a Tosephta (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:2-31" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.2-31"><i>Berakhot</i>1:1</a>). This Tosephta also has the division of the hour and its subdivisions by 24 parts each. This seems to belong to Rebbi’s statement since this subdivision and the division of the night (and possibly the day) is Roman practice. Rebbi Nathan, a contemporary of Rebbi known as “the Babylonian”, follows a Babylonian tradition that also seems to have been the old Israelite practice since the verse from Judges speaks of one “middle watch” which is possible only if there are an odd number of watches in the night. According to Rebbi, a watch is three hours and it has been noted that R. Joshua, who allows <i>Shema‘</i> to be recited during the first three hours of daylight, follows Rebbi in the division of the day.</i> said: There are four watches during daytime and four at nighttime. The period is one twenty-fourth of an hour. The time is one twenty-fourth of a period. The moment is one twenty-fourth of a time. How much is a moment? Rebbi Berekhiah in the name of Rebbi Ḥelbo said: as long as one needs to pronounce it. The Sages say the moment is like the blink of an eyelash. Samuel did formulate: the moment is one in 56,848 of an hour<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Of this part there exist three Yerushalmi sources [the Talmud here, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Lamentations 2:19" href="/Lamentations.2.19"><i>Midrash Ekha rabbati</i> on <i>Threni</i> 2:19</a>. <i>Midrash Samuel</i> 3(1)], all of which have an identical text and the definition of the number of moments in an hour by Rebbi as 24<sup>3</sup>= 13824, by Samuel as 56848, and by others either as the time needed to say the word or as the blinking of an eye. In Babylonian sources (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 7a" href="/Berakhot.7a"><i>Berakhot</i> 7a</a>, <i>Abodah zarah</i> 4a) the numbers are quoted anonymously and are given as 58888 (printed editions), 56880 (Munich manuscript), 56800 (Koronel manuscript) in <i>Berakhot</i> and 53848 (printed editions), 56884 (R. Ḥananel), 56888 (Munich ms.) in <i>Abodah zarah</i>. In <i>Sefer Agadot Hatalmud</i> the reading is 5845. The opinion that a moment is the length of time needed to pronounce the word is attributed in the Babli to Rebbi Abin (who might be identical with Rabin, a Galilean authority who escaped persecution by an emperor and became an authority in Babylonia.) Only the numbers given in the Yerushalmi tradition are composites of simple numbers; Samuel’s number is 16×11×17×19, whereas the Babylonian numbers have no decomposition into small factors. Now most of the numbers in the Babylonian sources (who have been copied and edited much more than the Yerushalmi and, therefore, are more likely to contain scribal errors) are close to Samuel’s number. One may, therefore, assume that the original number in all Talmud texts was 56848.<br>In the Babylonian Talmud, the number given is from an anonymous Tannaïtic source which also adds: “Nobody can determine the moment exactly; only Bileam the sorcerer could do that.” In Antiquity (and the Middle Ages), all astronomical computations were done in the technique of the old Babylonians, in a number system based on subdivisions by 60. In general, divisions were executed only for numbers that have an easy reciprocal in the sexagesimal system, i.e., they are composed by factors of 60 (2, 3, 5, and their multiples). Instead of dividing, people looked up the reciprocal in a table and then multiplied. Samuel is the astronomer of most authority in the Talmud. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that his number, which is not invertible by the Babylonian method, is a good example that “nobody can exactly determine the moment” because 1/56848 is an infinite sexagesimal fraction. Hence, the comment of the Tanna, that “nobody can determine the moment exactly,” is implied in the number of Samuel and the Babylonian text is a derivative of the Yerushalmi text here.</i>.

In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 8b" href="/Berakhot.8b">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 8b</a>), Rav Yehudah says in the name of Samuel that practice follows Rabban Gamliël who allows the recital of <i>Shema‘</i> after midnight in emergency cases. From the next “New Section” in the Yerushalmi it is clear that this is not the Israeli position; they forbid the recitation of the <i>Shema‘</i> after midnight. The opinion of Samuel represents either the autochthonous Babylonian practice or the teaching of the Academy of Nahardea founded by Ḥananiah ben Ḥananiah, the nephew of Rebbi Joshua, at the time of the revolt of Bar Kokhba.</i> in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: Practice follows the Sages. Rebbi Yasa commanded his colleagues: if you want to study Torah then you should recite the <i>Shema‘</i> before midnight and then study<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">One talks here about studying in the night. It is stated in Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:2 that one interrupts everything he is doing to recite <i>Shema‘</i> at its proper time. Hence, we may assume that all these scholars did recite <i>Shema‘</i> in the synagogue. It was stated at the start that one reads <i>Shema‘</i> in the synagogue, when Minḥa and Maäriv services are held together while it is still before sundown, to stand in prayer after studying words of Torah. [This Israeli practice was followed by Ashkenazic Jewry, whose ritual basically was Galilean, until the sixteenth Century as can be seen from Rashi to the first Mishnah, <i>Ṭur Oraḥ Cḥayyim</i>235 and the glosses of R. Moshe Isserls <i>Oraḥ Cḥayyim</i> 235. Because of the disapproval of the main commentators of <i>Shulḥan Arukh, Magen Abraham</i> and <i>TaZ</i>, the practice has disappeared in all Ashkenazic congregations except those of the old German rite.] The question here is whether the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> after nightfall is needed in order to fulfill the obligation of <i>Shema‘</i> or whether it is needed to protect one’s sleep from evil influences. In the first case, one recites <i>Shema‘</i> as soon as possible and then continues one’s normal activities; in the second case one may say <i>Shema‘</i> only when one actually goes to sleep and then cannot say anything anymore before actually sleeping.</i>. His words imply that the practice follows the Sages. His words imply that one may speak after <i>Emet Weyaẓiv</i><sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babylonian ritual followed today, the benediction after <i>Shema‘</i> in the morning is אמת ויציב but in the evening אמת ואמוּנה; in Israel the same version, אמת ויציב, was recited morning and evening.<br>We find a disagreement between Rashi and his grandson Rabbenu Tam about the practice of praying Maäriv immediately after Minḥah, before sundown. According to Rashi on the Mishnah, the practice of reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> is exclusively to start the <i>Amidah</i> prayer after words of Torah. Hence, the only valid recitation is in the night. According to Rabbenu Tam (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Berakhot 2a" href="/Tosafot_on_Berakhot.2a"><i>Tosafot Berakhot</i> 2a</a>), the prayers are held after <i>plag haminḥah</i>, not more than 1.25 variable hours before sundown, and according to an opinion of R. Yehudah mentioned later in the Mishnah, both <i>Amidah</i> and <i>Shema‘</i> are valid prayers. According to Rashi, it is possible that the original <i>minhag</i> of the Jews in Israel did not imply that the benedictions before and after <i>Shema‘</i> were recited in the synagogue and that, therefore, they had to be recited at home and could be combined with other prayers. It follows that “one may speak after אמת ויציב” can mean that one does not have to mention the praise of God for the redemption of Israel from Egypt immediately before starting the <i>Amidah</i> prayer. This interpretation is given by several commentators of the Yerushalmi, foremost among them R. Eleazar Askari. However, since the obligation to “connect the redemption to the <i>Amidah</i>” in evening prayers is given in the name of R. Yoḥanan in the Babylonian Talmud (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 9b" href="/Berakhot.9b"><i>Berakhot</i> 9b</a>) it is difficult to state the opposite opinion here in the name of R.

When the principle “immediately after redemption comes prayer” was adopted also for the evening prayers (see preceding section), the intermediate pieces were declared to be “extensions of the thanksgiving for redemption.” The benediction immediately preceding the <i>Qaddish</i> was fixed by Babylonian Geonim to be a benediction for future redemption.

Hence, the opinions of both Rebbi Simeon and Rabban Gamliel are of purely theoretical interest and no answer is required. In the Babli, the quote from Rebbi Simeon is given as a support to their decision that practice follows Rabban Gamliel. It seems to be the position of the Yerushalmi that in Temple times practice followed Rabban Gamliel in the Temple precinct and the Sages everywhere else.</i>.
Rabban Gamliel disagrees with the Sages and acts upon his opinion?<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:2" href="/Exodus.23.2"><i>Ex.</i> 23:2</a>) “to yield to the majority”, a religious authority is not allowed to act upon his personal opinion if it disagrees with the majority. This principle is then illustrated by several examples. It therefore is a big question why Rabban Gamliel’s action is mentioned in the Mishnah without a disapproving remark. [The position of the Babli here is quite different: Since the action of Rabban Gamliel is mentioned in the Mishnah without a disapproving remark, it follows that general practice follows Rabban Gamliel since the practice of a religious authority overrides theoretical arguments.]</i> Did not Rebbi Meïr disagree with the Sages and not act upon his opinion, did not Rebbi Aqiba disagree with the Sages and not act upon his opinion?
So we find that Rebbi Meïr disagreed with the Sages and did not act upon his opinion. We have stated: One rubs <i>olentia</i><sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Latin <i>olentia</i> “sweet smelling things” (E. G.).

Hence, it is not allowed to mix wine and oil with balsamum on the Sabbath since that would make it inedible. The parallel quote in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 134a" href="/Shabbat.134a">Babli is <i>Šabbat</i>134a</a>; the only difference in the texts is that the Babli and Tosephta have a purely Hebrew text while the Yerushalmi has the connecting remarks in Aramaic.</i> on a sick person on the Sabbath; but only if it was mixed with oil and wine before Sabbath eve. But if he did not mix it before Sabbath eve it is forbidden. We have stated: Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar said: Rebbi Meïr did allow to mix wine and oil and to rub it onto a sick persion on Sabbath. When he fell sick, we wanted to prepare the same for him but he did not let us do it. We said to him: Our teacher, are you going to invalidate your words when your life is in danger? He said to us: even though I am lenient for others, I am stringent for myself because my colleagues disagree with me.
So we find that Rebbi Aqiba disagreed with the Sages and did not act upon his opinion. As we have stated there (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Oholot 2:6" href="/Mishnah_Oholot.2.6"><i>Mishnah Ahilot</i> 2:6</a>): “Spine and skull from two dead bodies, a limb composed of limbs of two dead bodies, limbs taken from two living persons, Rebbi Aqiba declares them to be impure and the Sages declare them to be pure.”<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Purity and impurity mentioned here refer to transmission of impurity by a “tent”, since automatically everybody under the same roof with a corpse becomes impure; the “pure” bones mentioned here will still transmit impurity by touch. The conditions of impurity are spelled out in <i>Ahilot</i> 2:1. Flesh is causing impurity down to the volume of an olive but bones do so only if they are either the volume of a quarter <i>qab</i> (about .55 liter), most of the bones composing the skeleton in number or in importance, or skull and/or spine. [Whether one has to read שדרה וגלגולת as “skull <i>and</i> spine” or “skull <i>or</i> spine” is discussed inconclusively in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nazir 52b" href="/Nazir.52b"><i>Babli Nazir</i> 52b</a> ff.]</i> We have stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Oholot 4:2" href="/Tosefta_Oholot.4.2">Tosephta <i>Ahilot</i> 4:2</a>; there the full name Theodoros is given to the chief surgeon. The Tosephta starts: “Rebbi Yehudah said: Six cases did Rebbi Aqiba declare impure and he changed his opinion; it happened …”, and ends: “Rebbi Simeon said: Until the time of his death did Rebbi Aqiba maintain that it should be impure; whether he changed his opinion when dying I do not know.” This means that according to Rebbi Yehudah, the vote at Lod showed that Rebbi Aqiba changed his opinion but, according to Rebbi Simeon, Rebbi Aqiba did not change his opinion, only he did not want openly to defy the opinion of the majority. We assume that the Yerushalmi here accepts the opinion of Rebbi Simeon, otherwise there is no proof here. It follows that also when the Yerushalmi quotes the Tosephta, sometimes the proof comes from the omitted parts.</i> “It happened that they brought a chest full of bones from Kefar Tabi<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Former Arab village Kafr Ṭab East of Lod.</i> to Lod and deposited it in the open air [the courtyard] of the synagogue. Theodoros the physician entered and with him all physicians. Theodoros declared that there was no complete spine from one dead person and no complete skull from one dead person. They said: Since we have here some who declare this pure and others who declare it impure, let us vote upon it. They started with Rebbi Aqiba and he declared it to be pure. They said: Since you had declared it impure, but now you vote for it to be pure, it is pure.”
So we find that Rebbi Simeon disagreed with the Sages and did not act upon his opinion. As we have stated there (<i>Mishnah Ševiït</i> 9:1) “Rebbi Simeon says: all aftergrowth is allowed except the aftergrowth of cabbage because nothing similar grows wild<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah deals with produce of the Seventh year offered for sale by an <i>Am Haäreẓ</i>, a Jew who cannot be trusted with the careful fulfillment of all his religious obligations. The Torah says not only that it is forbidden to plant and sow during the Sabbatical year but also (<i>Lev.</i> 32:5): “Do not harvest the aftergrowth of your harvest,” i. e., it is forbidden to commercially exploit the produce growing on one’s field from the seeds of the preceding year. It is, however, acceptable to collect from one’s fields small amounts for one’s daily needs (and even for storage as long as wild animals can find similar food on the fields.) Rebbi Simeon is of the opinion that a poor person may offer anything for sale since he might (or probably did) collect them from wild growing plants which do not fall under the prohibition. The only exception is produce which is never found growing wild; such vegetables are forbidden for commerce in the production of one’s own field. The Sages, while agreeing that Rebbi Simeon’s position is the one which follows the Biblical precept closely, nevertheless as a Rabbinic ordinance forbid any such buying from untrustworthy people since it is too difficult to enforce the fine distinction made by Rebbi Simeon.<br>Our example shows that Rebbi Simeon refrained from disagreeing in practice from the rest of the Sages even in purely Rabbinical ordinances. The man cursed by him probably did collect wild aftergrowth, or maybe was known to Rebbi Simeon as a landless person who, therefore, collected from growth on other people’s land that was declared ownerless (הפקר), otherwise his opponent could not have invoked R. Simeon’s own ruling. [This explanation follows Maimonides on the Mishnah. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 51b" href="/Pesachim.51b">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 51b</a> has a different text, see the discussion in Mishnah <i>Ševiït</i> 9:1, and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:9:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.9.2-5"><i>Kilaim</i>, Halakhah 1:9</a>, and the notes to the Mishnah edition of the Institute for the Complete Israeli Talmud, <i>Ševiït</i> 9:1. The Rome ms. has here “forbidden,” influenced by the Babli.]</i>. But the Sages say that all aftergrowth is forbidden.” Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai acted on this in a Sabbatical year. He saw a man harvesting aftergrowth. He said to him: Is that not forbidden, is that not aftergrowth? The man answered him back: Are you not the one who allows it? He retorted: Do not my colleagues disagree with me? He recited over him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 10:6" href="/Ecclesiastes.10.6"><i>Eccl.</i> 10:6</a>): “He who breaches a fence may be bitten by a snake”, and this is what happened to that man.

We have stated “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”. Some people do not formulate “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”. Who formulates “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”? The Sages. Who does not formulate “the eating of the Passover sacrifice”? Rebbi Eliezer.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">For the Sages, the obligation of eating the Passover sacrifices lasts during the entire Seder night; the limitation to the first half of the night is a Rabbinical ordinance. According to Rebbi Eliezer [and Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 9a" href="/Berakhot.9a">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 9a</a>], there is a Biblical prohibition of celebrating the Exodus after midnight. (Cf. the discussion in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, Northvale NJ 1995, pp. 263–264.)<br>Rebbi Eliezer’s argument goes as follows: The Bible prescribes that the Passover sacrifice should be eaten “in that night.” It also reports that the death of the Egyptian firstborn was “in the middle of the night”. Since the second occurrence of “night” is qualified by “middle” but the first is left indeterminate, and we subscribe to the opinion that, unless explicitly given otherwise, words in the Pentateuch have an invariable meaning, the first occurrence must also mean “midnight.” The Sages follow Rebbi Aqiba in pointing out that the first Passover had to be eaten “in a hurry”, the hurry of the Exodus that happened only the following day. Hence, the notion of “night” here is opposed to “day” and not restricted to the first half.</i> What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer? It is written here (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:8" href="/Exodus.12.8"><i>Ex.</i> 12:8</a>) “in the night”, and it is written there (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:29" href="/Exodus.12.29"><i>Ex.</i> 12:29</a>) “in the night”.

We shall see later that the third section of the <i>Shema‘</i>, dealing with the obligation of <i>tzitzit</i>, was in Israel recited in abridged form during evening prayers. Hence, the <i>tzitzit</i> characterized the morning prayers. Each <i>tzitzit</i> contained three strands of white thread with one of <i>tĕkhēlet</i>.</i> dark blue and its white. What is the reason of the Rabbis? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:39" href="/Numbers.15.39"><i>Num.</i> 15:39</a>) “You shall see it”<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">I. e., the תכלת thread among the white threads of the <i>tzitzit</i>.</i>, from what is close to it.

We have stated in the name of Rebbi Meïr: It does not say “you shall see it”<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">In Rabbinic Hebrew, ציצית is clearly feminine, plural ציציוֹת. Rebbi Meïr notes that the verb referring to ציצית in this verse is in the masculine form. Usually, this is taken to mean that in Biblical Hebrew, ציצית is masculine (parallel to masculine קֹהֶלֶת “the preacher”); but many dictionaries of Biblical Hebrew refrain from assigning a gender to the word. Rebbi Meïr votes for taking ציצית as feminine; hence the suffix in “and you shall see” cannot refer to the <i>tzitzit</i>.</i> but “you shall see Him”. This tells you that anyone who keeps the obligation of <i>tzitzit</i> is as if he were admitted to the presence of God’s glory. This tells that <i>tĕkhelet</i> is similar to the sea.

Both Talmudim consider his position appropriate only for exceedingly holy people.</i>; if there were two how much more would there be? Rebbi Yose said before Rebbi Jeremiah: The position of Rebbi Yoḥanan is identical with that of Rebbi Ḥanina ben Aqabiah, as we have stated: “The scribes of Torah scrolls, <i>Tefillin</i>, and <i>Mezuzot</i>, do interrupt for the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> but do not interrupt for prayer. Rebbi Ḥanina ben Aqabiah said: just as they interrupt for <i>Shema‘</i>, so they interrupt for prayer, <i>tefillin</i>, and all other commandments of the Torah”.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">While we have the principle that “he who is engaged in the fulfillment of a commandment does not have to worry about other commandments,” this does not apply to people whose entire occupation is the fulfillment of a commandment.<br>The source is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 2:6" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).2.6"><i>Tosephta Berakhot</i> 2:6</a>, cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sukkah 26a" href="/Sukkah.26a">Babli <i>Sukkah</i> 26a</a>. The Tosephta also brings the opinion of Rebbi, that they do not interrupt for <i>Shema‘</i>, and a testimony that Rabban Gamliel and the Synhedrion at Yavneh did not interrupt sessions dealing with communal matters.</i> Would not Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai agree that one interrupts to make a <i>sukkah</i> or a <i>lulav</i>? Does not Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai make the distinction between one who studies in order to do<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">He who does is one who fulfills the commandments of the Torah. He who does not is one who does not fulfill the commandments of the Torah. Someone who studies Torah with the intent of not fulfilling its commandments certainly has no part in the future world since he does not have the excuse of everybody else that he did not know enough to fulfill all commandments. This is clearly spelled out in the following lines. The question here is, how can Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai take a position that for all practical purposes identifies the actions of the most holy man with that of the deliberate sinner?</i> and one who studies in order not to do? Because he who studies in order not to do would have been better off had he not been born. And did not Rebbi Yoḥanan say, he who studies in order not to do would have been better off if the afterbirth he was in was twisted around and he never would have entered the world? The reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai is that this one is repeated study and that one is repeated study and he does not push aside one study for the other study.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">But he certainly will interrupt for all other obligations. In fact, the story of his stay in the cave notes that he and his son took off their clothes and sat covered with sand up to their necks in order not to wear out the clothes, and used them only for the times of prayer. This means that Rebbi Simeon did <i>not</i> recite <i>Shema‘</i> since its recitation was replaced by his studies, but he <i>did</i> pray, even though the Mishnah seems to indicate that one omits prayer more easily than <i>Shema‘</i>.</i> But did we not formulate:<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">In our Mishnah here in <i>Berakhot</i>.</i> “He is like a man reading in the Torah.” Hence, at the right time it is preferred to Torah. One is like the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">This is a preliminary answer. Rebbi Yudan (Amora, colleague of R. Yose) tries to relativize the answer that it applies only to someone like Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai who spends his entire life studying and memorizing Torah. R. Abba Mari, one generation after R. Yudan, points out that this interpretation of the Mishnah is impossible but that one must take the statement of R. Simeon as an indication of his attitude in general.</i> Rebbi Yudan said that Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai, since he was permanently studying Torah, did not prefer <i>Shema‘</i> to the study of Torah. Rebbi Abba Mari said, did we not formulate: “He who reads (<i>Shema‘</i>) after that did not lose, he is only like a man reading in the Torah”? Hence, at the right time it is like Mishnah. Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai follows his own opinion since Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai said: He who studies the written Torah does himself good that is not so good. But the rabbis equate the study of the Bible with that of the oral law.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Studying Scripture is equal to studying the Oral Law in merit. Hence, reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> in its proper time transcends both for everybody including scholars of the rank of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai. Mishnah here stands for the entire Oral Law, which was called Mishnah in the time of Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai. (See the parallel in Babli <i>Baba meẓia‘</i> 33a.)</i>

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The school of Shammai say: In the evening, everyone must bend down<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Means to lie down on a couch, or as on a couch. “Reciting” always refers to the <i>Shema‘</i> since, as a technical term, it is used only for formal recitation of Biblical texts.</i> and recite and in the morning they should stand up since it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:7" href="/Deuteronomy.6.7"><i>Deut.</i> 6:7</a>): “when you sit in your house or go on the road, when you are lying down and when you are getting up.” But the school of Hillel say: everyone should recite in the position he is in, since it says “or go on the road.” In that case, why does it say: “when you are lying down and when you are getting up;” this means the time when people go to sleep and the time when they are getting up.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> They of the school of Hillel are able to explain both parts of the verse. How do those of the school of Shammai explain “when you sit in your house or go on the road”? “When you sit in your house”, to exclude those who are occupied with other religious commandments, “or go on the road” to exclude bridegrooms.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">An almost exact parallel is found in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 11a" href="/Berakhot.11a">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 11a</a>. The bride is exempt from reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> since women are freed from all positive commandments which have to be performed at set times. The bridegroom himself fulfills a divine commandment by getting married, but that fulfillment is really restricted to the short act of actual marriage and then to the first married intercourse; the exemption of the bridegroom from saying <i>Shema‘</i> refers to the entire wedding feast when he is unable to concentrate even on the first verses.</i>

Eleazar ben Azariah at first is sitting up and R. Ismael is reclining. This means that in the Babylonian version, the discussion was in the evening (also indicated in the Babylonian Talmud by a change in language, not “that they stayed at the same place” but that “they had dinner together.”) In our version, the discussion takes place in the morning.<br>While R. Ismael, after R. Aqiba the greatest scholar of his generation, did certainly exceed R. Eleazar ben Azariah in scholarship, the latter was the vice president of the Synhedrion; it is more likely that R. Ismael was sitting upright at the start. They might have got up very early, before the start of dawn, when it still was possible to eat before praying. It is impossible to decide which of the two versions is the original.</i>: It happened that Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah and Rebbi Ismael stayed at the same place and Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah was reclining while Rebbi Ismael was standing. When the time for the recital of the <i>Shema‘</i> arrived did Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah stand and Rebbi Ismael reclined. Rebbi Eleazar said to Rebbi Ismael, this is as when one says to someone in the market place, your beard is overgrown, and he says, that is against those who shave<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">I do it deliberately. Why did you do the opposite of what I am doing?</i>. I, who was reclining, stood up and you, who were standing, went on to recline. He answered him: You stood up following the school of Shammai, I reclined following the school of Hillel. Another explanation: That the students should not see me and make it the permanent practice to follow the school of Shammai.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Both explanations are necessary. R. Ismael did recline, not because it was required by the school of Hillel, but to spite the followers of the school of Shammai. He had to do this, even though the school of Hillel would have allowed him to continue standing, to give an example to the students. This shows that in all cases where there is a disagreement over practice, the actions of the leading Torah scholars count more than all theoretical arguments.</i>

After the war of Bar Kokhba, we do not hear of any followers of the school of Shammai in practice, nor of Jews that are Sadducees in practice. In the Talmud (Babli <i>Nidda</i> 33b), R. Yose (ben Ḥalaphta) states that the Sadducees in his time follow Rabbinic practice. We know that the sect at Qumran were Sadducees and their <i>Tefillin</i> follow Sadducee rules; characteristically, they have many more Biblical quotes in addition to the required verses (cf. Y. Yadin, <i>Tefillin from Qumran</i>, Jerusalem, 1978). The <i>Tefillin</i> found with the Bar Kokhba letters in the caves of the Judean desert are of the same type. Hence, Sadducee practice did not completely stop until the war of Bar Kokhba. As far as Sadduceeism goes, its disappearance in practice can be dated to the aftermath of the war of Bar Kokhba.<br>It is not believable that a man of the stature of Rebbi Tarphon would transgress a generally accepted practice supported by a divine pronouncement and by popular consent. Hence, the episode of Rebbi Tarphon must be dated in time before the <i>bat qol</i>. It is generally accepted that Rebbi Tarphon did not live to see the war of Bar Kokhba. This narrows the time of the <i>bat qol</i> to close to that war.</i>.

The second opinion, by a late Amora in the name of one of the first ones, explains the asymmetry in the numbers since they must add up to the odd number of 7.<br>Since in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:6:2-11" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.6.2-11">Halakhah 9</a> (and in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 14b" href="/Berakhot.14b">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 14b</a>) it is reported that in Israel one did not recite the entire last section of <i>Shema‘</i> in the evening, Rebbi Simon also gives a reason for the asymmetry: In the evening one recites 4 benedictions and 2 sections, in the morning 3 benedictions and 3 sections, for a total of 6 morning and evening.

Rebbi Ammi in the name of R. Simeon ben Laqish is quoted that “benedictions do not invalidate one another”, i. e., the recitation of the second before the first is not an obstacle. The essential difference is that for the Babli, the last benediction before <i>Shema</i>‘, which is praise for the Torah and its study, may take the place of the explicit benediction for the Torah (e. g., for somebody who came late to the Synagogue and is reciting that benediction before he had a chance to recite the benediction for the Torah), whereas the Yerushalmi requires two benedictions unless one starts studying after the recitation of the <i>Shema‘</i> without interruption; see below and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Berakhot 11b:10:1" href="/Tosafot_on_Berakhot.11b.10.1"><i>Tosaphot Berakhot</i> 11b, <i>s. v.</i> שכבר</a>.</i>.

These are the benedictions one begins with “Praised”. All benedictions one begins with “Praised”, but a benediction following another one, e. g., the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> and <i>Amidah</i>, one does not begin with “Praised”.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">This statement exists in two additional versions. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 46a" href="/Berakhot.46a">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 46a</a>) it reads: All benedictions one begins with “Praised” except for benedictions over fruits, obligations, benedictions following another one and the last benediction of the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 1:9" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).1.9">Tosephta (<i>Berakhot</i> 1:9</a>) it reads: All benedictions one begins with “Praised” except for benedictions following another one and the last benediction of the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>.<br>The versions of the Tosephta and the Babli are essentially identical, except that the Babli for completeness includes the short benedictions of one sentence for the execution of a <i>mitzwah</i> and for eating food, whose form otherwise is taken for granted. The main difference between the Babli/Tosephta and the Yerushalmi is that the last benediction for the <i>Shema‘</i>, the one recited after <i>Shema‘</i>, is considered by the Yerushalmi to be the continuation of the second benediction before <i>Shema‘</i> but for the Babli it needs special mention. The consequence is that for the Yerushalmi all prayer benedictions separated by Scriptural readings from a preceding benediction are considered consecutive (the benedictions after the morning Psalms and <i>Hallel</i>) whereas for the Babli each one needs special treatment. The first objection to the rule given in the next paragraph is therefore impossible for the Babli.</i>
Rebbi Jeremiah objected: But there is “redemption”<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">The answer shows that the question is about the benediction at the end of the recitation of the <i>Haggadah</i> in the <i>Seder</i> night: “Praised are You, o Eternal, our God, King of the Universe, Who has redeemed us and has redeemed our forefathers from Egypt and let us attain this night to eat <i>mazzah</i> and bitter herbs. May it please You, o Eternal, our God and God of our fathers, to let us attain in peace more festive seasons and holidays, when we shall rejoice in the rebuilding of Your city and enjoy Your service. There we shall eat from the family offerings and the <i>pesaḥ</i> sacrifice whose blood shall reach the wall of Your altar for goodwill. Then we shall thank You with a new song for our redemption and the liberation of our persons. Praise be to You, o Eternal, Who did save Israel.”<br>This benediction follows the recitation of the first two Psalms of <i>Hallel</i>. It is clear from here, and from the parallel in the last Chapter of Yerushalmi <i>Pesaḥim</i> that in Israel in Talmudic times one preceded the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> by a benediction (the details are discussed in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, pp. 317–318). Hence, by the principle of the Yerushalmi, this benediction should not start with “Praised”.</i>. There is a difference since Rebbi Yoḥanan said<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 9:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.9.7.2"><i>Pesaḥim</i> 9:1,</a> fol. 37c. In Galilee there existed congregations which were illiterate except for the cantor, where no one could recite the <i>Hallel</i> or the entire <i>Haggadah</i> at home. For these people it was instituted that <i>Hallel</i> should be recited in the synagogue after evening prayers (with its benedictions before and after); then the people could go home and just recite the benediction for redemption, drink four cups and go to bed. The text there seems to imply that the required recital of the Exodus likewise was read to them in the synagogue. The generally accepted implication of this and the following arguments is that any benediction which under some circumstances could be recited by itself has the status of a benediction that is not following another one (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 36a" href="/Berakhot.36a"><i>Rashba</i> on Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 36a</a>).</i>: If he heard <i>Hallel</i> in the synagogue he has fulfilled his obligation. Rebbi Eleazar, the son of Rebbi Yose, objected before Rebbi Yose, but there is its ending.<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">There is much controversy about the meaning of this question; every commentator has another interpretation. In the author’s opinion, this is a complete parallel to the identical question asked later for <i>Qiddush</i> and refers simply to the concluding statement “Praise be to You, o Eternal, Who did save Israel.” Since this follows the entire text, it certainly is a benediction following another one, so why does it repeat “Praise be to You, o Eternal”?</i> He said to him: there are two, one for the future and one for the past.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">A statement of Rava in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 117b" href="/Pesachim.117b">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 117b</a> notes that the benediction for redemption after <i>Shema‘</i> and in the <i>Haggadah</i> is גאל ישׂראל but that in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer is גואל ישׂראל. The same formulation, גאל ישׂראל, is found in the Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i> and is followed by the <i>Haggadah</i> texts with the exception of the Yemenite ones. The unvocalized text of Mishnah and Talmud is read גָּאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל in the past tense. Then Rebbi Yose’s statement makes sense. Since the text concentrates on the future after a perfunctory mention of the past, the conclusion by a benediction for the past is a change of theme and, therefore, the concluding phrase has to be considered a separate benediction. [Rebbi Yose belongs to those authorities who require that the topic of the final benediction should be repeated <i>immediately</i> before the final sentence. His opinion is superseded here by that of Rebbi Mana later in the discussion but is taken up again by Rebbi Aḥa.]<br>The very conservative Yemenite tradition, strictly based on the Babli, cannot be expected to disregard a prescription of that Talmud. Hence, it is possible that Rava did read גָּאֵל יִשְׂרָאֵל, a <i>pa’el</i> form of the present [cf. S. Morag, בנין פָּאֵל וּבנין נִתְפָּאֵל, <i>Tarbiẓ 26</i>(1957), 349–356 and the material quoted in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, p. 322.] The Yerushalmi here shows that the Israeli reading was גָּאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל. Hence, identical (consonantal) wording in Babli and Yerushalmi does not necessarily imply same text and same meaning. Since Italian and Northern European Jewry obtained their prayer texts from Israel, probably in the Mishnaic period, it is the rule that their prayer texts follow Yerushalmi sources.</i>
They objected: There is <i>Havdalah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Havdalah</i> benediction at the end of the Sabbath is preceded by benedictions over wine, spices, and light. These are all short sentences and it is universally agreed that they should start with “praise”. The only problem is the <i>Havdalah</i> benediction itself, which follows the other ones. The answer is that the benedictions over spices and fire are recited in order only for convenience, not out of necessity, and that Rebbi did recite them separately. Hence, <i>Havdalah</i> is a potentially freestanding benediction, but it follows always the benediction for wine. The objection based on this is not raised, but it will be raised for <i>Qiddush</i> and the answer given there also applies here. It is explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 54a" href="/Pesachim.54a">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i>54a</a> that Rebbi was collecting the other benedictions on the cup for his family, not for himself.</i> There is a difference since Rebbi Abba bar Zavda said that Rebbi was dispersing them and collecting them on the cup. The great Rebbi Ḥiyya was collecting them<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">Being a Babylonian, he never gave up Babylonian practices even though he spent his life in Galilee.</i>.
They objected: There is <i>Nevarekh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">The introductory section of Grace after meals, known as ברכת הזימוּן, “the benediction of preparation”. This introductory paragraph is recited only when at least three people are eating together who are obliged to recite Grace in the same degree of obligation.

There is “He Who feeds all”<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">This is the concluding benediction of the first paragraph of Grace; the question is parallel to that asked for the concluding paragraphs of “redemption” and <i>Qiddush</i>. The lack of an answer here is provisional; the final answer of the Amoraïm of the last Galilean generation covers all these cases.</i>; that is difficult.
There is “He Who is good and does good”<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">The fourth section of Grace that clearly follows the third but nevertheless starts with “Praised”. The answer is that the first three sections constitute Grace as required by the Torah, while the fourth starts Rabbinic Grace.</i>. There is a difference since Rav Ḥuna said: When permission was received to bury the slain of Bethar, “He Who is good and does good” was fixed, “He Who is good” because they did not rot, “He Who does good” because permission was received to bury them.
There is <i>Qiddush</i><sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">The main benediction follows the benediction over wine (or over bread) and, nevertheless, starts with “Praised”. The answer is that <i>Qiddush</i> during a meal does not require the benediction over wine even though there is an interruption in the meal since one is forbidden to eat and drink after sundown Friday night before making <i>Qiddush</i>. The Babli does not take up this question, hence practice follows this Yerushalmi, <i>Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 271, Sec. 4. The <i>Qiddush</i> starts with “praised” and its final sentence again starts with “praised.”</i>. There is a difference since if one was sitting and drinking when it still was day and the holy day came upon him, he does not say “Creator of the fruit of the vine.” But there is its final sentence? Rebbi Mana said, the type<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">Greek τύπος, “pattern, model, prescribed form”. Rebbi Mana was a student of Rebbi Yudan who uses the Hebrew מטבע “coin” for “form”. The students of Rebbi Mana were the collectors of the Yerushalmi in the form it came down to us. Hence, his answer is final: All long benedictions end with “Praise to You, o Eternal, …” as a matter of principle (going back to the Men of the Great Assembly). Between this sentence and the next, a “since” should be mentally interpolated.</i> of benedictions is like that. Rebbi Yudan said: A short form starts with “Praised” and does not end with “Praised”, a long form starts with “Praised” and ends with “Praised”.
All benedictions after their seals<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">This is a continuing discussion of the statement of Rebbi Yudan. The “seal” of a longer benediction is the last sentence “Praise to You, o Eternal, …” It is stated that this “seal” is what makes the benediction valid and it cannot be a Biblical verse.</i>; one does not say a verse as benediction. Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar objected before Rebbi Yose: Because you say after their seals, one does not say a verse as benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">Since the two statements appear together in one <i>baraita</i>, there should be a logical connection between them but there seems to be none.</i>?

They do not disagree with the rule which they state, but they note that the <i>baraita</i> does not deal with it; its correct interpretation is by Rebbi Aḥa.<br>About the rule itself, there is disagreement between the Yerushalmi and the parallel <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 12a" href="/Berakhot.12a">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 12a</a>, where it is stated: “If in the morning one started with ‘Creator of light’ and ended with ‘Making evenings dark’, he did not do his duty. If in the evening he starts with ‘He Who makes evenings dark’ and ends with ‘Creator of light’, he did not do his duty. But if he started with ‘Creator of light’ and ended with ‘Making evenings dark’, he did his duty. The principle is: Everything is determined by the seal.” The Babli asserts that if in evening prayers one started out wrongly with the text appropriate for morning prayers then everything is O.K. if only the final doxology is correct. But the Yerushalmi speaks of one “who is standing in morning prayers and forgot”, i. e., that he started out correctly, forgot himself in the middle, and remembered in time to close with the correct text. The principles of prayer texts were instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly. They determined the contents of the prayers but not, in general, their texts. (For the <i>Amidah</i>, the Mishnah even reports that Rebbi Eliezer says that one who repeats the same text for more than 30 days cannot really be an honest supplicant). The question is whether, in addition to the contents, the Men of the Great Assembly only determined the “seals” (following the Babli) or also the introductory sentences (following the Yerushalmi).</i>. Rebbi Aḥa said, all benedictions in the kind of their seals.<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">The language is difficult. R. Eleazar Askari explains that Rebbi Aḥa insists that only the “seal” counts and, therefore, the text preceding the “seal” is unimportant; the text of the “seal” cannot be a verse. R. Shelomo Cirillo and R. Moshe ben Ḥabib explain, on the contrary, that the “seal” must fit the text of the benediction just preceding and that this text cannot be a verse. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 104a" href="/Pesachim.104a">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 104a</a>) this principle is spelled out only for <i>Havdalah</i> [and in the Yerushalmi the treatment given for <i>Havdalah</i>, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 5:2:2-16" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.5.2.2-16"><i>Berakhot</i> 5:2</a>, fol. 9b) supports R. Eleazar Askari.] Most Medieval authorities extend the principle of the Babli to all longer benedictions.</i> But those who say (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 12:6" href="/Isaiah.12.6"><i>Is.</i> 12:6</a>): “Jubilate and sing, inhabitant of Zion …” do not violate the rule that no benediction is a verse<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">Ezra Fleischer (<i>Tarbiẓ</i> 41, p. 450) has published a Yerushalmi prayer text from the Cairo Genizah which uses this verse in the third benediction of the ‘<i>Amidah</i>, קדושת השם. From what is left of the original Galilean <i>minhag</i> it seems clear that the standard text of longer benedictions always ended with a Biblical verse just preceding the “seal”. For example, in Grace, the verses were <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 145:16" href="/Psalms.145.16"><i>Ps.</i> 145:16</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:10" href="/Deuteronomy.8.10"><i>Deut.</i><i>8:10</a></i>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 147:2" href="/Psalms.147.2">Ps. 147:2</a>. In the morning prayers, the verses have survived in the first benediction for <i>Shema‘</i> in all <i>minhagim</i> and for the benediction after <i>Shema‘</i> in most of them. The text states that the only acceptable place for a Biblical verse is <i>before</i> the “seal”. Even the Mishnah prescribes benedictions whose text is a Biblical verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 2:2:2-14" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.2.2.2-14"><i>Taäniot</i> 2:2</a>); what is prohibited here is using a verse in the final doxology.</i>.

The first statement is attributed to an otherwise unknown Tanna Naḥum the elder. The statement of R. Joshua ben Levi is attributed to Rebbi Yose (ben Ḥalaphta) but without the verse that gives the reason. The Yerushalmi gives a statement of Amoraïm, not to claim that the required topics were introduced by Amoraïm (that is quite obvious from the mention of Rebbi), but in order to point out the Scriptural basis and to fix the exact place where Torah has to be mentioned in Grace.</i> one tells him to repeat.

Bar Qappara<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">Bar Qappara belongs to the generation of transfer between Tannaïm and Amoraïm.

In the Babli, the parallel (13a) appears also at the end of the first Chapter, somewhat disconnected. One may assume that it is mentioned in parallel to the Yerushalmi.<br>In the printed editions of the Babli, the text is: “Bar Qappara stated”, a Tannaïtic statement. However, in the Munich ms. and the <i>Pisqe RYD</i> the text reads דרש בר קפרא “Bar Qappara preached”, an Amoraïc statement. (It also seems that Rebbi Eliezer, who completes the statement of Bar Qappara in the Babli in parallel to Rebbi Levi in the Yerushalmi, is “Rebbi Eleazar, the son of Bar Qappara’s sister”.) The people who object are determined in the Babli to be Rebbi Yose bar Abin or Rebbi Yose bar Zabida, of the later generation of Galilean Amoraïm. The statements of Bar Qappara and Rebbi Levi/Rebbi Eleazar are not mentioned in any of the Medieval codes, <i>Halakhot Gedolot, Alfasi, Mishneh Torah</i>; their authors took also the text in the Babli as Amoraïc sermon.</i> said: He who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive commandment.

Why were the names of Abraham and Jacob changed but Isaac’s name was not changed?

The Kingdoms will be principal and the Exodus additional. And similarly it was said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 35:10" href="/Genesis.35.10"><i>Gen.</i> 35:10</a>): :Your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name.” Not that the name Jacob will be taken away but Jacob will be additional to Israel. Israel will be principal and Jacob additional. And so it says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 43:18-19" href="/Isaiah.43.18-19"><i>Is.</i> 43:18–19</a>): “Do not remember the first things”; this means the Egyptians, “And what was earlier do not dwell on”; this means the Kingdoms, “Behold, I create something new, now it will grow”; this refers to Gog. They gave a simile: to what can this be compared? To someone who encountered a wolf and was saved from it. He started telling about the wolf when he encountered a lion and was saved from it. He forget about the wolf and started telling about the lion.After that, he encountered a snake and was saved from it. He forgot about both of them and started telling about the snake. So it is with Israel, the last troubles make them forget the earlier ones.

Chapter 2



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If someone was reading in the Torah at the time of recital<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Time of the obligatory recital of <i>Shema‘</i>.</i>, if he read with intention<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The intention of fulfilling the commandment of reading the <i>Shema‘</i>.</i> he fulfilled his duty, otherwise he did not fulfill his duty. Between the sections<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Of the <i>Shema‘.</i></i>, one greets people out of respect and answers their greetings. In the middle of a section one may greet because of fear and answer, the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yehudah says: in the middle of a section one may greet out of fear and answer for respect, between sections one greets for respect and answers greetings from everybody.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Abba said: This means that benedictions do not prevent<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">. Since the Mishnah allows one to concentrate on reading the Torah text as <i>Shema‘</i> without requiring an interruption for recitations of the benedictions, it follows that benedictions are a separate obligation. In a number of prayer texts from the Genizah, the recitation of the <i>Shema‘</i> has a separate benediction: “Praised be You, o Eternal, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us through His commandments and commanded us about the recitation of <i>Shema‘,</i> with a full heart to declare Him King over us, and willingly to declare His Unity.” While these texts are from a period about 500 years later than the text of the Yerushalmi, they show that recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> was then still considered an obligation separate from the benedictions mentioned in the Mishnah. The latter benedictions could then be recited before the <i>Amidah</i>. See Ezra Fleischer,תפילה ומנהגי תפילה ,ארץ־ישראליים בתקופת הגניזה Jerusalem 1988.<br>The paragraph has been explained as parallel to the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 11b-12a" href="/Berakhot.11b-12a">Babli (11b–12a</a>) by R. Solomon ben Adrat (<i>Rashba</i>) in his responsa, vol. 1, no 319.</i>.
Rebbi Yose said: If you say that one needs to recite the benedictions; when he recited them he must focus his attention for the entire <i>Shema‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Yose supports the statement of Rebbi Abba: If one would require concentration on what one recites for benedictions before and after <i>Shema‘,</i> certainly one requires total attention during the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>. As seen at the end of this paragraph, this is not the rule.</i>. They objected: Does he not interrupt and it does not appear in our statement?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the Mishnah, it is assumed that one may recite the several sections of the <i>Shema‘</i> separately since they are written at different places in the Torah scroll. Since the Mishnah does not mention the necessary interruptions in the recital, it might be possible that the Mishnah contemplates interruptions for the recitation of the benedictions before and after <i>Shema‘</i>; hence, the inference of Rebbi Abba is not justified.</i> So here also, even though it has not been stated he must recite the benedictions. That means<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The argument would be good only if the statement of Rebbi Yose were true.</i>, one must focus one’s attention for the entire <i>Shema‘</i>. We may hear it from the following: Rebbi Aḥai<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Aḥai was “Tanna”, collector of <i>baraitot</i>, in the Yeshivah of Rebbi Ḥiyya. He belongs to the generation between Tannaïm and Amoraïm. His statement, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 2:2" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).2.2"><i>Tosephta Berakhot</i>2:2</a> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 13a" href="/Berakhot.13a">Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 13a</a>), shows that Rebbi Yose’s argument is correct and that Rebbi Abba stated the practice correctly. (In the printed editions of the Babli, the name is Rebbi Aḥa, but in the Munich manuscript, and in all manuscripts of the Tosephta, the name is correctly Rebbi Aḥai. Rebbi Aḥa is an Amora of the fourth generation.)</i> said in the name of Rebbi Yehudah: “He has fulfilled his obligation if he focussed his attention for the first paragraph, even though he did not focus his attention during recitation of the second paragraph”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A natural question following the Tosephta of Rebbi Yehudah.</i>.
What is the difference between the first and second paragraphs?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A natural question following the Tosephta of Rebbi Yehudah.</i> Rebbi Ḥanina said: Everything mentioned in the first paragraph is mentioned in the second. In that case, should one have to recite only one of them? Rebbi Illa said: The first one is directed to the individual, the second one to the community; the first one concentrates on learning, the second one on doing<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The first paragraph is formulated in the singular, the second one in the plural. In addition, while the essence of the first paragraph is repeated in the second as a communal obligation, there are many topics in the second paragraph that are not mentioned in the first. In the language of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 14b" href="/Berakhot.14b">Babli (14b</a>), the first paragraph is the acceptance of the acceptance of Heaven, the second one the acceptance of the commandments of the Torah.</i>.
Bar Qappara said: One has to focus his attention only during the first three verses<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is the accepted practice for the Yerushalmi with no one objecting. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 13b" href="/Berakhot.13b">Babli (13b</a>), the statement is given in the name of an otherwise unknown Tanna Rebbi Zutra, and, even though it exemplifies the attitude of Rebbi Aqiba, it is later replaced by the statement of Rebbi Meïr that only the first verse, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:4" href="/Deuteronomy.6.4"><i>Deut.</i> 6:4</a>, must be recited with focussed attention. Another difference between the more demanding Yerushalmi and the Babli is that the Yerushalmi requires the rest of <i>Shema‘</i> to be “repeated”, i.e., memorized, whereas in the Babli it has only to be read.</i>. It was stated thus: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:7" href="/Deuteronomy.6.7"><i>Deut.</i> 6:7</a>) “You should repeat”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, "memorize".</i> until there is the obligation of focussed attention; from there starts the obligation of repetition.
Rebbi Ḥunah, Rebbi Uri<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Uri is not known from any other source. The Rome manuscript of the Yerushalmi reads “Rebbi Ammi”; this might be a better reading but Rebbi Ammi was a student of Rebbi Yoḥanan who in the parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 13b" href="/Berakhot.13b">Babli (13b</a>) is reported to require that a person walking has to stand still during recitation of the entire first paragraph of <i>Shema‘,</i> since he follows the ruling of Rebbi Aḥai in the name of Rebbi Yehudah that the entire first paragraph requires concentrated attention.</i>, Rav Joseph, Rav Yehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The most influential of all students of Samuel.</i> in the name of Samuel: One has to accept the Kingdom of Heaven standing.

It was stated: One has to prolong “is One”.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The last word of the first sentence of <i>Shema‘</i>. The composition here is difficult to understand since one starts with a tannaïtic statement (“It was stated”), continues with the opinion of an Amora (Rav Naḥman bar Jacob), and then returns to a Tanna (Symmachos, an outstanding student of Rebbi Meïr). The parallel <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 13b" href="/Berakhot.13b">Babli (13b</a>) starts with the statement of Symmachos and then continues with the statement of Rav Naḥman bar Jacob which is quoted there in the name of Rav Aḥa bar Jacob. It is possible that “Aḥa”, a name without meaning, is simply a form of endearment of the formal name “Naḥman”, and that in the Babli it is necessary to use the form of endearment to distinguish this Amora from Rav Naḥman, quoted without his father’s name because of his exalted status, whose full name seems to have been Rav Naḥman bar Jacob.</i> Rav Naḥman bar Jacob said: But only at the <i>daleth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The soft ד, without <i>dagesh</i>, was pronounced like an Arabic ذ, or a voiced English <i>th</i>, a sibilant sometimes close to ז. For example, the Aramaic די appears in the Elephantine papyri as זי. Hence, it really was possible to prolong the consonant <i>daleth</i> since it was not a plosive sound as it is today.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 13b" href="/Berakhot.13b">Babli (13b</a>), Rav Ashi adds that one should not omit to pronounce the ח. This was because in Babylonia, as in Medieval Ashkenaz, a ח was pronounced like a stronger ה and therefore tended to be silent in the middle of a word, as ה is mostly silent in the middle of a word in modern Hebrew. (Even the masters of the Massorah tried to counteract this tendency, e. g. by punctuating יִֽהְיֶה, to make the <i>Sheva</i> heard when it should be silent by grammatical rules, so that the Torah reader should be forced to pronounce the ה, but obviously to no avail.)</i> Symmachos bar Joseph<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A Tanna, student of Rebbi Meïr.</i> said: Anyone who prolongs “is One” has his days and years prolonged in wellbeing. Rebbi Jeremiah was prolonging very much. Rebbi Zeïra said to him: So much is unnecessary, only so long that you should think of Him as King of Heaven and Earth and the four directions of the world.
Rav asked Rebbi Ḥiyya: But I never see that Rebbi accepts upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. He answered him: When you will see him cover his face with his hand, at that moment he accepts the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 13b" href="/Berakhot.13b">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 13b</a>. It seems that Rebbi started his Yeshivah classes early in the morning, before one could recite <i>Shema‘,</i> and continued until it was too late to recite <i>Shema‘</i> as “acceptance of the yoke of heaven”, but only as “reading from the Torah.”</i> He asked him back: Is it not necessary also to mention the Exodus? He answered him: It is impossible that he should not turn his words<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Turn his words to the Exodus.

Rebbi Tavyome<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">An Israeli Amora of the fourth generation who otherwise is quoted only in Midrashim.</i> asked Rebbi Ḥizkiah: Does this not mean that one has to focus attention only for the first verse?<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">If Rebbi recited the relevant portion of <i>Shema‘</i> while covering his face with his hand during his morning classses, he could not have spent much time on it and, therefore, Rebbi does not accept the opinion of Bar Qappara that the first three verses have to be recited with focussed attention.</i> He said to him: With that<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">While he was covering his face he could have recited all three verses and there is no proof that he disagreed with the ruling that requires concentration for the first three verses.</i> he might recite until “You shall repeat.”

<b>New Section.</b> “Between the sections one greets people out of respect, and answers them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This is a quote from the Mishnah. The problem is that Rebbi Meïr does not indicate why one should answer. Since for Rebbi Yehudah the rules for answering are more lenient than for initiating the exchange, it follows that for Rebbi Meïr the rules for answering are not more lenient, but it is unclear whether answering and initiating have identical status or that the rules for answering are more restrictive than those for initiating a verbal exchange. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 13b" href="/Berakhot.13b">Babli (13b</a>) explains the words of Rebbi Meïr as meaning “one may start an exchange <i>and it goes without saying</i> that one may answer”, they seem to assume that it is obvious that the rules of answering cannot be stricter than those for starting. Also, the Babli takes the two parts together; it is possible that the unnecessary length in the statement of Rebbi Meïr is considered simply as a parallel to the necessary length of the statement of Rebbi Yehudah while for the Yerushalmi the two parallel statements of Rebbi Meïr represent two parallel problems which have to be solved separately. Hence the seemingly repetitous arrangement of the Yerushalmi here; but the first quote of Rebbi Meïr is in support of an argument while the second one presents the topic for further discussion; the two quotes of the identical text are of different status.</i> Why does one answer, out of fear or to show respect?

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The following are “between the sections”: between the first benediction and the second, between the second and <i>Shema‘,</i> between <i>Shema‘</i> and (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 11:13" href="/Deuteronomy.11.13"><i>Deut.</i> 11:13</a>) “it shall be when you will really listen”, between “it shall be when you will really listen” and (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:37" href="/Numbers.15.37"><i>Num.</i> 15:37</a>) “the Eternal spoke”. Between “the Eternal spoke” and “true and outstanding<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The benediction after <i>Shema‘,</i> starting with a series of epithets of the Torah.</i>”. Rebbi Yehudah said, between “the Eternal spoke” and “true and outstanding” one may not interrupt.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Levi said<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 14a" href="/Berakhot.14a">Babli (14a</a>), the explanation is by R.

In addition, Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan in the Babli declares that the practice follows Rebbi Yehudah; this decision is missing in the Yerushalmi and, hence, it seems that in Israel one used to follow the majority opinion that an interruption is permitted between the last words of the <i>Shema‘</i> and “true”. Hence, the question asked in the Babli, whether after reciting “the Eternal, your God. True!” one stops and starts again “true and outstanding”, is irrelevant for the Yerushalmi. The question in the Babli is whether Rebbi Yehudah disagrees with the first Tanna in principle, that ‘between “the Eternal spoke” and “true and outstanding” ’ there is no interruption allowed or whether he simply moves the end of technical <i>Shema‘</i> by one word and then allows the regular interruptions there.</i>, the reason of Rebbi Yehudah: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:41" href="/Numbers.15.41"><i>Num.</i> 15:41</a>) “I am the Eternal, your God<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">These are the concluding words of <i>Shema‘</i>.</i>”, and it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 10:10" href="/Jeremiah.10.10"><i>Jer.</i> 10:10</a>) “But the Eternal is the true God”.

This contradicts the opinion of the Babli as quoted above; it eliminates the objection of the Babli that certainly Rav would not put off fulfilling the obligation of <i>tefillin</i> until after the recital of <i>Shema‘</i>.</i>?

The Yerushalmi does not go into details. The connection with the previous text probably is the quote that one may not wear <i>tefillin</i> in a graveyard. This also counts as having an unclean body since on leaving the graveyard one has to wash his hands. A Mishnah in the next Chapter also implies that one may not wear <i>tefillin</i> when his body is not cleansed from an emission of semen. Some Medieval authorities imply from the statement of R.

The explanation of Tosaphot is easier to fit into our text but the explanation of Rabbenu Yeruḥam seems to have the correct historical background. Both the Roman and the Byzantine governments from time to time forbade the wearing of <i>tefillin</i>. Therefore, from the start of the reconstruction of Jewish life after the war of Bar Kokhba, <i>tefillin</i> were not worn publicly in the Land of Israel. The reading of the Rome manuscript, “Why does one not hold on to them in the Land of Israel?” seems to explain the situation from a Babylonian point of view where <i>tefillin</i> never were a problem with the government and where, in R. Sherira Gaon’s time at least, <i>tefillin</i> were worn by scholars all day long.

The objection is that (except for a fast day) one has to eat, hence one has to take off one’s <i>tefillin</i> and put them on again, certainly with a benediction.

If one connected the letters<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">One speaks here about writing <i>tefillin</i>, <i>mezuzot</i> and Torah scrolls, not about wearing them.

But when a letter has its head elongated, so that from the start the letter was not standing free, then the entire letter has to be scratched out and the writing has to start anew. The questionable case is a situation with a letter that is hanging down below the line, as in the combination תך when the small foot of ת meets the downward stroke of ך.

Joel Sirkes known as <i>Baḥ</i>, wants to cross out the last part of the quote, but the Yerushalmi shows that two versions of the Mishnah did exist and, since it is impossible to write two versions at the same place, one is quoted as a separate Mishnah and the other in the text.</i> he has fulfilled his obligation, Rebbi Yose says that he has not fulfilled his obligation.

Zachariah Frankel wants to correct “Rebbi Meïr” to “Rebbi Yehudah” and considers the second version of the Mishnah in both Talmudim as the Mishnah of Rebbi Ḥiyya, in contrast to the Mishnah of Rebbi that is formulated anonymously.

It was stated: “He who did pray<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The thrice daily <i>Amidah</i> prayer.</i> and did not make his ear hear did fulfill his obligation.” For whom do we need that?

Rav Mattanah notes that, obviously, one does not mean a deaf and dumb person who cannot talk, but a deaf person who cannot hear. Since the Mishnah is anonymous, it must be the consensus of the Sages that one cannot fulfill the obligation of reading the <i>Megillah</i> if one does not hear what he himself is saying. Hence, the general consensus in <i>Megillah</i> is identical with the opinion of Rebbi Yose in <i>Berakhot</i>.

Rabbi Ḥanina said in the name of Rav Ḥisda, this one is by Rebbi Yose.

For example, the technical term מחוור “logically consistent” in the Babli appears as מְחוּבָּר “connected” in Yerushalmi <i>Peah</i> 2:1, fol.l6d. It does not make any sense to derive מחוור from Aramaic חוור “pale”. Hence, Galilean מחבר sounded מחוור in Babylonian ears.

What means that he is in equilibrium? Two parts on his back and one part in front.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">An extended prohibition to communicate with others by movements of eyes, lips, or hands while reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> is given in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 19b" href="/Yoma.19b">Babli, <i>Yoma</i> 19b</a>, in the name of the early Babylonian Amora Rav Isaac bar Samuel Bar Martha. However, the Biblical justification of the prohibition is there given in the name of the early Tanna Rebbi Eleazar Ḥisma. Hence, the statement of the Yerushalmi is a genuine tannïtic one.</i>: “Nobody should give messages with his eyes while reciting.”
It was stated: “The hourly workers who worked for an employer have to recite the first benediction of Grace and subsume that of Jerusalem in the benediction for the Land and close with the benediction for the Land<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">The obligation of reciting Grace is biblical but the number of benedictions is a rabbinical ordinance (<i>Beth Yosef</i> on <i>Ṭur Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 191). In order to reduce the expense for the employer (and, hence, increase employment for the poor), the hourly workers whose lunchbreak is paid for by their employer recite an abbreviated version of Grace that still contains all required elements. Since the Yerushalmi does not mention the benedictions before the meal it seems that the hourly workers are required to recite these [this is also the reading of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 5:24" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).5.24"><i>Tosephta</i> (5:24</a>) and most of the manuscripts of the Babli, against the Venice text of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 16a" href="/Berakhot.16a">Babli (16a</a>)].</i>. But if they were working for him for their meals <sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">For the food only, without cash payment to them.</i> or if the employer was eating with them, then they recite all four benedictions.” Rebbi Mana said: This means that one may not work while reciting Grace. Otherwise, why do we have to say this<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">The abbreviated version of Grace; it is necessary only if it profits the employer.</i>? Let him work and recite the benedictions!

Rebbi Yose bar Abun thus taught his son-in-law Rebbi Hillel<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Probably referring to both prayer and trusteeship.</i>.
Rebbi Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa were sitting at one place and Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa had coins on him. There came the time for prayer, he unbound them and gave them to Rebbi Ḥizqiah.

Rebbi Ḥanina<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">He refers back to the <i>Tosephta</i> that allowed praying if the carrier’s load did not exceed 4 <i>qab</i>. The statement is introduced here since it is explained on the authority of R. Jacob ben Aḥa who was the main person in the preceding section.<br>The water referred to here is water used for the sprinkling with the ashes of the red heifer to cleanse from impurity caused by contact or closeness to the body of a dead Jew, as explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19" href="/Numbers.19"><i>Num.</i> 19</a> and the Mishnah tractate <i>Parah.</i> The ashes of the red heifer have to be given into מים חיים אל כלי, virgin fresh water in a vessel. This means that after being drawn from flowing water, the water has to be watched so that no kind of work is done with it. A lapse of attention to the water makes it unfit for use in cleansing from impurity. Nevertheless, Rebbi Ḥanina states that one may recite <i>Shema‘</i> and even pray while carrying such water. This statement is obviously difficult to accept. Rav Ḥuna (the second) dismisses Rebbi Ḥanina’s statement as in obvious contradiction to generally accepted principles.</i> said: Also one who has his water on his shoulder may recite <i>Shema‘</i> and pray. Rav Ḥuna said: So the reciting of <i>Shema‘</i> and praying do not require concentration? Rebbi Mana said: I pointed out the difficulty before Rebbi Phineas that even if you say that the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> does not need concentration, does prayer not need concentration<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Even if one accepts Rebbi Ḥanina’s statement for <i>Shema‘</i>, its reference to prayer must be a mistake even though it refers to a prior statement about prayer only. The sentence is a rhetorical question. In a text from the Cairo Genizah, it is formulated as a declarative sentence: “recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> does not need concentration; prayer needs concentration”. The meaning is the same in both versions.</i>? Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">The Amora, one of the editors of the Yerushalmi.</i> said: I confirmed it following what Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: You got it, the completion of the works of water<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">After the ashes have already been given into the water, when it is clear that the term “living water” no longer applies and there is no indication in the Torah that it has to be guarded as strictly as before. This also explains R. Ḥanina’s expression “his water”, not מי חטאת “the water of sprinkling” that is the technical term used for fresh water guarded for the ashes. It follows that as long as the ashes have not been given into the water, one may neither recite <i>Shema‘</i> nor pray while guarding it.</i> that are not clear from the words of the Torah.

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The bridegroom is free from reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> in the first night<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is unable to concentrate in anticipation of his first night with his bride. The bride, as a woman, has no obligation to recite <i>Shema‘</i> since this is a positive commandment occurring at stated times and does not apply to women.</i>; until the end of Sabbath if he did not do the act<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">It was common usage even in seventeenth Century Germany that couples who married Wednesday night had their first sexual relations the night following the Sabbath, cf. <i>Minhagim of the Community of Worms by R. Yospe Shamash</i>, ed. I. Zimer, I. M. Peles, vol. 2, p. 47; there the editor gives several conjectural reasons in note 16. He also indicates that this is a possible reflection of old usages from the Land of Israel, never followed in Babylonia. It seems to me that the usage is quite understandable if it is noted that bride and bridegroom were in their low teens, the girl possibly even a pre-teen. The marriage was arranged by the parents, with minimal involvement of the parties to the wedding. Some time was needed for the parties to get acquainted enough to get intimate.</i>. An action: Rabban Gamliël married and recited in the first night<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">Since he already had the title “Rabban” and had students of his own, it is obvious that he was not a teenager and the marriage was not his first. Hence, his level of anxiety was low.</i>. His students said to him: Our teacher, did you not teach us that the bridegroom is free? He said to them: I will not listen to you to lift from me the Kingdom of Heaven even for one hour.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Eleazar ben Antigonos<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">An Israeli Amora of the second generation who always reports in the name of R. Eleazar, son of R. Yannai.</i> in the name of Rebbi Eleazar the son of Rebbi Yannai: This means that it is permitted to start sexual relations on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">Since the groom is free from reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> Friday evening if he did not yet have intercourse with his wife, it follows that we expect him to be anxious about it also Friday night. If he were not allowed to have intercourse, then he could defer his anxiety for a day and recite <i>Shema‘</i>. The problem is that he will make a wound in deflowering his wife and, in the normal case of a very young girl, the making of the wound is automatic. Now, the making of a wound is forbidden on the Sabbath but, according to Rebbi Simeon (bar Yoḥai), any work not done for its own sake is not forbidden, except in the case of an automatic consequence (פסיק רישא “cut off its head, will it not die?’). For the very young girls discussed here, the wound might be an automatic consequence.<br>The entire discussion belongs more to <i>Niddah</i> X:1 where all the parallels in the Babli are found. The second part of the Yerushalmi <i>Niddah</i> is lost and it cannot be ascertained anymore whether the entire discussion of our Mishnah is taken from there.</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai said before Rebbi Yose: Explain it for a widow where he does not make a wound. He answered him: Did we not formulate “Four nights?<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first Mishnah in the last chapter of tractate <i>Niddah</i>: “About a young girl who marries before puberty, the House of Shammai say that one allows four nights and the House of Hillel say until the wound is healed” (one does not suspect any blood to be menstrual). While it is quite possible that a very young girl can already be a widow, the Mishnah cannot apply to her since the marriage festivities of a widow are only three days (Thursday, Friday, Sabbath) while those of a virgin are seven days (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 1:1:2-17" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.1.2-17"><i>Ketubot</i> 1:1</a>). Hence, we cannot talk here about a widow.</i>” Can you say four nights for a widow?
Rebbi Jacob bar Savdi<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">An Amora of the fourth generation, probably somewhat older than Rebbi Yose.</i> said: I asked the question before Rebbi Yose: What is the difference between her and him who breaks a clay amphora in order to eat a dried fig from it<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> XXII:3: “One may break a clay amphora (whose top has been closed off by solid clay) in order to eat a dried fig from its contents, but he may not have the intent to make it into a permanent vessel,” i. e., he may not break the seal open in such a way that it needs no more action after the Sabbath to make the opening a permanent one that is easy to use. This follows the principle quoted before that according to R. Simeon, work not needed for its own sake is not forbidden on the Sabbath. Even R. Yehudah, who disagrees and states that any complete work is forbidden on Sabbath irrespective of intent, will agree that breaking off an irregular piece of the covering does not constitute complete work since it needs further regularization after the Sabbath. Rebbi Yose’s answer is that breaking the hymen is a complete action in itself and, therefore, both R. Simeon and R. Yehudah will forbid it: R. Simeon because of his intent and R. Yehudah because it is a complete action.<br>In the Babli, the deflowered woman is called a vessel; the Yerushalmi only compares her to a vessel.</i>? He said to me: But it says afterwards, “only he should have no intent to make it into a usable vessel.” And here when he has the intention of making her a married woman it is as if he had the intention of making her into a vessel.

Simeon forbids actions which automatically imply some other action that desecrates the Sabbath, here he allows a first sex act on Sabbath since splitting the hymen is not a necessary consequence if the male partner is considerate (and, consequently, an intact hymen is no guarantee of virginity.) Since we decide on the Sabbath according to the opinion of Rebbi Simeon and since the medical statement is by Samuel, the greatest medical authority in the Babli, it is clear that the Babli decides that first sex relations on Friday night are permitted. (In the Middle Ages, poor people married on Friday afternoon in order to save expenses for a separate wedding meal.) It is seen here that the Yerushalmi is strictly of the opposite opinion; hence, the identity of “others” is not determined here.</i>: “A man should not have first sexual relations on the Sabbath because he makes a wound; but others allow it.” Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: The reason of the others is that he is intent on his job; the wound results automatically<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, the act is permitted according to R.

But in fact the deviations of the text here from its original in <i>Moëd Qaṭan</i> are all scribal or printer’s errors, as is shown from the Rome ms. and the Genizah fragments. Therefore, the text here follows the <i>Moëd Qaṭan</i> text wherever there is manuscript evidence from <i>Berakhot</i> to support that version.</i> stated that the mourner is forbidden to take a bath during the entire seven days?

Something happened to Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">The fourth generation Amora. It seems that Rebbi Yose felt uncomfortable with the prohibition of bathing; he sent one of his students to ask Rebbi Aḥa, the greatest authority in Lydda, in Judea.

Nevertheless, Rebbi Aḥa did not want to interfere with the prohibition accepted in Galilee and answered not with his own opinion but with a note that Rebbi Yose himself had taught about two cases where the question had come up in Galilee and was answered in the sense of Rebbi Nathan.</i>; he sent Rebbi Abba bar Cohen to Rebbi Aḥa; he said to him: Rebbi, did you not so teach us that something happened to Rebbi Ammi, he asked Resh Laqish<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish; the abbreviation “Resh Laqish” is standard in the Babli but very infrequent in the Yerushalmi.

And also from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">This is Rebbi Aḥa’s answer: Even if you do not agree that Rebbi Ammi asked twice, for two different cases of mourning, and was given the same answer by two different authorities, I have a completely independent occurrence in which Galilean rabbis gave the same ruling and, therefore, you have to accept it.</i>: Something happened to Rebbi Ḥama<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">He is the third generation Amora, father of Rebbi Oshaya the second.</i>, father of Rebbi Oshaya, he asked the rabbis and they forbade it.

If you would say the rabbis from the South, would he have asked minor authorities when greater ones were before him? If you say the rabbis of the South, some of them would allow and some of them would forbid, as we have stated: “At a place where it is customary to bathe after a funeral, one may bathe; in the South one bathes.” Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: He who permits that bath makes it like eating and drinking<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ramban (<i>Writings</i>, ed. Chavel, p. 175–176), Rebbi Yose bar Abun restricts the bathing to the aftermath of the funeral and says that in the same way that the mourner must have his first meal prepared for him by his relatives and friends, so his relatives and friends must cleanse him after the funeral from dust and germs (שיבתא). Hence, where it is customary, e. g. in the South, the mourner can have one bath, prepared by others, just after the funeral but is forbidden to have another one for the rest of the period of mourning. It then is difficult to understand the question of Rabban Gamliel’s students. Ramban writes that either he lived in a community where that bath was not customary or he was not satisfied with the cold bath prepared for him but took a full warm bath with following rubbing with oil for his asthenic condition.</i>.
That means, about a bath for pleasure.

Halakhah 8

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> And when his<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">Rabban Gamliel’s.</i> slave Tevi died, he received condolences about him. They said to him: Our teacher, did you not teach us that one does not accept condolences for slaves? He said to them: My slave Tevi was not like other slaves, he was honest<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">Since slaves were not liable in civil law, they could not be sued for damages of any kind, and neither could their master for their misdeeds; it was assumed that slaves were thieves, confidence men, and careless with anybody’s property and, when freed, had trouble establishing themselves as trustworthy witnesses.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Hence, about unrelated freed men one accepts condolences? So is the Mishnah: one does not accept condolences for slaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">There are several different explanations of this cryptic piece. The most reasonable is by R. Abraham ben Adrat (Rashba) in his commentary on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 16b" href="/Berakhot.16b">Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 16b</a>: Since the slave is not related to his master, even if he were free the master would not accept formal condolences for him since these are restricted to those close relatives for which one has to keep a period of formal mourning. The answer is that the Mishnah has to declare explicitly that one does not accept formal condolences since the slave is a member of the household and, presumably, is treated like a family member, parallel to the case of a student for whom the teacher may accept condolences; see the section after the next.</i>
It happened that Rebbi Eliezer’s maidservant died<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">She must have been his personal maidservant. The story is repeated in an enlarged version in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 16b" href="/Berakhot.16b">Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 16b</a> and, in the Yerushalmi version, in <i>Evel Rabbati</i> 1:9,10.</i> and his students came to him for condolences but he did not accept. He entered the courtyard, they followed him there. He entered the house, they followed him there. He told them: I was thinking that you would be burned by lukewarm water but you are not burned even by boiling water. Did they not say that one does not accept condolences for slaves because slaves are in this like animals? If one does not accept condolences for unrelated free persons, so much more for slaves<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Eliezer disagrees with his brother-in-law Rabban Gamliel and with the statement of the previous section in the Talmud. He will read in the Mishnah “<i>because</i> one does not accept condolences for slaves”, meaning that this is a rule that cannot be waved. In the Babli, his attitude is directly contradicted by Rebbi Yose, the most authoritative of the Tannaïm of the fourth generation. Rebbi Yose even recommends eulogies for honest slaves; this represents the Galilean attitude (not shared in Babylonia) and, while not spelled out in the Yerushalmi, is taken for granted in this passage which immediately after the present story gives examples of model eulogies for rabbis.</i>. If one’s slave or animal died, people say to him: The Omnipresent may replace your loss.
When Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">A second generation Amora in Galilee. He had the reputation of a saintly man. He might have been a student of the young Rav in the Academy of Rebbi, but his main teacher was R. Simeon ben Laqish.<br>Since the topic of condolences and eulogies is implied in the previous text, a list of sample eulogies follows. Most of these are found (with some change in names) in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shir HaShirim Rabbah 6:2" href="/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.6.2"><i>Midrash Rabba, Song of Songs</i> on 6:2</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:11" href="/Ecclesiastes.5.11"><i>Ecclesiastes</i> on 5:11</a>.</i>, the nephew of Bar Qappara, died did Resh Laqish accept for him since he was his teacher and a student is beloved as a son<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, a teacher may formally mourn a student.

He went and eulogized him: (<i>Song of Songs</i> 6:2) “My friend descended to his garden, to the spice patch<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">While the masoretic text has “spice patches”, the consonantal spelling here seems to prefer the singular which also is appropriate to the sermon based on this verse.

The spelling is left as in the manuscripts and is not edited to conform to our masoretic texts.</i> It would have been necessary only to say “ “My friend descended to shepherd in the gardens.” But “my friend” is the Holy One, praise to Him. “He descended to His garden”, that is the world. “To the spice patch”, that is Israel. “To shepherd in the gardens”, these are the peoples of the world. “And to collect lilies”, these are the just ones whom He removes from their midst. They gave a parable, to what can this be compared? To a king who had a son whom he loved very much. What did the king do? He planted a garden for him. When the son did the will of his father, the father searched in the entire world for a nice plant and planted it in his garden. When the son was making him angry, he cut down all his plants. So when Israel does the will of the Holy One, praise to Him, he searches the entire world and observes the just person, brings him and attaches him to Israel, like Jethro and Rahab. And when they are making him angry he removes the just ones from amongst them<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada was collected because of the sins of his generation.</i>.
A clarification. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rome manuscript, he is identified as the Great Rebbi Ḥiyya (whose full name was Ḥiyya bar Abba bar Aḥa Karsala from Kufra in Iraq), who otherwise is never referred to as “bar Abba” in the Yerushalmi. The sage here cannot be the third generation Amora R. Ḥiyya bar Abba, student of R. Yoḥanan, since not only are the alternate authors Tannaïm of the fourth generation but the story is very explicit in showing that the scholars among themselves are speaking Hebrew and only with the unlearned farmer they speak Aramaic. The Great Rebbi Ḥiyya belongs to the generation of transition between Tannaïm and Amoraïm; even his inclusion is a little late compared to the other two possible sources. This, as noted by Levi Ginzberg (following Eliezer ben Yehudah) is characteristic of Tannaïtic times.<br>It is possible that the author of the<i>Zohar</i> identified this R. Ḥiyya bar Abba as a Tanna of the fourth generation, contemporary of Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Jacob, and, therefore, Rebbi Simeon bar Yoḥai, since he appears there as a major partner in dialogues with the latter.</i> and his group, some say Rebbi Yose bar Ḥalaphta and his group, and some say Rebbi Jacob and his group, were sitting to study Torah under a fig tree. The owner of the fig tree was coming every morning at sunrise and collected figs. They said, maybe he mistrusts us<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">Since he comes early every morning to check on us. (In the Leyden manuscript and the Venice print, the text is “mistrusts me” but the Rome manuscript can be read as “mistrusts us”).</i>, let us change place. The next day, the owner of the fig tree came to them<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">In the Midrash, it is explained that he went on a systematic search to find his scholars.</i>; he said to them: the one <i>miẓwah</i> that you used to do with me you are withholding from me<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Since the one who provides the physical means for Torah study, not the scholar, acquires the greater merit from the study, you are depriving me of the merit of Torah study that I cannot acquire on my own.</i>. They said to him: We thought that maybe you mistrust us. During the morning he came and informed them that if the sun shines on ripe figs they get wormy<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, he has to come early every morning to harvest all figs that are ripe because later they become worthless.</i>. At that time they said, the owner of the fig tree knows the best time to collect figs and he collects them. Likewise, the Holy One, praise to Him, knows the time of the just ones to be removed from the world and He removes them<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the Amora Resh Laqish, the Tannaïm do not see in the premature death of a saintly man a consequence of the sins of his contemporaries.</i>.
When Rebbi Abun bar Rebbi Ḥiyya<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">One of the frequently quoted authorities of the Jerusalem Talmud, a student of Rebbi Yoḥanan and Rebbi Zeïra; he died young as his eulogy shows.</i> died, Rebbi Zeïra ascended his pulpit and eulogized him: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:11" href="/Ecclesiastes.5.11"><i>Eccl.</i> 5:11</a>) “Sweet is the year of the worker.” It does not say here “sleeps” but “whether he eats little or much.” To what can Rebbi Bun bar Ḥiyya be likened? To a king who hired many workers and there was one worker who was exceptionally productive in his work. What did the king do? He took him and walked with him the long and the short. In the evening, the workers came to receive their wages and he gave him his total wages with them. The workers complained and said: we were toiling the entire day and this one did toil only for two hours and he gave him his total wages with us! The king told them: This one produced in two hours more than what you produced all day long.

He, like the Great Rebbi Ḥiyya, was a collector of mishnaic material (<i>baraitot</i>); his collection became the foundation of study in Nahardea.</i> died, the father of Samuel came and eulogized him: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 12:13" href="/Ecclesiastes.12.13"><i>Eccl.</i> 12:13</a>) “Final word: Everything has been heard, fear God.” To what can Rebbi Levi ben Sisi be compared? To a king who had a vineyard with a hundred vines which gave him every year a hundred barrels of wine. He reduced them to 50, to 40, to 30, to 20, to ten, to one, and this one gave him a hundred barrels of wine. This one vine was as dear to him as the entire vineyard. So Rebbi Levi bar Sisi was beloved before the Holy One, praise to Him, like all mankind. This is what is written (<i>loc. cit.</i>) “Because that is all of man,” that one is like all of mankind<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">A kind of pun on the possible interpretations of כל as “all” or “entire”.

Cahana<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">While the previous section dealt with a Galilean emigrating to Babylonia, we now deal with Babylonians immigrating into Israel. Cahana here is Rav Cahana II; his story can be understood only in connection with the remarks in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 117a" href="/Bava_Kamma.117a">Babli <i>Bava Qama</i>117a</a>,b; the interpretation is Rashi’s (117b).<br>Rav Cahana was a young member of the Academy of Rav when Rav unsuccessfully tried to dissuade a Jew from informing against another Jew before the Persian authorities. Rav Cahana was so outraged that he slapped the would-be informer and broke his neck. Rav pointed out to him that under the new Sassanid regime the Jews had lost the criminal jurisdiction they had under the Parthians and that, therefore, he was liable to be prosecuted. Rav told him to go (“ascend”) to the Land of Israel, to the Academy of Rebbi Yoḥanan, but he warned him not to ask difficult questions from Rebbi Yoḥanan for seven years. This must have happened between the Sassanid victory in 226 C.E. and Rav’s death in 247 C.E. (Since the organization of the new Persian empire must have taken some time, the earliest time for Rav Cahana’s flight is probably around 235 C.E. When Rav Cahana returned to Babylonia, he became a student of Rav’s successors Rav Yehudah and Rav Huna; hence, he returned after 247 C.E.) In Tiberias, Cahana (whose rabbinical title is not recognized in the Yerushalmi) first kept Rav’s injunction but in the end he found a way to get around it and was recognized by Rebbi Yoḥanan as a great scholar. Unfortunately, by a birth defect or an accident, Cahana had unsymmetric lips which gave his face the look of a permanent smirk and Rebbi Yoḥanan got offended. He gave him an evil eye so that Cahana died. When informed that the smirk was no smirk but a bodily feature of Cahana, he went to the cave where Cahana was buried. The entrance to the cave was guarded by a poisonous snake which let Rebbi Yoḥanan enter only after he had publicly acknowledged that he had been a student of Cahana. Then he prayed in the cave and Cahana was resurrected from the dead. This is the basis of the questions asked here by the hoodlums. According to the Babli, Rav Cahana found the presence of R. Yoḥanan too dangerous. This will explain the roundabout way in which he asked for leave from the Academy in the Yerushalmi version.</i> was very young when he came up here. A person in rags saw him and asked him, what is new in Heaven? He answered: The judgment over this man has been sealed. This happened to him and he was stricken. Another one in rags saw him and asked, what is new in Heaven? He answered: The judgment over this man has been sealed. This happened to him. He said: Did I not go up to gain merit, but I am sinning! Did I come up to kill the people of the Land of Israel? I shall go and step down the way I came up. He came to Rebbi Yoḥanan and said to him: A man whose mother wishes him well and whose step mother<sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">The land of Babylonia.</i> honors him, should he go there? He said to him, he should go there where he is honored. Cahana descended the way he came up. They came and told Rebbi Yoḥanan that Cahana had descended to Babylonia. He said, how could he go without asking permission? They told him: that question, that he asked of you, was his request for permission.
Rebbi Zeïra went to have himself bled when he ascended here<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">This used to be the general method to heal minor illnesses and also served as a prophylactic.

He went and wanted to buy a pound<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">A Roman pound (<i>libra</i>, λίτρα) of twelve Roman ounces, slightly more than 12 avoirdupois ounces.

He asked him: How much is that pound? He said to him, 50 minas and one slap<sup class="footnote-marker">331</sup><i class="footnote">The price of meat can be taken to determine the time of R. Zeïra’s arrival in Israel. A Mina (Μνᾶ͂) was 100 Denar. In old times, a Mina was an enormous sum. But the inflation in the later part of the military anarchy, from the failed currency reform of Aurelianus to the reorganization of the Roman state under Diocletianus, was extreme. All Midrashim telling about exorbitant sums being paid for simple objects of daily use must be dated to that period, from 274–284 C.E. Diocletian introduced new gold coinage based on a price of 50’000 old gold Denars for a Roman pound of gold. This makes one pound of gold (345 g) the equivalent of 1’250’000 old silver denars. At that time, 50 Minas, or 5’000 silver Denars, would therefore be 1.38 g = 0.04 oz of gold or at today’s gold prices, $14.45. This is a very high price but not out of line in a time of extreme decline of farming and ranching. It is quite clear from this and other stories that the obligation to eat meat on holidays was a serious monetary obligation. (The so-called silver coins of that period were copper coins dipped for a second in a silver solution.)<br>קורסם is Greek κρουσμός, ὁ, “striking, smiting, collision”.</i>. He said to him: Take 60, but he did not accept. Take 70, but he did not accept. Take 80, take 90, until he came to 100 and he did not accept. Then he said: Do what is your routine. The next morning he went to the Academy and said to them: Rabbis, what is this bad practice here that nobody can eat a pound of red meat unless they slap him! They said to him: Who is that? He said, the butcher so-and-so. They sent to him to bring him but they found that his coffin was being carried out.

When Rebbi Yasa ascended here, he went to a barber. He wanted to bathe in a public bath of Tiberias.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Anyone whose dead is lying before him<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Any close relative who has to mourn for the dead and who has to organize the burial.</i> is free from reciting <i>Shema‘</i> and from <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text of the Yerushalmi and the Mishnah manuscripts. Most sources of the Babylonian Talmud add “and from all obligations of the Torah”, but the commentary of <i>Talmid Rabbenu Yonah</i> to Alfassi declares that good manuscripts do not contain the addition and it also seems that the addition was not accepted by Tosaphot.</i> The carriers of the bier, their substitutes, and the substitutes of their substitutes, in front of the bier or behind the bier, those that are needed by the bier are free, those that are not needed by the bier are obligated.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli: “Those behind the bier are obligated”. Rashi explains that those in front of the bier await their turn to carry the bier to the cemetary but that those behind the bier already did that; they follow only to honor the dead person, but not to actively render any more services. The Yerushalmi does not know of such an organization.</i> All of them are free from the obligation to pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to Maimonides, the obligation from the Torah is only to say some prayer every day; hence, even if the participants in the burial miss one prayer they still have two others to fulfill the Biblical requirement. According to Nachmanides, the obligation to prayer is entirely rabbinical and is eliminated before the Torah obligation to bury fellow Jew.</i>
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the first sentence of our Mishnah.</i>: “And from <i>tefillin</i>.”A<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is a <i>baraita</i> from <i>Moëd Qaṭan</i> (3:5); a similar <i>baraita</i> (with the names of Rebbis Eliezer and Joshua switched) is quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 21a" href="/Moed_Katan.21a">Babli <i>Moëd Qaṭan</i> 21a</a>. All authorities in all sources agree that a mourner may not put on <i>tefillin</i> the entire first day of mourning, even if the burial was conducted in the preceding night. So there is no connection between <i>tefillin</i> and the necessity to attend to the burial.</i> mourner may not put on <i>tefillin</i> on the first day; on the second day he puts on <i>tefillin</i> and when new faces appear during the seven days of mourning he takes them off; these are the words of Rebbi Eliezer. Rebbi Joshua says: On the first and second days he does not put on <i>tefillin</i>; on the third day he puts on <i>tefillin</i> and if new faces come he does not take them off. If he does not put on <i>tefillin</i> even on the second day, why is it necessary to mention “anyone whose dead is lying before him”? Because he stated the one he stated the other<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is necessary to mention that he is free from reciting <i>Shema‘</i>(and from prayer, whether that is stated in the Mishnah or not), the mention of <i>tefillin</i> is added as a memory aid. Since for a long time the Mishnah was transmitted by memory, it could not have been written down. Memory aids are an important part of Mishnah composition.</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra, Rav Jeremiah in the name of Rav: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer in putting on and Rebbi Joshua in taking off<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The mourner puts on <i>tefillin</i> starting the second day after the funeral and does not take them off for a new visitor. In the Babli, this is a ruling of Ulla, one of the commuters between Babylonia and Galilee in the second generation of Amoraïm.</i>. Rebbi Zeïra inquired: If he put them on on the second day, following Rebbi Eliezer, would Rebbi Eliezer act like Rebbi Joshua, not to take them off? Rebbi Yose bar Abun said: Is it so that Rebbi Eliezer would act like Rebbi Joshua, not to take them off? If it were so, we should say “practice follows Rebbi Eliezer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If on the second day, on which we follow Rebbi Eliezer, he takes off <i>tefillin</i> for new visitors, then the ruling should have been: Practice follows Rebbi Eliezer on the second day and Rebbi Joshua from the third day on. Since days are not mentioned, it is clear that Rebbi Joshua’s opinion, that one does not take off <i>tefillin</i> for visits of condolence, does not depend on the day. In the Babli, this is the ruling of Rava, of the generation following Rebbi Zeïra. The Babli quotes from the early Tanna Rebbi Jehudah ben Tema that one puts on <i>tefillin</i> and takes them off even a hundred times. Since R. Jehudah ben Tema, whose time cannot be determined, precedes Rav in any case, his opinion is not of much practical value.</i>
Rebbi Abun said: It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 16:3" href="/Deuteronomy.16.3"><i>Deut.</i> 16:3</a>) “So that you should remember the day of your exodus from Egypt the totality of the days of your living;” the days when you are occupied with the living, not the days that you are occupied with the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The verse deals with the celebration of Passover but is used to indicate that any obligation of remembrance, and <i>tefillin</i> is one of them, are only for living and are invalid once one has to care for the dead.

The verse gives a complete justification for the Mishnah, <i>viz</i>., that the entire first day is not for <i>tefillin</i>, even after the burial.</i>.

Explain that it refers to weekdays. But has it not been stated: he is free from blowing the <i>shofar</i>. Can you say on weekday? No, on holiday. Rebbi Ḥanina said<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it is forbidden to use the Sabbath to prepare for the next day, in these cases it is permitted to position oneself on the Sabbath so that one can start immediately fulfilling a <i>miẓwah</i> after the end of the Sabbath.

(The Babli, <i>loc. cit.</i>, notes that a Cohen is prohibited by Biblical commandment from stepping over a grave only if there is less than a hand-breadth of space between the corpse and the upper cover of the coffin, as explained in Mishnah <i>Ahilot</i> VII; in most cases stepping over a grave is only a rabbinical prohibition which may be lifted in special circumstances.)</i>.

Rebbi Mana retorted that, since he would not defile himself for her during the patriarch’s lifetime, when it would have constituted an honor for the patriarch, he might not do so after the patriarch’s death.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> When they buried the deceased and returned, if they are able to start and finish before they form the row<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Before the mourners leave for their home, the other participants of the funeral form two lines and the mourners pass in the row between them. While they pass, words of consolation are spoken to them. Today, that ceremony is performed in the cemetary so that the Mishnah becomes void. In talmudic times, the burial was in the cemetary far from the city, but the ceremony of the row took place at the entrance to the city. There may be a long enough walk from cemetary to town that the prescribed time for <i>Shema‘</i> would pass. The words “start” and “finish” refer to the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>.</i> they should start, otherwise they should not start. Those who stand in the row, the innermost are exempt<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Since the mourners can see and hear them, they are doing a good deed and cannot be distracted by other obligations.

[A seemingly similar <i>baraita</i> in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 19a" href="/Berakhot.19a">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 19a</a>, deals with a eulogy before burial and has nothing in common with the text given here.]</i>: The eulogizer and all who participate in a eulogy interrupt for the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i> and do not interrupt for prayer.

Rebbi Phineas said, they do not disagree. He who said: the Amen of “the holy King”, on the Sabbath, and he who said: the Amen of “He Who listens to prayer” on weekdays.

Also, in the Babli only the second part of the Tosephta is attributed to Rebbi Yehudah. According to Rashi, only those are obliged to read the <i>Shema‘</i> who come out of curiosity whereas according to most others those who come to honor the dead and his family but do not actively console are not exempt.

We are informed that the original custom was that the mourners walk between two rows of participants who greet them with words of consolation. When competition grew in Sepphoris, it seems because people were jostling for the best positions (those who did not make it to the front rows could not be seen or heard by the mourners), Rebbi Yose decreed that the mourners should stay put and all others march by them to greet and console them. This is the case dealt with by Rebbi Judah, that there is only one row (moving, not standing). An otherwise unknown Rebbi Samuel declares that the innovation of Rebbi Jose did not stand the test of time and in his time the consolers stand and the mourners move. Rebbi Samuel’s opinion is the “last teaching”, Rebbi Yose’s “the first teaching”. In the first teaching, there are no people in outer rows, so the Mishnah automatically has to apply to the last teaching.</i>, and what is stated: “Those who are standing because of honor are obliged, those because of mourning are exempt”, is the first teaching<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Since the entire Tosephta is Rebbi Judah’s, it speaks of the case where there is only one row.

This is possible only in the scenario envisaged by Rebbi Yose; it is shown that the practice instituted by Rebbi Yose at Sepphoris (in the second half of the second century C.

Hence, there are two opinions about the attribution but the meaning is clear. If the uncertainty is the editor’s, then the note “Another opinion: the first” belongs to the text.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> and from phylacteries but are obliged for prayer, <i>mezuzah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">While both phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> are based on verses in <i>Shema‘</i>, their status is different.</i> and Grace for food.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Women from where? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 11:19" href="/Deuteronomy.11.19"><i>Deut.</i> 11:19</a>) “You must teach them to your sons.” To your sons but not to your daughters<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">The father is unconditionally obliged to teach his sons Torah; since this is an integral part of <i>Shema‘</i>, the same is valid for reciting the <i>Shema‘</i>. It is general practice that women <i>may</i> recite <i>Shema‘</i>; it follows that in the opinion of the Yerushalmi, women may study any subjects of Torah they wish. [The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 20b" href="/Berakhot.20b">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i> 20b</a>, simply notes that <i>Shema‘</i> is an obligation to be executed at stated times, of which women and slaves are automatically exempted. Since the Yerushalmi brings this argument in relation to other things later in this section, it follows that for it the recital of <i>Shema‘</i> is simply an aspect of Torah study and Torah study is required “day and night”, not depending on any particular time.]</i>.
Slaves from where? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:4" href="/Deuteronomy.6.4"><i>Deut.</i> 6:4</a>): “Hear, o Israel, the Eternal, our Power, the Eternal is unique.” He who has only one Lord, this excludes the slave who has another lord<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the preceding paragraph, the Yerushalmi does not refer to the obligation of reciting <i>Shema‘</i> as an obligation to be performed at stated times; therefore, a separate argument is necessary to free from the obligation slaves who accepted Judaism.</i>.
Minors from where? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 13:9" href="/Exodus.13.9"><i>Ex.</i> 13:9</a>) “So that the Torah of the Eternal should stay in your mouth”, at a time when he is permanent in it<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is exceedingly difficult for two reasons. 1) It is a generally accepted principle that minors are not obliged to do anything; it is their parents who are obliged to teach them and see to it that they perform <i>miẓwot</i>. 2) The verse deals only with <i>tefillin</i>.<br>In the Yerushalmi tradition, the statement and the tradition are not unquestioned. Both <i>Mekhiltot</i> (<i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael</i>, ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 68; <i>Mekhilta dR. Simeon bar Ioḥai</i>, p.41), the Tannaïtic commentaries to Exodus, give the same commentary on the next verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 13:10" href="/Exodus.13.10"><i>Ex.</i> 13:10</a>): “You must preserve this decree in its time, from year to year”. “Why has this been said? Because it has been said (v.9): ‘It shall be for you a sign on your hand’, I might understand this to include minors. And it is logical, since <i>mezuzah</i> is a positive commandment and <i>tefillin</i> are a positive commandment; if you find that <i>mezuzah</i> applies to minors the same way it applies to adults you might think that <i>tefillin</i> apply to minors the same way they apply to adults, but the verse says ‘you must preserve this decree’, I spoke only about those able to watch over their <i>tefillin</i>; from here they said: If a minor knows how to watch his <i>tefillin</i>, his father makes him <i>tefillin</i>.”<br>The argument presupposes the statement that minors are obliged to have <i>mezuzot</i> on their doors (meaning that if they live alone, the rabbinic authorities have to see to it that they have <i>mezuzot</i> on their doors). <i>Mezuzah</i> and <i>tefillin</i> are always mentioned together in the first two paragraphs of <i>Shema‘</i>. Hence, one may assume that they are identical in those details that are not spelled out. Both Yerushalmi and Mekhiltot agree that some explanation is needed to distinguish between the rules for <i>mezuzah</i> and those for <i>tefillin</i>. However, the Mekhiltot extend the obligation of <i>tefillin</i> to all school children whereas the Yerushalmi restricts it to those for whom the study of Torah is a permanent obligation, i. e., from Bar-Miẓwah onwards. In itself the argument about minors is totally irrelevant; it is needed to exclude the opinion of the Mekhiltot.</i>.
They are obliged to pray so that everybody ask mercy for himself<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Here again, we have a divergence between Yerushalmi and Babli. The Yerushalmi states that prayer is an obligation not because it is a Biblical commandment but because the rabbis thought that everybody has to implore divine mercy for himself. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 20b" href="/Berakhot.20b">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 20b</a>), the argument of the Yerushalmi is repeated but then it is stated that in Psalms (<i>Ps.</i> 55:18) three times daily are stated for prayer and if that were a general obligation, women would be automatically dispensed from it. Hence, it follows that the rabbinical obligation of prayer for women cannot mean for the Babli an obligation to pray at those stated times, which it could mean in the interpretation of the Yerushalmi. The opinion of the Babli is that of Maimonides, the possible one of the Yerushalmi that of Nachmanides.</i>.
And for <i>mezuzah</i>, as it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:9" href="/Deuteronomy.6.9"><i>Deut.</i> 6:9</a>): “You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and your gates<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">This is an obligation of ownership, not of person.</i>.

It is stated: “For every obligation that a man is free of, he may help the congregation to fulfill their obligation, except for Grace.” But have we not stated: “Anybody who is not obligated may not help the congregation to fulfill their obligation”? If he were obligated, he could help them to fulfill even if he himself already fulfilled it!<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">“To be free” does not mean the same as “not being obligated” but rather “having already acquitted himself of the obligation.” The first statement means, e. g., that someone who already has heard the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh Hashanah nevertheless may blow the <i>shofar</i> and recite the appropriate benediction for somebody who did not hear the blowing. The only exception mentioned is that of saying Grace. The second statement means, e. g., that a woman, not being obligated to hear the <i>shofar</i>, may not blow the <i>shofar</i> for a man who is obligated. Since everybody is obligated to say Grace after a meal, there seems to be no reason why Grace should be exempted in the first statement.</i> Rebbi Lia said: There is a difference about Grace since it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:10" href="/Deuteronomy.8.10"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise the Eternal, your God;” he who ate must give praise.

The discussion of prayer presupposes the Galilean practice that the reader recite the <i>Amidah</i> aloud, without silent prayer, and it is stated that everyone is required to say the prayer with the reader, not just to respond with “Amen”.

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The person with gonorrhea who had an emission of semen, as well as a menstruating woman who lost semen, and the woman who started menstruating while having intercourse, need immersion, but Rebbi Yehudah frees them<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">It is explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15" href="/Leviticus.15"><i>Lev.</i> 15</a> that the man with gonorrhea makes everything around himself impure and cannot be become pure except by a lengthy procedure. Similarly, the menstruating woman needs at least seven days for her purification. If any of these is polluted by the minor impurity of <i>qeri</i> as explained in the preceding <i>halakhah</i>, any immersion for <i>qeri</i> has no influence on the severe impurity already existing (or the one additional in the case of the woman who notices her period while she is already impure by having intercourse). Rebbi Yehudah notes that since the immersion for <i>qeri</i> has no practical consequences, it is not needed. The other sages seem to think that since the immersion does not need <i>miqweh</i> or flowing water and since it is needed to let the persons pray it is of a completely different character and independent of the other impurities. Since the woman noticing her period during intercourse has to stop it immediately, even before emission of semen, it is clear that her impurity is not the Biblical one described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:16-18" href="/Leviticus.15.16-18"><i>Lev.</i> 15:16–18</a> but the rabbinic one of <i>qeri</i>.</i>
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> So far the person with gonorrhea who had an emission of semen; is it good for anything if the person immerses himself who had an emission and afterwards has an episode of gonorrhea?

What is Rebbi Yehudah’s reason?

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Morning prayers are until noon; Rebbi Yehudah says, until four hours<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">One hour being one twelfth of the time difference between sunrise and sundown (according to some interpreters of the Babli, from dawn to dusk).</i>. Afternoon<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Minḥah</i>” prayers. This expression refers to the Temple service when the flour offering after the afternoon sacrifice signalled the end of the day. The preferred time fixed for this offering was 2h 30min. before sundown. Hence, “half of <i>Minḥah</i>” is 1h 15min. before sundown. The earliest time for the evening sacrifices (on Passover eve) was 30 minutes after noontime. <i>Musaph</i> prayers were added on days when there were additional public sacrifices between morning and afternoon sacrifices.</i> prayers are until evening, Rebbi Yehudah says until half ofʹ <i>Minḥah</i>. Evening prayers have no fixed time. <i>Musaph</i> prayers have all day.

In the religious sense, עבודה without qualifier always means the Temple service, the actual offering of sacrifices and all that is connected with it.

In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 2a" href="/Taanit.2a">Babli (<i>Taänit</i> 2a</a>), prayer is explicitly qualified as “service by the heart”.</i> for Him with all yor heart and all your soul,” does there exist work in the heart?

When the New Moon falls on a fast day, how does one mention the New Moon<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is extremely difficult to understand and the greatest authorities of the Middle Ages, Rashba (R.

Since three of the four prayers of the New Moon are weekday prayers with an addition added in “Temple service” (רצה, the 16th benediction in the Yerushalmi version) as given later in Chapter 5, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:2:2-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.2.2-8">Halakhah 2</a>, the only question can be about <i>Musaph</i>. However, we never hear that the particular inserts in the morning prayers of a fast day were recited also for <i>Musaph</i>. On the other hand, as Rosh points out, the previous paragraph certainly implies that the one benediction recited on <i>all</i> fast-days except Yom Kippur, not only on those for rain, known as עננו, must be recited also for <i>Musaph</i> since the day requires that the benediction be inserted in all prayers. One may at least understand the position of Rebbi Abba that on a fast day for rain which coincides with a day of the New Moon, one recites the usual <i>Musaph</i> with an additional fifth benediction which deals with the fast day, after the fourth for the New Moon. The dissenting opinions of Rebbis Zeïra and Abba bar Mamal seem to imply that <i>Musaph</i> on a fast day consisted of the introductory and final benedictions that are common to all prayers and the additional benedictions for the fast day, whereas the section on the New Moon, for which <i>Musaph</i> is recited in the first place, is moved from its regular place to an insert in either the 16th or the 17th (מודים, “thanksgiving”, a place usually reserved for thanksgiving for past miracles) benediction.</i>? Rebbi Zeïra said, in “thanksgiving”. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, in “Temple service”. Rebbi Avina said, he says it as the fourth benediction. Rebbi Abba said, how do we find everywhere that he says it as the fourth benediction, here also as the fourth benediction. And so it was acted upon according to Rebbi Abba<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">A reported action on an opinion is the best proof that this is accepted practice, see Chap. 1, Note 125.</i>.
What does one read? Rebbi Yose said, one reads blessings and curses<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Both on the day of the New Moon and on fast days one reads in the Torah. The readings are explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 3:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.3.5.1">Mishnah <i>Megillah</i> 3:6</a>. On the day of the New Moon, one reads abouts its sacrifices, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 28:11-15" href="/Numbers.28.11-15"><i>Num.</i> 28:11–15</a> (in Babylonia, 28:1–15), and on fast days for rain, blessings and curses, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 26:3-46" href="/Leviticus.26.3-46"><i>Lev.</i> 26:3–46</a>.

In Babylonia there would be no problem since there two Torah scrolls were used to read both portions, giving each person a larger share to read. However, in Israel the Torah was not read in the Babylonian one-year cycle but in an irregular three-year cycle with shorter readings and where the regular reading was postponed for any special one. For example, on Sabbath Ḥanukkah, in Israel <i>only</i> the corresponding part of the dedication sacrifices (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 7" href="/Numbers.7"><i>Num.</i> 7</a>) was read, whereas in Babylonia that was simply the reading from the second Torah scroll. Similarly, for a Sabbath New Moon one read in Israel only <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 28:1-15" href="/Numbers.28.1-15"><i>Num.</i> 28:1–15</a> and not the regular Torah reading. Hence, there is a serious question which portion to read on the New Moon which is also a fast day.</i>. Rebbi Mana said to him: For example to tell them about the fast day? They are lying on their bellies<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, falling on their faces for private prayer after the <i>Amidah,</i> a penitential service (נפילת אפים) that is forbidden on semi-holidays like the day of the New Moon.</i> and should not know that it is a fast day?

If one already eliminates the prohibition of fasting on the New Moon, the occasion is so serious that the Torah reading also is eliminated.</i>. Rebbi Yudan the Kappadokian<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">A scholar from Kappadokia in Anatolia; he is always mentioned in connection with the Amora Rebbi Yose.</i> said before Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Yehudah ben Pazi: One reads about the New Moon.

Since the sequence of 30 day and 29 day months was not determined beforehand, only at Eyn Ṭab was the day of the New Moon fixed. Everywhere else one knew that it was certainly a fast day and probably a day of the New Moon; the certain has precedence over the probable.</i>, since they know for sure that it is the New Moon, they read about the New Moon.

Most probably, as conjectured by Levi Ginzberg, it is a second version of Rebbi Mana’s answer, that this is a really stupid question from a scribe who has not learned to think by himself: Since one interrupts for the Sabbath, it is clear that the reading of the New Moon, which occurs at least 16 times a year, has precedence over Ḥanukkah which occurs only 8 times.</i>; he said to him: That is a true question of a scribe.

It seems that for R. Joshua in the Yerushalmi the short prayer is a replacement for Samuel’s text of the middle part of the short <i>Amidah</i> as explained here later by (the Babylonian!) Rav Ḥisda, but in Babylon it is interpreted as an independent prayer that must be complemented by a full <i>Amidah</i> once the danger has passed.</i> and says: Help, o Eternal, your people Israel; in all passing situations may their needs be before You. Praised are You, o Eternal, Who hears prayer (and entreaties)<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">This is only in the Mishnah text in the Yerushalmi Halakhah (not in the Mishnah preceding the Chapter) and in a few Mishnah manuscripts.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Rebbi Eliezer says: If one makes his prayer fixed, his prayer is not supplication<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">This belongs to the next Mishnah; the paragraph explains this statement.

However, it seems that the error is not with the copyists of the Yerushalmi but with the copyists of the Mishnah and that the statement of Rebbi Eliezer belongs to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.3.1">Mishnah 3</a> where Rabban Gamliel says that everybody always prays 18 fixed benedictions. R. Joshua says everybody prays a shortened but fixed version, and R. Aqiba notes that one should follow either course depending on one’s knowledge. But Rebbi Eliezer insists that the appropriate form of prayer depends only on intent. In the first prints of the Babli, Soncino and Venice 5280, the statement of R.

Zeïra) is also the one in the Babylonian Talmud who points out the practical impossibility of finding a new formulation in a fixed framework of 18 benedictions every day. One may also note that the statement of R. Simeon ben Nethanael (<i>Abot</i> 2:13) “do not make your prayer קבע” appears in <i>Abot deR.

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah says, <i>Musaph</i> prayer is said only in an organized community, but the Sages say, with and without an organized community. Rebbi Yehudah says in his name<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah’s name. He disputes the tradition in the name of R. Eleazar that <i>Musaph</i> cannot be recited outside an organized community. According to Rebbi Yehudah, <i>Musaph</i> has to be recited everywhere, but in a town with an organized synagogue it is enough to listen to the public prayer of the reader that he recited without a corresponding silent prayer of the congregation.</i>, at any place where there is an organized community a private person is free from reciting <i>Musaph</i> prayers.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Bibi<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Probably his name was Vivianus, an Amora of the third generation. Rebbi Ḥana’s name appears twice in the Talmudim; he seems to have been a student of Rebbi Jeremiah. Neither Rebbi Bibi nor Rebbi Ḥana are great authorities.

Hence, the Mishnah spoke only for shepherds and field guards; therefore, everybody else is obliged. The words of Rebbi Yoḥanan agree since Rebbi Yoḥanan said: I saw Rebbi Yannai standing in the market of Sepphoris praying; then he walked four cubits and prayed <i>Musaph</i><sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">A shortened version, speaking only about the <i>Musaph</i> prayer, is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 30b" href="/Berakhot.30b">Babli 30b</a>.

Rav says, one must change the text<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>Musaph</i> sacrifices are distinct for every holiday, the prayer must accomodate this distinction.</i>, but Samuel says, one does not have to change the text.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Abba: Prayer is forbidden to him who comes from a trip. What is the reason? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 51:21" href="/Isaiah.51.21"><i>Is.</i> 51:21</a>) “Listen to that, poor woman, drunk and not from wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This proves that there is drunkenness not induced by alcohol. Formal prayer, the <i>Amidah</i>, is forbidden to a drunk.

He tried to systematize aggadic interpretation of the Bible.</i>: Prayer is forbidden to one in pain; is that not our verse: “Listen to that, poor woman, drunk and not from wine”?
It is stated<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">We have three versions of this formulation, in the Yerushalmi, the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 31a" href="/Berakhot.31a">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 31a</a>), and the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 3:21" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).3.21">Tosephta (3:21</a>). The main difference in formulation is between the Tosephta and the Talmudim, since the Tosephta requires that one start prayer מתיך דברים של חכמה. In Mishnaic Hebrew, as in Modern Sephardic Hebrew usage, the <i>Ḥakham</i> is the rabbi, and <i>dibrē ḥokhmāh</i> are halakhic rulings; as in the following paragraph, practices universally accepted and not subject to doubt or discussion. From the order of the Yerushalmi it seems that in practice the text of the Yerushalmi should be interpreted as implying the statement of the Tosephta. The tradition of the Babli is uncertain; see <i>Diqduqe Soferim, Berakhot</i>, p. 160, note ר. The Venice print of the Babli requires that one start prayer “out of joy over commandments”. Rashi, the Munich manuscript of the Babli, Halakhot Gedolot and the students of Rabbenu Jonah have simply “out of joy.” The Koronel manuscript and <i>Menorat Hamaör</i> have “out of joy of Torah”, parallel to the Yerushalmi. A Florence manuscript that is typically Sephardic has “out of joy of Halakhah”, directly parallel to the Tosephta. Rabbenu Asher ben Yeḥiel (Rosh) has “out of words of joy”; the insistence on “words” is parallel to Yerushalmi and Tosephta. While the Babli in the printed version would refer to the state of mind required for the <i>Amidah</i>, as implied in the two rulings preceding this Tosephta in the Yerushalmi, the Tosephta and the Yerushalmi require the correct state of mind before one starts with the preparatory sections of prayer, even preceding the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>. This seems also to be confirmed by the preparatory prayer reported later by R. Ḥizqiah in the name of R. Abbahu. Most of the variants of the Babli text would demand an interpretation similar to that of the Tosephta. All three versions agree that one should start afternoon prayers with a word of Torah or Halakhah directly before the <i>Amidah</i>.</i>: “One should pray neither out of conversation, nor out of jokes, nor out of frivolities, nor out of idle occupations, but out of words of Torah. Similarly, one should not take leave from one’s friend either out of conversation, or out of jokes, or out of frivolities, or out of idle occupations, but out of words of Torah, since we find that the earlier prophets were closing their words with expressions of praise and consolation.” Rebbi Eleazar said, except for Jeremiah who closed with words of reprobation. Rebbi Yoḥanan said to him, still he closed with words of consolation and said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 51:64" href="/Jeremiah.51.64"><i>Jer.</i> 51:64</a>) “So Babylon shall sink.” Because Jeremiah continued to prophesy about the Temple.

A menstruating woman is ritually unclean and prohibited from having sexual contact until seven days have passed. On the other hand, a woman having a discharge looking like blood is subject to quite different rules that are more lenient for an occasional occurence and much more strict for recurrent discharges. A decision about the character of the discharge can be made only by a competent rabbi. In theory all women should show their discharges to a rabbi. Even in the time of the Temple, that was a practice only of wives of Cohanim who had to minimize their time of impurity by all means. It may be assumed that all other women chose to follow the method described here, to consider any discharge as a recurrent discharge and to wait seven days after the last day of discharge. In that way, no problems arise that would require a rabbi in intimate matters.

Rebbi Jacob from Kefar Ḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph explains the reason of those who say that Elijah’s prediction that there would be no dew never came true.

Rebbi Zeïra in the name if Rebbi Ḥanina: When someone stood [praying] in the rainy season and mentioned dew one does not make him repeat. In the season of dew and he mentioned rain one makes him repeat. But is it not stated<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The discussion follows the general pattern: If a statement contains statements A and then B, the discussion will discuss first B, then A. Hence, the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> will be repeated before the discussion turns to it. The statement of Rebbi Ḥanina and the discussion of its last part is quoted in Alfassi <i>Taänit</i> 1:1 where it is added to the tradition of the same Rebbi Ḥanina in the Babylonian Talmud (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 3b" href="/Taanit.3b"><i>Taänit</i> 3b</a>): “In summertime, one who says ‘He Who makes the wind blow’ does not have to repeat; if he says ‘He Who makes rain descend,’ he has to repeat. In wintertime, one who omits ‘He Who makes the wind blow’ does not have to repeat; if he omits ‘He Who makes rain descend,’ he has to repeat.” Alfassi gives no interpretation of the Yerushalmi he quotes but the early Medieval authorities R. Zeraḥia Halevi, R. Abraham ben David, Nachmanides, and R. Nissim Gerondi all have different interpretations (mutually contradictory) and most of them also have different readings. Among manuscripts, the expression דְּלָא מַצְלִי וְלָא מֵיקַל appears with or without one or both לָא. The following interpretation follows Nachmanides closely. [Most commentaries agree with R. Nissim Gerondi in taking מיקל as a <i>Pa‘el</i> form of a contracted form of קלל “to curse”; such a form קול is nowhere attested, but קיל “to take, make easy” is frequent.]</i>: The sages did not oblige one to mention dew and winds but if he wants to mention them, he may mention?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who stands before the arc should not answer Amen after the Cohanim because of the distraction<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">The “emissary of the congregation” who stands before the arc and has to recite the priestly blessing (between the last two benedictions) so that the Cohanim may repeat the blessing aloud should not say “Amen” after each sentence of the priesly blessing because he must go on reciting the appropriate words (and the following last benediction) without the help of a prayer book.</i>. If there is no Cohen there but him, he should not lift his hands. But if he is sure that he can lift his hands and return to his prayer, he may do so<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Devarim Rabbah 7:1" href="/Devarim_Rabbah.7.1"><i>Midrash Rabba Devarim</i> 7(1</a>), an early Israeli <i>Yelammedenu</i> Midrash, extends the last sentence, “but if he is sure that he can return to his prayer, he may do so,” also to answering Amen after the Cohanim, “because there is nothing greater before the Holy One, praise to Him, than the Amen which Israel answer.” It is very likely that when this Midrash was composed, the flowering of synagogal poetry already had led to the writing of prayer books for the reader.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Megillah (Lieberman) 3:27" href="/Tosefta_Megillah_(Lieberman).3.27">Tosephta <i>Megillah</i> 3:27</a> is similar to this text.</i>: He who recites the blessings for the <i>Shema‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew expression meant different things at different times. The translation follows the consensus of the Gaonic responsa that פורס means “recites the benediction” on basis of <i>Targum Jonathan</i> to <a class="refLink" data-ref="I Samuel 9:13" href="/I_Samuel.9.13"><i>1Sam.</i> 9:13</a> where הוא יברך הזבח is rendered by הוּא פָרִיס מְזוֹנָא. The Gaonic interpretation is that, even though at the end of a full prayer one may recite Amen on his own prayer, this does not apply to the benedictions after the <i>Shema‘</i>. Most Medieval commentators take פורס to mean “to parcel out” and apply the term to a group of people who prayed with less than a quorum and after the <i>Amidah</i> found themselves with 10 adult males; they then may appoint a reader who recites half <i>Kaddish,</i> ברכוּ, possibly the first benediction for the <i>Shema‘</i>, and the repetition of the <i>Amidah</i> with <i>Qedushah</i> and the priestly blessings. The Ashkenazic interpretation is supported by the reading of the Tosephta (<i>loc. cit.</i>) where פורס clearly means “breaking, parcel out”.</i>, he who stands before the ark, he who lifts his hands, he who reads in the Torah, he who recites <i>Haphtarah</i> from the prophets, and he who recites any blessing for obligations spelled out in the Torah, should not recite Amen after his own benediction. If he answered, he is uncivilized. Some Tannaïm have stated: he is uncivilized; and some Tannaïm have stated: he is wise. Rav Ḥisda said: He who said “he is wise” refers to him who answers at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">In Sephardic and Oriental interpretation, this refers to all prayers, when one recites “Amen” after one’s own benediction at the end of a well defined unit of several benedictions which form a whole that can stand for itself (except the benedictions for the recitation of <i>Shema‘</i>). This is the reasonable interpretation of the Yerushalmi here. In the Babli, the parallel discussion is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 45b" href="/Berakhot.45b"><i>Berakhot</i> 45b</a> on reciting Grace after the meal, where Amen separates the part which is a Biblical obligation from the rest which is purely rabbinic.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> It is a bad sign for him who prays when he makes a mistake. And if he is an emissary of the congregation, it is a bad sign for those who sent him because the emissary of somebody is like that person. They said about Rebbi Ḥanina ben Dosa that he was praying for sick people and saying that this one was going to live and that one was dying. They asked him, how do you know? He said to them, if my prayer comes easily from my lips I know that he has been accepted; otherwise, I know that he is being torn.

Chapter 6



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Which benedictions are recited on produce<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Before one eats of these fruits, as will be explained in the Halakhah. All benedictions start with “Praise to You, Eternal, our God, King of the Universe”. This formula is understood and does not have to be repeated.</i>? On tree-grown fruits one says “Creator of the fruit of the tree” except for wine, because on wine one says “Creator of the fruit of the vine.” But on fruits of the land one says “Creator of the fruit of the soil” except for bread, because on bread<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The words “because on bread” are not in the Venice print but since they appear in the Leyden manuscript the omission seems to be a printer’s error.</i> one says “He Who produces bread from the earth.” On vegetables one says “Creator of the fruit of the soil”, Rebbi Yehudah says: “Creator of kinds of vegetables<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Yehudah insists that benedictions should be exact and vegetables without seeds do not qualify as “fruits”.</i>.”
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 24:1" href="/Psalms.24.1"><i>Ps.</i> 24:1</a>): “The Eternal’s are the earth and what is in it, the dry land and its inhabitants.” He who profits from the world commits larceny<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since he uses God’s property, not his own.</i> until good deeds will permit him<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The obligation to say Grace after a meal is spelled out in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:10" href="/Deuteronomy.8.10"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>. The obligation to recite blessings before one eats is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah. Since Grace is only treated in the next Chapter, one has to find here Biblical allusions to this duty and (in the next section) to the duty of reciting a benediction before fulfilling specified commandments.<br>The verse appears in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 35a" href="/Berakhot.35a">Babli (35a</a>) in the name of Samuel. R. Levi compares the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 115:16" href="/Psalms.115.16"><i>Ps.</i> 115:16</a>) “Heaven is the Eternal’s heaven but the earth He gave to mankind”, explaining that before a benediction everything is the Eternal’s property but after a benediction it becomes human property. While Rebbi Levi is a Galilean teacher, the Yerushalmi rejects his combination since in the third paragraph earthly enjoyment is only “<i>as</i> if one ate from one’s own”. The text of the Yerushalmi is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 4:1" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).4.1">Tosephta <i>Berakhot</i> 4:1</a> which is identical with the Talmudic text except that there it says “until all good deeds will permit him”, meaning that only if the preparation of food is completely within the commandments of the Torah then the last step of the preparation, the recitation of the benediction, will allow the food to be given to man as his own.</i>. Rebbi Abbahu said, it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:9" href="/Deuteronomy.22.9"><i>Deut.</i> 22:9</a>) “Lest the fullness of the seed that you sow and the yield of the vineyard should be forbidden.” The entire world and its contents are like a vineyard. What is its redemption? The benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This argument is very difficult to understand and the commentators either chose to ignore it or give very incongruous explanations. The best explanation is that of R. Eliahu Fulda who in his Yerushalmi edition suppresses the word פֶּן “lest”. One would have to assume that Rebbi Abbahu’s text did not have the word but that later scribes added it from memory. By it the negative implication of the verse (which speaks about growing different kinds of plants in a vineyard) are changed to a positive one which now should be translated: “That you shall sanctify the fullness of the seed that you sow and the yield of the vineyard.” Since the sanctity is not that of sacrifices, the sanctity may be removed by redemption (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:11" href="/Leviticus.27.11"><i>Lev.</i> 27:11</a>). However, there can be no monetary redemption of anything not explicitly authorized in the Torah. Hence, the redemption is non-monetary and is the traditional praise given to God in benedictions. [The simple sense of the verse is that produce grown in a vineyard becomes forbidden for private use as if it were dedicated for sacrifice.]</i>. Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 16:2" href="/Psalms.16.2"><i>Ps.</i> 16:2</a>) “Say to the Eternal, You are my Master<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows the Biblical text, not the text written here.</i>, my good is only with You.” If you ate and recited the benedictions then it is as if you ate from your own. Another explanation<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is extremely hard to understand; the next two interpretations have nothing to do with the topic on hand; they are only added to indicate translations that might be considered if בל is not a negation but a verb form derived from בלל, which may mean either “to give food” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Judges 19:24" href="/Judges.19.24"><i>Jud.</i> 19:24</a>) or, more frequently, “mixed with fluid, moistened.”</i>: “My good is בל with you”, I am feeding My goodness to your body. Another explanation: “My good is בל with you”, all good things may be mixed together and come to you. Rebbi Aḥa said, what is “only with you?” I shall not bring any good things to the world without you. As it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 41:44" href="/Genesis.41.44"><i>Gen.</i> 41:44</a>) “Without you nobody may lift his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Taking בל as shorthand for בִּלְעֲדֵי “without”.</i>” Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:24" href="/Leviticus.19.24"><i>Lev.</i> 19:24</a>) “Holy for praises”, this shows that it needs benediction before and after. From here did Rebbi Aqiba say that nobody should taste anything before he gives praise<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is also quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 35a" href="/Berakhot.35a">Babli (35a</a>); the source of both Talmudim is <i>Sifra</i> on the verse.

Rebbi Ḥaggai and Rebbi Jeremiah went to the Bazaar<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The translation is tentative; בית חנוותא means “the house of stores”, which might be a description of a <i>shuq</i> even though it is difficult to explain why the word שׁוּקָא was not used. It is not clear what kind of <i>miẓwah</i> the two rabbis performed in the market. In the opinion of R. Eleazar Askari they were <i>agoranomoi</i>, overseers of weights and measures, and Rebbi Ḥaggai recited a benediction before starting to go from stall to stall and checking the balances for correctness since that is a Biblical commandment repeated several times in the Pentateuch (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:15" href="/Deuteronomy.25.15"><i>Deut.</i> 25:15</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:36" href="/Leviticus.19.36"><i>Lev.</i> 19:36</a>) in addition to the prohibition of fraudulent business practices.<br>The Rome manuscript has instead of בית חנוותא the expression לְמֵי חַטָּאתָה “the water for the ashes of the read heifer”, the drawing of which certainly would need a benediction. The Talmud reports that Rebbi Ḥaggai finished his Talmud studies with Rav Ḥuna I at age 18 and lived to be 160 years old; so, as shown in the commentary to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.1">Mishnah 1:1</a>, he still could have seen ashes of the read heifer, but these could not have been preserved at the time of Rebbi Jeremiah who lived during the third and fourth generations of Amoraïm, even if these ashes were uniquely reserved for Cohanim eating <i>Terumah</i>.<br>R. Zachariah Frankel wants to emend to בֵּית חַתְנוּתָא “place of a wedding” but his reading has no basis in antique or medieval sources.</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai was quick to recite a blessing. Rebbi Jeremiah said to him: You acted correctly because all commandments need a benediction. And from where that all commandments<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">After establishing benedictions before the consumption of food one establishes now the need for benedictions before the execution of positive commandments (by tradition, only those to be performed at specific times or occasions, not those that are always valid).</i> need a benediction? Rebbi Tanḥuma, Rebbi Abba bar Cahana in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 24:12" href="/Exodus.24.12"><i>Ex.</i> 24:12</a>) “I want to give you the stone tablets, the Torah and the commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The verse really reads: “both Torah and Commandments”.

How far may he break<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">There are two connected problems here. The first one, what is the minimum size of a piece of bread (or any other food) that requires a benediction beforehand; the second, if one person makes a benediction over bread for an entire company (with the other participants answering “Amen” instead of reciting their own benedictions), what is the minimal size of a piece of bread that every participant has to receive and eat after the benediction. For Grace after meals, the situation is clear. The requirement from the Torah (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:10" href="/Deuteronomy.8.10"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>) is “when you will have eaten and will be satiated then you must praise the Eternal …”; the Biblical obligation applies only after a full meal. The rabbinic obligation explicitly applies to food that fills at least the volume of an olive; smaller amounts do not require Grace and, according the preceding paragraph, one may not recite Grace for such minute amounts. But since benedictions before eating are all rabbinic institutions, the problem is whether food in an amount less than the volume of an average olive must (or may) have a benediction and, if a benediction is recited on a larger loaf, whether the piece eaten immediately after the recitation of the benediction must be the size of an olive or not.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 37b" href="/Berakhot.37b">Babli (37b</a>) has another angle to the problem. Since bread has a separate benediction from cereal and cakes, how small may the recognizable pieces of bread in cereal or soup be so that it still falls under the category of bread rather than cereal or soup?</i>?

Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav: Those assembled may not taste anything before the one who recited the benediction did taste. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: They may drink even if he did not drink.

[The parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 47a" href="/Berakhot.47a">Babli (47a</a>) has only the statement of Rav; there it is explained that לטעום “to taste”, usually applied to drinking, here means “eating” as is clear from the Yerushalmi.]</i> but Rebbi Joshua said when each one had his own cup in his hand.

Since everybody agrees that grain may be offered as first-fruits, and grain can be brought only after it was cut and separated from the straw, it follows that Rebbi Yehudah treats trees simply as stalks for their fruits.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, it is everybody’s opinion since fruits of a tree are also fruits of the soil but fruits of the soil are not fruits of the tree<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the opinion of the Tanna R.

Rebbi Yehudah accepts these formulas as guidelines which have to be adapted to varying circumstances and this adaptation is more important than using the approved formulas. The great number of different formulas of benediction in the Yerushalmi and fragments of Yerushalmi rite prayer books show that the opinion of Rebbi Yehudah was the dominant one in the Land of Israel. In staying with this attitude, it was even discussed at the start of this <i>halakhah</i> that the anonymous Mishnah should present the opinion of Rebbi Yehudah. In the parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 40b" href="/Berakhot.40b">Babli (40b</a>), Rebbi Yehudah’s opinion is not even quoted; in Babylonia only the opinions of Rebbi Yose (for those who know Hebrew) and of Rebbi Meïr (for the illiterate) are accepted.</i>. Rebbi Meïr says, even if he says: “Praised be He Who created this property, how beautiful it is,” he has fulfilled his duty. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Samuel: practice follows Rebbi Meïr.

First, that in benedictions one did follow Rebbi Yehudah in frequently changing the wording of benedictions. [This principle, absent in the Babli, is the cause that the reports about and conclusions from this story in the two Talmudim are not comparable.] The second, more important one, is that the language of the Mishnah, “On all of them if he pronounced ‘everything’, he has fulfilled his obligation” does <i>not</i> mean that one may recite that benediction on anything that specifically needs it and then extend it to fruits and vegetables, only that if one recited the benediction on agricultural produce it also is valid, but not preferred.</i>. If we recite on orach, it will not serve for anything else. One of them jumped the gun and recited “by Whose word everything was created” on the partridge. His colleague<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">The Aramaic text seems to have a scribal error for חַבְרֵיהּ.</i> laughed at him. Bar Qappara said to that one, not about that glutton but about you scoffer<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">I am angry.</i>. This one acted in his gluttony, why did you laugh? And to the other one he said, is there no rabbi here, is there no old man here? They said, within a year they both died. Rebbi Yose said, there two are gone and we did not learn anything from the incident. What is it? It is reasonable that one recites the benediction on leeks because “By Whose word everything was created” is secondary for vegetables<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the statement is that one should not start with the benediction over the quail because that benediction is also applicable to vegetables and, hence, cannot be recited a second time for the same meal without taking God’s name in vain. But, as explained earlier, the benediction “everything” is not valid for vegetables if recited on meat and, in any case, is undesirable for plants that have their own more specific benediction. Hence, the person reciting the benediction first on partridge cannot eat of the vegetables. On the other hand, if he makes the first benediction “Creator of the fruit of the soil” for the vegetables, then he can make a second benediction “that all was by His word” for the bird and all is fine.</i>.

But if the snack of fruits is not followed by bread and Grace after the meal then the fruits of the Land of Israel take precedence since they require at the end a “benediction imitating three benedictions” whereas other fruits only require the short benediction “Creator of living things” that earlier was considered to be “nothing”.</i>, but if he did not intend to eat bread afterwards, everybody agrees that if among them one is of the Seven Kinds, that is the one over which he recites the benediction.

The <i>Arukh</i> translates the word by Italian קוציאי which Perles misread as <i>guscio</i> “trestle; shell, hull”. Even <i>coccio</i> “potsherd” does not make much sense. The older commentaries to the Yerushalmi were misled by a scribal “correction” in the <i>Arukh</i> that identified <i>gryzmth</i> with lupines, which refers to the next word in the text. Levy’s dictionary, following Perles, derives the word from a non-existing Greek word γαρίσμη [but compare γαρισκός, ὁ, “an unknown fish”, γάρος, ὁ “paste of brine and small fish”, γάρον, τὸ “fish sauce”.] Jastrow considers the word as Par‘el from (Hebrew and Arabic) גזם “to cut in pieces”.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Three persons who ate together are required to “invite”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Three adult males who ate together are obliged to recite Grace as a group and start with a special invitation to all participants to join in the praise of the Lord by Whose kindness we live. The text of the “invitation” is given in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 7:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.7.3.1">Mishnah 3</a>.</i>. If one ate <i>demai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Newly harvested produce is subject to several obligatory gifts and tithes. The first one is the heave, תְּרוּמָה, that can be given to any Cohen. This <i>terumah</i> must be eaten by a Cohen’s family in ritual purity. There is no rate set for <i>terumah</i> in the Torah but in times when ritual purity can be observed, the rabbinically established rate was 2 percent. Next, the tithe of 10% must be given to a Levite. This <i>maäser</i> again is subject to a 10% <i>terumah of the tithe</i> to be given to the Cohen. The remainder of this <i>first tithe</i> is secular private property of the Levite and need not be kept in purity. However, consumption by a non-Cohen of any food containing still <i>terumah</i> (and of impure <i>terumah</i> by a Cohen) is a deadly sin. In Temple times it was established that all Jews, educated and uneducated, observant and nonobservant alike, did separate <i>terumah</i> and give it to a Cohen. However, the first tithe was not given by a substantial minority of uneducated and nonobservant. Since untithed produce still contains the <i>terumah of the tithe</i> and its consumption would be a deadly sin, it was instituted that observant Jews have to separate at least the <i>terumah of the tithe</i> for produce bought from unreliable sources. Since a majority of all agricultural producers did give the tithe, the obligation to tithe is conditional and is waved for the poor. Produce sold by unreliable persons is called <i>demai</i>; the rules under which <i>demai</i> has to be given are spelled out in a separate Tractate. In any case, since any person might give away all his property and then become poor and eat <i>demai</i> without tithing, <i>demai</i> is potentially permitted food for everybody and the person who eats it does not commit blasphemy in reciting Grace.</i>, or first tithe of which the heave was taken<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Babli explains, even if the heave was taken somewhat irregularly.

Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Huna, Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Abba bar Jeremiah: Three are required, two have permission. Rebbi Zeïra said this before Rebbi Yasa. He said to him: I have only the Mishnah, three who ate together are required to “invite”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">But two may not recite Grace together with the formula of invitation. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 45" href="/Berakhot.45">Babli (45a/b</a>) comes to the same conclusion that the old tradition of Babylonia was that two may say Grace together but three must do it, but the Israeli tradition was always to exclude two if three are required.</i>.

In contrast to the Babli, the Yerushalmi never entertains the thought that for common Grace one would have to lie down on couches.</i>.

According to the opinion of Rebbi Zeïra and his group, only if all three were dipped together. If you want to say that we do not infer rules of hyssop from rules of benedictions, do we not see the rabbis deal with <i>sukkah</i> and learn from pourable mud?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This proof that one requires logical consistency even in fields that are rather remote from each other is also a belated justification of the previous comparison of the rules of Grace with the composition of a court of law.</i>.

Three who ate together and one wants to leave, Rav said he should recite the first benediction, then he may leave. What is the first benediction? In the Yeshivah of Rav<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">After Rav’s death.</i> they said, the benediction of invitation. Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rav Jeremiah: that is “He Who feeds all.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The first benediction of Grace when recited without “invitation”. It seems that Rebbi Zeïra also agrees that the one who wants to leave has to recite the benediction “of invitation” aloud so that the other two may answer and fulfill their duty to recite Grace with “invitation”; the disagreement is only about how much he has to recite aloud, whether only the “invitation” or also the first benediction of Grace proper. [If all three recite Grace together, the one who recites the “invitation” has to recite all of Grace aloud; this custom has disappeared in Eastern European Ashkenazic Jewry after the invention of printing and the availability of inexpensive prayer books for everyone.]</i> Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Ḥanan in the name of Rav: that is “He Who feeds all.” Rav Sheshet objected, but a <i>baraita</i> disagrees: “Two, three are obliged to recite Grace.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It is generally agreed that ברכת הזימון is a scribal error and that the correct reading is that of Alfassi ברכת המזון “Grace”. The explanation of the elliptic <i>baraita</i> is according to Alfassi: If two or three people sit together and neither of them knows how to recite the entire Grace but each of them knows one or two benedictions that the others do not, then they take turns in reciting the benedictions and they all have fulfilled their obligations, the one reciting by pronouncing the benediction and the others by listening and answering “Amen”. The numbers are important to show that we require one person to recite an entire benediction; it is not permissible to split one benediction among several people. Hence, the maximal number of people who can share in reciting Grace is the number of benedictions in Grace.</i>” If you want to say the benediction of invitation is the first one, one should state “four.” They found stated “four.” If you want to say this is “He Who feeds all”, it is difficult. If you want to say that it<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The fourth benediction according to him who requires the first benediction to include “He Who feeds all.”</i> is “He Who is good and does good”, you cannot do that, there is a difference<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Between the first three benedictions that are Torah obligations and the fourth one who seems to be Rabbinic in character.</i> because Rav Huna said that “He Who is good and does good” was fixed<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">It says “fixed”, not “instituted” as in the parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 48b" href="/Berakhot.48b">Babli (48b</a>). According to the Yerushalmi, the fourth benediction is old, probably Biblical, but it was not permanently required in earlier times; the problem is discussed in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i> (Northvale NJ, 1995) p. 358–359.</i> after permission was received to bury the slain of Betar<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Roman law did not allow the burial of rebels against the government.

Rav Huna said, you may explain it following Rebbi Ismael since Rebbi Ismael said<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta deR.

For Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Torah study, including Torah reading.</i> there is written a benediction before, but no benediction is written after. What is written before it? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 32:3" href="/Deuteronomy.32.3"><i>Deut.</i> 32:3</a>) “For I am invoking the name of the Eternal, attribute greatness to our God.” For food there is written a benediction after, but no benediction is written before. What is written after it? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:10" href="/Deuteronomy.8.10"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise”. From where that which is said about one on the other and vice-versa? Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥmani in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: The Name is mentioned in both verses as parallel expressions<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In general, it is assumed in the system of Rebbi Aqiba that a word can have only one meaning. A stronger implication, agreed to by all tannaïtic authorities, is a “parallel expression”. The formal definition of the school of R. Ismael is that <i>if</i> one has a tradition that two equal or synonymous expressions are written in the Torah for purposes of comparison and <i>if</i> these two words are not used for any other inference, <i>then</i> all laws connected with one word apply to the other and vice-versa. The derivation here does not fulfill these conditions; hence, it is labelled to follow the rules of R. Aqiba who is not known to require too much formality in case the verse is used to give a biblical base to an old tradition.</i>. Just as the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction before, so the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction before. And just as the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction after, so the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction after. That follows Rebbi Aqiba<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Who is an exponent of intensional interpretation, whereas R. Ismael is an exponent of extensional interpretation. The rules of R. Ismael are systematized in his “13 rules” given in the introduction to the halakhic Midrash <i>Sifra</i> on <i>Leviticus</i>. The problem of both Rebbi Aqiba and Rebbi Ismael is that in its mishnaic-talmudic form, the rules of Jewish conduct form a logically consistent whole. It was shown earlier in this chapter, Notes 24 – 29, that rules must be consistent from one application to the next, such as rules of Grace and forming a court of law. But the basis of these laws, the words of the Torah, are unsystematic, fragmentary, and sometimes appear contradictory. Hence, one needs a method of translating the aphoristic text of the Torah in a legally consistent new language; cf. the author’s <i>Logical problems in Jewish tradition</i>, in: Confrontations with Judaism, ed. P. Longworth, Blond, London 1966, 171–196. The rules are discussed in the medieval texts <i>Introduction to the Talmud</i> by R. Samuel Hanaggid and <i>Sefer Keritut</i> of R. Simson of Sens.</i>. What following Rebbi Ismael? Rebbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rebbi Ismael, an inference from the lesser to the greater<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">קל וחוֹמר, the first rule of R. Ismael. If there are two commandments, A and B, and if every rule for A is no more stringent than the corresponding rule for B, then a rule expressed for A that has no equivalent for B is valid also for B. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 21a" href="/Berakhot.21a">Babli (21a</a>) quotes the following <i>qal waḥomer</i> in the name of R. Yoḥanan only and points out that the application here is not justified since it is self-contradictory. The Yerushalmi seems to be of the opinion that in the formulation given here, with “not more stringent” instead of “less stringent”, the argument is logically admissible.</i>. If food that needs no explicit benediction before, needs a benediction afterwards, regarding Torah that needs a benediction before, it is only logical that it should need a benediction afterwards. That works for Torah; what about food? If Torah that needs no benediction afterwards, needs a benediction before, regarding food that needs a benediction afterwards, it is only logical that it should need a benediction before. Rebbi Isaac and Rebbi Nathan say, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="I Samuel 9:13" href="/I_Samuel.9.13"><i>1Sam.</i> 9:13</a>): “For he will recite the benediction over the sacrifice and after that the invited guests will eat.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 48b" href="/Berakhot.48b">Babli (48b</a>) and in the <i>Mekhilta</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) this is given in the name of R. Nathan only. A verse from Samuel (Biblical but not Pentateuchal) cannot prove a commandment but can prove a practice.</i> Rebbi Nathan<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli and the Mekhilta, this appears in the name of Rebbi Isaac.</i> said, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:24" href="/Exodus.23.24"><i>Ex.</i> 23:24</a>) “you shall serve the Eternal, your God and give praise for your bread and your water”; when is it called your bread and your water, before you eat<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The full verse seems to read: “You shall serve the Eternal, your God, then He will bless your bread and your water and I will remove sickness from your midst.” The switch from third to first person is awkward in any case. In the Babli (in particular, in the Sephardic incunabula print) it is spelled out: Do not read וּבֵרַךְ “He will bless” but וּבָרֵךְ “and praise”. However, the Bible Concordance of G. Lisowsky (Stuttgart 1958) takes the verse, as it stands, to mean “You shall serve the Eternal, your God, and praise for your bread and your water, then I will remove sickness from your midst.” One may recite a benediction one one’s bread and one’s water only before it is consumed; afterwards one may speak only of nourishment and sustenance.</i>. Rebbi said, if he has to give praise when he ate and is satiated, somuch more at a time when he is hungry for food. That is for food, what about Torah? If food, which sustains only temporary life, needs a benediction before and after, Torah, which sustains eternal life, so much more<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli and the <i>Mekhilta</i> this is a קל וחוֹמר of Rebbi Ismael.</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra asked: These three that are called<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For reading the Torah in public. Since the preceding arguments tied benedictions over Torah reading to Grace, one has to ask in which way they are comparable. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 21b" href="/Megillah.21b">Babli <i>Megillah</i> 21b</a> there is a <i>baraita</i>: “(In reading the Torah) he who starts recites the benediction before and he who finishes recites the benediction after.” On that, the Gemara notes: But today, all recite benedictions before and after. This “today” may be long after the work on the Yerushalmi stopped. In any case, the <i>baraita</i> seems to represent the early Babylonian practice; we do not know of any direct Yerushalmi source that let people read the Torah without benediction. Rebbi Zeïra, the Galilean head of academy who had come from Babylonia, is the right person to ask for the reasons and the correct practice. Since his questions remain without answers, both practices might be acceptable. Both the preceding paragraph and R. Zeïra’s question presuppose that private Torah reading requires benedictions before and after, cf. מסכת סופרים Chap. 13 and Ezra Fleischer, קטעים מקובצי תפילה ארץ־ישראליים מן הגניזה, קובץ על יד יג (כג) 139–141, 188–189.</i>, how are you treating them? As three who ate together or as three who ate each one for himself? If you treat them as three who ate together then the first one recites the benediction before, the last one recites the benediction after, and the middle one does not recite any benediction at all. If you treat them as three who ate each one for himself then even the middle one recites benedictions before and after. Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, they did learn the benedictions for the Torah from Grace<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Text of the parallel in <i>Megillah</i> 4:1; the Venice print has here “benediction of ‘invitation’ ”, a scribal error הזימון for המזון.</i> only in public<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">R. Samuel ben Eudaimon seems to object to reciting a benediction after Torah study. Also, since Torah study is a permanent obligation (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 1:8" href="/Joshua.1.8"><i>Jos.</i> 1:8</a>), one benediction in the morning is enough to cover all Torah study during the day and evening; one does not have to recite a new benediction for study after an interruption.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not ‘invite’<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">To recite the invitation aloud and to count them for a group of three.

The question is whether the ten all have to be male adults or whether they have to be just ten males (of which nine are certain adults and the tenth possibly a minor as “appendix”.) In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 47b-48a" href="/Berakhot.47b-48a">Babli (47b/48a</a>), R. Joshua ben Levi is quoted as permitting the tenth (for reciting Grace) even to be a baby lying in a crib. However, from the continuation of the discussion here it seems that the Yerushalmi does not even consider allowing a minor to join for the long form of “invitation” but only for Torah reading or other <i>public</i> services.<br>Rebbi Yose ben Shaul was a student of Rebbi.

Also if a minor was among them?
Rebbi Berekhiah said that Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi asked before Rebbi Yose: “What are we dealing with? There<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In the case of public reading of the Torah, as given in the next paragraph.</i> one makes him an appendix for ten, one should say that here<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Reciting Grace.</i> one should make him an appendix for three.

It has been stated: One may take a minor and a Torah scroll as appendix. Rebbi Judan said: So is the <i>baraita</i>: One may take a minor as appendix for the purpose of Torah reading<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">But the Torah scroll is not a human and one never will get by with only eight adult males.

When does one start to make him an appendix? Rebbi Avina said: Rab Ḥuna and Rav Yehudah disagreed, both in the name of Samuel.

Rebbi Zeïra said, as long as I was there, I would have needed that. I regret that I did not ask.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked: May he who ate vegetable recite Grace?

From the Babli it seems that there was a tradition linking the two verses (since in its opinion, <i>gezerah shawah</i> must be based on a tradition) and, therefore, R.

But it is said here “the children of Israel” and it is said there “the children of Israel.” Since “children of Israel” said there means ten, so here it also must mean ten.
How do the Sages use the reason of Rebbi Yose the Galilean? “In assemblies”, in each separate congregation. Rebbi Ḥanina the son of Rebbi Abbahu said, it is written במקהלת<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The opinion of the sages is that the plural “assemblies” points to different assemblies at different places and not to different categories of the same assembly. R. Ḥanina notes that in R. Yose the Galilean’s tradition, the word was written defective and could be read as a singular מִקְהֶלֶת “assembly”. Hence, if the word is vocalized as a plural, it is an ideal plural that refers to different stages of the same assembly. In all our sources, the word in Psalms is written <i>plene</i> to support the position of the Sages; the Masorah to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 32:25-26" href="/Numbers.32.25-26"><i>Num.</i> 32:25/26</a> (composed several centuries after the conclusion of the Talmudim) notes that מקהלת appears as geographical name only in <i>Num.</i> and that in Psalms, מקהלוֹת is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Three who ate together are not permitted to split<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Since three together are required to recite the “invitation” whereas two or one do not recite it; the minimum number required for two separate recitations of Grace is six. Nine may form three groups, but ten are required to recite the “invitation” with an invocation of the Name. Hence, 10 to 19 people in a group may not split in the recitation of Grace.</i>, neither are four or five. Six may split and so on up to ten. Ten may not split and so on unless they are twenty.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated: If one was eating sitting down on Sabbath and forgot and did not mention Sabbath, Rav said: he must repeat, and Samuel said: he need not repeat<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 49b" href="/Berakhot.49b">Babli, 49b</a>, the opinion of Samuel is not mentioned; even Rav Naḥman, the student of Samuel, is reported to follow the ruling of Rav. Later commentators state that, since on the Sabbath one may not fast, eating on the Sabbath is a consequence of it being Sabbath and the Sabbath has to be mentioned in reciting Grace. Samuel might be of the opinion that anything not mentioned in the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:10" href="/Deuteronomy.8.10"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a> cannot be a reason for repeating Grace.</i>.
Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: If one is in doubt whether he mentioned the New Moon or did not mention it, one does not make him repeat<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 49b" href="/Berakhot.49b">Babli (49b</a>) there is a similar statement by Rav Naḥman in the name of Samuel that, if someone forgot the day of the New Moon in Grace, one does not make him repeat. According to the Yerushalmi, that seems obvious as the opinion of Samuel. However, the mention of Samuel is not in the Munich manuscript of the Babli, and the Spanish incunabula prints of <i>Berakhot</i> Babli have “Rav” instead of “Samuel”; this seems to be the correct reading. According to the Babli, one does not have to repeat even if he is sure that he did not mention the day; according to the way the Yerushalmi quotes the formulation, one has to repeat even if there was only a doubt that he did not mention the day.</i>. They found a dissenting statement: On every day that has a <i>Musaph</i> sacrifice (e. g., the day of the new moon and the intermediate days of holidays,) he must mention the occasion and if he did not mention it, one makes him repeat. But on every day that has no <i>Musaph</i> sacrifice (e. g., Hanukkah and Purim,) he must mention the occasion but if he did not, one does not make him repeat.
Ḥanan bar Abba and the colleagues were eating on Sabbath. After they had eaten and recited Grace he got up and left. When he returned, he found them reciting Grace. He said, did we not recite Grace already? They said to him, we recited, but now we recite again because we forgot to mention the Sabbath. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The titles of Huna and Jeremiah must be Rav, not Rebbi as in the Hebrew text, since the entire discussion is between students of Rav.</i> Huna (Rav Jeremiah extends it in the name of Rav) did not say so: If he forgot to mention the Sabbath, he says: He<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">The full benediction would be: Praised are You, Eternal, our God, King of the universe, Who gave.…</i> Who gave rest to His people Israel.

In both these texts, the second sentence reads “if they sat down to eat”; this is interpreted in the Babli to mean that they are sitting together by a common decision. Hence, they form a group and have to recite Grace together. The language of the Yerushalmi, “they sat down and ate,” points to a spontaneous act that would not require Grace to be recited in common in the opinion of the Babli.</i>: Ten people walking on the road, even if all of them eat from the same loaf, each one recites Grace for himself. If they sat down and ate, even though each one eats his own loaf, one recites Grace for all of them.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Two groups that ate in one house, if some of one group saw some of the other group they join in “invitation”; otherwise, each group recites the “invitation” for itself.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Abba bar Zamina in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: For two houses, there is a problem<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah gives the rule for two groups assembled at different places in one house. The problem of two groups which eat in different houses but see one another is not treated and one may make arguments both ways. {Tosaphot in <i>Babli</i> 50b read the statement as: “[The Mishnah] is only needed for two houses,” the inference being that if they see one another they can join in saying Grace. This transfers the meaning of Babylonian צריכא (“it is necessary”) to the Palestinian expression נצרכה (“it is problematic”) used here!}</i>.
Rebbi Yoḥanan said, it applies only if they entered with that in mind<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yoḥanan refers to the Mishnah: Two groups not in the same room may recite common Grace only if they started the meal with that intention. This corresponds to the opinion of Babli and Tosephta in the case of the caravan travelling together, discussed at the end of the previous Halakhah. However, since it is necessary to state this rule for people in two different rooms, it follows that the Yerushalmi does not require common intent for people in one room; R. Yoḥanan agrees with his student’s student R. Jeremiah in the preceding Halakhah.</i>.
What do you do with those at the house of the patriarch, like one house or like two houses<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 50a" href="/Berakhot.50a">Babli (50a</a>) notes that at a dinner in the house of the Resh Galuta, the head of the Jews of Babylonia, one recites Grace in small groups since the place is so noisy that one could not hear a person at the dais reciting Grace. Here it seems that the Patriarch held his formal dinners in a very large hall with several groups forming circles and not communicating with one another. The question is whether the room acts as a common enclosure for all these groups or not.</i>? Let us say that if they usually walk over from one group to the other then they “invite” together; otherwise they do not “invite” together. Rebbi Berekhiah used to place his speaker in the middle of the door of the house of study and he recited the “invitation” together with both groups<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">The meals in the Yeshivah were taken in two adjacent rooms. A similar note in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 50b" href="/Berakhot.50b">Babli (50b</a>) states that if the same waiter waits upon several groups in a very large room, the waiter makes them one group.</i>.
“One does not recite a benediction over wine unless he added water; these are the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, one may recite the benediction.” Rebbi Zeriqa in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: The Sages agree with Rebbi Eliezer that one has to add a small amount of water into the cup used for Grace<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Because that is the civilized way of acting and religious obligations should be executed with dignity.</i>. The rabbis do so for the <i>Qiddush</i> cup. The statement of Rebbi Yose disagrees with Rebbi Jonah, for Rebbi Jonah tasted it and restored it<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Jonah tasted from the cup for <i>Qiddush</i> of Friday evening, then left the rest standing in the cup and “repaired” it the next morning by filling it again with more wine. As will be explained later in this Halakhah, a cup that has been drunk from cannot be used for another benediction; hence, it has to be replenished. The question is, if R. Jonah put water into his <i>Qiddush</i> cup, how could he leave it standing half full through the night?</i>. If you imply that it was mixed, did we not formulate: He who drinks mixed drinks that were standing through the night, his blood is on his head. Rebbi Yoḥanan said, that is only if it was standing in metal vessels<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The last two statements are also in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 17a" href="/Niddah.17a">Babli (<i>Niddah</i> 17a</a>); the <i>baraita</i> is very close to the text in <i>Derekh Ereẓ Rabba,</i> Chapter 11.

Jonah might add water to his wine as long as his cup was not of metal.</i>.

You may infer from this three things. You infer that one must hold the cup with his right hand<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">If the left hand only is required to help, the main action is done by the right hand.</i>, that one’s hand must be lifted from the table at least a hand-breadth<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">For a lesser height than a handbreadth (one sixth of a cubit), no help would be necessary.</i>, and that one has to look at the cup<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, it would not be necessary to lift the cup during recital of the benedictions.</i>.
Rebbi Aḥa said: Three things were said about the cup of Grace: full, decorated, and washed. All three come from one verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 33:23" href="/Deuteronomy.33.23"><i>Deut.</i> 33:23</a>): “Naphtali is satiated with goodwill, full of the blessings of the Eternal.” Satiated - decorated<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">There are different lists in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 51a" href="/Berakhot.51a">Babli (51a</a>); one also mentions “decorated” and different interpretations are given. Rav Yehudah is reported to have surrounded himself with his students when he recited Grace over a cup of wine; Rav Ḥisda surrounded the (larger) cup of benediction with smaller cups that presumably were filled with wine. This second interpretation seems to be the one original with the Yerushalmi which identifies satiated with decorated, i. e., more than enough wine to fulfill every desire.</i>, goodwill - washed<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">So that everybody would willingly take the cup and drink from it. The Babli is a little more explicit and requires “rinsed and dried.”</i>, full as its acception.

Yose ben R. Ḥanina; R. Yoḥanan says that he is given boundless property.

Hence, the allusion cannot be meant to describe his territory but is either a geographic amplification or refers to another world.</i>.
Rebbi Eleazar said: One does not recite benedictions on a damaged cup. If one tasted from it, he damaged it. You may infer from this three things. You infer that one does not recite benedictions on a damaged cup. And that it must contain a measure. And if one tasted from it, he damaged it<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Two of the three statements are exactly what Rebbi Eleazar said. The only inference to be drawn from the fact that the cup should not be “damaged” is that it must contain a minimum measure (a <i>reviït,</i> a quarter <i>log</i>) to be valid. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 105b-106b" href="/Pesachim.105b-106b">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 105b/106</a> a), the derivation is both from the argument given here and from a <i>baraita</i> about <i>Havdalah</i> after the Sabbath. The parallel argument would have been to derive the necessity of a minimal volume of wine from the next paragraph which implies that if one does not have enough wine for <i>Qiddush</i> both Friday night and Sabbath morning one leaves all the wine for the morning. Otherwise, one simply could divide the wine and drink the volume of a liquor glass each time. The order of topics here does not exclude that this also is the Yerushalmi reasoning.</i>.
Rebbi Tanḥum bar Yudan said: The honor of the day takes precedence over the honor of the night. The <i>Qiddush</i> of the night takes precedence over the <i>Qiddush</i> of the day. What is the honor of the day? Rebbi Yosi in the name of Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, and Rebbi Eleazar bar Joseph<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">An otherwise unknown student of Rav.</i> in the name of Rav: “He Who created the fruit of the vine.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">This means that the primary obligation of reciting <i>Qiddush</i> is in the night. The obligation of honoring the Sabbath is mainly during the day. Hence, if there is only one cup of wine, <i>Qiddush</i> of the night should be recited over bread. The <i>honor</i> of the day, referred to in the Babli euphemistically as “great <i>Qiddush</i>,” consists in reciting the benediction over wine only, without any additions, over a specially dedicated cup of wine. This is reported and endorsed in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 106a" href="/Pesachim.106a">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 106a</a>) as the action “of an old man,” confirming a Yerushalmi practice.</i>”
Rebbi Zeriqan, son of the father-in-law of Rebbi Zeriqan, mentioned Ḥanukkah in “the Land” and they praised him<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">It was stated in an earlier <i>baraita</i> in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 7:4:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.7.4.2-5">Halakhah 5</a> that Ḥanukkah should be mentioned.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> These are the matters between the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel about meals. The House of Shammai say, one pronounces the benediction of the day<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Qiddush</i> of Friday night and holidays that has to precede the meal.</i> and then the one over wine. But the House of Hillel say, one pronounces the benediction over wine and aftewards the one of the day.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> What<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The entire section is paralleled in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 10:2:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.10.2.2-5">Yerushalmi <i>Pesaḥim</i> 10:2</a> (with a slightly better text). The content of this paragraph is paralleled in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 51b" href="/Berakhot.51b">Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 51b</a> and, in language very close to the Babli, in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 5:25" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).5.25">Tosephta <i>Berakhot</i>5:25</a>. Both Babli and Tosephta add that “practice follows the House of Hillel,” a seemingly unnecessary statement since practice always follows the House of Hillel (except if noted otherwise.) It seems that the Tosephta is very old, from before the times of Rabban Gamliel. The Yerushalmi either suppressed the note that was no longer relevant or quotes another source which never had that statement.</i> is the reason of the House of Shammai? The Sanctification of the Day causes the wine to be served; he was obligated for the Sanctification of the Day<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since there is a Biblical injunction (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 20:8" href="/Exodus.20.8"><i>Ex.</i> 20:8</a>): “Remember the Sabbath Day to declare it holy” and this obligation starts immediately at nightfall, whereas the meal is held later for technical reasons. The laws of <i>Qiddush</i> are discussed in Chapter 10 of <i>Pesaḥim</i> and reviewed in the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah,</i> pp. 209–227.</i> before the wine was served. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? The wine causes the Sanctification of the Day to be recited<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Sanctification cannot be recited without food especially designated for the Sabbath. (However, <i>Qiddush</i> may also be recited over the Sabbath bread but this is not the preferred way, at least not in the Land of Israel where wine was and is abundant.)</i>. Another explanation: The wine is frequent, Sanctification is less frequent<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The principle of sacral actions is: The more frequent action (or benediction) has precedence. This is spelled out by the Babli here; Yerushalmi sources are: <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 2:1:18-2:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.2.1.18-2.9"><i>Yoma</i> 2:3</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shekalim 8:4:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shekalim.8.4.2-4"><i>Šeqalim</i> 8:6</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 5:6:2-7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.5.6.2-7"><i>Sukkah</i> 5:6</a>. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 4:3:4-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.4.3.4-5"><i>Taäniot</i> 4:5</a>. The principle is implied by the Yerushalmi here. Both Houses have two reasons for their positions. Wine is more frequent since it is also used during weekdays and it may also be used for <i>Havdalah.</i></i>.
Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He is R. Yasa (Assi), colleague of R. Mana I.</i> said: From the words of both of them<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Houses of Hillel and Shammai.</i> it follows that for wine and <i>Havdalah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The “separation” between Sabbath and weekdays that has to be recited at the end of Sabbath. The obligation of reciting <i>Havdalah</i> starts at the very moment of nightfall.</i>, the wine comes first. Is not the reason of the House of Shammai that the Sanctification of the Day causes the wine to be served? But here, <i>Havdalah</i> does not cause the wine to be served<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havdalah</i> may be recited over any alcoholic beverage (in the opinion of the Babli, over any beverage, other than water, that is common in the country.) <i>Qiddush</i> may be recited only over wine or possibly the Sabbath bread.</i>; wine therefore has precedence. Is not the reason of the House of Hillel that the wine is frequent, Sanctification of the Day is less frequent? Also here, wine is frequent and <i>Havdalah</i> is less frequent: the wine has precedence. Rebbi Mana said: From the words of both of them it follows that for wine and <i>Havdalah</i>,<i>Havdalah</i> comes first. Is not the reason of the House of Shammai that he was obligated for the Sanctification of the Day before the wine came? Also here, since he is obligated for <i>Havdalah</i> before the wine came, <i>Havdalah</i> has precedence. Is not the reason of the House of Hillel that the wine causes the Sanctification of the Day to be recited? But here, the wine does not cause <i>Havdalah</i> to be recited: <i>Havdalah</i> has precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havdalah</i> may be recited over any alcoholic beverage (in the opinion of the Babli, over any beverage, other than water, that is common in the country.) <i>Qiddush</i> may be recited only over wine or possibly the Sabbath bread.</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra said: One infers from the words of both of them<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Mana.</i> that one may make <i>Havdalah</i> without wine but one may not make <i>Qiddush</i> without wine<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 106b" href="/Pesachim.106b">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 106b</a>) allows one to make <i>Qiddush</i> over bread, at least in Babylonia where wine is hard to come by.</i>. That is the opinion of Rebbi Zeïra since Rebbi Zeïra said: One makes <i>Havdalah</i> on alcoholic beverages<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Any alcoholic beverage, including low grade beer. The opinion of the Babli is not clearly stated (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 107a" href="/Pesachim.107a"><i>Pesaḥim</i>107a</a>), but the practice there is spelled out that any alcoholic beverage common in a country may be used for <i>Havdalah.</i> Current practice allows even non-alcoholic beverages, except water, as long as they are commonly used (<i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 296(2)).</i> but one goes from one place<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The physical exertion of the walk may interfere with one’s Sabbath rest but the duty to hear <i>Qiddush</i> recited over wine has precedence.</i> to another to hear <i>Qiddush.</i>
The Great Rebbi Yose said: Over there<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In Babylonia.</i>, they have the custom that at a place without wine, the reader stands before the Ark<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For a formal prayer, a kind of shortened repetition of the <i>‘Amidah.</i> Normally, evening prayers are communal without a reader.</i>, recites one benediction that contains seven<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The middle portion of the prayer by the reader contains allusions to all seven benedictions of the Sabbath <i>‘Amidah</i>: “(1) Shield of the Patriarch, (2) He Who revives the dead by His command, (3) the Holy God, (4) Who gives rest to His people, (5) before Him we shall serve (6) and give thanks to His name, God of thanksgiving, (7) Master of peace.” Today, the benediction is recited always except the first night of Passover when everybody is required to drink four cups of wine; thus, there is no reason to replace <i>Qiddush</i> by public prayer. In Babylonian sources, the benediction is not mentioned explicitly; in Medieval sources, a different reason is given for the benediction.</i>, and closes by “He Who sanctifies Israel and the Sabbath Day<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is the Israeli formula. The Babylonian one has only “He Who sanctifies the Sabbath,” probably because the Sabbath is a cosmic day of rest in contrast to holidays that exist only in Jewish history.</i>.”
It is difficult in the opinion of the House of Shammai, how to proceed on Friday evening if someone was sitting and eating on Friday afternoon, it got dark, and there was only one cup of wine<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">One returns to the discussion of the Mishnah. One may not start a meal Friday afternoon close to the Sabbath (Mishnah <i>Shabbat</i> 1:2) but one may start earlier and continue until nightfall. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 100a" href="/Pesachim.100a">Talmud (Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i>100a</a>, Yerushalmi <i>Pesaḥim</i> 10:1, fol. 37b) reports that R. Yehudah bar Illai requires one to stop before nightfall, but R. Yose bar Ḥalaphta lets him continue, and practice follows R. Yose. It is assumed here that even the House of Shammai will accept the position of R. Yose.</i>? You must say that he reserves the cup until after the recitation of Grace and includes all other benedictions. Obviously, if he would want to pronounce the benediction for the day, Grace has precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even if one continues, the Sabbath meal must be separate since eating on Sabbath is a religious obligation. Hence, Grace must be said for the preceding meal and, if one has wine, it must be recited over a cup of wine.</i>. If he wants to recite the benediction over wine, the day has precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to the House of Shammai.</i>. One may infer this from the following (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 8:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.8.8.1"><i>Mishnah</i> 8:9</a>): “If wine was brought to them after the meal and there was only one cup.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In that situation, the House of Shammai say that one starts Grace with the benediction over wine while the House of Hillel require the benediction for wine after Grace. It would seem that in our situation also, the wine could come before <i>Qiddush.</i></i>” Rebbi Abba said: Because it is a very short benediction, he might forget and drink<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He might inadvertently drink from the wine after Grace without a benediction. This is a special situation and the House of Shammai will not agree to apply that Mishnah to it.</i>. But here, he connects everything with the cup of wine and he will not forget. How should he proceed according to the House of Shammai? He should recite Grace first, after that he makes <i>Qidddush,</i> and only after that he recites the benediction over the wine.
It is difficult in the opinion of the House of Hillel, how may one proceed at the end of the Sabbath if someone was sitting and eating on Sabbath, it got dark, and there was only one cup of wine? You say, he reserves it<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The cup of wine that should follow Grace and precede <i>Havdalah.</i></i> until after the meal and connects everything to it. What can you say? Shall he recite the benediction for the wine, Grace has precedence. Shall he recite Grace, the light has precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">After the end of the Sabbath, one has to recite not only <i>Havdalah</i> but with it a benediction for man-made fire (that was forbidden on the Sabbath and now can be kindled anew) and spices (to make up for the loss of the intensified pleasure one derives from the Sabbath that now is being lost.) The invention of man-made fire is traditionally attributed to Adam at the end of his first Sabbath, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 8:5:5-9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.8.5.5-9">Halakhah 6</a>. The problem here is that one must make the benediction for the light as soon as one profits from newly lit fire.</i>. Shall he recite for the light, <i>Havdalah</i> has precedence. We may infer from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 5:30" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).5.30">Tosephta <i>Berakhot</i> 5:30</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 52a" href="/Berakhot.52a">Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 52a</a>. In both of these sources, the House of Shammai is reported to require light before spices and the House of Hillel spices before light. R. Arieh Leib Yellin in his <i>Yephe Enayim</i> points out that the text of the Yerushalmi is consistent with all the inferences drawn here and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 8:5:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.8.5.2-4">Halakhah 5</a>. Hence, there is a genuine difference in tradition between Galilee and Babylonia.</i>: “Rebbi Yehudah said, the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel do not disagree that Grace comes first and <i>Havdalah</i> at the end. They disagree only over light and spices because the House of Shammai say spices and afterwards light, but the house of Hillel say light and afterwards spices.” Rebbi Abba and Rav Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Two Babylonians, one an authority in Galilee, the other in Babylonia. They are responsible for enforcing uniformity in Jewish custom in both countries.</i>: Practice follows him who says spices and afterwards light. What should he do following the opinion of the House of Hillel? He should say Grace first, afterwards he should recite the benediction over wine and afterwards <i>Havdalah.</i>
A holiday that starts at the end of Sabbath. Rebbi Yoḥanan said YQNH, wine, <i>Qiddush</i>, light, <i>Havdalah.</i> Ḥanan bar Abba said in the name of Rav: Wine, <i>Qiddush</i>, light, <i>Havdalah, sukkah</i>, time<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">He agrees with Rebbi Yoḥanan but includes all possibilities that may be appropriate for a holiday. The benediction for time is: “He Who let us live, kept us, and let us reach this time.” This benediction is not recited on the last day of Passover. Hence, Rebbi Yoḥanan gives the minimal formula as pointed out in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 101b" href="/Pesachim.101b">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i>101b</a>).</i>. Rebbi Ḥanina said, NHYQ<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Light, <i>Havdalah,</i> wine, <i>Qiddush.</i> In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 102a" href="/Pesachim.102a">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 102a</a>), this order is attributed to R. Joshua, the early highest authority who is given his full name, R. Joshua ben Ḥananiah. It is possible that this led to the substitution of “R. Joshua ben Levi” for “Samuel” in the following parable. However, Rashbam (R. Samuel ben Meïr), in his commentary to Babli <i>Pesaḥim,</i> quotes R. Ḥanina as requiring YNHQ, wine, light, <i>Havdalah, Qiddush.</i> But this is the undisputed order of Levi here who is described as taking a middle road between R. Ḥanina and R. Yoḥanan. The Venice print of the Yerushalmi has the impossible reading YNHYQ which is a confluence of the codes attributed to R. Ḥanina in the Babli and the Yerushalmi.</i>. Samuel follows the opinion of Rebbi Ḥanina since Rebbi Aḥa said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rashbam quotes “in the name of Samuel”. In the Babli, as mentioned earlier, this parable is from “R. Ḥanina illustrating the words of R. Joshua ben Ḥananiah.”</i>: A king<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The king is the Sabbath and the subordinate prefect is the holiday; the Sabbath has to be mentioned first, including the light that belongs to the ceremony of Sabbath end, before making <i>Qiddush</i> for the holiday. Since holidays also give one spiritual ease, spices are not added at the end of a Sabbath that is the start of a holiday.</i> leaves and a prefect comes. One accompanies the king and only afterwards does one receive the prefect. Levi said YNHQ<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Wine, light, <i>Havdalah, Qiddush</i>; first the full <i>Havdalah</i> and then an appended <i>Qiddush.</i> In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 102a" href="/Pesachim.102a">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i>102a</a>), Levi is reported as requiring QNYH, in opposition to everybody mentioned here.</i>. It seems that Levi says it both ways<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">He puts wine first following R. Yoḥanan and <i>Havdalah</i> before <i>Qiddush</i> following R. Ḥanina.</i>. Rebbi Zeïra asked before Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yasa (Assi) elsewhere. The Babylonian R. Zeïra inquired from the Tiberian R. Assi whether the practice in Galilee was identical with the Babylonian.</i>: What does one do in practice? He said to him: one follows Rav and Rebbi Yoḥanan. And so it became the practice following Rav and Rebbi Yoḥanan.
When Rebbi Abbahu went to the South<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The region of Lod, the only remaining Jewish settlement in Judea and the Southern plain. R. Abbahu lived in Caesarea and personally followed the rule of R. Ḥanina who always speaks in the name of the authority of Rebbi.</i>, he followed Rebbi Ḥanina. When he descended<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Tiberias is below sea level. From Caesarea Philippi (Banias) one has to descend, from Caesarea Maritima via Bet Sheän one would ascend.</i> to Tiberias, he followed Rebbi Yoḥanan in order not to disagree with anybody in his home town.
The opinion of Rebbi Ḥanina is understandable. It is difficult to understand Rebbi Yoḥanan: Does one not pronounce the benediction over the light at all other days that one should extinguish it<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since the light is for celebration only; it is extinguished after <i>Havdalah.</i> The light for <i>Havdalah</i> is preferably a torch, but the light for a meal is from a lamp.</i>? And here, he makes the benediction over the light so that he should not extinguish it<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">On a holiday, one may light a fire (from an existing one) but one may not extinguish it. Hence, the light in our case is a light for the meal, not for <i>Havdalah,</i> and should precede <i>Qiddush</i> irrespective of the order of <i>Qiddush</i> and <i>Havdalah.</i> [In current practice, the wife lights the candles first with her own benediction and the husband then recites his benediction (after <i>Qiddush</i>) over the same lights. That does not seem to be reasonable. It may be assumed that R. Ḥanina requires either husband or wife to recite the first benediction over light.]</i>. How does Rebbi Yoḥanan handle this? Since he has wine<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For a full meal for which the light is needed.</i>, his light will not go out. Then he might say the benediction over the light at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">When the light is really needed for the food.</i>. In order not to disturb its timing from other Sabbaths<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">To keep the order wine - (spices) - light - <i>Havdalah</i> as a matter of course.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The House of Shammai say that one washes his hands and after that he mixes the cup, but the House of Hillel say that one mixes the cup first and then he washes his hands<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The cup here is the <i>Qiddush</i> cup. <i>Qiddush</i> is followed by a meal with bread for which one must wash his hands. The details and reasons are spelled out in the Halakhah. This disagreement has nothing to do with the question whether one washes his hands before (following R. Moses Isserls) or after (following R. Joseph Caro) <i>Qiddush</i>; in both cases, the cup is filled before one washes his hands.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> What is the reason of the House of Shammai? The fluids on the back of the cup should not become impure from his hands and in their turn defile the cup<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical principles on ritual impurity are spelled out in the book of <i>Leviticus.</i> A Biblical source of impurity is called אב הטוּמאה “father of impurity”. The only possible objects of impurity are humans, vessels, and food. Any object that becomes impure secondarily, usually by contact, is “first in impurity.” For profane objects, the two stages are the only ones. However, by rabbinic tradition there exists a “second in impurity” for profane and “third, fourth” for certain holy objects. The general principle is that any transmitted impurity decreases by one degree. There is one important exception. Since body fluids of a person with gonorrhea are “fathers of impurity”, it was decreed that any impurity involving fluids is at least “first in impurity.” Also, unwashed hands are always assumed to be “second in impurity.” If one touches a dry cup with unwashed hands, nothing happens. But if there should be drops of wine on the outside of the cup, these drops will become “first in impurity” and defile the contents of the cup. It is the characteristic of Rabbinic (pharisaic) Judaism that one tries to eat one’s profane meals in a way reasonably consistent with rules of ritual purity. It seems that the House of Shammai assumes that a “full cup” required for <i>Qiddush</i> is full to the rim, kept together only by surface tension, and, hence, it is unlikely that the back of the cup will be dry. (For pottery vessels, other rules apply.)<br>The text of the explanation is from the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 5:26" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).5.26">Tosephta (<i>Berakhot</i> 5:26</a>).</i>.
What is the reason of the House of Hillel? The back of the cup is always impure<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The back of the cup is impure (“second in impurity”) by Rabbinic decree, as explained in the next paragraph. If one washes his hands first and does not dry them very thorougly, then the hands will become “first in impurity” by holding the cup, as explained in the previous note, and one is worse off than with unwashed hands. (This is also the explanation of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 52a" href="/Berakhot.52a">Babli, 52a</a>.) The House of Hillel assume that a “full cup” is one filled close to the rim but leaving a reasonable safety margin as hedge against a spill.</i>. Another explanation: Washing of the hands should be as close as possible to the benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear whether the benediction in question is that over bread (R. Joseph Caro) or the wine for <i>Qiddush</i> (R. Moshe Isserls). Here also both explanations are from the Tosephta (<i>loc. cit.</i>)</i>.
Rebbi Vivan<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">A Galilean Amora of the third generation, student of all the great Amoraïm of R. Joḥanan’s generation. His name probably was Vivianus. In other quotes, his name is shortened to Bibi, Vivi.</i> in the name of Rebbi Yoḥanan: It turns out that the House of Shammai is consistent with Rebbi Yose and the House of Hillel with Rebbi Meïr<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This is paradoxical since practice follows the House of Hillel and Rebbi Yose. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 52" href="/Berakhot.52">Babli (52a/b</a>) explains otherwise, that the Houses of Shammai and Hillel disagree on whether one may use a cup which is impure outside at all if one cares about consuming food in purity.</i>, since we have stated there (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 25:7" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.25.7">Mishnah <i>Kelim</i> 25:7</a>)<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 25 starts: “All vessels have an inside and an outside.” For earthenware vessels, it is a decree of the Torah that they become impure only if an impure “father of impurity” is found in the volume enclosed by the vessel (even without touching the walls,) never from the outside (even if the “father of impurity” touches the wall.) From this is derived a Rabbinic decree that also all other vessels, e. g. metal vessels that become impure from a biblical “father of impurity” by simple touch, cannot become impure inside if a Rabbinic impurity touches from the outside (but not vice versa.) <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 8:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.8.6.1">Mishnah 7</a> then reads: “All vessels have an outside, an inside, and a rim. Rebbi Tarphon said, [one speaks of] a large wooden trough, Rebbi Aqiba said, of cups. Rebbi Meïr said for impure and pure hands, R. Yose said, they spoke only about pure hands.” Since inside and outside have been discussed before, the opinions of Rabbis Meïr and Yose, students of R. Aqiba, deal with the rim, the part of the outside of the cup that is slightly bent outward or otherwise distinguished as place for the lips when one drinks from the cup. The explanation of the Mishnah is given in Tosephta <i>Kelim Baba bathra</i>3:9–10: “R. Meïr said: How is it for impure hands? If one’s hands are impure, the outside of the cup is pure; if it has moist spots then he may hold the cup by its rim without worry. R. Yose said: How is it for pure hands? If his hands were pure and moist, but the outside of the cup impure, then he may hold the cup at the rim without worrying that the moisture of his hand should become impure from the outside and then defile his hand.” It follows that for R. Yose, the hands have to be pure (i. e., washed) and for R. Meïr they may be impure.</i>: “Rebbi Meïr said, for impure and pure hands. Rebbi Yose said, they spoke only about pure hands.”

The <i>Tanḥuma</i> explains the expression “conditional” for something that is required, by “it is optional in the sense that if one decides not to eat bread with his meal, he does not have to wash his hands.”</i>, after the meal it is obligatory.

It seems that the Yerushalmi has a first version in which the husband simply divorced his wife and in the second version he killed his wife, the intended victim, and himself.

Rav Huna said: Handwashing is only for bread.

For any sacred food like <i>terumah</i> or the Passover sacrifice, it is obvious that one has to wash his hands before touching fluids since the secondary impurity of hands causes primary impurity for the fluid. Hence, for the <i>Seder</i> it is only a question whether one should pronounce a benediction, as in the times of the Temple, or whether one washes his hands as a remembrance of Temple times. Here, the question is posed for everyday food, since handwashing for profane food comes from the “discipline of <i>terumah.</i>” Rav is of the opinion that the Rabbinic institution of handwashing applies only to bread whereas Rebbi Hoshaya requires handwashing for profane food in all situations where it would be required for <i>terumah.</i> In Antiquity, in the absence of spoons most foods in sauce were scooped up with pitta bread. Hence, the real difference between Rav and R. Hoshaya was in food handling as explained by R. Zeïra.</i>.

The latter interpretation is then rejected by the Talmud. In the Yerushalmi it seems that Rav is reported to require only one washing per day and Rebbi Avina restricts it to people like donkey drivers who cannot easily find water.

Rebbi Zeïra went up to Rebbi Abbahu in Caesarea. When he met him he said: Come to eat. He [R. Abbahu] gave him a loaf to break and told him: Take it and recite the benediction. He [R.

The table whose legs are screwed in and can be unscrewed without tools is covered by the Tosephta (<i>loc. cit.</i> 1:11): “Restaurant chairs, even those having holes, that have their legs screwed in are permanently pure; if legs are fixed with a nail then they may become impure.” The parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 52b" href="/Berakhot.52b">Babli (52b</a>) states that the House of Shammai will forbid the use of a table that is ritually unclean; both Babli and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 5:27" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).5.27">Tosephta (5:27</a>) note that the House of Hillel will never allow one to put the towel on the table because the fluid on the towel might touch the food and render it impure in the second degree (and by eating from it an amount greater than the volume of two eggs one’s body becomes impure in the second degree, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Tahorot 2:2" href="/Mishnah_Tahorot.2.2">Mishnah <i>Ṭahorot</i> 2:2</a>).

So here also, he should recite at the place where he remembers<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">In the formulation here, it is agreed that a worker at a dangerous place does not have to return (a) to expose himself to unnecessary danger and (b) to spend unproductive time at the expense of his employer who is required to pay his entire day. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 53b" href="/Berakhot.53b">Babli (53b</a>), the entire discussion is a <i>baraita</i> and the argument of the House of Hillel precedes that of the House of Shammai. Hence, its implication is that the House of Shammai require the worker to return to his dangerous place and his employer to pay for the time lost. In this case, it seems that the Yerushalmi reports a deliberate change from earlier practice in order to embody a change in labor law.</i>.
How long may he recite? Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Samuel, until the food in his bowels is digested. But the sages say, all the time that he is thirsty because of that meal<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Presumably, if he did not drink during the meal.</i>. Rebbi Yoḥanan says, until he gets hungry again<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 53b" href="/Berakhot.53b">Babli (53b</a>) quotes R. Yoḥanan as is he quoted here and attributes the statement of the Sages (that would guide practice here) to R. Simeon ben Laqish, whose opinion carries less weight than that of R. Yoḥanan. Another statement of R. Simeon ben Laqish, who gives as maximum the time it would take to walk four <i>mil</i>, 1 hour 12 min., has no parallel in the Yerushalmi. The difference between the Galilean יתאכל and the Babylonian יתעכל is dialectal; the Babylonian Mishnah has יתעכל. Since Samuel was a medical doctor, his explanation “until the food was digested” may have been practical for him; it certainly is not practical for everybody else. It is therefore not necessary to say that R. Yoḥanan is more restrictive than the Mishnah (as is the opinion of the student of Rabbenu Jonah in his commentary on Alfassi.)</i>.

Halakhah 8

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If wine was brought to them after the meal and there was only one cup. The House of Shammai say, he recites the benediction over wine and afterwards says Grace, but the House of Hillel say, he recites Grace and afterwards the benediction over wine. One answers “Amen” after a Jew but one does not answer “Amen” after a Samaritan unless one has heard the entire benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Samaritan follows a non-standard form of Judaism, one may not answer after his benediction unless one has ascertained that his benediction is compatible with our rules.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> The Mishnah deals with wonders of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pne Mosheh</i> (Margalit) notes that probably “Israel” here means “more than 50% of all of Israel” as in other circumstances.</i>.

Or if he was a famous person like Joab ben Ẓeruiah and his companions? Or a man through whom the Name of Heaven was sanctified, for example Daniel and his companions? He recites a benediction.” In this version, all questions are being answered and the next sentence starts a new paragraph. <i>Rosh</i> also quotes from Rav Hai Gaon a reading in the Babli, referring to the previous paragraph, that for a miraculous escape a man, his son, and his grandson have to recite the (appropriate) benediction.</i>?

The opposite opinion is that of Rebbi Meïr.</i> that each tribe is called “assembly”, one has to recite the benediction; but according to him who said that only all tribes together are called “assembly”, one does not have to recite the benediction.
He who sees Babylon has to recite five benedictions<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli (57b), this is a sermon of Rav Hamnuna, in a slightly different order.

[The formula for the Kingdom: “our God, King of the Universe,” probably was introduced to counter Christian ideas that God’s kingdom is not of this world.] In addition, Abbaye notes in the Babli that Rav will not require R. Yoḥanan’s addition. The formulation of the Yerushalmi shows that in Galilee, they interpreted the statement of Rav that one is required to say “You” to mean that one has to say “You, o Eternal,” since in adressing somebody in the second person one must specify the adressee. Hence, the statement of R. Yoḥanan in the Babli was meant as clarification of Rav’s statement, not a new requirement; it does not have to be mentioned since Rebbi Yoḥanan would disclaim any originality. Only in Babylonia they adopted a narrow interpretation of Rav’s words. [In practice, reference to the Kingdom is required only for benedictions that either stand alone or start a series of benedictions.]</i>: Any benediction without mention of the Kingdom is no benediction.

Ḥanina let the reader finish and only afterwards asked him: Did you finish all that can be said about your Creator? This argument also is accepted by the Yerushalmi since the explanations of the verses that follow are based on the principle that God’s infinity cannot be expressed in finite words. In the Yerushalmi tradition, anyone who deviates from the pattern instituted by the Sages has to be stopped in the middle of his prayer.</i>: “The great God, the strong and awe-inspiring, the noble and overpowering;” they stopped him and told him: you are not permitted to add to the formula the Sages coined for benedictions. Rav Huna in the name of Rav: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Job 37:23" href="/Job.37.23"><i>Job</i> 37:23</a>) “The All-powerful, we did not find for Him the fullness of His might,” we did not find out the might and strength of the Holy One, praise to Him<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It is too much for finite man.</i>!

Saul Liebermann points out that the Tosephta may deal with a different period in Jewish history. In the Tosephta, the sequence ’L-’L is termed “not Jewish” and YH-’L as “ignorant.” He conjectures that the Tosephta is directed against sects similar to the Dead Sea sect in whose “Discipline of the community”, 1QS, one finds a formula: ברוך אתה אלי “Praise to You, my God (singular form).” (The prayer manual of the sect, 1QH, always uses the <i>ădônāi</i> as replacement for YHWH.) In the time of the Yerushalmi, such sects no longer existed.]</i>.
(Jewish) Christians asked Rebbi Simlai: How many aspects of divinity created the world? He answered them: Are you asking me? Go and ask the first Adam, as it is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 4:32" href="/Deuteronomy.4.32"><i>Deut.</i> 4:32</a>): “Please ask the first days etc<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“Please ask the first days that were before you, starting from the day that God created man on the earth …”</i>.” It does not say there “when gods created man on the earth” but “from the day that God created man on the earth”.

Rebbi Phineas said in the name of Rebbi Zeïra, flesh and blood has a protector.

Enemies come and grab him at the door of his protector’s courtyard. While he is crying and before someone could come out, the sword already passes over his neck and kills him.

Rebbi Tanḥuma said: A happening with a ship of Gentiles that sailed the great sea and on it was a Jewish child.

The child immediately got up with a full heart and cried; the Holy One, praise to Him, received his prayer and the sea quited down. When they came to dry land, each one descended to buy his needs.

But a good guest says, praised be the householder, may the householder be remembered in a good way! How much wine did he bring before me, how many cuts did he bring before me!

Yadin has pointed out, already in the Song of Deborah there is a reference to the tribe of Dan who “went to dwell on ships.” Rashi’s interpretation is that of the Talmudim (the parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 110a" href="/Bava_Batra.110a">Babli is <i>Bava Bathra</i> 110a</a>), since both have Jonathan (not just one of his descendants) alive and active at the time of David, about 300 years after the conquest of Laish by the tribe of Dan.</i>?

If a man came to sacrifice an ox, a sheep, or a goat to the idol and told him: Make it favorably inclined towards me, <i>he</i> would say: What use does it have for you? It neither sees, nor hears, nor eats, nor drinks, nor does good or evil, and does not talk.

When does one recite the benediction for commandments?

Yoḥanan overrode earlier Babylonian practices.</i>. Rav Huna said, when he does it. Rav Huna agrees with Samuel, since Rebbi Yose bar Abun said in the name of Samuel: All commandments need a benediction while one is doing them except blowing<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">The shofer on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, sine obviously one cannot blow and recite the benediction at the same time.</i> and immersion<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>miqweh</i>, when one is naked and forbidden to recite a benediction.

In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 7b" href="/Pesachim.7b">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 7b</a>), the statement about blowing and immersion is an addition to the statement that all benedictions must precede the action. It is clear that the mention of blowing in that context makes no sense; that statement is then dropped and only immersion is left for a benediction <i>after</i> the act. The Yerushalmi shows that in the Babli we have a later confluence of older (Rav Huna) Babylonian tradition with the adoption of Galilean (R.

But the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.1">Mishnah (<i>Qiddušin</i> 1:1</a>) lists sexual relations (in front of two witnesses) as a possible form of <i>qiddušin</i>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who enters a fortified place<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Greek χάραξ “palisade”. A Roman fortified camp with soldiers and police not under the control of the local authorities.</i> prays two prayers, one when he enters and one when he leaves. Ben Azai said four, two when he enters and two when he leaves. He gives thanks for the past and implores for the future.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “He who enters a fortified place says two prayers, one when he enters and one when he leaves.” What does he say when he enters? May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You will bring me into this fortress for peace. When he leaves, he says: May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, etc. “Ben Azai said four, two when he enters and two when he leaves.” When he is about to enter, he says: May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You will bring me into this fortress for peace. After he entered, he says: I thank You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that I entered in peace; so may it be Your pleasure that You will lead me out of it for peace. When he wants to leave, he says: May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You will lead me out from this fortress in peace. When he left, he says: I thank You, o Eternal, my God and God of my fathers, that You made me leave in peace; so may it be Your pleasure that You will lead me to my house for peace (or, to place X for peace.)<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">There are parallels to these prayers in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 6:16" href="/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).6.16">Tosephta (6:16</a>) and the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 60a" href="/Berakhot.60a">Babli (60a</a>). The Tosephta has only three prayers: Before entry, after entry and after exit. It is to be noted that in the version of the Yerushalmi, the prayer after entry really is also a prayer for safe exit and the third prayer repeats the second part of the prayer after safe entry. The printed version of the Babli has four prayers; the prayer after safe entry only gives thanks for that and is not a prospective prayer for safe exit. This would best be described by the words of Ben Azai. The Spanish print in <i>Śeridei Bavli</i> (Dimitrovsky) fol. 49 has only two prayers, corresponding to the opinion of the first Tanna in the Mishnah, which is disregarded in the other versions: “What does he say when he enters? May it be Your pleasure, o Eternal, my God, that you will let me leave this fortress for peace. When he left, he says: I thank You that You guided me out of this fortress for peace, and just as You led me out in peace, so let me travel in peace, lead me in peace, and save me from the hand of any enemy or ambush on the road. Praise to You, Eternal, Who listens to prayer.” The doxology that makes this a benediction is found only in the Spanish incunabula print and in <i>Kolbo</i> §87; it is expressly denied, in the tradition of the Babli, by Ravad (R. Abraham ben David of Posquières) in his critique of R.

The prayer has to be said only if there is an actual danger in entering the fortress. The difference between Gentile and Jewish populations is not in the Babli; there the problem is the question whether “one judges and kills” in the fortress. In the first version, one does not have to recite the benediction if there are courts that enforce the laws by executing criminals; in the second version one has to recite the prayer anyhow since the police, when confronted with an unsolved crime, might be tempted to frame a stranger who, not knowing any good local lawyer, is in grave danger of being convicted. By contrast, so the interpretation of R. Abraham al-Ashbili, the Yerushalmi recommends the prayer even at a Jewish place if lawless and criminal elements there can kill with impunity.</i>, if it is inhabited by Gentiles, but if it is inhabited by Jews, he does not have to recite the benedictions.

It is spelled out in the Torah many times that these obligations (the heave for the priests, tithes for the Levites and the poor, the Sabbatical Year, etc.) come into force “when you come to the Land and inherit it,” as duties on the land distributed as family heritage to the tribes by Moses and Joshua. These commandments became obsolete when the tribes were led into captivity, including the obligations of the remaining Israelite population of Galilee who, according to our sources, were never exiled and who reappear in history at the time of the Hasmonean revolt without any record of resettlement in Galilee. The continued obligation to observe the Laws that depend on the Land therefore is derived only from the voluntary covenant enacted by the people in the time of Ezra and Nehemia (<i>Shevi‘it</i> 6:1): “Rebbi Lezer says: they voluntarily accepted the duties of the tithes. Why do I say this? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 10:1" href="/Nehemiah.10.1"><i>Neh.</i> 10:1</a>) ‘With all this, we enact a written trust and covenant signed by our princes, Levites, and priests.’ How does R. Lezer explain the inclusion (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 10:37" href="/Nehemiah.10.37"><i>Neh.</i> 10:37</a>) of ‘the firstborn of our cattle and flocks’ [an obligation that does not depend on the Land and therefore is universal]? Since they accepted the obligations (of heave and tithes) that they could have avoided, Scripture gives them credit for those obligations which they had to fulfill anyhow as if they had accepted these also voluntarily.” The same idea is also expressed by an opponent of rabbinic Judaism who is reported (<i>Shevi‘it</i> 9:9) to have said: “<i>Ḥallah</i> (the heave to be taken from bread dough) is a biblical obligation (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:20" href="/Numbers.15.20"><i>Num.</i> 15:20</a>) but the Sabbatical year is now an obligation only by the authority of Rabban Gamliel and his colleagues.” [Cf. the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah,</i> p. 280–281, and <i>Seder Olam</i> p. 248–250.]</i>, etc.” What is: “<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Malachi 3:10" href="/Malachi.3.10"><i>Mal.</i> 3:10</a>: “Bring the full tithe into the (Temple) storehouse, so that there may be food in My House, test Me in this,” said the Eternal of Hosts, “if I will not open for you the skylights of heaven, and I shall pour out for you blessing until ‘without enough.’ ” The obligation accepted by the people on Earth without Heavenly Command gives Divine Reward.

Zeraḥiah Halevi to his <i>Maör haqaṭan,</i> who reads Hebrew חרשיא “plowings.” Since the roots חרש (Arabic חרת̇) “to plow” and חרש (Arabic ח̇רשׂ) “to be silent” are identical in Hebrew, both authors give the interpretation” silence” also to the Aramaic equivalent כרב. The author of <i>‘En Yaaqob</i> reads ברכייא, “blessings.” All these authors read first “bad” then “good” as in the preceding sentence; Rabbenu Jonah even quotes the sentence about silence as alternative reading for “small talk.” Many commentators write here that the sentence should be: All lies are bad and the lies of Torah are good, referring to lies such as Eliezer’s when he met Rebecca, first gave her gold rings and then inquired after her family but in his recital to them pretended to first having asked about her family and only afterwards given her the heavy gold jewelry, to keep within accepted norms of behavior.</i>.
