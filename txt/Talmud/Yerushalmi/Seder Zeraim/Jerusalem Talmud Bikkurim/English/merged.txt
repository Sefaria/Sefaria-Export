Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Some people bring First Fruits and make the declaration<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The thanksgiving declaration <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:5-10" href="/Deuteronomy.26.5-10"><i>Deut</i>. 26:5–10</a>. It is forbidden to bring profane food into the Temple. If there is no obligation to bring First Fruits then there is a prohibition to bring. If there is an obligation, a dedication must sanctify the First Fruits as Temple offerings.</i>, some bring and do not make the declaration, and some do not bring. The following do not bring<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The reason is explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 1:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.1.7.2">Mishnah 2</a>.</i>: He who plants in his own but provines<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">He bends a branch of a vine down into the earth and has it reappear elsewhere; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 7:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.7.1.1"><i>Kilaim</i> 7:1, Note 1</a>.</i> into a private or a public plot; and so he who provines from a private or a public plot into his own. If someone plants in his own and provines into his own but a private or public road is in the middle he cannot bring; Rebbi Jehudah says he brings.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Some people bring First Fruits and make the declaration,” etc. He who plants in his own but provines into a private or a public plot cannot bring even from the old tree<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The original one growing on his own property.</i>; he who provines from a private or a public plot into his own cannot bring even from the new tree. That means that just as the new lives off the old<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">While the buried branch will grow new roots, as long as a connection exists between the original vine and its offshoot, the internal flow of sap cannot be controlled. Since First Fruits have to be brought “from your land” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:2" href="/Deuteronomy.26.2"><i>Deut</i>. 26:2</a>), any roots of the tree have to be on the farmer’s own property.</i>, so the old lives off the new.
Rebbi Joḥanan said, in all cases they judged by the rules of robbers. Rebbi Yose said, that is what the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 1:2.</i> means: “Why can he not bring? Because it was said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:2" href="/Deuteronomy.26.2"><i>Deut</i>. 26:2</a>): ‘the beginning of the First Fruits of <i>your</i> land.’ ”
It was stated: If he provined with permission<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of the owner of the lot on which the original vine stood or into which the new vine is drawn.</i>, he brings and makes the declaration. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Ammi: Only if the permission was permanent, not temporary. Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Ammi: Even temporary. The force of Rebbi Jonah comes from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 2:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.2.10.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Batra</i> 2:12</a>. If somebody digs a cistern on his own property and in digging he comes upon roots from a neighbor’s tree, he may cut off these roots and keep the wood of the roots. In the Yerushalmi, <i>Baba Batra</i> 2:12, R. Assi in the name of R. Joḥanan holds that (invisible) roots do not influence the rules of First Fruits.</i>: “If somebody digs a cistern, a ditch, or a cave, he may cut down as he works and the wood is his.” Is the wood not as if temporary? What does Rebbi Yose do with this? Roots always regrow; since roots do regrow it is as if permanent. Rebbi Mana said, the statement of Rebbi Joḥanan supports my father<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jonah.</i>, as Rebbi Joḥanan said in all cases they judged by the rules of robbers. In our case, if he gave permission to provine even temporarily, the proviner is not a robber<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">First fruits can always be brought if the farmer does not make illegitimate use of public or other people’s private property.</i>.
Rebbi Zeriqan asked before Rebbi Zeïra: Is the Mishnah Rebbi’s since Rebbi said, all roots live off one another<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>‘Orlah</i> 1:1, Note 39.</i>? He said to him, it is everybody’s opinion. Here, the Torah said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:2" href="/Deuteronomy.26.2"><i>Deut</i>. 26:2</a>): “the beginning of the First Fruits of <i>your</i> land,” that all growth be from <i>your</i> land.
In the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah, what is the difference between him who plants on his own property and provines into a private person’s and him who plants on his own and provines into his own and a private road is in between<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the first case, R. Jehudah agrees that he cannot bring First Fruits but in the second case he permits bringing.</i>? Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Miasha, when he provined through a gourd or a pipe<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He tunnels under the ground which is not his and shields the branch there either by a clay or metal pipe or by threading it through a pumpkin serving as a pipe. Since no roots can grow there, he does not steal from the owner of the path and is not disqualified as a robber.</i>. If he provined through a gourd or a pipe he should bring and make the declaration! Even according to the rabbis he should bring and make the declaration<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">R. Aḥa’s solution is rejected.</i>! Rebbi Jonah said, Rebbi Jehudah had a problem. If somebody sells a path to another person<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">But he retains ownership of the fields on both sides of the path.</i>, does he sell him the place where the foot treads or does he sell him down to the abyss? If you say, he sold the place where the foot treads, he brings and makes the declaration. If you say, he sold down to the abyss, he should not bring at all. Because of the doubt he brings but does not make the declaration<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since R. Jehudah mentions only bringing but not making the declaration.</i>. For the rabbis it is obvious that he sold down to the abyss. Where do they differ? When he sells a path to another person. But if he sold him a field and reserved a path for himself, everybody agrees that he reserved for himself down to the abyss<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If he extends branches under the path, it is still in his property.</i>.
In the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah, what is the difference between him who plants on his own property and provines into the public domain and him who plants on his own and provines into his own and a public road is in between? Rebbi Ammi said, Rebbi Jehudah holds with Rebbi Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The teacher of his father R. Ilaï.</i>, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 3:11:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.3.11.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Batra</i> 3:12</a>.</i>: “One may not make a cavity under the public domain, cisterns, ditches, or caverns. Rebbi Eliezer permits it if a truck loaded with stones can pass over it.” As Rebbi Eliezer said there, under the public domain, it is his, so Rebbi Jehudah said here, under the public domain, it is his. Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac asked, if it follows Rebbi Eliezer, he should bring and make the declaration. Rebbi Yose said, Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac thought that Rebbi Eliezer permits to do that and it remains his permanent property, but Rebbi Eliezer permits to do that but anybody quick to acquire does acquire it<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A cavity under the public domain cannot be appropriated for the exclusive use of a private person. Therefore, it may be legal to provine under the public domain but the provined plant is not exclusively in the vintner’s domain.<br>The statement of R. Eliezer is not discussed in Yerushalmi <i>Baba Batra</i>. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 60a" href="/Bava_Batra.60a">Babli (<i>Baba Batra</i> 60a</a>) holds that the anonymous Tanna would agree with R. Eliezer if the safety of the road could be guaranteed for all times without maintenance. This cannot be the opinion of the Yerushalmi.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Why can he not bring? Because it was said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:2" href="/Deuteronomy.26.2"><i>Deut</i>. 26:2</a>): “You shall bring the beginning of the First Fruits of <i>your</i> land,” that all the growth should be from your land. For the same reason sharecroppers, tenant farmers, <i>sicarii</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Knife-wielding robbers who take deeds of property as ransom for the lives of the property owners. The <i>sicarii</i> mentioned in this Mishnah obviously are Jews; in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.7.1">Mishnah <i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:6</a> the <i>sicarii</i> are Gentiles.</i>, and robbers cannot bring, since it is said: “The beginning of the First Fruits of <i>your</i> land.”
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> So far if he robbed the real estate. If he robbed a vine and planted it, does he not owe money<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">If the owners gave up hope to recover the robbed object, the robber becomes the legal owner. The transfer of ownership imposes on the robber the obligation to pay for it. Before giving up hope, the owners could have sued for the return of the stolen object; after they gave up hope but the circumstances changed and made a suit possible, they can only sue for damages. The next paragraph will make clear that this is the situation here.</i>? But the rabbis have a problem: do commandments follow the rules of Temple sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">These rules are stricter than those governing other obligations.</i> or not? If you say they are like Temple sacrifices he may not bring<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Wayiqra Paršata</i> 5(2), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 67b" href="/Bava_Kamma.67b">Babli <i>Baba Qama</i> 67b</a>: <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 1:10" href="/Leviticus.1.10"><i>Lev</i>. 1:10</a>, “If <i>his</i> sacrifice is from the flock” implies that robbed animals cannot become sacrifices.</i>; if you say they are not like Temple sacrifices he may bring. Everybody agrees that from a worshipped tree which was damaged<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">If one of the prior worshippers of the tree damages it in a manner inadmissible in pagan worship, the tree loses is idolatrous status and becomes profanely usable. But if at any time it was forbidden for the Jewish altar it remains forbidden since in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 10:35" href="/Nehemiah.10.35"><i>Neh</i>. 10:35</a> the supply of firewood for the altar is called a “sacrifice.”</i> one cannot bring logs for the altar fire. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked, may he take a <i>lulav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The palm frond used on the Holiday of Tabernacles. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 47a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.47a">Babli, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 47a</a>, this is R. Simeon ben Laqish’s question in the interpretation of Rav Dimi. In his interpretation, the rules of sacrifices require that anything inadmissible at some time is always inadmissible; clearly this is not the case for any non-sacrificial use.</i> from it? Do commandments follow the rules of Temple sacrifices or not? If you say they are like Temple sacrifices he may not take; if you say they are not like Temple sacrifices he may take. It is obvious that he may take a <i>lulav</i> from it<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 26b" href="/Moed_Katan.26b">Babli (<i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 26b</a>) makes a difference between things used for commandments (such as a <i>lulav</i>) and holy things (such as a Torah scroll). Things used for commandments may be discarded after use; holy things which can no longer be used must be buried just as damaged Temple stones must be buried. It is possible that the Yerushalmi agrees with this distinction.</i> and commandments are not like Temple sacrifices. May he bring First Fruits? According to Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The disagreement between R. Jehudah and the Sages is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 3:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.3.6.1">Mishnah 3:10</a>.</i> who compares them to country sacred food<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Sacred food to be consumed by the Cohen in purity anywhere in the Land, i. e., heave, heave of the tithe, and <i>ḥallah</i>.</i> he may bring; according to the rabbis who compare them to Temple sacrifices he may not bring.
So far about a robbery when the owners did not give up hope<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">he hope to recover the real estate taken from them.</i>. Even about a robbery when the owners did give up hope? They thought to say that we can hear it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 2:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.2.2.1">Mishnah 2:2</a>, which states among other rules that heave applies to sharecroppers, tenant farmers, buyers of expropriated property, and robbers.</i>: “This applies to heave and tithe but not to First Fruits.” For what is this needed? Not for a robbery when the owners did not give up hope, but for a robbery when the owners did give up hope<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Most commentators want to switch the two cases, against all ms. evidence, misreading the rhetorical quality of the multiple negations.</i>? Even for heave he did not do anything, as we stated<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 1:6" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).1.6">Tosephta <i>Terumot</i> 1:6</a> and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 67a" href="/Bava_Kamma.67a">Babli <i>Baba Qama</i> 67a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 114" href="/Bava_Kamma.114">114a/b</a>.</i>: “A strongman<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">His quality is not defined; he might be anything from a kidnapper to a corrupt politician.</i>, a thief, or a robber, as long as the owners pursue them, their heave is no heave, his tithes no tithes, and their dedications no dedications. If the owners do not pursue them, their heave is heave, their tithes are tithes, and their dedications dedications.” Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Neither of them can give heave<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As the Babli explains, the robber cannot give because it is not his and the owners cannot give because it is not in their possession.</i>. Rebbi Ammi in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Even if the owners declare heave, it is no heave. Rebbi Yose said, so far we deal with a robbery when the owners did not give up hope. Then why did we state: “This applies to heave and tithe but not to First Fruits”? It is possible for fruits to be usable without First Fruits. It is impossible for fruits to be usable without heave and tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah does not state that Jewish robbers, etc., have to give heave but that the rules of heave and tithes apply to them. Since they cannot give heave, they never can eat the produce of the land they robbed. On the other hand, produce may be eaten of a crop from which First Fruits were not given.</i>! But a robbery when the owners did give up hope remains a question<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Whether First Fruits may be brought from this land.</i>.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not bring First Fruits except from the Seven Kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The fruits enumerated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:8" href="/Deuteronomy.8.8"><i>Deut</i>. 8:8</a>; cf. <i>Berakhot</i> 6, Notes 15, 151.</i>, nor from mountain dates, nor from valley fruits<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Grapes, figs, pomegranates and olives. These grow better in the hills; dates grow best in the Jordan valley. The requirement of “best quality” applies to all First Fruits.</i>, nor from oil olives which are not best quality. One may not bring First Fruits before Pentecost. <sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The remainder of the Mishnah is also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 4:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.4.5.1">Mishnah <i>Ḥallah</i> 4:11</a>; Notes 172,173.</i> The people from Hyena Mountain brought their First Fruits before Pentecost but they did not accept from them because of the verse in the Torah: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:16" href="/Exodus.23.16">Ex. 23:16</a>) “The pilgrimage holiday of harvest, the First Fruits of your work from sowing the field.”
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text in <i>Sifra</i> <i>Deut</i>. 197(2), a third version in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 84b" href="/Menachot.84b">Babli <i>Menaḥot</i> 84b</a>.</i>“One does not bring First Fruits”, etc. If it were written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:2" href="/Deuteronomy.26.2"><i>Deut</i>. 26:2</a>): “You shall take the First Fruits of your land”, I would have said that all kinds should be obligated for First Fruits. The verse says,“<i>from</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">As always, prefix מ is read as partitive.</i> the First Fruits”, not all firsts. If “from the first” and not all first, then you have only wheat and barley. The verse says “fruits of your land”; this is inclusive. Does it include everything? Here<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:2" href="/Deuteronomy.26.2"><i>Deut</i>. 26:2</a>.</i> “your land” has been said; at another place<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:8" href="/Deuteronomy.8.8"><i>Deut</i>. 8:8</a>.</i> “the Land of wheat and barley” has been said. Since “land” mentioned there deals with the Seven Kinds, so also “land” mentioned in this verse must deal with the Seven Kinds.
<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph and the following explain expressions used in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:8" href="/Deuteronomy.8.8"><i>Deut.</i> 8:8</a>.</i>“Oil olives” that is <i>agory</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 17:8" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.17.8">Gaonic commentary to <i>Kelim</i> 17:8</a>, the reading is איגורי. The kind of olive, the main example of a mid-sized olive, is called after a place Egor as the suffix <i>-y</i> shows. The etymology, in the name of R. Abbahu, is also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 39a" href="/Berakhot.39a">Babli <i>Berakhot</i> 39a</a>.</i>. Rebbi Ammi in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, that is the Avaritic<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently after an Egyptian city Avaris, mentioned by Manetho. In Babli <i>Berakhot</i>, the readings are אברוסי, אברוסי, סמרוסי, סברוסי, סמדוסי Cf. I. Löw in Krauss <i>Lehnwörter</i> p. 7; S. Liebermann, <i>Tosefta ki-Fshutah</i> p. 332.</i>. Why is it called <i>agory</i>? Because it stores its oil inside. Do all other olives lose their oil? Rebbi Ḥanina said, all other olives will leach their oil if rains fall on them but this one stores its oil inside.
“And honey”. This refers to dates. Rebbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar: It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="II Chronicles 31:5" href="/II_Chronicles.31.5"><i>2Chr</i>. 31:5</a>) “When the thing expanded, the Children of Israel did increase the first gifts<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Heave and tithes.</i> of grain, cider, oil, and honey.” Is honey subject to tithes? But this refers to dates which are subject to tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Date syrup. This argument would extend the biblical duty of tithes from grain, wine, and oil to all Seven Kinds.</i>.
Rebbi Berekhiah in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman: Why is “Land, Land” written twice<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 8:8" href="/Deuteronomy.8.8">Deut. 8:8</a>:</i> A <i>Land</i> of wheat and barley, and vine, and fig tree, and pomegranate, a <i>Land</i> of the oil-olive and honey.</i>? To tell you that a house stands only on these two things<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The necessities of life are wheat and olive oil.</i>. Why are [the others] included? Rebbi Jehuda ben Rebbi and Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥman, one says for benedictions<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Explained <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 6:4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.6.4.5"><i>Berakhot</i> 6:4, Notes 150–151</a>, where this opinion is labelled “Babylonian”.</i>, the other says for measures<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 4" href="/Eruvin.4">Babli, <i>Eruvin</i> 4a/b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sukkah 5b" href="/Sukkah.5b"><i>Sukkah</i> 5b</a>, this is reported in the name of the Babylonian Rav Ḥanin. The seven measures are: I. A person entering a leprous house is severely impure only if he remains long enough that he could have eaten a slice of wheat bread (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:47" href="/Leviticus.14.47"><i>Lev</i>. 14:47</a>). 2. A fragment of a human bone the size of a barley corn imparts impurity. 3. A quarter <i>log</i> of wine drunk by a <i>nazir</i> makes him subject to punishment. As a derivative, a quarter <i>log</i> of wine is the minimum for legal obligations. 4. Somebody carrying food in the volume of a dried fig from private to public domain on the Sabbath is guilty of desecrating the Sabbath. 5. A vessel having a pomegranate-sized hole is unusable and freed from the impurity of vessels. 6. The volume of an olive is the standard for most rules involving solid food. 7. Eating food in the volume of a dried date on the Day of Atonement is a desecration of the day.</i>. He who says for benedictions is understandable. He who says for measures, did we not state: “A shiny mark the size of half a bean<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:1-8" href="/Leviticus.13.1-8"><i>Lev</i>. 13:1–8</a>, Mishnah <i>Nega‘im</i> 6:1.. A smaller lesion does not make impure.</i>”? That is not reliable<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The size of the lesion does not mean anything in itself. Even if the lesion is larger, if it does not grow after being seen by the Cohen it does not make impure. If it is smaller but seen by the Cohen and then spreads, there is impurity. (Explanation of <i>Pene Moshe</i>). Another interpretation would be that this and the next measure are not standardized.</i>. “The size of a lentil from a crawling thing”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 17:6" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.17.6">Mishnah <i>Kelim</i> 17:6</a>.

That is not reliable<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">An integral limb makes impure even if it is smaller than a lentil.</i>.
The following is obvious: If somebody dedicated First Fruits not from the Seven Kinds it was not sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The thanksgiving declaration <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:5-10" href="/Deuteronomy.26.5-10"><i>Deut</i>. 26:5–10</a>. It is forbidden to bring profane food into the Temple. If there is no obligation to bring First Fruits then there is a prohibition to bring. If there is an obligation, a dedication must sanctify the First Fruits as Temple offerings.</i>. Where is there a disagreement? About mountain dates and valley fruits. Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Assi in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: They were not sanctified. Rebbi Hila in the name of Rebbi Immi: Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish disagree. Rebbi Joḥanan said they were not sanctified, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said they were sanctified. Rebbi Jonah said, the reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish is that if somebody transgressed and gave heave from bad for good produce, his heave is heave<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 2:6.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, we have heard that bad produce is subject to tithes; did we hear that bad produce is subject to First Fruits?<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The argument of R. Jonah is disproved.</i> A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Yose: “One does not bring [fruits] from Sepphoris<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">On a hilltop.</i> and Bet Shean<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In a deep valley. It is not specified why fruits from these two places are unacceptable as First Fruits.</i>, and if he brought they are not sanctified.” Rebbi Zeïra said, but there it is stated: “Figs pierced on the branch and grapes dusted and smoked<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Mishnah <i>Ševi‘it</i> 2:2.</i> one does not bring. But one brings bat <i>šeba</i> figs<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">White figs, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.1.1"><i>Demay</i> 1, Note 5</a>.

Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose, both in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac: The Mishnah speaks of a proselyte of the descendants of the Qenite, the relative of Moses by marriage, since the descendants of the Qenite, the relative of Moses by marriage, bring and make the declaration, as it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 10:29" href="/Numbers.10.29"><i>Num.</i> 10:29</a>): “Go with us and we shall treat you well.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bikkurim (Lieberman) 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Bikkurim_(Lieberman).1.2">Tosephta 1:2</a>: “Rebbi Jehudah said, all proselytes bring but do not make the declaration, except that a Qenite proselyte brings and makes the declaration.” This contradicts the opinion given here that a Qenite proselyte can make the declaration only if he is the son of a Jewish mother.<br>The problem is, why should the proselyte, son of a Jewish mother (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 1:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.1.4.3">Note 68</a>), be able to make the declaration? He would not be able to declare “that the Eternal had sworn to our forefathers to give us” since the Land was distributed to males only. The daughters of Ẓelofḥad could inherit only as sole heirs of their father who was of those counted at the Exodus; the Land was never promised to the females. But since the family of Jithro were invited by Moses to join the Israelites and received part of the Land (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Judges 1:16" href="/Judges.1.16"><i>Jud.</i> 1:16</a>), a Qenite can declare “that the Eternal had sworn to give us” from his father’s side and “to our forefathers’ from the mother’s. {The hypothesis that the Qenites were not considered as Israelites at the conquest is difficult to accept.}</i>” Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Eleazar did not say so<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">They do not disagree with the statement of R.

Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac said, explain it by the proselyte mentioned here<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 5 in its entirety only deals with Qenites.

Rebbi Yose said, Benjamin bar Astor explained it before Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: The Mishnah deals with a Gentile who had forbidden intercourse with a Jewish woman<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Torah in many places requires that the proselyte and the natural born Jew be equal in rights and duties, the proselyte mentioned here cannot be the child of a proselyte who by converting became a 100% Jew.

In similar situations, the Babli explains the rules to refer to a child of proselytes whose mother was pregnant when the parents converted. In that case, the child is Jewish but not the child of Jewish parents since at conception the parents were Gentile. E. g., if born on a Sabbath, if such a child is a male he cannot be circumcized on the Sabbath. Since a solution is chosen here which seems to contradict <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.10.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 3:12</a>, one might infer that the Yerushalmi determines the status of the baby not by the status of the parents at conception (whose time is impossible to determine exactly) but at birth.</i>. Rebbi Jonah did not say so, but: Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that a name has disappeared here.</i> heard those of the family bar Astor, who were proselytes, children of proselytes<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The child of a Jewish mother is automatically Jewish.

That means, not proselytes children of proselytes! Rebbi Yose said, Benjamin bar Astor explained it before Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Benjamin bar Astor explained it before us: The Mishnah deals with a Gentile who had forbidden intercourse with a Jewish woman.
Rebbi Zeriqan said, Rebbi Zeïra asked: Do they not refer to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob their forefathers?

Then the farmer holds the basket by its handles, the Cohen puts his hands under the basket and weaves it (as required by the anonymous <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.2.3.1">Mishnah 2:4</a>). Only after that, the declaration 26:5–10 is made and the basket deposited near the altar. For R. Jehudah, the first “putting down” is into the hands of the Cohen, the second on the floor. For him, both mentions are necessary.<br>The other sources more or less follow R. Jehudah. <i>Sifry</i> <i>Deut</i>. #300 infers from 26:4, “you shall put it down before the altar of the Eternal, your God”, that in the absence of an altar there cannot be any obligation of First Fruits. In #301 it is inferred from the double mention of “putting down” that there are two, one for the declaration and one for the subsequent prostration.<br>The late <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> (Pseudo Jonathan) translates 26:4: “The Cohen shall take the basket from your hand, <i>move it forward and backward, upward</i> <i>and downward</i>, and <i>at the end</i> put it down before the altar of the Eternal, your God.” The first inserted text describes the “weaving” required by R. Jehudah. Verse 10 is translated without addition: “… put it down before the Eternal, your God, and prostrate yourself before the Eternal, your God.”</i>. For Rebbi Judah who said it had to be repeated, because it applies to everybody<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Jehudah the two mentions of “putting down” are needed in the description of the ceremony. For him, accepting First Fruits from a person who cannot recite is a rabbinic interpretation, unsupported by the biblical text.</i>. For the rabbis who instruct that it did not need to be repeated, because it was repeated<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Since for them there is only one “putting down”; the double mention is for emphasis.</i>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who buys two trees on another’s property brings but does not make the declaration; Rebbi Meїr says he brings and makes the declaration<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The standard contract (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 5:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.5.1.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Batra</i> 5:4</a>) about buying trees implies that the ground on which the trees stand is sold with the trees only if the transaction involves at least three trees in one orchard.

In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 81a" href="/Bava_Batra.81a">Babli, <i>Baba Batra</i> 81a</a> the matter is decided, that R.

Rebbi Yose said, it is everybody’s opinion since fruits of a tree are also fruits of the soil but fruits of the soil are not fruits of the tree.
Rebbi Abun bar Cahana asked before Rebbi Hila: If somebody sold him a field with its standing crop, may the buyer bring First Fruits? He said to him, why not? That is, when it is moist; even when it is dry<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">If the grain is totally dry at the moment of sale and does not ripen in the possession of the buyer.</i>?

The following is obvious: If somebody sold the harvest and retained the land for himself, the seller cannot bring since he has no harvest. If he bought it back? Let us hear from the following: “If he gave her dedicated things they are permitted; wines, oils, flour, or anything of a kind admissible near the altar, are prohibited<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Similar statements, in different order, are <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Temurah 6:4" href="/Mishnah_Temurah.6.4">Mishnah <i>Temurah</i> 6:4</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Temurah 4:2" href="/Tosefta_Temurah.4.2">Tosephta <i>Temurah</i> 4:7</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Temurah 4:2" href="/Tosefta_Temurah.4.2">9</a>.

This implies that the prostitute was paid in kind; if she is paid in money then what she buys with that money is not prohibited.

If he gave her<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Fruits or grains admissible as First Fruits.</i> as whore’s wages, do we say that the buyer on the market brings First Fruits?

Therefore, if they were not whore’s wages she might bring. That means, if he bought back he may bring.

Halakhah 7

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If he dedicated his First Fruits and then sold his field he brings but does not make the declaration. The other person cannot bring from the same kind, but from another kind he brings and makes the declaration. Rebbi Jehudah says, he may bring and make the declaration from the same kind.<br>If he dedicated his First Fruits and then they rotted, were robbed, stolen, lost, or became impure, he brings others in their stead.

So is the Mishnah: “They forbid in Jerusalem in the most minute amount; Rebbi Simeon permits.

Even though it is stated in Mishnah <i>Terumot</i>9:4 that growth from First Fruits or second tithe is profane, this holds only outside of Jerusalem.

Also by the unauthorized or by animals does Rebbi Simeon permit.” Do not the rabbis agree with him since he asked them<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">In a <i>baraita</i> not otherwise transmitted.</i>: Do you not agree that if they are permitted for the unauthorized, they are permitted as animal feed? Does one need walls<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Food that has to be consumed in the holy precinct outside the Temple domain must be consumed inside the city walls (possibly defined as the walls of the city in First Temple times.) Since growth from dedicated seeds is intrinsically profane and does not need city walls if used as animal feed, walls are not needed and the restriction to those authorized is without basis (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Pesachim 34a:2:1" href="/Tosafot_on_Pesachim.34a.2.1"><i>Tosafot Pesaḥim</i> 34a, <i>s. v.</i> טהרו</a>).</i> for unauthorized eating or for feeding animals? Just as one does not need walls for unauthorized eating, one does not need walls for feeding animals! The rabbis say, they made Jerusalem something which has no possibility to become permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis agree that R.

The language of the Babli is straightforward: For something which may become permitted without invoking the rules of insignificance (1 in 60, 100, or 200), those rules were not instituted. The standard example is that of an egg freshly laid on the Sabbath which is not food prepared for the Sabbath but becomes automatically permitted at the end of the Sabbath. If such an egg disappears in a barrel containing 1’000 eggs, all are forbidden for use until the end of the Sabbath.<br>The language of the Yerushalmi, “something which has no possibility to become permitted”, presupposes the knowledge of the rule: If the rules of insignificance were not instituted for a certain case, they are not applicable even in the case of the smallest possible admixture. Since First Fruits and second tithe can be eaten in Jerusalem, they are always permitted for authorized people and are therefore “something which has no possibility to become permitted”.</i>. Anything which has no possibility to become permitted prohibits in the most minute amounts; similarly, Jerusalem prohibits in the most minute amounts.
About what do Rebbi Simeon and the rabbis disagree? About growth. But in mixtures even Rebbi Simeon agrees. What is the difference between growth and mixtures? In mixtures all exists. In growth it already has disappeared. Where Rebbi Simeon agrees with the rabbis is in mixtures of tithe, but mixtures of First Fruits are treated like growth.

He said to him, but did we not state<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumah</i> 9:6.</i>: “What is one whose seeds do not disappear?

Rebbi Joḥanan’s argument seems inverted. There<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">It is unknown what this statement refers to. Since the tentative explanation of R. Eliahu Fulda is the only one not based on emendation of the text, it is followed here. The statement of R. Joshua ben Levi is based on the explanation of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:28" href="/Exodus.21.28"><i>Ex.</i> 21:28</a> given in <i>Mekhilta deR. Simeon ben Ioḥai</i> which contains the teachings of Ḥizqia, the teacher of R. Joshua ben Levi and the young R. Johanan (ed. Epstein-Melamed, p. 178): “If an ox gores a man or a woman and they die, the ox should be stoned, its meat may not be eaten, and the owner of the ox is free.” If the ox is stoned, it becomes a carcass whose meat is forbidden anyhow; why the remark “its meat may not be eaten”? This means that if the ox has been condemned in court to be stoned but the owners slaughtered it before execution, the meat is still forbidden. What does mean: “The owner of the ox is free”? Ben Azai said, he is freed from his property; the entire animal is forbidden for all usufruct. On that, R. Joshua ben Levi adds that not only the meat but (hide and) horns are forbidden even if it died before slaughter. R. Joḥanan objects and notes that if the verse deals with two cases (stoned or slaughtered), the rules have to apply to both. In the case of R. Joshua ben Levi this means that the verse is needed to forbid hide and horns also for a correctly slaughtered ox; therefore, one does not understand why he did not object to R. Yannai that both second tithe and First Fruits should have the same rules.</i>, Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, it was quoted for the horns of a cadaver. He said to him, did the teacher not teach: “I saw” the size of two beans<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">This deals with the impurity of houses by mold disease (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:33-57" href="/Leviticus.14.33-57"><i>Lev.</i> 14:33–57</a>). Mold disease is considered impure if it is the size of a Cilician bean. It is said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:35" href="/Leviticus.14.35"><i>v</i>. 35</a>) that the owner has to tell the Cohen, “like <i>a</i> plague it appears to me in the house.” But since it is written in <i>v</i>. 37 that the Cohen has to see “the plague in the <i>walls</i> of the house”, the house is impure only if two impurities appear, each of the size of a bean.</i>? Should he have said here also, “their growths”?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A citron<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">The fruit of the tree <i>Citrus medica var. cedrata.</i> In Mishnah <i>Ma‘serot</i> 1:4 (Note 86), citron is enumerated among vegetables, showing that the position of Rabban Gamliel is accepted as practice. The problem is that the fruit may stay on the tree for several years; therefore, the time of the budding of the fruit should not determine its status as required for fruits of a tree, whether it is subject to second tithe (in years 1,2,4,5 of the Sabbatical cycle) or to tithe of the poor (in years 3,6). R. Eliezer requires the owner of the orchard to collect fruits from different years in separate batches.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How does one designate First Fruits? A person comes into his field and there sees an early ripening fig, an early ripening bunch of grapes, an early ripening pomegranate; he binds them with bast and says, “these are First Fruits.” Rebbi Simeon says, nevertheless he repeats and calls them First Fruits after they have been separated from the ground.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “How does one designate First Fruits? Etc.” In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon, if he did not call them when they were picked they are not sanctified, they do not create <i>dema‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">If they are mixed with profane fruits and are unrecognizable, the mixture is permitted to laymen.</i>, one is not required to add a fifth<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If misappropriated, the amount of restitution has to be 100%, not 125%.</i>, and one is not whipped for them outside the wall<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If eaten outside the city walls of Jerusalem.</i>.

Even unripe grapes, even unripe figs! In the opinion of Rebbi Simeon, since at the moment of presentation it must be a fruit, so also at the moment of dedication it must be a fruit.
Rebbi Zeïra asked: Do First Fruits of a grafted branch permit what is budding<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If a grafted branch produces already recognizable fruits while the tree stump only has buds, does designating a fruit from the graft prevent you from designating later a fruit of the original tree?
