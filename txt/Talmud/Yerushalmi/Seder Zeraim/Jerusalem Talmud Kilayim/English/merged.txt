Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Wheat and <i>zěwānîn</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Arabic זִוַאן, זֻוַאן, זַוַאן defined in the dictionaries as “<i>Lolium temulentum L</i>., tare, darnel grass.” E. and H. Hareubeni, in a memoir dedicated to זונין (<i>Tarbiẓ</i> 10, 1939, 172–189), indicate that the same name is also used in many places for <i>Cephalaria Syriaca L</i>.; the common denominator of the two very different plants is that they are weeds and their seeds spoil the flour if they are ground with it. The grains produced by <i>Lolium</i> are light gray; if infected by a fungus they become dark and poisonous. <i>Lolium</i> belongs to the same family as most grains. It is used as fodder for chickens. <i>Cephalaria</i> is a grass from the family of dipsaceas. Its grains are almost black, about the size of a wheat kernel, and are poisonous to humans but eagerly eaten by pigeons. One has to wonder whether the word could also designate grain blight, whose poison is generated by a fungus just as that of <i>Lolium</i>.<br>Maimonides defines זונין as a kind of inedible wheat; this could indicate blight. <i>Arukh</i> explains by Italian <i>niella</i>, “black kernels.” This translation would fit both <i>Cephalaria</i> and grain blight. The Hareubenis report that in the Arabic of Galilee and Syria, the same word שַׁילַם denotes <i>Lolium</i>,<i>Cephalaria</i>, and blight.</i> are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other. Barley and fox tail<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides defines this as “prairie barley,” R. Asher and R. Obadia from Bertinoro as (Spanish and Italian) <i>avena</i> “oats.”</i>, spelt and oats<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Asher defines as French <i>seigle</i>, “rye,” following Rashi and Rabbenu Gershom to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 35a" href="/Pesachim.35a">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i>35a</a>. Maimonides: “prairie wheat.” Arukh: <i>espelda</i> (modern Italian <i>spelta</i>) “spelt.” The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 70b" href="/Menachot.70b">Babli <i>Menaḥot</i> 70b</a> defines שיפון by Aramaic דישרא which can be compared either to Syriac/Arabic دوس “<i>aegilops</i>, barley darnel” (which would parallel זונין for wheat) or to Accadic <i>dišarru</i> “a kind of grain, oats, or rye.”</i>, beans<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew and Arabic used only for beans not eaten with their pods, mostly <i>vicia faba</i>.</i> and Indian peas<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides: Arabic מאש <i>Phaseolus maximus L</i>.

Arukh: Arabic גֻלֻבָּאן <i>Lathyrus sativus</i>.</i> and fava beans and green beans<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Eaten for their pods. Maimonides: Arabic לוּבִּיָא “beans.”</i> are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This refers separately to each group of two plants connected by “and”.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It is written: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a>) “you should not sow your field <i>kilaim</i>;” I could think, even two kinds of wheat or two kinds of barley. “You should not breed your animals <i>kilaim</i>;” I could think, even black on white cattle, or white on black cattle. “And <i>kilaim</i> cloth, שעטנז, should not be worn by you;” I could think, even two kinds of wool or two kinds of linen. It was made explicit about garments, (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:11" href="/Deuteronomy.22.11"><i>Deut</i>. 22:11</a>) “do not wear שעטנז, wool and linen together.” Just as for garments where I forbade you two kinds, neither one is of the genus of the other, so <i>kilaim</i> that I forbade you at any place, neither one is of the genus of the other.
“Wheat and <i>zĕwānîn</i> are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other.” Hence, with barley they would constitute <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Hareubenis note that neither <i>Cephalaria</i> nor <i>Lolium</i> grow in barley fields since the larger leaves of the barley obstruct the sunlight they need for growth. Hence, the question is theoretical.</i>. “Wheat and <i>zĕwānîn</i> are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other;” could anybody err about something that is not food and state it as <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since one may not sow one’s field <i>kilaim</i>, the prohibition refers only to crops that are raised by the farmer and excludes weeds.</i>? Rebbi Abba bar Zavda said, because there are places where they are collected as food for pigeons<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This applies only to <i>Cephalaria</i>, not to <i>Lolium</i>. It might apply to blighted wheat.</i>. Rebbi Abba bar Zavda said, this follows Rebbi Eliezer, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 5:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.5.7.1">Mishnah 5:8</a>. That text reads: “But the Sages say, nothing becomes forbidden unless it is allowed to grow.”</i>: “If somebody lets thorns grow in his vineyard, they become ‘sanctified’, the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, they do not become ‘sanctified’.” Rabbi Abbahu said, the reason of Rebbi Eliezer is that at some places in Arabia one stores them for camels<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">There, thorns may represent a cash crop. (One might wonder why Arabia, not a place where <i>kilaim</i> are forbidden, should be of interest here.<br>But since practice does not follow R. Eliezer, a discussion is not necessary.) The statement is quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 134b" href="/Shabbat.134b">Babli <i>Šabbat</i>134b</a>, in the name of R. Ḥanina.</i>. Does this imply that the Sages think that there are no places in Arabia where one stores them for the camels? Let them check it out! The Sages say, where one stores them they are forbidden, but at places where one does not store them they are permitted. But Rebbi Abba bar Zavda cannot follow Rebbi Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since practice does not follow Rebbi Eliezer in his disputes with the Sages, and our Mishnah is anonymous, the Mishnah cannot be explained as being R. Eliezer’s.</i>! There, people do not transport horns<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simson reads קוֹצִים “thorns;” this is appropriate here. The two manuscripts of the Yerushalmi read קרנים “horns,” which is difficult but not impossible since most points of thorns are horn-shaped.</i> from place to place. But here, people do transport <i>zewānîn</i> from place to place<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">At places in the Holy Land, <i>zĕwānîn</i> are an object of trade and, hence, a cash crop subject to the rules of <i>kilaim</i>. This was still found true by the Hareubenis in the early 1930’s.</i>.
If so<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>zĕwānîn</i> can be a cash crop, they should be <i>kilaim</i> with anything that is not their own kind.</i>, should they not be <i>kilaim</i> with wheat? Rebbi Jonah said, they are a kind of wheat but the fruits went astray<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This certainly fits blight, but <i>Lolium</i> also belongs to the same family (<i>gramineae</i>) as wheat and rye.</i>. As it was stated: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:29" href="/Leviticus.19.29"><i>Lev</i>. 19:29</a>) “The Land should not go whoring,” from here that produce may go astray.
Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi asked before Rebbi Jeremiah: Is our Mishnah from Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose? As it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 4:6" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).4.6">Tosephta <i>Terumot</i> 4:6</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 4:7" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).4.7">7</a>, this appears in a different formulation: “Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose says in the name of his father that one may take heave from wine on vinegar but not from vinegar on wine. Even if one gives heave, one gives only in proportion. {That means, one gives enough vinegar that it would equal in value the wine which should have been given.} If somebody gives an amphora of wine as heave and it turns out to be vinegar, when it was known that it was vinegar before he gave the heave, it is not heave. But if it turned into vinegar after it was given, it is heave. In case of doubt it is heave and he should give heave a second time, the words of Rebbi, who says that wine and vinegar are two distinct kinds, but the Sages say, it is one kind.”</i>: “Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose says in the name of his father that one may take heave from wine on vinegar but not from vinegar on wine. If somebody transgressed, his heave is heave. Rebbi says that wine and vinegar are two distinct kinds and one does not give heave nor does one tithe from one on the other.” He<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Jeremiah looked at R. Jacob to indicate that he found the question stupid and a waste of time.</i> was looking at him. He said to him, what are you staring at me? Bring a lash for yourself<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">That you can be whipped for asking such a stupid question.</i>; there it is for tithing<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">An obligation on the finished product.</i>, here it is for <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">An obligation on the fruit growing on the field. It was implied in the first paragraph that wine grapes and grapes used for producing vinegar should not be treated as two separate kinds.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, he should not have stared at him since the earlier rabbis wanted to understand this matter and understood that there it refers to tithing but here to <i>kilaim</i>.
Rebbi Yosa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: All of these form pairs. Has that been said for the entire Chapter, or only for this Halakhah? From what Rav said, that the five vegetables with which one may satisfy one’s obligation at Passover time can all be sown in one vegetable bed<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The five vegetables which may be used for bitter herbs on Passover are enumerated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 2:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.2.5.1">Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i>2:5</a>; cf. the author’s <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, pp. 332–333. The parallel discussion to the one given here is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 39a" href="/Pesachim.39a">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 39a</a>, also in the name of Rav. The statement of Rav was understood to mean that the five kinds may be sown <i>together</i>.</i>, and one says that the statement of Rav disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Since some of the bitter herbs are mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>, dividing them into groups seems to contradict the opinion of Rav.</i>, it follows that it has been said for the entire Chapter. Rav Abba in the name of Rav: All<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the Chapter here, identical with the previous statement of R. Joḥanan that only pairs of plants enumerated with a connecting ו may be planted together.</i> have been stated in pairs. The reasoning of Rav is inverted; there he says that they all constitute one kind, and here, he says so? No, Rav did not say that they all constitute one kind, but rather that they all are kinds of vegetables that may be sown in one vegetable bed<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.1.1">Mishnah 3:1</a> it will be stated that in planting vegetable beds one may not mix vegetables but one may plant different kinds so that they almost touch at corners, whereas grain and legume fields need much greater distances between different crops. All Rav wanted to state was that they can be sown under the lenient rules for vegetable beds, for intensive cultivation, in contrast to produce that can only be sown in fields, for extensive cultivation. Rav did not mean to say that they all were one kind.</i>.
Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, they found written in the notebook of Rebbi Hillel ben Rebbi Vales<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">A companion of Rebbi Jehudah Nesia, the grandson of Rebbi, reputed to have been very rich.</i>; Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, they found written on the wall of Rebbi Hillel ben Rebbi Vales: Beans, πίσον<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Reading of R. Simson: פייסונא, of Rome ms. פרשונה. These are all explanations in the vernacular of the different kinds of beans and peas mentioned in the Mishnah.

Simson reads as our text, Rome ms. מלוותא (which in Syriac would be a plural, “pitchers.”) The attempt by Jastrow to explain the word as describing peas grown by hydroponics is impossible, since acquatic plants are not subject to the laws of <i>kilaim</i>. Arukh reads מיליתא. I. Löw proves that all proposed identifications are impossible (<i>Flora der Juden</i> 2, p. 437.)</i>, <i>krpwnh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Another unexplained word. R. Simson reads מדשיא, the Rome ms. שדפוה.</i>, climbing beans<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simson reads פסילתא, Greek φάσηλος, Latin <i>phaselus</i> “bean”.</i>.
So is the Mishnah: Fava beans and string beans<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">These are two different kinds and not one long name. In the Rome ms., פול והשעונית.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, why is it called שעוּעית? Because if makes the heart happy and the intestines going.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Green melon<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The word is etymologically equivalent with Arabic قِثّاْ <i>qiṯṯā</i>“cucumber, <i>cucumis sativus L</i>.” This is Maimonides’s definition, in Yemenite mss., for all three occurrences of the word in Mishnah <i>Zeraïm</i>. However, in Mishnah <i>Uqeẓin</i> 2:1 and apparently in the <i>Zera‘im</i> ms. before Alḥarizi, he defines it as Arabic فُقُوس <i>fuqūs</i>, in classical Arabic “green melon” (possibly water melon?). In modern Hebrew, קישות means “zucchini.”</i> and sweet melon<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In the Halakhah, the word is explained as Greek μηλοπέπων “apple melon,” composite of μῆλον “apple,” πέπων “sun ripened.” Pliny [<i>Hist</i>.<i>nat</i>. XIX (23)] defines <i>melopepon</i> as “golden melon,<br><i>cucumis melo L</i>.” The Yerushalmi <i>Targum</i> to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 11:5" href="/Numbers.11.5"><i>Num</i>. 11:5</a> translates Hebrew אבטיח as מלפפון (in contrast to modern Hebrew where אבטיח means “water melon.”) Maimonides translates מלפפון as Arabic כ̇יאר خِيَار <i>ḵiyār</i> “cucumber.” This is the meaning of the word in Modern Hebrew, vocalized מְלָֽפְפוֹן.</i> are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other.

[In Modern Hebrew, following Ashkenazic Medieval usage, the word is used for horseradish.]</i>, endives and field endives<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Here, the cultivated form is mentioned first and the wild one second; one might conclude that in the days of the Mishnah, wild Romaine lettuce was still collected for sale but endives were mostly produced in the vegetable garden.</i>, leeks<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Also כרת̇י, Arabic كرّاث kurrāṯ.</i> and field leeks, coriander and field coriander, mustard and Egyptian mustard<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between these two plants can no longer be determined.</i>, Egyptian pumpkin and ash-gourd<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides defines Egyptian gourd as دالع <i>dalā‘</i>, which in Moroccan means “watermelon”. He defines ash-gourd as a naturally bitter pumpkin which becomes edible only when roasted for some time in hot ashes (רמץ). In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 51a" href="/Nedarim.51a">Babli, <i>Nedarim</i> 51a</a>, Samuel defines the fruit as “Caucasian gourd.”</i>, Egyptian beans<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Arabic also فول <i>fūl</i> “large flat greenish beans,” the main ingredient of <i>falafel</i>. חרוב means “carob, carob tree,” but here it means elongated black beans that imitate the looks and shape of carob.</i> and carob beans are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Yudan bar Menasheh<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">A third generation Galilean Amora; his surviving statements are all aggadic.</i> said: The opinion of the Sages is that one takes a small piece from the pericarp<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Some fertilized seeds with the carpic tissue surrounding it.</i> of a green melon and plants it and it grows to a water melon. One takes a small piece from the pericarp of a water melon and plants it and it grows to a sweet melon. Rebbi Jehudah says, it in itself is <i>kilaim</i>. One takes a small piece from the pericarp of a water melon and a small piece from the pericarp of an apple and puts them into one cavity where they unite and become <i>kilaim</i>. Therefore it is called “apple melon” in the Greek language.
What does Rebbi Jehudah say about green melon and water melon? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kilayim (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Kilayim_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta <i>Kilaim</i> 1:1</a>: “Green melon and squash, water melon and <i>melopepon</i>, are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other, and one may tithe from one on the other; these are the words of R. Meïr. R. Jehudah and R. Simeon say, they are <i>kilaim</i> one with the other, and one may not tithe from one on the other.”</i>: “Green melon, water melon, and sweet melon are not <i>kilaim</i> [if combined] one with the other; Rebbi Jehudah says, they are <i>kilaim</i>.” It has been said that green melon and water melon are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other, and water melon and sweet melon are not <i>kilaim</i> one with the other; Rebbi Jehudah says they are <i>kilaim</i>. Green melon and water melon are questionable<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since in the entire chapter we are dealing with comparisons of pairs, it is assumed that the teacher of the <i>baraita</i> only compares pairs. Hence, it is questionable whether the <i>baraita</i> teaches anything new. We know from the Mishnah about the comparison of green melon and sweet melon, also from the Tosephta about water melon and sweet melon (cf. Notes 39, 48). Since Rebbi Jehudah is only quoted as reacting to the statements of the first teacher, nothing can be inferred about his opinion if the reference to sweet melon is omitted. In any case, the argument teaches that the absence of <i>kilaim</i> is not a transitive notion: If A is not <i>kilaim</i> with B, and B not with C, it does not follow that A is not <i>kilaim</i> with C.</i>.
“Lettuce and garden lettuce.” Rebbi Ḥananiah said, roof lettuce. Simeon, the son of Rebbi Avi, said, Antiochian (lettuce<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Musaphia, in his additions to <i>Arukh</i>, reads אינטובין, ἔντυβον “endives.”</i>.) Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, sweet <i>yase</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">An unidentified plant. Kohut’s identification as <i>jacea</i> is unconvincing.

Endives may be eaten raw<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Τρώξιμα, τά “what is eaten raw, vegetable”, from τρώγω “to nibble, eat raw”; in Jewish sources only used for endives.</i>, field endives are ‘<i>ulthin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Arabic غَلثَة עֹלתֹה “bitter vegetable”.</i>.

“Egyptian gourd.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following items are quoted from the Mishnah.</i>” Our Mishnah does not follow Rebbi Neḥemiah.

See also below, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.5.1">Mishnah 5</a>.</i>: Aramean gourd is Egyptian gourd; it is <i>kilaim</i> with Greek gourd, <i>kilaim</i> with ash-gourd.
“Ash gourd.” Rebbi Ḥinenah said, it is a kind of bitter gourd and they sweeten it in hot ashes.
“And carob beans.” Rebbi Jonah said, they are a kind of Egyptian - Persian beans and their pods look like carob<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">From all these explanations one may infer that many of the kinds mentioned in the Mishnah either were no longer known in the Fourth Century or were known under different names.</i>.

In Tractates <i>Kilaim</i> and <i>Eruvin</i>, the word פֵּיאָה does not have the meaning “corner” as in Tractate <i>Peah</i>, but means a wire or string strung as a symbolic fence around a field to separate it from the next one, or around a town to make it a “walled” town for the rules of Sabbath. Now, it is stated in Mishnah and Tosephta of Chapter 4 that a solid wall permits one to plant vegetables on one side and vines on the other. This clearly is inadmissible for a <i>peah</i>-fence; one may not plant vines within four cubits of such a symbolic fence. Then the Tosephta states that even in this case the roots that enter from the outside do not cause <i>kilaim</i> if they are at a depth of at least half a cubit.</i> that enter within four cubits of a vineyard are permitted below three hand-breadths.”

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If someone hides turnips and radishes under a vine<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">These turnips and radishes have been harvested and tithed; now they are put into a hole dug in the earth and covered with earth in order to be preserved over the summer. Since the plants were taken out of the gound, they have lost the capillary roots that fed them in the ground, and if put again into a hole, they will not grow again. In the opinion of R. Simson and R. Abraham ben David of Posquières, it is necessary that some leaves are showing only if one desires to take them out on the Sabbath, since on that day one may neither dig nor harvest. For the other rules, turnips or radishes may be completely covered. In the interpretation of Maimonides and R. Joseph Caro, the leniencies of the Mishnah apply only if some leaves are uncovered (Maimonides, <i>Hilkhot Kilaim</i> 2:11, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:5:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.5.2">3:6</a>).

Simson since it forbids the taking on the Sabbath only if the turnips cannot be pulled by hand. The scenario is difficult to understand since the leaves of harvested plants will soon wilt or rot.</i> and some of the leaves were showing he does not have to worry either because of <i>kilaim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Since the produce will not grow, there is no planting and no hint of <i>kilaim</i>. Similarly, if the turnips were put into the ground before the start of the Sabbatical year, they do not become Sabbatical produce while in the ground. If they were tithed, they need not be tithed again when taken out.</i> or because of the Sabbatical year, or because of tithes, and they may be removed on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, the radishes have to be pulled out by their leaves. Since radishes are eaten raw, they are permitted food on the Sabbath and may be taken. Earth by itself may not be moved, but if earth falls by the side when the food is moved, its motion is unintentional and not forbidden.</i>. If someone sows wheat and barley together, that is <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, the minimum number of different kinds for <i>kilaim</i> is 2. Rebbi Jehudah requires uniform rules for all kinds of <i>kilaim</i> and, since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:9" href="/Deuteronomy.22.9"><i>Deut</i>. 22:9</a> states that one may not sow <i>kilaim</i> in one’s vineyard, the minimum is the vine plus <i>kilaim</i>, i. e., three components. {The Babli does not accept the Mishnah as practice but requires at least one seed each from three different species.}</i>. Rebbi Jehudah says, it is not <i>kilaim</i> unless there are two wheat kernels and a barley kernel, or a wheat kernel and two barley kernels, or one each of wheat, barley, and spelt.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Ḥizqiah said, they stated only turnips and radishes, nothing else. Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is no difference whether turnips, radishes, or any other plants. What are we talking about<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Joḥanan, why does the Mishnah give only one example and not establish a principle, as in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.7.1">Mishnah 7</a>?</i>? If because of the rules of vegetables and trees, why do I need vine and radishes, even any other plants<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">If the reason is to say that in such a situation the prohibition to sow vegetables too close to a tree does not apply, then the particular example is irrelevant. The same question is asked for the alternative reason in the next sentence.</i>? If because he does not want them to take root, why turnips and radishes, even any other species also? From what Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, “for example bunches of turnips and bunches of radishes,” it follows that the reason is only because he does not want them to take root<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">If we accept R. Ḥiyya as authoritative, then all our questions are resolved. First, since he says “for example,” it is clear that he is of R. Joḥanan’s opinion and opposes his own son, Ḥizqiah. Second, the Mishnah mentions turnips and radishes, because they are bound in bunches after the harvest. Hence, not all produce may be so stored but only produce one can store in such a way that the formation of new roots is prevented (e. g., storing cabbage after the roots have been cut away.) This means, in the end we accept neither Ḥizqiah nor R. Joḥanan, but we allow only produce which certainly will not grow new roots, similar to turnips and radishes. (For the requirement that the leaves be uncovered, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.9.1">Note 160</a>.) Vines are mentioned because they follow the most restrictive rules; what is permissible for vines is <i>a fortiori</i> permissible for all other fruit trees.</i>.

Rebbi Eleazar ben Taddeus<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">A Tanna of whom only this <i>baraita</i> is known.</i> said, in either case he pushes in a spear or a knife and lifts them out<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">If one uses a knife, he has the intention only to move what is permitted; in contrast, if one has to remove the cover to get to the figs, he would have to move things which he is forbidden to move. Rebbi Simeon always holds that unintended side effects of an action are not forbidden on the Sabbath since only מלאכת מחשבת “deliberate action” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 35:33" href="/Exodus.35.33"><i>Ex</i>. 35:33</a>) is forbidden.</i>.” The statement of Rebbi Eleazar ben Taddeus turns out following Rebbi Simeon, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">A slightly different version appears in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 22a" href="/Shabbat.22a">Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 22a</a> (and 5 other places); a shorter version is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 2:18" href="/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).2.18">Tosephta <i>Yom Ṭov</i> 2:18</a>.</i>: “One should not drag<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">On a dirt floor or outside.

And just as you say that one is permitted to move it, so one is permitted to bring it back. Rebbi Yose said, we also have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">In our Mishnah. (The language is slightly different from that of the Mishnah; it is influenced by <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 17:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.17.1.1">Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 17:1</a>: “All vessels may be taken on the Sabbath.”)</i>: “They may be taken on the Sabbath.” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, that is from Rebbi Simeon. But we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Again in the Mishnah. The problem is that R. Simeon declares in Mishnah <i>Ševiït</i> 9:1 that “all aftergrowth of the Sabbatical year is permitted except for that of cabbage,” because the aftergrowth is not usually harvested. This means that aftergrowth may be traded and unlike food harvested in the Sabbatical year, it does not have to be disposed of once there is no more food for the wild animals on the fields. Since any growth of the hidden turnips and radishes can be compared to aftergrowth, there is no way one could possibly worry about the growth in the Sabbatical year, according to R. Simeon. If one cannot worry, then it would be superfluous for R. Simeon to mention that one does not have to worry and he cannot be the author of the Mishnah.<br><a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 51b" href="/Pesachim.51b">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 51b</a> and a few Mishnah sources have R. Simeon stating that “all aftergrowth of the Sabbatical year is forbidden except for that of cabbage.” This reading contradicts the position of the Yerushalrni and will be discussed in Mishnah <i>Ševiït</i> 9:1.</i>: “The Sabbatical year!” Can you say that “the Sabbatical year” follows Rebbi Simeon? Explain “the Sabbatical year!” For Rebbi Simeon permits the aftergrowth of the Sabbatical year, and here he says so? Even though Rebbi Simeon permits aftergrowth of the Sabbatical year, he still holds it subject to the holiness of the Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical precept is that the produce of the Sabbatical year is to be eaten by man or animal (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:6" href="/Leviticus.25.6"><i>Lev</i>. 25.6</a>) but may not be used for industrial purposes, nor may it be left to decay. Holdover turnips and radishes from the previous year may be used for industrial purposes in the Sabbatical year.</i>. Here also, he worries neither about the Sabbatical year nor about the holiness of the Sabbatical year!

Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish agrees that one who sows on the sea<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">The “sea” is a stone tub in the building of the olive press in which the harvested olives are stored before pressing, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 4:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.4.5.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Batra</i> 4:5</a>.

Since sowing vegetables on either side of a fence is permitted, sowing with the intention of putting up a fence is forbidden but not sanctionable. This contrasts with the next statement about R.

Rebbi Abba from Carthage said, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish agrees that on the Sabbath it must come to rest<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sabbath, moving something from a private to the public domain or vice versa is a desecration. Moving is defined as 1) taking up, 2) changing its place, and 3) putting down. R. Joḥanan is quoted in Tractate <i>Šabbat</i>1:1 (fol. 2b) that this is punishable only if all three actions have been completed. (This means that if one takes up something in the house, carries it outside and delivers it running to a relay of runners who never stop before the end of the Sabbath, he it is not punishable.) R. Simeon ben Laqish agrees that, even if one had the intention of putting the object down on the Sabbath, a punishable action did not occur as long as the piece had not been put down and come to rest.</i>. Our Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “If someone sows wheat and barley together, that is <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">There are no qualifications in the Mishnah.</i>.” He explains it, if they are put inside a six<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Since the measure is given by a number in the masculine, it must refer to hand-breadths (טפחים).

Rebbi Johanan asserts that infringing on these minimal distances is sinful but not punishable unless the grain field contains at least a surface area of one square cubit bare of the main crop. Then anything sown there is a punishable transgression, but an unavoidable occasional strange seed among the seed grain does not cause a punishable offense.</i> or enclosed by a fence<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">If inside a grain field one separates any area, even less that a square cubit, by erecting a fence, sowing any two kinds there is punishable since the minimal distances have not been observed.</i>.
Does Rebbi Judah say that in this case<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">The case indicated by R. Joḥanan, that there was a bald spot of six-by-six in a field, and another kind was planted there. Does R. Jehudah accept this as <i>kilaim</i> or not?</i> it is not <i>kilaim</i>?

If one has vegetables planted in orderly rows and he desires to plant different vegetables in different rows, R. Jehudah requires that the rows be separated by “a foot width,” which is the same as a hand-breadth.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, he who wants to question this statement of Rebbi Zeïra might deduce the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah from that of the rabbis. Just as the rabbis say, in the case of the prohibition of <i>bet rova‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">The area in which a quarter <i>kab</i>, or one twenty-fourth of a <i>seah</i>, can be sown.

It is explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.8.1">Mishnah 2:11</a> that two fields of different kinds of grain have to be separated by a fallow <i>bet rova‘</i>.

Since he threw it out from his hand as seed, he is guilty<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse reads, “do not sow your field <i>kilaim</i>,” the act of sowing is forbidden, not its consequence in the soil.

But did we not state that “Rebbi Jehudah says, it is not <i>kilaim</i>?” Explain it, until the moment that it comes to rest<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simeon ben Laqish states his rule according to the rabbis. He will agree that R. Jehudah requires that the seeds actually fall to the ground, since it says “do not sow <i>your field kilaim</i>;” even if he had the intention of sowing <i>kilaim</i> but the wind carried the seeds away, there is no criminal act committed. Hence, in this interpretation intent alone cannot be the determining factor.</i>. But was it not stated that Rebbi Judah permits it? Even if it came to rest, Rebbi Jehudah permits it<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">The previous interpretation is contradicted; R. Simeon ben Laqish only expresses his opinion according to the rules of the rabbis, not at all following R. Jehudah.</i>. Rebbi Illaï said, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish follows his own opinion, since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of Ḥizqiah: A vertex<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">ראש תור “ox head, trapezoid, vertex” describes the configuration in which two fields are not parallel but are at an angle to each other, so that a vertex of one field touches the other field in the middle of a side.

Ḥizqiah adds that even if one of the fields does not have a regular shape, e. g., if it ends in a dry spot, if in the neighborhood of the other field it forms a triangle with a vertex touching the other field the leniency of ראש תור applies.<br>Cf. the discussion of ראש תור in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.5.1">Chapter 2, Note 101</a>.</i> from a dry spot is permitted. Then it also should be thus in the case of two wheat grains and one of barley<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">The one barley grain should be ראש תור between the row of two wheat grains!</i>? That is correct. But did we not state, “unless there are two wheat kernels and one barley kernel, or one wheat kernel and two barley kernels, or one each of wheat, barley, and spelt?” Explain it if there is a grain of wheat on each side, a fence on each side, and the grain of barley caught in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, the configuration of ראש תור is excluded since the field represented by the barley grain enters the field represented by the wheat grains, and the minimal distances of separation will have to be observed.

Rebbi Yose said, this implies that one is forbidden to mix in; if you say that one is permitted to mix them back in, why require good grain instead?

Any statement introduced by “in truth” is unquestioned practice.</i>: “In truth, they said that garden seeds which are not eaten add up together for one in 24 when they fall on a bet <i>seah</i>.” And we stated on that, this is a <i>qab</i> or half a <i>qab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The standard of maximal contamination for seeds of kitchen greens is a <i>qab</i> for the larger seeds and half a <i>qab</i> for the smaller seeds. Since these seeds are so much smaller than seed grain, they cannot be 1 in 24 of the full <i>seah</i> since that would overwhelm all the grain, but only 1 in 144 or 1 in 288, depending on the size of the seeds. The standard is a contamination of 1 in 24 of the harvest, not the seeds.</i>. What could one do with the twenty-fourth part of half a <i>qab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">About 0.09 liter.</i>? For that, they are worried because of the bad impression<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The entire rule is rabbinical so people should not think the contamination was intentional. One forbids only accidental weeds or strange admixtures which exceed the commercial standard.</i>. They were not worried because of the bad impression from a lesser amount.
“Should be diminished<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from the Mishnah.</i>.” How does he diminish? Either he removes from the quarter or he adds to the <i>seah</i>. But did not Rebbi Joḥanan say (Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan), for all prohibitions, if one added in error, it is permitted, if intentionally, it is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For example, if some dairy product fell into a meat dish, if the meat dish by volume is more than 60 times that of the dairy product, the contamination is declared minimal and the dish is permitted to be eaten. (This is the rabbinical standard.) If the ratio was less at the time of the accident but later some more of the meat dish was added inadvertently or unknowingly, the measure at the end is determining. But if the addition was made in the knowledge of the prior prohibited contamination, then the measure at the time of the accident is determining and the later addition must be disregarded. How can the Mishnah here permit intentionally adding to legalize the prohibited mixture?</i>. There you add to annul a Torah prohibition, but here you add because of the bad impression.
“Rebbi Yose says, he must pick it out.” What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? Because he started with the quarter, he must finish the entire quarter. Rebbi Yose agrees that if there was less than a quarter when he started, he does not need to attend to it<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If he started to remove the foreign seeds when he did not have to he may stop in the middle, before removing all of it. We do not say that the fact of his removing impurities shows that he is bothered by their presence and, therefore, any sowing would be intentional sowing of <i>kilaim</i> and forbidden.</i>. How is that done? If there was a quarter composed of two kinds, does he pick out one kind and that is sufficient, or does he have to pick out everything<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The question is not answered since practice does not follow R. Yose.</i>?
“Rebbi Simeon said, they said it only for one kind,” not two kinds. How far? Up to the greater part of the <i>seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As long as the total of foreign seeds is less than 50% and each single contamination is less than 1 in 24, the seeds remain permitted. (Up to 12 contaminants of maximum volume are possible.)</i>. If he added afterwards, the grain returned to its permitted status<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simeon accepts the earlier interpretation that adding of the main seedstock makes everything permitted again.</i>. Just as Rebbi Simeon said, two kinds do not combine for prohibition, so he says that they do not combine for permission. How is that done? If there were twenty-three and one half quarters of wheat and half a quarter of barley, and into that fell less than a quarter of lentils<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It is supposed here that the volume of the lentils is at least <sup>23.5</sup>/<sub>24</sub> = 0.9792 quarters but less than one quarter. In that case, if the lentils were judged against the combined volume into which they fell, it would be less than 1 in 24. But since the barley is not counted at all, the contamination is at least a full twenty-fourth of the volume of wheat grain and the mixture is forbidden.</i>, even so the two kinds would not combine for permission.
We have stated about this, “three or four <i>qab</i>,” hence two <i>qab</i> go by one in 24<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The rule of the first Mishnah covers all seeds which need between four and three <i>seah</i>, i. e., between ⅔ and ½ <i>seah</i> per <i>bet</i> <i>seah</i>. Hence, seeds that need less volume are considered kitchen vegetables and go by <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup>/<sub>24</sub>. In slightly different language, this is explicitly stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kilayim (Lieberman) 1:16" href="/Tosefta_Kilayim_(Lieberman).1.16">Tosephta <i>Kilaim</i> 1:16</a>.</i>. “In truth;” Rebbi Eleazar said that every place where they stated “in truth,” it is practice going back to Moses on Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This principle is also accepted in the Babli, <i>Baba</i> <i>Meẓia</i>‘ 60a.</i> And we stated about this, for example a <i>qab</i> or half a <i>qab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.1">Halakhah 1, Notes 22–24</a></i>.Hence, two <i>qab</i> go by a quarter. Here you say, two <i>qab</i> by a quarter, and there you say, two <i>qab</i> by one in 24. Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Abun in the name of Rav Huna; one says, nine <i>qab</i>, the other says, eight <i>qab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">If one only needs 2 <i>qab</i>, ⅓ <i>seah</i>, for seeding, then the contamination is by a quarter, as expressed in the Tosephta, not for 1 <i>seah</i> but for 1⅓ to 1½ <i>seah</i> (8 to 9 <i>qab</i>). For smaller quantities, one goes by the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub> rule; the two statements are complementary, not contradictory.</i>.
Do nine and ten join together<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It was stated that seeds which need 8 or 9 <i>qab</i> are contaminated by a quarter of seeds which need two <i>qab</i>. Does this rule extend to seeds that need 10 <i>qab</i>? The answer is, since 3 <i>qab</i> go by the quarter rule, and 9 <i>qab</i> go by the same rule, the difference between 9 and 10, a mere 10% from above, is not large enough to change the rules. Hence, if seeds which need 9 or 10 <i>qab</i> contaminate seeds which need one <i>seah</i>, they are measured by <sup>9</sup>/<sub>24</sub> = ⅜ <i>qab</i> per <i>seah</i> of the main seed. In the opinion of R. Simson, if half of the contamination is by seeds which need 9 <i>qab</i>, this half is measured by <sup>9</sup>/<sub>24</sub>, the other half by <sup>10</sup>/<sub>24</sub>. (Maimonides does not mention these rules in his Code.)</i>? Come and see, nine and three come together, so much more nine and ten!
Rebbi Abin and Rebbi Ḥanina both say that a split <i>seah</i> is between them<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the Sages and Rebbi Simeon is whether wheat grain is the standard by which everything is measured or whether every kind has its own standard. The examples given all go by the rule of R. Simeon.</i>. A quarter <i>seah</i> may prohibit three <i>qab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A quarter <i>seah</i> is half of three <i>qab</i>, not 1 in 24. The explanation is that if some plants need 6 <i>seah</i> of seeds for a <i>bet seah</i>, then they contaminate in 6÷24 = .25 <i>seah</i>, even if the main seed is one that needs only half a <i>seah</i> to cover a bet <i>seah</i>. All other examples follow the same pattern and are really superfluous.</i>, and a quarter of three <i>qab</i> may prohibit a <i>seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Here the contaminating seed needs 18 <i>qab</i> = 3 <i>seah</i> per <i>bet seah</i>.</i>. A quarter <i>seah</i> may prohibit nine <i>qab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The contaminating seed needs 4 <i>seah</i> per bet <i>seah</i>, the contaminated seed is standard.</i>, and a quarter of nine <i>qab</i> may prohibit a <i>seah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The contaminating seed needs 6 <i>seah</i> per <i>bet seah</i>.</i>. Three quarters of flax seed prohibit a <i>seah</i>. How is this? On a plot on which one sows one quarter of wheat, one sows three quarters of flax seed.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If someone wants to make his field into separate garden beds<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Borrowed from Aramaic מישרא, parallel Arabic مَشَارَة “plant life”. According to Maimonides in his Code (<i>Kilaim</i> 3:8), משר applies only to a rectangular garden bed that is not square. A square garden bed is called ערוגה if it is isolated and קרחת if it is part of a field. The latter assertion is difficult to accept, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.7.1">Note 150</a>. One might accept that קרחת applies to congruent rectangular patches but משר to rectangular patches of differing sizes. This seems to be the position of R. Abraham ben David of Posquières.</i> of different kinds, the House of Shammai say, three furrows of the ploughshare, and the House of Hillel say, the width of a Sharon yoke. Both criteria are close to one another<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">According to Maimonides, the criterion is that of the minimal distance between beds. According to R. Isaac Simponti, the criterion is that of the minimal size of a garden bed, with only a minimal but orderly separation. The Halakhah can be interpreted both ways; this is the position of R. Simson.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Eleazar, in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya the Elder: He makes it two by two cubits, but decreases continuously to an arbitrarily small distance<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The total area must be four square cubits, but the division into strips is left to the farmer. This interpretation seems required by the question of R. Eleazar in the next paragraph.<br>R. Simson thinks that somewhere there must be an empty space of two by two cubits, otherwise the border strips can be as narrow as one desires. Maimonides in his Commentary and <i>Hilkhot Kilaim</i> 4:6 explains: “He makes it two by two cubits, but the border can be minimal;” i. e., if the field is subdivided into garden beds, inside between any two beds must be 4 square cubits of fallow land. At the border of the entire field, a border strip must be left empty. That strip has no minimal size (but presumably it must be wide enough to allow the farmer to walk there on his own property.) This interpretation takes מצר as a noun, “border strip,” a word otherwise documented only in the Babli. The translation and R. Simson take the word as a verb, “to narrow,” a usage that is required later in the statement of Rebbi. In addition, the phrase והולך עד “doing something continuously,” is only used in conjunction with transitive verbs.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, that is, if it is subdivided into garden beds, but if all is one bed, it does not apply. This parallels what Rebbi Yannai said: I may sow my field<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The standard field understood in all these Mishnaiot, a <i>bet seah</i> of 50 by 50 cubits. Rebbi Yannay splits the field into two strips, each of length 50 and width 25-ε cubits (ε being a small positive quantity) and reserving two cubits in length for each crop and its border.</i> with fifty kinds, twenty-five here and twenty-five there; this is in two rows.

Simeon ben Laqish.</i>? Then it parallels what Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of Ḥizqiah: A vertex from a dry spot is permitted! Rebbi said, he starts with an area of <i>bet rova‘</i> and narrows it down to three furrows of the ploughshare. Does Rebbi not accept that between grains one needs a <i>bet rova‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Stated in Rebbi’s own <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.7.1">Mishnah 2:9</a>; it is extremely rare to find Rebbi accepting into the Mishnah anonymous opinions conflicting with his own basic positions.</i>? That is for a square field<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Of a minimum size of 2500 square cubits.</i>, here for a garden bed. Do the rabbis not recognize garden beds? Rebbi Yudan said, the minimal distance for Rebbi is the maximal distance for the rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">For Rebbi, the width of three furrows is the lower limit of what is acceptable; for the rabbis, the width of three furrows is the upper limit of what is required. So everybody agrees that the separation by three furrows is acceptable under all circumstances.</i>.
Rebbi Eleazar asked: What are the rules for a small field<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Since for a standard field (50 by 50 cubits), the total area of the strips between the garden beds must be four square cubits, what is the required minimum for a field that does not contain the required 2500 square cubits?</i>? Let us hear from the following: “<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Parallel statements appear in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kilayim (Lieberman) 2:1" href="/Tosefta_Kilayim_(Lieberman).2.1">Tosephta <i>Kilaim</i> 2:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kilayim (Lieberman) 2:4" href="/Tosefta_Kilayim_(Lieberman).2.4">2:4</a>, about the border strips, or furrows, that are required between two fields, either in the situation of the preceding or the present Mishnah. For fields longer than 50 cubits, they do not require that the separation of the fields, by empty strip or by planted flax, be longer than 50 cubits. (Probably, this means that in designating the border by one row of flax, one may not use a furrow longer than 50 cubits, in order to avoid commercially usable flax that would be <i>kilaim</i> and make the field forbidden.) The statement about a small field is not in the Tosephta concerned only with fields having at least the standard size.<br>Abba Yose bar Joḥanan (Hanan) from Yanoaḥ in Upper Galilee, a Tanna of the fifth generation, was a student of R. Meïr and Abba Cohen Bar Dalaiah.</i> Rebbi Eleazar ben Simeon: Abba Yose ben Joḥanan from Yanoaḥ said for a large field 50 cubits, for a small field along most of it.” Since those who specified a measure for a large field did not do so for a small one, the Sages who did not specify a measure for a large field certainly would not specify a measure for a small field.

In the technical sense, ראש תור is applied to any trapezoidal or pentagonal field in which the furrows are not parallel, in particular if the last furrow in a field is not parallel to the other furrows and certainly not to the furrows in the adjacent field.

Does a fence save grains<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The question as it stands makes no sense since the Mishnah states clearly that a fence absolutely separates crops. One has to say that one does not speak of a (wooden) fence but of a stone wall and the question is whether the stone wall loses its status if it is used as a field in itself. (R. Moses Margalit wants to emend the following גריד to גדר and take the next sentence as explaining the meaning of the present one. This is impossible since the text is also supported by the Rome ms. and, as R. Eliahu Fulda notes, dry land is only mentioned to separate vegetables, whose rules are not as strict as those for grains.) One has to take the text here parallel to the following one and interpret “fence” as “stone wall topped by soil on which produce is growing.”</i>? Does sown dry land save vegetables? Rebbi Samuel in the name of Rebbi Zeïra understood it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kilayim (Lieberman) 2:5" href="/Tosefta_Kilayim_(Lieberman).2.5">Tosephta <i>Kilaim</i> 2:5</a>. There it is added that the roots have to be 10 hand-breadths high, corresponding to the minimal size of a separating stone wall. Hence, living roots are not different from a stone wall on which some crop was planted.</i>: “One sows close to dried-up tree roots.” This mentions only dry ones; hence, if they are moist, it is forbidden. Rebbi Yose understood it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from the current Mishnah. Here, “fence” (and also, “closure”) is used without qualification and includes stone walls on which produce is grown.</i>: “One does sow close to a fallow field, a ploughed field, a closure, a foot path, a fence ten hand-breadths high.” That implies that a sown fence saves grains! Even if you accept “fence ten hand-breadths high,” a sown fence does not have to save grains. There is a difference here because the fence is sown and no sown fence saves grains<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Since the stone wall carries produce, all separation rules for fields apply; there is no longer any wall in the legal sense once it became a field.</i>.
Rebbi Judan asked: Do dry land and length add together? How is that? If there was space ten and a half cubits long and six hand-breadths wide<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">On separate ground in a grain field one may sow a row of vegetables since, as was just stated, dry land only helps for vegetables.</i>, one does not have to have dry land<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">In order to permit the planting. But if dry land is added, one can sow grain close to it. Since the row of vegetables also takes up space, without the dry strip there would not be the required separation of at least three hand-breadths from the grain.</i>. If dry land was added on both sides, one may sow close on both sides.
It was stated: Rebbi Jonathan ben Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">A Tanna of the fourth generation, student of R. Aqiba, and perhaps also of R. Ismael. He is mentioned only in Tosephta and <i>baraitot</i>. His statement here refers to the Mishnah, that one may plant different crops at the sides of a rock outcropping that is at least ten hand-breadths high (about a yard). He states that any side of the outcropping at least one yard long forms an absolute barrier for <i>kilaim</i>.</i> said, one may sow close to a rock ten hand-breadths long and four hand-breadths wide on both of its sides. If it was ten by ten hand-breadths, one may sow close to it on all four sides.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who wants to turn his field into patches<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Arabic קַרָאח “terrain appropriate for being sown,” used here for equal patches all sown or planted with different kinds. Clearly, R. Meïr cannot require the patches all to be square and equal, since 24 is not a square number. Since a <i>seah</i> contains 24 <i>rova‘</i>, each plot will have just the minimal size that allows different seeds to be sown. Since the patches have to be rectangular and equal in shape, on a field of 50 by 50 cubits the sides of the rectangles are 50/4=12.5 by 50/6=8. 3̄ cubits (or 50/3=16.6̄ by 50/8=6.25 cubits.)</i> for all different kinds makes 24 patches per <i>bet seah</i>, each patch one <i>bet rova‘</i>, and sows in each one any kind that he desires.

Meïr’s.</i>. But the Sages say, nine patches are permitted, ten are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">This is explained in the Halakhah. Maimonides, who insists that a קרחת must be square, takes as model of the 50 by 50 cubits field a five-by-five square checkerboard. All white fields in the first, third, and fifth rows are squares of a <i>bet rova</i>‘ each (squares of √2500/24 = 10.207 cubits edge length) while the black fields in these rows are rectangles of edge lengths 10.207 and 9.69 cubits. In rows 2 and 4, the black fields are squares of a <i>bet rova</i>‘, the white fields are rectangles of edge lengths 9.69 and 10.207 cubits. Together, they fill the large square, but only the nine fields selected first may be sown and all others must lie fallow.<br>According to Maimonides, the number 9 as maximum of patches is a mathematical fact. In the interpretation of R. Simson who admits rectangular patches, 10 patches would be possible but are forbidden. In a 4-by-6 checkerbord, a valid centrally symmetric configuration of 10 patches might contain (1,1) (1,4) (2,2) (3,1) (3,3) (4,2) (4,4) (5,3) (6,1) (6,4). The expression “ten are forbidden” supports R. Simson.</i>. Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, even if its field is a <i>bet kor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">1 <i>kor</i> = 30 <i>seah</i>. 1 <i>bet kor =</i>75’000 square cubits, larger than the <i>bet kor</i> appearing in cuneiform documents.</i>, he should not make in it more than one patch.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Yasa, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: For the first part, Rebbi Meïr says, even jailed, even adjacent, but the rabbis say, on condition that they were neither jailed nor adjacent<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Two rectangular fields may meet one another at a vertex, since each one is ראש תור for the other. “Jailed” means here that a rectangular field forms ראש תור at all four of its vertices. Rebbi Meïr permits to sow rectangular fields, each of the minimum size of <i>bet rova‘</i>, even if they are adjacent, i. e., they are joined at an edge, and even if they are jailed at all corners, which means that he permits to use the entire field. The Sages do not disagree that a קרחת must have a minimum size of <i>bet rova‘</i>. If the field is divided into equal rectangles, one may imagine that the different rectangles are alternately black and white in checkerboard fashion. Since the rabbis do not permit adjacent rectangles to be sown, the first condition is that only rectangles of the same color are chosen. The second condition is that no chosen rectangle can be surrounded by 4 chosen rectangles. The opinion of Maimonides about the position of the rabbis was explained in the Mishnah. His opinion is difficult to accept, since he does not permit any two fields to touch at all, so the mention of “jailing” is totally redundant. It is therefore better to look for a partition of the 50 by 50 field into 24 equal parts. The rabbis cannot speak about division of the field into squares since their number would have to be either 16 (with 7 chosen squares) or 25 (where 12 chosen squares are possible.) Also, the squares in the second case would be smaller than a <i>bet rova‘</i>. If the Sages would follow the division of R. Meïr and cover the field by a 4-by-6 checkerboard, they could accomodate 10 chosen rectangles (fields 1,3,5 in the first row, 2,4,6 in the second, 1,5 in the third, 2,4 in the fourth.) Hence, it seems that the rabbis insist that the area for קרחת should be strictly larger than a <i>bet rova‘</i>, and on a 5-by-4 board one may select at most nine (e. g., fields 1,3,5 in row 1; 2,4 in row 2; 1,5 in row 3; 2,4 in row 4.) The area of each plot is then 125 sq. cubits. (Explanation of R. Eliahu Fulda.)</i>. How is that done? 3,2,1,2,l<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">This statement fails in two respects. First, the underlying checkerboard is 5-by-5, allowing only 100 sq. cubits per plot, and second, on such a checkerboard that has 13 white and 12 black fields, one may choose all white fields with the exception of the central one (#3 in row 3), for a total of 12 admissible fields. Hence, this sentence (choosing 3 plots in the first row, 2 in the second, 1 in the third, 2 in the fourth, 1 in the fifth) must be a later addition. Even if one chooses the central element in row three, one still could accomodate 10 plots (1,3,5 in the first row, 2,4 in the second, 3 in the third, 1,5,in the fourth, 2,4 in the fifth).<br>The argument is not part of R. Joḥanan’s statement since it is in Aramaic. R. I. J. Kanievski proposes to read תְּלַת תַּרְתֵּי וְחָדָא תַּרְתֵּיי וְחָדָא, eliminating two conjunctions and translating “three [times] two and one each.” The syntax is very unusual.</i>.

Chapter 3



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> In a garden bed that is six by six hand-breadths<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the minimal size (about 0.3 m<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup>) of a plot that can be planted with different kinds. The rules for garden beds are different from those of fields. If no trees are involved, then the only requirements are that the different kinds not be sown together and that they form distinct smaller beds (with straight boundaries), so that they should not appear continuous. It will be stated in later Mishnaiot that two different patches either may come together as the vertex of a triangle, ראש תור, touching a straight side, or that the two patches meet in a pair of vertical angles, or that the patch boundaries are parallel and separated, either by a ditch one hand-breadth deep and wide and six long, or by an earthwall one hand-breadth high and one wide, or by a strip of flat empty ground 1½ hand-breadths wide. The Halakhah will explain that under most circumstances, one must leave the corners of the ערוגה-square empty. The problem of interpretation of the Mishnah is to find a way that gives the farmer maximum use of his soil. The maximum problem was solved by Maimonides, whose interpretation we follow here. A similar explanation is given by Rashi, Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 84b; Rashi’s explanation is identical with one by an unnamed Gaon, <i>Oẓar</i> <i>Hageonim Šabbat</i> p. 83–86. [In all these discussions, “six hand-breadths” is used, not “one cubit,” since there is an opinion (Tosephta <i>Kelim Baba Meẓia‘</i> 6:13) that in all that concerns <i>kilaim</i>, a cubit is only five hand-breadths. For the metric equivalents of these measurements, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.1.1">Chapter 4, Note 2</a>.]</i> one may sow five kinds of seeds, four at its four sides and one in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Divide the 6×6 plot into 36 squares of one hand-breadth edge length each. Along the four edges, the corner squares are left fallow. Then on each edge, a rectangle, 4 long and 1 wide, can be planted. These 4 rectangles can be planted with 4 different kinds since they meet only at a pair of vertical angles. Together, they contain 16 of the 1-by-1 squares. The interior edges of the rectangles enclose a 4×4 square. In this square, a square can be planted in the shape of a diamond, having its vertices at the midpoints of the inner edges of the rectangles. This is permitted as ראש תור since the rules of “jailing” do not apply to flower beds. The diagonals of the diamond have length 4; it covers exactly half of the internal square of 16 square hand-breadths. Hence, the entire cultivated area is 8 + 4×4 = 24 hand-breadths square.<br><img

Each rhomb is three high and two wide. (The edge length of each rhomb is <i>l</i> = √3.25, half the acute vertex angle is given by sin α = 2/3. Hence, the distance between two parallel edges of two parallel rhombs is <i>d</i> = <i>l</i> sin 2α = 1.792 &gt; 1.5, and the arrangement is legitimate. If the inner ערוגה would be filled by 9 1-by-l diamonds, the distance between parallel patches would be only 1; this is too small.

arrangement increases the number of kinds that can be sown but it does not change the total cultivated area. (According to R. Obadiah of Bertinoro, R. Jehudah refers only to the ערוגה that is surrounded by an earth wall, so that the corners can also be sown. His configuration is of six 2.25-by-1 rectangles separated by strips 1.5 wide, sitting on two parallel edges of the square.)</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 61:11" href="/Isaiah.61.11"><i>Is.</i> 61:11</a>) “Its sown seeds,” the minimum of seeds are two<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The entire paragraph appears in <i>Šabbat</i> 9:2 as commentary on the Mishnah: “(R. Aqiba said,) from where do we know that one may sow five different kinds in a garden bed that is six-by-six hand-breadths, four at the four edges and one in the middle? For it is said: For as earth will produce its plants, and as a garden will make its seedlings germinate.… It does not say, ‘it will make germinate its seedling’ but ‘its seedlings.’ ” The verse uses a plural for the seedlings in a garden (interpreted as one garden bed); this proves only that it is possible to sow more than one kind.</i>. Rebbi Samuel bar Sisarṭa<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He appears elsewhere as R. Samuel bar Sosarṭa, bar Sotar (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 63" href="/Berakhot.63"><i>Berakhot</i> p. 63</a>).</i> said, from two you infer four. Just as for two you start at the beginning of six and reduce continuously, so for four you start at the beginning of six and reduce continuously. It is impossible that there should not be a free space to plant in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The argument as explained by R. Simson: At the end of the paragraph, it is stated that one deals with a vegetable bed surrounded by other vegetable beds. The rules of “jailing” require that at the corners squares of one hand-breadth each must be empty. In order to grow two kinds of plants, one may sow two strips, each 4 hand-breadths long, along parallel edges, each one 2.25 hand-breadths wide, so that the required separation of 1.5 hand-breadths be observed in the middle. But then the argument may be used also for the other two edges. That means that one sows four triangular patches; each one has a base of 4 hand-breadths on an edge of the garden bed, with base angles of 45°. These triangles must be separated by strips 1.5 hand-breadths wide. This means that at the edges, we must leave a square of edge length <i>a</i> empty, whose diagonal is 1.5 = a√2. Hence, <i>a</i> = 1.061; the bases of the triangle can only be 3.878 hand-breadths. In that case, the distance of the third vertex of the triangle from its base is equal to half the base on the edge, or 1.939 hand-breadths. The distance from the center is <i>a</i> = 1.061 &lt; 1.5. In order to plant a single seed in the middle, it is therefore necessary to cut off the triangles at distance 1.5 from center and edge, creating four congruent trapezoids. The height of a trapezoid is <i>h</i>=1.5, its base 2<i>b</i>=3.878. By similar triangles, the length <i>t</i> of its top is given by <i>2b/b = t/(b-h)</i> or <i>t</i> = 0.878. That makes it possible to plant a single fifth kind in a small space in the middle. The total area planted amounts to four times the area of the trapezoids, 15.044 square hand-breadths, plus the area of the small space in the middle.<br><img

Rebbi Jonah said, working space joins working space but a kind does not meet another kind to jail it<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Each separate kind needs a working space around it, given by the strip of width 1.5 hand-breadths, but the same strip does serve two different kinds without problem. Also, the rules of “jailing” only apply to fields, not to garden beds.</i>. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: “Its seed, its seeds, its sown seeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts a new approach, that the verse itself implies more than 2 kinds. The word זרוּע appears only twice in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 61:11" href="/Isaiah.61.11">Bible, <i>Is.</i> 61:11</a> and in a description of grain (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:37" href="/Leviticus.11.37"><i>Lev.</i> 11:37</a>): “seeds of seedlings that may be sown.” In contrast to modern dictionaries which take זרוע as a word different from זרע, the authors here take it as expansion of זרע “seed.” The root is expanded three times, by taking the plural, adding a possessive suffix, and adding the letter ו. Each change is taken as a plural, hence three plurals are added for a total of six.</i>” That follows Rebbi Jehudah, since Rebbi Jehudah said six, “seed, its seed, its seeds, its sown seeds.” Rebbi Ḥaggai said, זרעיה has five letters; everywhere I find ו,י I delete them<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">R. Ḥaggai assumes that originally all Hebrew spelling was what is called defective. Hence, any ו or י that is neither part of the root nor required by grammatical rules is considered an addition by later scribes and therefore is disregarded. That eliminates the ו but leaves the י which is required as sign of plural. One ends up with five letters, following the anonymous opinion in the Mishnah.</i>. This was asked of Rav Huna, the scribe of the assembly, and he said, זרועיה is written <i>plene</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The spelling זירועיה in the text is certainly wrong since the expression of ־ֵ by י is standard only in Mishnaic and later texts, not in Biblical ones. Hence, the <i>plene</i> writing refers to the masoretic spelling of the word; one has six letters supporting Rebbi Jehudah.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Yannai: All inside of six<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">All seeds are sown in the interior of the bed, away from the corners.</i>. Cahana in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: All at the outside of six<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The corners at the boundary, which are at the outside, are sown. Then one may sow four 1-by-l corner patches, four 1-by-l patches at the center of each edge, and a center diamond, for a total of nine patches.</i>. Then we should state “nine!” Rebbi Tanḥum from Bostra<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A student of R. Jeremiah and teacher of R. Eliezer ben R. Yose, from the town of Bostra, at the Southern border of the province of Trachonitis, on the road from Damascus to Edrei.</i> said, that is true. But our Mishnah speaks of a garden bed in the middle of garden beds<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since the rules of “jailing” apply to garden beds as a whole, not to smaller patches, the corners cannot be sown. This is the opinion of Samuel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 86b" href="/Shabbat.86b">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 86b</a>). Otherwise, it really is possible to sow 9 kinds, as the Babli puts it (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 86a" href="/Shabbat.86a"><i>Šabbat</i> 86a</a>), in the case of a garden bed planted on land otherwise dry, with no other beds nearby. Rav in the Babli still admits only five kinds even on dry land.</i>.
Rebbi Isaac and Rebbi Immi were sitting and asking, did we not state: “If it had a wall around it at least one hand-breadth high, one may sow in it thirteen kinds: three at each of the three sides of the wall, and one in the middle.” Should we not state, ‘six in the middle?’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As was shown in the Mishnah, a six-by-six plot may be sown in six rhombs.</i> Explain it if the walls diminish six<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The leaves of the three patches on the border wall hang down and leave less than a 6-by-6 plot in the middle.</i>. If the walls diminish six, is it that about which we stated: “Rebbi Jehudah says, six kinds may be in the middle?” We upheld it, but we do not know whether the colleagues upheld it or Rebbi Immi did; it refers to the beginning<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Jehudah disagrees with the anonymous Tanna of the first statement in the Mishnah and asserts that one may sow 6 distinct kinds in a garden bed.</i>. And if it refers to the beginning, it is that about which Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: Rebbi Jehudah says, 18<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This can only refer to the case of the garden bed with 12 little patches on the surrounding elevated wall and 6 rhombs in the middle, for a total of 18. This is possible since the outer patches are a hand-breadth higher than the planted rhombs which, therefore, do not have to be 1.5 hand-breadths distant from the border patches (the actual horizontal distance is only 1.5/√3.25 = .832.)</i>.
May one raze a <i>bet rova‘</i> and sow in it five different kinds of grain<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In one of the patterns established for a garden bed, homothetically amplified.

One of them in the first conjugation is: “to dig a well”, another one in the eighth, “to improvise”. As noted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.7.1">Chapter 2, Note 150</a>, the derived noun קראח means “plot prepared for sowing”.

Hence, the <i>bet rova‘</i>, which for separation is only a rabbinical requirement, cannot have more stringent rules.</i>, you say it is permitted, then so much more here where you are not whipped by Biblical decree.

If about a six-by-six, for whose infringement one is whipped by Biblical decree, you say it is permitted, then so much more here where you are not whipped by Biblical decree<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For a <i>bet rova‘</i> one proposes to make trapezoids with sides inclined 45°, starting out at a distance of 1.061 from the vertex and narrowing to a distance of 1.5 from the center; see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.1.2">Note 10</a>, fig. 3–4. In that case, the base is 8.084 cubits, the vertex of the isosceles triangle of angle 45° is again at distance <i>a</i> = 1.061 from the center and the length of the top of the trapezoid is again <i>t =</i> 0.878. Since in the trapezoidal configuration the plots do not touch, there is no question of “jailing”, which is permitted for garden beds and forbidden for larger fields; hence, what is permitted for garden beds in this case is also permitted for a <i>bet rova‘</i>. (The configuration of Maimonides cannot be carried over to larger fields.)</i>.
Rebbi Nassa asked: Is it not reasonable that, if the top of the surrounding wall is two hand-breadths wide, one is permitted to sow on it two kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Leave the outermost one hand-breadth square at the outer edge empty, then plant one hand-breadth square at the inner part of the 2-by-2 corner and then four times 1-by-l.5 of different kinds alternatingly on both sides of the wall along an edge, and so on all around the bed.</i>?

R.

(This is the position of Rav in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 85a" href="/Shabbat.85a">Babli, <i>Šabbat</i> 85a</a>. It is rejected there by Samuel, <i>loc. cit.</i> 85b.)</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra said, they made every single hand-breadth<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Each 1-by-l square on the elevated wall.</i> on the border wall a domain for itself.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not sow any kind of seed-plants in a garden bed<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">“Seed-plants” are plants whose seeds are used as food, such as grains and legumes. {Sometimes, זרעים denotes only grains.) “Vegetables” are plants whose edible parts are leaves and/or roots (e. g. cabbage or turnips) or the fruit is distinct from the seeds (e. g. cucumbers or melons.) Since it is not customary to sow such little quantities of seeds, one may not sow grains and similar produce in garden beds that contain multiple kinds of plants since it would look like <i>kilaim</i>. What one does with a small plot planted only with one kind is not regulated here.</i>; but one may sow any kind of vegetables in a garden bed. Mustard and smooth peas are counted as seed-plants, large peas are vegetables. A border wall that was one hand-breadth high and shrank is in order because it was in order at the start<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The “start” is planting or sowing time when the full height is required.</i>. In a furrow or a water canal one hand-breadth deep one may sow three kinds of seeds, one on each side and one in the middle.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Any kind of seeds, etc.” Mustard and smooth peas are counted as seed-plants; if one sowed them for use as vegetables he may not put them in a garden bed. Large peas and Egyptian beans sown to produce seeds one may not put in a garden bed. If one sowed them for use as vegetables he may put them in a garden bed.

But the manuscripts of the Tosephta are too corrupt here to be of any value.</i>.
“If it shrank it is in order.” Rebbi Immi said, that means for the seeds that were already on it; hence, it is forbidden to sow anew. If one transgressed and sowed, since the earlier ones are permitted, so are the new ones. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: It is acceptable that if the later ones were uprooted, the earlier ones are permitted. If the earlier ones were uprooted, what is the status of the later ones?

The mattress lies on strings that are strung from one long board to the opposite one. The bed has become impure. It is a utensil, and any utensil can become pure either by immersion in a ritual bath (which is a problem for a large bed) or by becoming unusable. The Mishnah states that if the two long boards are broken we no longer have a bed and the remainder becomes pure, even if the boards are later replaced by new ones. But if the long boards are simply removed and replaced by new ones, the impurity is not removed, even if the replacement boards break, since the old ones could be returned to their place.</i>: “If the two long boards of a bed were removed and one made two new ones in their stead but did not change the holes, if the new boards were broken, it is impure, if the old ones, it is pure, since all goes after the prior status.” That means, if the later ones were uprooted, the earlier ones are permitted. If the earlier ones were uprooted, the later ones are forbidden.
Rebbi Jonah said, Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Immi, both in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, one said one plants near a fence but not near a border wall<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">However, everybody agrees that one may sow דאש תור under all circumstances.

Since Rebbi Yose said, Rebbi Zeïra in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: One plants near a fence but not near a border wall, this means Rebbi Immi is the one who said that a border wall that lost height is in order, hence a fence which lost height is invalid. Rebbi Yose said, we also did make both statements, that a border wall that lost height is in order, hence a fence that lost height<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">To less than 10 hand-breadths, unless the fence itself was 1.5 hand-breadths wide.</i> is invalid. One plants near a fence, as we have stated (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.6.1">Mishnah 2:8</a>): “One does sow close to a fallow field, a plowed field, a stone wall, a foot path, a fence ten hand-breadths high.” One does not plant near a border wall, as we have stated (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.2.1">Mishnah 3:2</a>): “In a furrow or a water canal that are one hand-breadth deep one may sow three kinds of seeds, one on each side and one in the middle.” If you say that one may sow close to a border wall, he should sow several rows down in the ditch. The colleagues said before Rebbi Samuel bar Abin: Explain it if the top of the border wall was sown<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">One may not sow parallel to it in the ditch unless the total distance was 1.5 hand-breadths.

Is it not better to uproot one stem and sow several rows down in the ditch?

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> It is permitted that a vertex of vegetables enter<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">As before, “enter” means that it touches the last row of vegetables, not that there should be a straight line on which the last plant of the ראש תור is bordered on both sides by plants of the field.</i> a field of other vegetables, since it is visibly the end of its field<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Visual separation is all that is needed.</i>.

Rebbi Jehudah says, the width must be the width of the sole of a foot<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Exactly one hand-breadth. The language of R. Jehudah refers to the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 11:10" href="/Deuteronomy.11.10"><i>Deut.</i> 11:10</a>: “You did irrigate it with your foot like a vegetable garden.”</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A vertex<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">A quote from the Mishnah. However, the discussion is not about that sentence at all. In the opinion of R.

According to the more likely opinion of R. Eliahu Fulda, the statement refers to the one row of vegetables that one plants in a field of other vegetables.</i>, etc.” Bar Qappara stated: He sows in it only one kind.
What did Rebbi Ismael say about the width?

Samuel said, they taught only one row<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">“A row” mentioned in the Mishnah may mean “one row.” In Samuel’s opinion, two rows form a field and are subject to the rules of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.8.1">Mishnah 2:10</a>.</i>, hence two are forbidden.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If someone plants two rows of green melons, two rows of pumpkin, two rows of Egyptian beans, this is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">We are now talking about one field on which several kinds of vegetables are planted.

The distance between the two adjacent kinds, melon on one side and Egyptian beans on the other, therefore is eight cubits (plus two hand-breadths for an empty furrow on each side.) This corresponds to the opinion of R. Aqiba in the next Mishnah. However, the Sages in the next Mishnah require a swath 12 cubits wide between the two outer kinds, that is three rows of each kind.

But a melon strip, which you empowered among melon strips to save by a mere eight, will be jailed by eight, melon strips among onions, which you weakened to save only by twelve, certainly will be jailed only by eight. If you say that a melon strip among onions will be jailed only by twelve, then an argument <i>a fortiori</i> shows that a melon strip among melons should be jailed only by twelve.
So far if [the planting] is covering [the entire area]. What about producing single stalks? Just as you say of a vineyard that there is no difference between covering or producing [single stalks], so here also there is no difference between continuous planting or producing single stalks.

Eliezer permits the planting, but in the case of only three rows he will join his colleagues in forbidding it.</i>. Rav said, it is everybody’s opinion that just as two kinds join together to save so they do join together to prohibit. Our Mishnah supports Rebbi Yannai, as we have stated: “Rebbi Eliezer permits it.” Our Mishnah differs with Rav: “One row of melons, one row of pumpkin, one row of Egyptian beans, and one row of melons.” Before he started the fourth one, was it not already forbidden?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If one’s field was sown with onions and he desired to plant there rows of pumpkin, Rebbi Ismael says, he uproots two rows, plants one row, and leaves two rows of onion standing, uproots two rows, plants one row<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">A row of vegetables together with its surroundings is four cubits wide. In the interpretation of Maimonides, R. Ismael requires that a swath eight cubits wide be cleared, in which a row of pumpkin four cubits wide is planted. Hence, in the interpretation given in the Halakhah, he envisages a field with a regular pattern: Eight cubits wide onions, two cubits fallow, four cubits pumpkins, two cubits fallow, eight cubits onions, etc. (R. Simson takes the Mishnah to mean that eight cubits have to be fallow between any two beds of onion.)<br>Since onions usually are planted, not sown, either the language of the Mishnah is imprecise or one speaks of a field in which onions were sown and then thinned to produce straight rows.</i>. Rebbi Aqiba says, he uproots two rows, plants two rows, and leaves two rows of onion standing, uproots two rows, plants two rows<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">R. Aqiba requires only one furrow between different kinds. He has parallel strips of equal width, alternatingly pumpkins and onions. Then the farmer has to watch closely lest the pumpkins expand into the domain of the onions. (R. Simson holds also in this case that eight cubits have to be fallow between any two beds of onions; R. Aqiba holds that four of these eight are for tending the onions, four for tending pumpkins, and that for a single row of pumpkins one does not have to provide space around them. He holds that for a single row of pumpkins, R. Aqiba requires only four cubits to be fallow between any two beds of onions.)</i>. But the Sages say, if between one row and the next is less than twelve [cubits], he should not keep the seeds in between<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">In the interpretation of Maimonides, the Sages require only that between any two strips of pumpkin there be 12 cubits distance, but they do not require any fallow land between pumpkins and onions, except for the obligatory single furrow.

If the pattern is regular, as explained in the Mishnah, the distance is 2+8+2 = 12. If the empty spaces are all at the far side of the pumpkins, away from the onions, then the space is only 8 cubits (+ the space of the required furrows, half of which can be accounted for by the rows of pumpkins, leaving one hand-breadth empty from the space of the onions.)</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If there are less than three hand-breadths of distance between the sticks of a partition fence made from sticks, so that a kid goat cannot enter, then that is a valid partition wall<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, one may plant the vineyard up to the partition fence and on the other side one may sow his field up to the partition fence. One speaks here of a partition fence rather than a stone wall because one does not plant vines too close to a stone wall since the roots of the vines would damage the foundations of such a wall.</i>. Also, if a wall was torn down up to a length of ten cubits, that acts as a gate. If more than that, it is forbidden along the torn-down part<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">At such a place, the outside field must be separated from the vines by a minimum of four cubits. The same rule applies to the situation described in the next sentence.

If it is torn down in many places, if what is standing is more than what is torn down, it is permitted, but if the torn-down part is more than the standing one, it is forbidden at the torn-down places.

The laths one discusses here are not put into the torn-down parts but close to them, either before the front or behind the back part of the wall; therefore, they cannot be considered parts of the wall. Hence, one may plant vines up to the wall and sow produce on the other side only where an actual wall provides the separation; everywhere else the minimal distance must be 4 cubits.</i> and what is standing is four hand-breadths wide, and what is standing is more than what is torn down: where it is standing it is permitted, where it is torn down it is forbidden.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody plants one row of five vines, the House of Shammai say that this is a vineyard<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Less than 5 vines are single vines and one has to leave only 6 hand-breadths of free space around them. But a vineyard needs 4 free cubits on all four sides. In addition, while <i>kilaim</i> is forbidden to be sown near a vine, only for a vineyard both vines and seeds become sanctified and forbidden for any use; for single vines the usufruct is not forbidden.</i>. But the House of Hillel say, [a planting] is not a vineyard unless it has two rows<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">It will be clear from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.4.1">Mishnah 6</a> that the House of Hillel also put the minimal number of vines in a vineyard at 5 but require them to be planted in two rows.</i>. Therefore, if somebody sows within four cubits of a vineyard, the House of Shammai say that he sanctifies one row, but the House of Hillel say, two rows<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The extent of what becomes forbidden to use is detailed in the Halakhah.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> That is, if sown in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">This explains what is forbidden if somebody sowed too close to a vineyard. The situation is simple unless one sows at a corner of the vineyard. In the entire discussion, the seeds are sown outside the vineyard but less than 4 cubits distant from the next vine.</i>. If he sowed in front of a middle vine, in the opinion of the House of Shammai he makes the entire row forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Not the entire row in a large vineyard, but the nearest row that forms a vineyard, which is 5 vines in one row. In this case, the vine in front of which the seed was sown becomes sanctified and with it two vines on each side in the front row.</i>. In the opinion of the House of Hillel, he forbids three parallel three<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The House of Hillel define a minimal vineyard as five vines planted in two rows. So in the first row, the vine in front of which the <i>kilaim</i> was sown, and one vine on each side are sanctified. In the second row, the vine behind the middle one in the first row certainly is forbidden, as well as one vine adjacent to it. But since there is no way of deciding between left and right in this case, both are forbidden.</i>. If he sowed in front of an interval in the middle, in the opinion of the House of Shammai, he forbids two on each side. What is said about the fifth? If the seeds were close to one vine, those are forbidden; if not, they are permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">If the seed in the middle were a mathematical point, we would have a problem. But in reality, if the perimeter of the growing plant is closer to one adjacent vine than to the other, the fifth is added at the closer side. If the growing plant is right in the middle, six vines become forbidden, three on each side.</i>. In the opinion of the House of Hillel, four parallel two are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">In the next Mishnah, the House of Hillel state that a minimal vineyard consists of five vines in two rows, forming a rectangle and a “tail.” In the interpretation of Maimonides, based on Gaonic sources, the “tail” is formed by a fifth vine forming an isosceles triangle with two of the other vines, together giving the vertices of a pentagon. In the interpretation of R. Simson, the minimal vineyard consists of two rows, three vines in one and two in the other, where two vines in each row are the vertices of a rectangle. According to Maimonides, both in his Commentary and his Code, the configuration of R. Simson is explicitly excluded in the next Mishnah. However, the Halakhah here seems to support R. Simson; I fail to see how the rest of the Halakhah can be interpreted by Maimonides. According to R. Simson, three vines in the first row and two in the second become sanctified; since we cannot intrinsically distinguish here between left and right, we have to choose four vines in the first row in the case where according to the House of Shammai one would have to choose six.</i>. If he sowed opposite the corner, which row is forbidden in the opinion of the House of Shammai? Both of them<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Since the seed is supposed to be exactly on the extension of the diagonal pointing to the corner, both edges coming together at the corner are equal candidates, and one has the corner vine and four others on each edge, for a total of nine that become sanctified.</i>! In the opinion of the House of Hillel, two parallel two and one forming a tail on each side are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The vines that become sanctified are the corner vine, two adjacent ones on each of the edges, and the vine next to the corner one on the diagonal. Then in any way one looks at the configuration, one has three vines in the first and two in the second rows, and four vines form a rectangle (“two parallel two.”) The total number of forbidden vines is six. (It has to be noted that, since the vines in a vineyard are planted in orderly rows, a “tail” in the sense of Maimonides is impossible here, but not a “tail” in the sense of R. Simson.)</i>. If one sowed in an interval at the corner<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">He sows between the corner vine and one of the adjacent vines. According to the House of Shammai there is no problem; he sanctifies the first five vines defined by the corner and the adjacent vine. According to the House of Hillel there is a problem, whether to take three vines in that row and two in the next, or to consider the seed to be placed between two rows, in which case we have to take three vines in the other edge starting from the corner, and the first two vines in the next row parallel to that edge, for a total of six vines. Another possible configuration, chosen in the next sentence, is to take three vines in the row in front of which the seed is sown, and perpendicular to it one vine in the outer and two in the next row perpendicular to it. Again, four vines form the rectangle at the corner and the other vines form minimal vineyards both in the direction of the edge in front of which was sown, and perpendicular to it.</i>, in the opinion of the House of Shammai he makes the entire row forbidden. In the opinion of the House of Hillel, two parallel two and one forming a tail are forbidden. What is the sixth? The third in the first row, the second in the third row.

Rebbi Zeïra showed to the colleagues: Nine rows of seven each<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He explains the Mishnah by an example. We have a vineyard whose vines are planted 8 cubits apart from one another. This follows from the discussion later (Notes 17,18), but it is understood that one wants to construct a vineyard in which the 16-cubit rules forbid one to sow with a minimum number (10) of vines standing. Hence, the vines must be spaced as far apart as possible and still form a vineyard. In modern language, we make a model of that vineyard by drawing an (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinate system in the plane and indicating the vines by the points with integer coordinates, where in each row (“woof”) <i>x</i> = 1, 2, …, 7, and the rows are numbered by (“warp”) <i>y</i> = 1, 2, …, 9. In all, we have 63 vines. Now, we cross out alternate rows and columns, i. e., we cross out all points with coordinates <i>x</i> = 2, 4, 6 and <i>y</i> = 2, 4, 6, 8. There remain 5 <i>y</i>-coordinates (1,3,5,7,9) for each of the remaining 4 <i>x</i>-coordinates (1,3,5,7). Hence, there remain 5×4 = 20 vines.</i>.

For example, the standing vines {(1,5) (3,5) (5,5) (3,7) (5,7)} form such a vineyard, as do {(1,5) (3,5) (5,5) (3,3) (5,3)} or {(5,9) (5,7) (5,5) (3,7) (3,5)} or {(5,1) (5,3) (5,5) (3,3) (3,5)} or even {(1,5) (3,7) (5,9) (3,5) (5,7)}. In all, one may identify 8 minimal vineyards. Hence, from all angles, the pattern describes a valid vineyard. (One certainly cannot simply create one large vineyard, three times three vines plus one additional, since the maximum area covered by such a vineyard is only 1532 square cubits.)</i>.
One assumes that<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">כילו is a contracted form of כְּאִילּוּ.</i> another [vine] was planted there, for all four sides<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since R. Zeïra explains the Mishnah according to R.

In our case, one cannot actually have these vines added, because that would immediately generate three rows of three vines each, which define a large vineyard for which the rule of tail does not apply. Then the question arises of how to compute the area of the remaining vineyard. This will be dealt with in the next paragraph where it is shown that one cannot have exactly a <i>bet seah</i>(2500 square cubits) as required by the Mishnah unless one reduces the distances between the vines.</i>. One cannot actually plant on any of the four sides because it would form a tail and there is no tail for a tail. This implies that there is no tail for a large vineyard, which gives a simple answer to the question of Rebbi Yose ben Zabida in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: one considers as if another [vine] was planted there<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:4:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.4.2-4">Halakhah 4:6</a>, R.

Since 64 × 48 = 3072, the area is 572 square cubits larger than the 2500 square cubits of a <i>bet seah</i>. Since we have removed the corners, we have to remove some of the area; the problem is to do it in a uniform way to end up with 2500 square cubits. {According to Samuel in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:4:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.4.2-4">Halakhah 4:6</a>, the kite-shaped quadrilateral defined by the extremal vines in R.

How do you treat it<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Before continuing to compute, we have to settle the question whether the <i>bet seah</i> is the area defined by the standing vines or whether it includes the strip of 4 cubits all around the vineyard for tending the vineyard.</i>?

If you take it with the area to tend it within the <i>bet seah</i>, then 348 are missing<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This number is difficult to explain. All commentators change the numerical value to agree with their computation. All we can do is understand the problem. The basis of the argument is the computation underlying the next sentence. There it is established that the area of the vineyard in R. Zeïra’s example is cross-shaped (fig. 2), formed from the rectangle of sides 64 and 48 by excising corner squares of area 16×16, of area 2048 square cubits.<br>FIGURE 5-2 HERE<br>The strip of width 4 around it, not counting the corners, has area (64+48) ×2×4 = 896 square cubits. Of these four are concave corners that are counted twice, hence, one has to remove 4 times 16, for a total area of 832 square cubits. It is questionable whether one has to fill out the 90° circular sectors around the virtual vines but one has to add two 90° circular sectors of radius 4 at the two vines on the border of the vineyard. Hence, the total area in question here is <i>A</i> = 2048 + 832 + 8π = 2880 + 8π. Even if one uses the approximation π ≅ 3, <i>A</i> = 2500 + 404 and not <i>A</i> = 2500 + 348 as asserted. It is impossible to account for the missing 56 square cubits.<br>On the other hand, the number 452 in the next sentence is certainly correct and both mss. have 348 here; emendation is impossible. All we can do is discover a possible way of computing the area, keeping in mind that in computations of this kind one suppresses fractions at the end. It seems that here the boundary strip is only three cubits wide except near where real vines are standing. Let <i>h</i> be the width of the boundary strip. Then the computation of the area of the boundary strip is done in five steps.Since the perimeter of the figure is 224 (all measures in cubits), the strip along the sides except for the convex corners is A1 = 224h-4h2 since the convex corners are counted twice in the first term.On the top and bottom edges in fig. 2 are two real vines, both of which have to be enclosed in a circular domain of radius 4. Let<i>q</i> = (16-<i>h</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup>)<sup class="footnote-marker">1/2</sup><br>and<br>α = arctan <i>h/q</i>.<br>Then the center angle of the sector outside the strip is<br>φ = π - 2α;<br>the area to be added is<br><i>A</i><sub>2</sub> = 32φ - 2<i>hq</i>.<br>FIGURE 5-3 HEREAt the two vines in position (5,1) and (5,5), one adds two semicircles of radius 4 minus two isosceles right triangles of sides h, for<i>A</i><sub>3</sub> = 32π - 2<i>h</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup>.<br>FIGURE 5-4 HEREAt the four concave corners with real vines, one has to add quarter disks and subtract the parts covered by the strip wide h. The half-angle of the sector outside the strip is β = π/4 - α. This yields<i>A</i><sub>4</sub> = 128β - 64sin α (cos α - sin α).</i>. If you take it without the area to tend it, there is an excess of 452<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">FIGURE 5-5 HEREFinally, at the six convex corners occupied by virtual vines, one adds quarter discs of radius h, or A5 = 3πh2. The total area is the sum of these five. The entire computation is within the level of difficulty of Euclid’s Data. The next problem is the determination of π. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 3:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.3.1.1">Mishnaiot Eruvin 3:1</a>, Ahilut 12:6 state that π = 3. Maimonides writes that they adopted this raw approximation since in the opinion of Aristotle, the straight and the curved are original opposites and it is impossible to express curved quantities precisely in terms of linear measures. (In the framework of Archimedean mathematics, the falsity of this assertion was shown only in the Seventeenth Century by John Wallis.) Since we tend to disregard fractions in Talmudic computations, it seems reasonable to take π = 3. We do not have access to the table of chords used by the Talmudists to compute the contribution of A4 unless we want to take Ptolemy’s table (Ptolemäus, Handbuch der Astronomie, transl. K. Manitius, ed. O. Neugebauer. Leipzig 1963, pp. 37–40). This means all our computations here are only an approximate reconstruction. If we take modern values for the trigonometric functions in step 4 the total area is 800 for h = 2.94. (For h = 3, the deviation of the modern value from Ptolemy’s is negligible, about 0.001, much less than the precision of our computation.) It is reasonable to assume that in talmudic approximation, this means h = 3. [Better values of π known from Antiquity, 3 ⅛ or 3 ⅐, yield smaller values of h which have no reasonable explanation.]According to R. Joḥanan, we have to add to the standing vines the ones that complete the minimal vines, i. e., the vines at positions (1,3), (1,7), (3,1), (3,9), (7,3), (7,7). This means that from the original 64×48, at each corner we excise a square of edge length 16. The remaining area is 3072 - 4×16×16 = 3072 - 1024 = 2048 = 2500 - 452 cubits.</i>. You might say, they are separated as single ones<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since the scheme of R. Zeïra does not work out to produce 10 vines on exactly 2500 square cubits, we have to conclude that the 10 vines are isolated in the field. Then, each vine has 250 square cubits around it, which means that it is situated in the center of a square of edge √250 = 15.81 cubits. This length is also the distance of two vines (or better, the distance of the centers of any two vines) from one another, and this is just below the 16 cubits that would diqualify the field from being a “vineyard”.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A vineyard that is planted less that four cubits apart<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This violates standard agricultural practice.</i>, Rebbi Simeon says that it is no vineyard. But the Sages say that it is a vineyard and one disregards the ones in the middle as if nonexistent<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If every second vine is disregarded the remaining vines still are less than eight cubits apart and, hence, still form a vineyard. The argument of the Sages (made explicit in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 102b" href="/Bava_Batra.102b">Babli <i>Baba Batra</i> 102b</a>) is that vines planted too close to one another will not bear the best or the most fruit; hence, the vintner might plant too many vines at the start and then, when it becomes clear which vines grow best, he will take out the rest and use as wood and replant the best ones as a regular vineyard. Rebbi Simeon is of the opinion that a vineyard is planted for its yield, so he waits until the vineyard is thinned before he imposes the restrictions of a vineyard. (In the Babli, R. Simeon is interpreted to mean that nobody plants a vineyard with the intention of thinning.) The Sages think that planting for a vineyard makes a vineyard from the start.<br>It is not quite clear what the minimum distance is; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.1.1">Chapter 4, Note 2</a>. The cubit of 52.6 cm would give 210.4 cm as minimal distance of two vines. R. A. H. Nach defines the hand-breadth as 8.5 cm, which implies that 4 cubits of five hand-breadths each are 170 cm. Modern viticulture works with distances of 135 to 150 cm; one is best off by adopting the minimal interpretation of cubits.</i>.

Rebbi Ḥananiah<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">R. Ḥananiah and R. Mana disagree about the meaning of the last statement of R. Simeon. According to R. Ḥananiah, in the case of two rows of five vines each, if one disregards any vines numbered 2 and 4 in their rows, one retains two rows of three vines each forming a legal vineyard. But if one has two rows of 6 each, one eliminates either the even or the odd numbered vines; the ones eliminated would also form a vineyard and that is unacceptable in the opinion of R. Simeon. R. Mana has essentially the same argument, only he says that the disagreement concerns the first case, when one would have a vineyard in case one eliminates vines 2 and 4, but not if one eliminates 1, 3, 5. However, in the case of 6 or more vines, one always retains a valid vineyard (and the vines considered nonexistent do not give the possibility of sowing there since the distance from vine to remaining vines is less than 8 cubits.)</i> said, that applies in the case where there are six parallel six.

Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, that is, if it is round<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">As Maimonides explains, given the direction of the rows of vines, a round mound has the required size only at its diameter, but the lengths of the parallel chords go to zero and there is no separation at the circumference. For the same reason, a circular mound needs a dirt wall around the seeds.</i>. But if it is square, it does not need an empty space of four hand-breadths. Rebbi Ḥalaphta ben Shaul said<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Rome ms. reads: “R. Ḥalaphta ben Shaul stated…” Since the author belongs to the generation between Tannaïm and Amoraïm, both readings are acceptable.</i>, it needs three hand-breadths of dirt on top. Rebbi Yose said, that is, if it is round. But if it is square, it does not need three hand-breadths of dirt on top.
The Mishnah deals with the case from three to four [hand-breadths]. With less than three it is closed; from three to four one has to complete, four one may sow immediately<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The depression or cleft has to be at least three hand-breadths wide, otherwise one may easily step over it and it can be disregarded. If the width <i>w</i> is between three and four hand-breadths, one has to leave on either side an empty strip (4-<i>w</i>)/2 hand-breadths wide. If the cleft is four wide, one may sow in it up to the wall; the six hand-breadths used to tend the seeds are only needed as lengthwise separation between the vine and the seeds (R. Simson).</i>.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who plants vegetables in a vineyard or who lets them grow<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">If the edible vegetable grew from wind-borne seeds.</i> sanctifies 45 vines. When is this? In case they are planted four four or five five apart. If they were planted six six or seven seven apart, he sanctifies sixteen cubits in every direction, circular but not square<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The language of this Mishnah is so involved because of the special rule for a vineyard planted in spaces of five cubits. In general, vegetables can be planted in a vineyard only in a bald spot; according to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.1.1">Mishnah 4:1</a> that means at a distance of 16 cubits from the next vine. The rule of the Mishnah for vines planted more than 5 cubits apart is just that: In the interior of the circle of radius 16 and centered at the vegetable there may not be any vine.<br>The application of that principle to vines planted 4 apart leads to 45 sanctified vines. One assumes that the vegetable is sown closely around a vine. One takes the stern of that vine as center of a Cartesian coordinate system and takes the <i>x</i>-axis in the direction of the rows of vines, the <i>y-</i> axis perpendicular. The unit of measurement is the cubit. Points with coordinates (4<i>m</i>,4<i>n</i>) with integer <i>m</i>,<i>n</i> represent vines. According to Pythagoras, the distance from the origin is &lt;16 if and only if <i>m</i><sup>2</sup><i>+n</i><sup>2</sup><i>&lt;</i> 16. This means that for <i>m</i> = 0, ±1, ±2, <i>n</i> = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, and for <i>m =</i> ±3, <i>n</i> = 0, ±1, ±2. In all, there are 5·7 + 2·5 = 45 admissible couples (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>). This is explained in the Halakhah. There the language is that all acceptable couples are <i>m</i>,<i>n</i> = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3 except for couples (±3,±3). The case of vines planted 5 apart is not treated; one has to assume that one excludes the vines at points (5<i>m</i>,5<i>n</i>) for <i>m</i><sup>2</sup><i>+n</i><sup>2</sup><i>&lt;</i> 25 because vineyards planted 5 apart look similar to those planted 4 apart. (For an opposing opinion in the Tosephta cf. <i>Tosefta ki-fšuṭah</i> p. 629.)</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, only if he sowed near the middle vine. Rebbi Abin in the name of Samuel: Only if the middle vine is surrounded by vegetables. How is it computed? Seven rows by seven rows. Subtract from them four vines at the four corners; there are 45 vines remaining. That is what we stated: “He sanctifies 45 vines”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">All this was explained in Note</i>.
“When is this? In case they are planted four four or five five apart.” This supports Rebbi Zeïra, since Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This has to be “R.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody sees a vegetable in his vineyard and says, when I get to it I shall remove it, that is permitted; when I return I shall remove it, if in the meantime it increased by one twohundredth it is forbidden.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, they taught about the worker<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">“Somebody” mentioned in the Mishnah is not the owner, whose negligence would sanctify vines and vegetable and not just make the vegetable forbidden. It cannot be a stranger whose actions cannot influence the status of the farmer’s goods. Hence, it must refer to the farm hand who works in the vineyard for the proprietor.</i>.
They gave the owner occupied with his work the status of a farmhand<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">While the rules for the vintner are more strict that those for his employees, that only applies if he is not occupied tending his vineyard.</i>. If the owner kept field vegetables [growing] in his vineyard, they are forbidden to him and to others. If a farmhand kept field vegetables [growing] in the vineyard, they are forbidden to him but are permitted to everybody else. This is difficult. If they are forbidden to him, they should be forbidden to everybody. If they are permitted to everybody else, they should be permitted to him. It must follow Rebbi Simeon who says that nobody may sanctify anything that is not his own property. Even though Rebbi Simeon says that nobody may sanctify anything that is not his own property, he agrees here that it is forbidden to him if another person harvested it<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This is a fine for his laziness. If he did not remove the vegetable when he should have but returned later, the strict rule of the Mishnah applies.</i>; but if he himself harvested, it is forbidden to him and to everybody else.
“If it increased by one twohundredth it is forbidden.” Those of the house of Rebbi Yannai estimate by purslain. How does one check? Rav Vivian in the name of Rebbi Ḥaninah: He takes one out and leaves one in [the ground]; what the first one is less, the other did increase.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody was passing through a vineyard and accidentally dropped some seeds, or that seeds were brought there by manure or water, or someone sowed and the wind carried the seeds behind him, all this is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Unintentional contamination has no effect on the status of the vines.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Eleazar said, our Mishnah speaks of one standing in a grain field while the wind carried the seeds into a vineyard. Rebbi Zeïra inquired<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">R. Zeïra shows that the statement of R. Eleazar about the part of the Mishnah dealing with windswept seeds is a logical necessity.</i>: Was [the Mishnah] speaking about one standing in [a grain field] or even one standing [in a vineyard]? If you say in a grain field, then not in a vineyard. If you say even one standing [in a vineyard] there is no difference. Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kilayim (Lieberman) 3:12" href="/Tosefta_Kilayim_(Lieberman).3.12">Tosephta <i>Kilaim</i> 3:12</a>. the arguments of R. Zeïra and R. Eleazar are accepted by Maimonides, <i>Kilaim</i>5:17.</i>: “Rebbi Simeon ben Jehudah said in the name of Rebbi Simeon: If one was sowing and the wind carried the seeds behind him, this is permitted, since it happened by accident.” What are we dealing with? If he stands in the vineyard he is tending it, and you say it is permitted? But we must deal with the case of one standing in a grain field and the wind carried the seeds into a vineyard.
Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia: “If they produce greenery it should be plowed under:” all is permitted. “If they are green stalks, they should be broken:” the straw is permitted but the grains are forbidden. “If they produced grain it must be burned:” all is forbidden. Rebbi Joḥanan said, all is forbidden. What does our statement mean, “if they produce greenery it should be plowed under, if they are green stalks, they should be broken, if they produced grain it must be burned”? It parallels what we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Temurah 7:5" href="/Mishnah_Temurah.7.5">Mishnah <i>Temurah</i> 7:5</a>. There, Rashi in the Babli explains that “what usually is buried” is fluids, “what usually is burned” is produce. This cannot be the position of R. Joḥanan here. Maimonides in his Commentary explains the Mishnah following R. Hoshaia, whose position is easily squared with the Mishnah in <i>Temurah</i>, but in his Code (<i>loc</i>.<i>cit</i>.) he follows R. Joḥanan since it is the position of the Babli that in a disagreement between R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish, practice almost always follows R. Joḥanan. (For <i>orlah</i> cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 5:7:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.5.7.5">Note 94</a>).</i>: “<i>Orlah</i> and <i>kilaim</i> of a vineyard. Anything that usually is buried should be buried. Anything that usually is burned should be burned.”
Rebbi Jacob bar Idi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: Sometimes, the straw is permitted but the grain is forbidden, and sometimes the straw is forbidden and the grain is permitted. How is that? If his sowing was permitted but later he trained the leaves of a vine over it, the straw is permitted but the grain is forbidden If he sowed where it was forbidden and then removed the overhanging growth, the straw is forbidden but the grain is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">It is assumed that the grain developed only after the <i>kilaim</i> were removed.

Similarly, in the first case it is assumed that the vines were drawn over the grain only after the stalks reached their full height, then the stalks grew while permitted and are permitted.</i>. Rebbi Zeïra inquired: It is understandable that the straw would be permitted but the grain forbidden. If the straw should be forbidden and the grain permitted, it grew while forbidden and you say is is permitted? Rebbi Zeïra follows his own opinion, as Rebbi Zeïra said in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: An onion from <i>kilaim</i> in a vineyard that he removed from the soil and planted anew is forbidden even if it increases manifold, since growth of what is forbidden can never justify forbidden produce<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Since the onion is a root bulb, the root determines the growth of the plant. Since the root is forbidden, its growth will always be forbidden, even if the greens grow only after the <i>kilaim</i> were removed. “Justify” here means that there is enough of permitted produce (60, 100, or 200 times the amount of other produce, as the case may be) so that the prohibited produce should be considered negligible. It is asserted here that growth from a forbidden root is never permitted.</i>.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> What is a trellis<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the interpretation of most commentaries, from Hebrew ערש “crib”, Arabic عَرِبش “trellis, crib”. R. Abraham ben David in his commentary to <i>Idiut</i> 2:4 explains that five vines in a row form a vineyard for the House of Hillel only if the vines are growing on a trellis near a fence, not if the fence is used as a trellis. This is the only possible explanation in <i>Idiut</i>, but in his Commentary on this Mishnah, Maimonides explains that vines lean on or upon the (stone) fence. He gives the same interpretation in his Code (<i>Kilaim</i> 8:2) but then has to come to the conclusion (<i>loc</i>.<i>cit</i>. 8:3) that the four cubits to be measured from the fence are on the side pointing away from the vines. R. Abraham ben David protests against this interpretation which “never entered the mind of any commentator.” Maimonides’s interpretation is difficult to accept, the tortured justifications of R. David ben Zimra and R. Joseph Caro in their commentaries on the Code notwithstanding, since the vines according to the Mishnah can be up to three cubits distant from the fence.</i>? If somebody plants a row of five vines along a fence ten hand-breadths high or a ditch ten hand-breadths deep and four wide, one gives it four cubits working space. The House of Shammai say one measures four cubits between the stems of the vines and the field. The House of Hillel say, between fence and field<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For them, the trellis (or plantation) is not quite a vineyard; it is irrelevant where in the strip near the fence the vines are planted.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said, anybody who affirms this is in error; if there are four cubits between the stems of the vines and the fence one gives it its working space and he may sow the rest. What is the working space of a vine<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A single vine. For R. Ismael, five vines in a row are never a vineyard; they are a collection of single vines; the restrictions of the Mishnah apply only because the trellis is too close to the fence. But as soon as the vines are a full four cubits distant from the fence, the vines are treated as isolated. For R. Aqiba, the working space must have a diameter of six hand-breadths.</i>? Six hand-breadths in every direction; Rabbi Aqiba says three.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It is difficult. Is it not forbidden anyhow for the House of Shammai as a vineyard<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Five vines in a row constitute a vineyard for the House of Shammai, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.3.1">Mishnah 4:5</a>.</i>? Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, this was taught about a curved trellis<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Simson, the trellis is in a straight line but the vines are planted alternatingly on both sides of the trellis; they are not in a straight line. According to R. Isaac Simponti, the trellis is built as arc of circle, to provide wider spacing for the branches of the vines exposed to the sun.</i>. In that case, it would not be forbidden as a vineyard without a fence. Rebbi Jonah inquired<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation of this paragraph and the next follows R. Iehiel Michel Halevi Epstein in his notes published as <i>Mēkhal Hammayîm</i>, Wilna 1928. The question is addressed to the House of Hillel in the interpretation of R. Simeon ben Laqish. For them, two parts of the definition of a vineyard are missing; there is only one row and the vines are not planted in a straight line. The Mishnah declares a trellis in front of a fence to have a status similar to a vineyard but it is not clear whether the rules of a vineyard are valid without change. Since in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 6:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.6.4.1">Mishnah 7</a>, the space required to separate two trellises is only half the space required to separate two vineyards, it is clear that the rules of vineyards cannot be applied without change to trellises.<br>We have to assume that also along the trellis the vines are planted at least four cubits apart. Since the vines are planted in a zig-zag pattern, between two vines in the same row the distance is almost eight cubits. Rebbi Jonah now asks, according to R. Simeon ben Laqish does the forbidden area cover the union of circular disks of radius 4 centered at the vines or is the entire convex hull of that domain (the smallest convex set containing the disks) forbidden? In the first case, between the vines the minimal distance from the trellis is less than 4 cubits; this is “in between”. The answer is that only in the case of vines planted in a straight line can one say that the interior of the parallel figure to the trellis in distance 4 is forbidden; here it seems that not even the entire parallel figure to the zig-zag line connecting the vines is forbidden but only the union of the five circular disks.<br>The second question then asks whether maybe not even the entire disks are forbidden but only the union of five polygons, each centered at a vine. Let <i>v</i> denote the center of a vine, <i>a</i> the point at distance 4 from <i>v</i> on the perpendicular from <i>v</i> to the fence, <i>a’</i> the reflection of <i>a</i> in <i>v</i>. On both sides of the line <i>a’va</i> draw parallels in distance 1. They intersect the parallels to the zig-zag line through <i>a</i> and <i>a’</i> at <i>b</i>,<i>b’; c</i>,<i>c</i>’. The polygon attached to <i>v</i> is then <i>abb’a’c’ca</i>. The forbidden area around <i>a</i> now is 8, not 16π &gt; 50, and even on the zig-zag line there is an interval of almost 2 cubits that might be sown. The answer is negative, with reference to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:6:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.6.2-3">Halakhah 3:7</a>.<br>FIGURE 6-1 HERE</i>: May one sow in between? Is it in a straight line, that you say it is forbidden to sow in between? May one sow between the vines? As you say in the case of a row of gourds that it is forbidden to sow in between the pits, so here also it is forbidden to sow in between the vines.
Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Mishnah was taught about a straight trellis. In that case, would it not be forbidden as a vineyard without a fence<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For the House of Shammai.</i>? Let us say, it was stated because of the House of Hillel<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the opinion of R. Joḥanan, the presence of a trellis has no legal consequences for the House of Shammai; else he would have stated that for the House of Hillel a straight row on a trellis, for the House of Shammai even a curved trellis, would form a vineyard.</i>. Rebbi Ḥananiah said, it is reasonable to assume that Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish agrees with Rebbi Joḥanan that it was taught about a straight trellis because of the House of Hillel, and Rebbi Joḥanan agrees with Rebbi Simeon [ben Laqish] that it was taught about a curved trellis because of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri, since Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said that anybody who affirms this is in error.

Joḥanan ben Nuri only one cubit around a vine has to be left empty, but for the House of Shammai four cubits along the trellis are required. The question seems to be that in a normal case, if the trellis is parallel to the fence at a distance of three cubits there is no difference since one may not sow between the trellis and the fence (R. Yose in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 5:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.5.3.1">Mishnah 5:4</a>) and the next cubit away from the fence is forbidden according to both Houses and R. Joḥanan ben Nuri.

Joḥanan ben Nuri. But if one measures from the fence and the last vines are 4-ε cubits from the fence, then the House of Hillel forbid only a strip four cubits wide from the fence and R.

For him who says one measures from the bottom of the fence, where the string drawn from the fence ends it is forbidden, the rest is permitted. If there were two cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is a different situation and refers to the disagreement between the Houses of Shammai and Hillel, but not to R.

According to Maimonides (<i>loc</i>.<i>cit</i>.), the House of Shammai will forbid only strips of two cubits each on both sides of the trellis but the House of Hillel will forbid an additional two cubits on the other side of the fence. According to R. Abraham ben David, the explanation of Maimonides defies all logic since a fence separates in all respects. R. Abraham explains that for the House of Shammai, a strip of width 2 is forbidden on each side of the vines. If the vines are <i>d</i> cubits wide, the total width of the forbidden strip is 4+<i>d</i>. But for the House of Hillel, the width is only 4, less than the width required by the House of Shammai.</i>, only two cubits are forbidden for him who says one measures from the roots of the vines, but for him who says one measures from the bottom of the fence, another two cubits are forbidden.

For a situation comparable to the one here one has to assume that plot and trellis are enclosed by a fence ten hand-breadths high.</i>: “About a small garden surrounded by a trellis, if there is room for the vintner and his basket on each side one may sow there, if not, it may not be sown.” Rebbi Jonah said, the vintner requires one cubit, his basket one cubit on each side.

Ḥananiah must insist that the rules of trellis do not depend on the number of vines but on the number of spaces between them. In a linear order, for four spaces one needs five vines. But in a circular arrangement, four vines define four intervals. I prefer to read the statement as: “<i>Any</i> two vines form a corner, for a total of four intervals.”</i>.

For him who says one measures from the bottom of the fence, does the stem not decrease the measure of four cubits? Explain it if it was clinging to the wall. And similarly Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri here. It is reasonable to assume that Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Ismael will agree with Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri, but Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri will not agree with Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Ismael<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joḥanan ben Nuri might not agree that vines not planted in a straight line, even if strung on a trellis, ever need four cubits. But R. Yose and R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody trains a vine over part of a <i>papyrus</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Definition of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 17:3" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.17.3">Gaonic commentary to <i>Kelim</i> 17.3</a>. Some sources here and in <i>Kelim</i> have אפפיריו, a medieval commentator writes הפיפיריות. The latter reading, seeing in the prothetic א the definite article ה, is supported by the Halakhah which uses פיפור, פיפר and the similar reading of most commentaries in <i>Kelim</i>. Most moderns see in the word a form of Greek πάπυρος (but this fits better with Tosephta <i>Kelim b</i>.<i>m</i>. 5:15, כלי פפיר “paper vessels”.) According to the Geonim, one takes rope from papyrus leaves (according to Maimonides, the reeds themselves) and puts them crosswise into a frame in order to form a platform that will be supported by posts. Sources confirming the use of papyrus rope in Antiquity are adduced by Loew in Krauss’s Dictionary, <i>s. v.</i> פיפור.<br>{In view of the formal parallelism between “part of a <i>papyrus</i>” and “part of a futile tree”, “part of a fig tree”, one might also take <i>papyrus</i> as a living plant, rather than a rope or mat of papyrus fibers.<br><i>Papyrus antiquorum</i>, mostly perennial grassy plants cultivated throughout the ancient world, had multiple commercial uses: e. g., <i>Cyperus esculentus</i> with edible, oil-rich bulbs (<i>Bulbuli Trasi</i>,<i>Dulcinia</i>), <i>Cyperus officinalis</i>, used medically, <i>Cyperus textilis</i>, used in basket-weaving and paper manufacture. A papyrus plant growing near a vine would therefore also make sense in a discussion of <i>kilaim</i>. (E. G.)}</i>, he should not sow under the rest, but if he did, it does not become sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from the last sentence in the Mishnah that one speaks here of a single vine, not a vineyard or a trellis of five vines. Therefore, only a minimal distance has to be kept from the stem of the vine. Since the vine will expand, and the area below the part of the papyrus not covered by the branches and leaves of the vine is certainly more than a cubit away from the stem and can be used for other crops. However, if either the sown plants or the vine expand so that now parts of the plants are directly under the vine, the plants become forbidden. A prudent farmer, therefore, will not even start sowing close to the vine.</i>. If the new growth expands it becomes forbidden. The same applies to one who trains over parts of a futile tree<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In modern Hebrew, the term means “non-fruit-bearing tree” and סרק (2) has the general connotation of “useless, abortive”. [סרק (1) means “to comb”.] The word may be derived from the root that appears as Arabic סרק, Assyrian שרק, “to rob” (as in Saracen), a tree which robs the farmer of his labor if he would tend it. It is clear from the next Mishnah that a tree bearing cheap fruit is also אילן סרק. Because it does not bear high quality fruit, it has the same status as a rope or a beam.</i>.<br>If somebody trains a vine over part of a fruit tree he may sow under the rest.

All other Mishnah texts have: “Rebbi Joshua visited Rebbi Ismael at Kefar Aziz”, לכפר instead of מכפר. In that case, the host is R. Ismael (ben Elisha), the student of R. Joshua, who should have known his teacher’s opinion. It therefore seems likely that the Yerushalmi version is superior and the host is a minor figure mentioned only here. The paragraph establishes the previous Mishnah as R. Joshua’s.</i>. He showed him a vine trained over parts of a fig tree and asked, may I sow under the rest? He told him, it is permitted. He took him from there to the armory and showed him a vine trained over part of a beam and a sycamore stump on which were many beams. He said to him, under that one beam it is forbidden, the rest is permitted.<br>What is a futile tree? One which does not bear fruit. Rebbi Meïr says, every tree is futile except olive and fig trees. Rebbi Yose says, a futile tree is one of which one does not plant entire orchards.

Animal hides used as containers for water or wine are obtained by skinning slaughtered lambs or sheep. The skin then is open at the neck, the tail, and the four feet. If the feet and tail end are sown tight, there is no doubt that a permanent container was formed which may become impure. If the feet are only tied with rope, they also can become untied; the vessel so created is temporary and cannot become impure.

If we do not change the names in <i>Kelim</i>, the arguments of R.

A permanent knot is one that cannot be untied with one’s fingers; it is so tight that it can be removed only by cutting the rope. In that case, a tool was needed to create the openings; this action is as if one used a drill to make a hole in a pot, which destroys the vessel and makes it pure.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> An interrupted trellis is more than eight cubits. No linear measurement stated by the Sages requires “more than” except an interrupted trellis.

Rebbi Yose said, we were of the opinion that a vineyard has air space; a single vine has no air space.

This situation really should have been dealt with in our Mishnah since in that configuration there are points distant more than four cubits from any vine. Since it is not mentioned in our Mishnah, R.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody draws his vine over somebody else’s grain it sanctifies and he is responsible for its alienation<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The neighbor’s grain has to be burned but the neighbor has a claim enforceable in court against the offender. This position of the anonymous Tanna is accepted as practice in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 15b" href="/Menachot.15b">Babli <i>Menaḥot</i> 15b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon say, nobody can sanctify anything that is not his.<br>Rebbi Yose said, it happened that someone sowed in his vineyard in the Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">While the farmer remains the owner of the land in the Sabbatical year, the yield of that year is common property of all people. That means that while the vines remain private property (except for the grapes hanging on them), the grain never was the private property of the person sowing it.</i>. When this came before Rebbi Aqiba, he said nobody can sanctify anything that is not his.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:9" href="/Deuteronomy.22.9"><i>Deut</i>. 22:9</a>): “Do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard.” This refers to your own vineyard. From where about another person’s vineyard? The verse says, <i>kilaim</i>, no vineyard and no <i>kilaim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is slightly more clear in the version of <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 230 on the verse: “Do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard, lest the fulness of the seed you are sowing be sanctified together with the yield of the vineyard.” The <i>Sifry</i> reads: “I understand not only a fruit-bearing vineyard, from where a vineyard that is not fruit-bearing? The verse says ‘the vineyard’, any vineyard. I understand not only your own vineyard, from where other persons’ vineyard? The verse says ‘do not sow <i>kilaim</i>’, in any way.” R. S. Adani argues that in contrast to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a>, where the direct object precedes the predicate, in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:9" href="/Deuteronomy.22.9"><i>Deut</i>.<i>22:9</i></a> the predicate precedes the direct object and this is always taken as indicating that the prohibition stated at the beginning of the verse covers all situations the verse refers to. Hence, the operative word is not כרמך “your vineyard” but the last word of the sentence, הכרם “any vineyard.”</i> Rebbi Eleazar said, this is Rebbi Meïr’s, for Rebbi Meïr said that a Gentile cannot acquire real estate in the Land of Israel to free it from tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah makes no difference whether the neighbor is Jewish or Gentile, its author must hold that the laws of the Land are not abrogated by Gentile ownership.</i>.

Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi La: It is everybody’s opinion.

Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, this is a fine imposed by Rebbi Meïr<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The anonymous Tanna does not dispute that in principle nobody can sanctify anything that does not belong to him, parallel to the position of R. Yose in the preceding paragraph. The order to destroy the growth under the vine is purely rabbinical and intended to punish the mischievous vintner. In contrast to the Babli which always accepts R. Meïr’s decrees of fines, the Yerushalmi will accept only a fine imposed by a majority of the Synhedrion.</i>. Did he act on that, “if somebody draws his vine over somebody else’s grain …”? But what did that person do? When it grows, it grows according to his intention<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">What could be the reason to impose the fine? When a person draws a vine over somebody else’s grain, both the vine and the grain are permitted and legitimate. Since later he does not do anything further, of what could he be guilty? The answer is that the grain will continue to grow and that increase under the vine is a necessary consequence of the earlier action and covered by the responsibility for the prior action. In the language of the Babli, nobody can claim missing intent by stating that he wanted only to cut off his victim’s head, not to kill him. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 100b" href="/Bava_Kamma.100b">Babli (<i>Baba Qama</i> 100b</a>) extends the liability to the case when a stone fence between a vineyard and a grain field developed a hole and the owner after being apprised of the problem did nothing to repair it.</i>.

Does Rebbi Eleazar take a fee? Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Abuna: One who takes it into his hand has the status of one who takes a fee<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that this argument is an echo of the rule that a single judge who is shown to be in error has to pay the money he erroneously took from one party if he actually handled the money himself (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:4:2-5:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.4.2-5.4"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:4</a>, fol. 47a).

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun does not say so, but Rebbi Eleazar says that this fine is imposed by the rabbis; Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish says the fine is imposed by Rebbi Meïr. When the case came before Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, he asked Rebbi Eleazar, who imposed this fine? He [Rebbi Eleazar] said, the rabbis. He [Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish] answered him, go and pay<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simeon ben Laqish required R. Eleazar to pay not because the law was that he had to pay, but because R. Eleazar thought the law was that he had to pay. It follows that the Yerushalmi rejects the decrees of R.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, everybody agrees that the grapes will be forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">They belong to the offending party.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar said to him, what makes forbidden is not forbidden and what is not forbidden will be forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">If the vine is drawn in a state in which it does not expand any further, only the growth of the grain under it makes the configuration forbidden, as stated earlier.

Up to one third<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Since usually agricultural work cannot be done on the intermediate days of a holiday, the workers will know that the farmer is in a bind and raise their wage demands.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Abba bar Jacob in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: So is the Mishnah: One may harvest it even on a holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">One should not think that the Mishnah prescribes that the illegal grain must be harvested on a holiday if the field reverts to its rightful owner on a holiday. All that is stated is that one may harvest it because it looks badly (if the workers are not too expensive) even though nobody can sanctify anything that is not his and harvesting on the intermediate days of a holiday is forbidden (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Sukkah 30b" href="/Tosafot_on_Sukkah.30b"><i>Tosaphot Sukkah</i> 30b</a>).</i>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> <i>Kilaim</i> in a vineyard are forbidden to be sown or kept and are forbidden for any use. <i>Kilaim</i> of grains are forbidden to be sown or kept but are permitted for eating and certainly for use. <i>Kilaim</i> of textiles are permitted for everything; they are only forbidden to be worn. <i>Kilaim</i> of animals may be raised and kept; they are only forbidden to be mated. <i>Kilaim</i> of animals are forbidden [to be mated] with one another<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since a mule is part horse and part donkey, mating of two mules implies double mating of parts of horse with parts of donkey and is forbidden for human intervention.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “<i>Kilaim</i> in a vineyard are forbidden,” etc. It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:9" href="/Deuteronomy.22.9"><i>Deut</i>. 22:9</a>): “Do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard.” Not only sowing, how about keeping? The verse says, vineyard and no <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 7:3:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.7.3.2">Chapter 7, Note 44</a>. The parallel to this argument is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Kedoshim" href="/Sifra,_Kedoshim"><i>Sifra Qedošim</i> 2(18</a>) [<a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 2b" href="/Moed_Katan.2b">Babli <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 2b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 64a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.64a"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 64a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Makkot 21b" href="/Makkot.21b"><i>Makkot</i> 21b</a>]: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a>): “ ‘Your field you should sow no <i>kilaim</i>.’ Not only sowing, how about keeping? The verse says, no <i>kilaim</i>, I told you only because of <i>kilaim</i>.” This argument covers grains, vegetables, and vines. However, the same verse also mentions <i>kilaim of</i> animals and textiles in similar language and these may be kept in the opinion of the Mishnah. It follows that a derivation based on the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a> has to be rejected and only an argument parallel to that in Chapter 7 is acceptable.</i>. Does this follow Rebbi Aqiba, for Rebbi Aqiba said that he who keeps [<i>kilaim</i>] transgresses a prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">“Prohibition” usually refers to a criminal offense. “Forbidden” refers to a moral obligation. Since the statement of R. Aqiba in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kilayim (Lieberman) 1:15" href="/Tosefta_Kilayim_(Lieberman).1.15">Tosephta <i>Kilaim</i> 1:15</a> deals with <i>kilaim</i> of seeds (grains and vegetables), he cannot imply that passively keeping <i>kilaim</i> is prosecutable as a criminal offense. However, in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 2b" href="/Moed_Katan.2b">Babli (<i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 2b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 64a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.64a"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 64a</a>), R. Aqiba is quoted in a <i>baraita</i> to the effect that keeping <i>kilaim</i> is a criminal offense. This forces Rashi and the other commentators to conclude that “keeping” here means “fencing in” or a similar activity. (Rashi to <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 2 is lost; the commentary is in <i>Avodah Zarah</i>.) The Yerushalmi has no such difficulty.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, it is the word of everybody. Everybody agrees that what is forbidden is forbidden if he did not preserve through an action, but if he preserved through an action he is whipped, as it is stated: He who covers <i>kilaim</i> is whipped.
From where that it is forbidden for any use? It is said here (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:9" href="/Deuteronomy.22.9"><i>Deut</i>. 22:9</a>) “lest you sanctify it” and it is said elsewhere (lest it become sanctified by it)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There is no such verse in the entire Hebrew Bible. It is the consensus of the commentators that it should read פן תנקש (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 12:30" href="/Deuteronomy.12.30"><i>Deut</i>. 12:30</a>) “lest you be caught”, speaking of idolatrous objects that must be destroyed and every use of which is explicitly forbidden. One applies the principle that words in the Pentateuch have one invariable meaning; if that meaning is spelled out at one place, it can be transferred to any other occurrence of the same word.</i>. Since “lest” there means it is forbidden for any use, “lest” here means it is forbidden for all use. Some want to say, it is said here “lest you sanctify it” and it is said at another place “there shall be no <i>qadeš</i> among the Israelites.” Since <i>qdš</i> there means forbidden for any use, so <i>qdš</i> here must mean forbidden for any use. Rebbi Huna said, his sex act is forbidden for all use<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>qadeš</i> is the Semitic male temple prostitute. In the Talmudim, the notion which had become obsolete at that time was extended to all sexual relations of persons who could not legally marry one another, such as the relation between a slave and a free woman, or of a free Jew and a slave girl or a Gentile. Since the woman could not hope to be married, she could have no gain from the sex act; any pleasure she might have is strictly forbidden.</i>. Some want to understand it from the following, as Rebbi Ḥanina said, “lest you sanctify it”, lest fire should be kindled<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The same argument is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 56b" href="/Kiddushin.56b">Babli <i>Qiddušin</i> 56b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 115a" href="/Chullin.115a"><i>Ḥulin</i> 115a</a> in the name of Ḥizqiah. No Tannaitic source proposes to change the text from תקדש to תקד אש.</i>.”
It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:9" href="/Deuteronomy.22.9"><i>Deut</i>. 22:9</a>): “Do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard.” This teaches us that one is not guilty unless he sows two kinds in the vineyard, the words of Rebbi Josia<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text לא תזרע כרמך כלאים is somewhat ambiguous. One may translate “do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard” or “do not sow your vineyard as <i>kilaim</i>.” R. Josia chooses the first possibility, R. Jonathan the second. There is no question that the verse of <i>Deut</i>. contains the rule of sanctification that does not apply to the situation of the verse in <i>Lev:</i>, the question is why the second verse does not refer to the first.</i>. Rebbi Jonathan said, even one kind. In the opinion of Rebbi Jonathan it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a>) “in your field do not sow <i>kilaim</i>”, why does it say “do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard”? The colleagues say, to make it sinful even with one kind. In the opinion of Rebbi Josia, “in your field do not sow <i>kilaim</i>”; why does it say “do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard”? The colleagues say, as a warning. If he was warned about “your field”, he is whipped, if he was warned about “your vineyard”, he is whipped<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In talmudic legal theory, a verdict of guilty cannot be pronounced unless criminal intent was shown by the testimony of two witnesses. The standard way of proving intent is the testimony that the perpetrator was warned not to commit such and such an act because it is forbidden in the Torah and that therefore he committed the act in the knowledge of its illegality. The prohibition must be specified. In our case, since sowing something in a vineyard turns the vineyard into a field, either of the verses may be used. This almost impossible standard of proof is needed only in order to convict somebody under biblical law which knows only flogging and the death penalty; it does not have to be strictly adhered to for convictions under police powers for which the punishment is jailtime.</i>. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, to give another measure besides six hand-breadths; here it is four cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Conviction for sowing <i>kilaim</i> in an enclosed field (and single vines considered as fields) is possible only if a minimal distance of six hand-breadths was not observed; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:9:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.9.2-5">Halakhah 1:9</a>. Four cubits is the minimum distance for an enclosed vineyard. The existence of two different verses is a precondition to the establishment of two different legal standards.</i>. What are we talking about<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">One tries to clarify the statement of R. Abun bar Ḥiyya. If the field is not enclosed, no minimum separation is required but only clear geometric shapes. If the field is enclosed either the enclosure passes through the vineyard, in which case there is no legal vineyard, or it encloses the vineyard, in which case the more stringent rules of the circumference apply (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.4.1.1">Mishnah 4:1</a>). The only possibility is that the field itself is the enclosure, that a spot was cleared inside the field containing a four-by-four square, to be used for planting an illegal vineyard.</i>? If he made a fence on the inside, the vineyard is abolished. If he made a fence on the outside, that is the circumference. But we deal with a field that was a grain field and he cleared four cubits in its midst. This agrees with what Rebbi Ḥanina said, nothing forbidden may form a separation to save. They were of the opinion that what is forbidden does form a separation to prohibit<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is explained in Chapter Four, Note 28.</i>. In the opinion of Rebbi Jonathan it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a>): “In your field do not sow <i>kilaim</i>”, why does it say: “Do not sow <i>kilaim</i> in your vineyard”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Abun bar Ḥiyya, why does R. Jonathan use the verse to declare that somebody can be convicted of a biblical crime by sowing one foreign kind in a vineyard since the verses are needed to establish two different standards? This question is not a repetition of the one asked at the start of this paragraph.</i>? For that which Rebbi Hila said, if you would say [the Torah] did not say it, what would you say<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse is needed first for the more stringent standard and then for the problem of sanctification, it is impossible to think that it should not have been written.</i>? Or following what Rebbi Zeïra said, “do not sow your vineyard <i>kilaim</i>,” creating your vineyard do not sow <i>kilaim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">He takes the verse literally, “do not sow your vineyard as <i>kilaim</i>”, not, as we would think, that “do not sow” refers to a preexisting vineyard which usually is planted, not sown. The only transgression that can be punished by biblical standards, i. e., whipping, is creating a vineyard as <i>kilaim</i>, sowing while the planted vines take root.</i>
Rebbi Yudan from Kappadokia asked before Rebbi Yose: There they say that tree seeds are called seeds but here you say that tree seeds are not called seeds. He said to him: There the verse excluded them since usually people do not call them “seeds,” but here the verse added (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:37" href="/Leviticus.11.37"><i>Lev</i>. 11:37</a>) “any sown seed that may be sown.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The text is from Tractate <i>Peah</i>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 1:4:2-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.1.4.2-6">Halakhah 1:4</a>, and is explained there in Notes 252–253. “There” is here, Tractate <i>Kilaim</i>, “here” is in <i>Peah</i>. No tree seeds form <i>kilaim</i> with grain and vegetables except grape seeds.</i>
Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Yannai: He who covers <i>kilaim</i> is whipped. Rebbi Joḥanan said to him: Is that not a Mishnah? “<i>Kilaim</i> in a vineyard.” How are <i>kilaim</i> possible by ploughing<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since a standard vineyard is planted with four cubits between vines and rows, there is no space for a plough which needs four cubits on each side. Hence, anything sown has to be sown on the unploughed earth and then covered; the verse calls covering seeds with earth “sowing”.</i>? It must be by covering! Rebbi Yannai praised him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 46:6" href="/Isaiah.46.6"><i>Is</i>. 46:6</a>:) “Those who pour out gold from the wallet, etc.” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 3:21" href="/Proverbs.3.21"><i>Prov</i>. 3:21</a>) “My son, they should not be removed from your eyes,” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 9:9" href="/Proverbs.9.9"><i>Prov</i>. 9:9</a>) “give to the wise that he shall become wiser,” let the wise listen<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse: “inform the just”.</i> “that he increase in knowledge.” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, after all these praises I can explain it following Rebbi Aqiba since Rebbi Aqiba said that he who keeps [<i>kilaim</i>] transgresses a prohibition. Rebbi Aqiba said only that he transgresses, did he say to whip? Here we are dealing with whipping. Further, from what we have stated “Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Eleazar, everybody agrees that ploughing in the Sabbatical year is a criminal offense, while according to R. Joḥanan everybody agrees that ploughing in the Sabbatical year is not a criminal offense. There is no way to single out R. Aqiba’s opinion.</i>.” Can you say that the Sabbatical year follows Rebbi Aqiba? Explain the Sabbatical year following Rebbi Eleazar, as Rebbi Eleazar said, one whips because of ploughing in the Sabbatical. Rebbi Joḥanan said, one does not whip because of ploughing in the Sabbatical. What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:2" href="/Leviticus.25.2"><i>Lev</i>. 25:2</a>) “The Land should keep a Sabbath for the Eternal,” a general statement. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:4" href="/Leviticus.25.4"><i>Lev</i>. 25:4</a>) “Your field you should not sow, your vineyard you should not prune,” detail. Sowing and trimming were in the general statement, why were they detailed? To trap with them and to tell you that just as sowing and pruning are particular as agricultural work on the earth or on a tree, so everything that is agricultural work on the earth or on a tree [is forbidden]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian version of this argument is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 3a" href="/Moed_Katan.3a">Babli <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 3a</a>, a tannaïtic version in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar" href="/Sifra,_Behar"><i>Sifra Behar</i> 1</a>. [Cf. Sanhedrin 7:5, reference from Addenda and Corrigenda by Guggenehimer] A comparison with the Babli should use only manuscripts or early editions; the current versions have been corrupted by editors, cf. <i>Diqduqe Sopherim ad loc</i>. The relevant verses are <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:2-5" href="/Leviticus.25.2-5"><i>Lev</i>. 25:2–5</a>: “(2) Speak to the Children of Israel and tell them, when you shall come to the Land which I am giving you, the Land shall rest for a Sabbath of the Eternal. (3) Six years you shall sow your field, six years you shall prune your vineyard and eat its yield. (4) But in the Seventh year, the Land shall have a Sabbath of rest; do not sow your field, do not prune your vineyard. (5) Your harvest’s aftergrowth you shall not harvest, the grapes of your wild growth you shall not gather, a year of rest shall be for the Land.” One’s first impulse would be to consider verses (4) and (5) as a unit, following the rule known as כלל ופרט וכלל (the seventh rule of R. Ismael, <i>Sifra</i> introduction) that details flanked by general statements have to be taken as examples, rather than for themselves, and that all activities forbidden are those described by the intersection of the intensional definitions of the examples. This interpretation led the later editors of the Babli astray. The problem is that verse 4 by itself seems to have the structure כלל ופרט, a general statement followed by a particular one, which would imply that the particular statement is to be taken literally; nothing is covered by the general statement that is not covered by the particular one. This forces the Babli to conclude that even R. Eleazar agrees with the principle [anonymous in the Yerushalmi, attributed to R. Ilaï (Hila, La) in the Babli] that a positive general statement and a negative particular one cannot form a unit. {The inverse statement, that a negative general statement and a positive particular one must be considered as unrelated, is an anonymous remark in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 7a" href="/Yevamot.7a">Babli <i>Yebamot</i>7a</a>.}<br>If the first and the second parts of verse 4 have no direct connection, the question arises (in the formulation of <i><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar" href="/Sifra,_Behar">Sifra Behar</a></i>) whether one could think that all work is forbidden in the Seventh Year, including building roads and repairing aqueducts. The second part of the verse describes what is really forbidden. The second rule invoked here by R. Eleazar is <i>heqqēš</i>“trapping”, meaning that a rule exemplified by different cases applies to all cases subsumed under the intersection of the intensional definitions of the examples. Everybody agrees that a rule exemplified by three different examples only applies to these three and nothing else, and a rule exemplified by one example applies to everything similar unless restricted, e. g., by the use of a definite article. A rule exemplified by two examples is problematic; some think these are examples only if they appear at different places and some hold that for illustration of a general rule the examples must appear in the same verse. This is the basis of the following disagreement between R. Eleazar and R. Joḥanan. (For the meaning of all these rules, cf. H. Guggenheimer, <i>Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition</i>, in: Ph. Longworth, ed., <i>Confrontations with Judaism</i>, London 1966.)</i>. How does Rebbi Joḥanan deal with this? They are two things and two things that are specified from a general notion divide<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The examples are separate; they cannot be used in <i>heqqēš</i>.</i>. Does Rebbi Eleazar not hold that they divide? He holds that they do not divide but instruct. Does Rebbi Joḥanan not hold that they instruct? It is different here because the general statement is a positive commandment and the details are prohibitions; no positive commandment implies anything for a prohibition and no prohibition implies anything for a positive commandment.
According to R. Joḥanan it is obvious that one is permitted to dig in it<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbatical year. If ploughing is permitted, digging certainly is.</i> cisterns, ditches, and caves. According to R. Eleazar, may one dig in it cisterns, ditches, and caves? If the verses have no implication for prohibition they cannot have implications for permission<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The question is asked the wrong way: If R. Joḥanan asserts that two examples together do not prove anything, they cannot prove that something is permitted. On the other hand, R. Eleazar (following <i><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Behar" href="/Sifra,_Behar">Sifra Behar</a></i>) only prohibits work on the field and in the vineyard, certainly not digging ditches.</i>.
Rebbi Abba from Carthage said, the reason of Rebbi Joḥanan is (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:3" href="/Leviticus.25.3"><i>Lev</i>. 25:3</a>): “Six years you shall sow your field”, not in the Seventh, “six years you shall prune your vineyard,” not in the Seventh. Every prohibition derived from a positive commandment is a positive commandment; he transgresses a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In the opinion of R. Abba from Carthage, R. Joḥanan only asserted that ploughing is not overstepping a formal prohibition. For him, ploughing is still forbidden but the prohibition is not one of criminal law since it is formulated in a positive way.</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah said, he transgresses a positive commandment. Rebbi Yasa said, there is not even a positive commandment! Why is it written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:2" href="/Leviticus.25.2"><i>Lev</i>. 25:2</a>): “the Land shall rest for a Sabbath of the Eternal?” For the prohibitions in it<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">He (R. Assi) sticks with the prior explanation that two simultaneous examples do not imply <i>heqqeš</i>; “the prohibitions in it” are the two prohibitions spelled out in the verse.</i>.
“I could think one would whip because of the additions.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is a quote from a <i>baraita</i>; a similar one, also quoted in two separate pieces, is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 3b" href="/Moed_Katan.3b">Babli <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 3b</a>. A <i>baraita</i> starting with “I could think that …” always ends with showing that it is not so. The “additions” are prohibitions not explicitly stated in the Pentateuch.</i>” Rebbi Joḥanan explains the <i>baraita</i>, I could think that one would whip because of ploughing in the Sabbatical. Rebbi Eleazar explains the <i>baraita</i>, I could think that one would whip because of the prohibition of the first two terms<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition to work after the harvest of the year preceding the Sabbatical, two different terms, one for fields and one for orchards (<i>Ševi‘it</i> 1:1,2:1). These regulations have purely rabbinical character; the Biblical prohibition extends only to a short time before New Year’s Day. R. Eleazar will agree that even transgression of the latter prohibition is not punishable in court but the expression “two terms” is inappropriate since it refers to rabbinical extensions.</i>. Some Tannaïm state (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:3" href="/Leviticus.25.3"><i>Lev</i>. 25:3</a>): “Six years you shall sow your field, six years you shall prune your vineyard.” Some Tannaïm state (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:4" href="/Leviticus.25.4"><i>Lev</i>. 25:4</a>) “Your field you should not sow, your vineyard you should not prune.” He who states: “Six years you shall sow your field, six years you shall prune your vineyard,” supports Rebbi Joḥanan. He who states: “Your field you should not sow, your vineyard you should not prune,” supports Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The implications of these verses for the positions of the authors have been explained in the previous paragraphs.</i>.
A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>baraita</i> is preserved in <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 70–71, on the verses (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 12-13" href="/Deuteronomy.12-13"><i>Deut</i>. 12–13</a>): “<i>Guard yourself</i> not to present your burnt offerings at every place you see. Only at the place which the Eternal will choose from one of your tribes, there <i>you should present</i> your burnt offerings and there <i>you should perform</i> all that I am commanding you.” The first verse contains a prohibition, the second a positive commandment and because of this difference, the verses cannot be taken together in the way R. Eleazar interpreted a similar situation regarding the Sabbatical year. Hence, R. Eleazar seems to contradict tannaïtic attitudes. Since in our sources R. Eleazar’s interpretation of the verses <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:2-5" href="/Leviticus.25.2-5"><i>Lev</i>. 25:2–5</a> is found in <i>Sifra</i>, one may take this as an indication that <i>Sifra</i> was unknown to the compilers of the Yerushalmi, and that <i>Sifra</i> is a Babylonian compilation of tannaïtic material as is traditionally asserted.</i>. “ ‘Guard yourself’ means a prohibition. And it is written: There you should present, there you should perform.” Because that is written, otherwise I would have said it is a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:13" href="/Leviticus.25.13">Verses 13–14</a> show that sacrificing outside the precincts of the Tabernacle or the Temple is a criminal offense (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:13" href="/Leviticus.25.13">v. 13</a>) and a disregard of a positive injunction (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:14" href="/Leviticus.25.14">v. 14</a>). The two verses are parallel, not logically consecutive as R. Eleazar would require.</i>. But that you should not say as you say regarding the Sabbath that if somebody dug a hole, made a ditch, and dug to put in a pole, he is guilty only of one offense, so similarly, if somebody slaughtered, sprinkled the blood, and presented he should be guilty only of one offense<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">An argument is given that R. Eleazar could justify the different treatment of an apparently similar situation.<br>The Sabbath prohibitions are classified under 39 categories of “main works”. An action similar to one of the main works is called a derivative. For example, ploughing as a preparation for sowing and digging a hole for the planting of a tree are main work and derivative respectively. If somebody performed both a main work and one of its derivatives in error, he has to bring one sacrifice of atonement. But if he transgressed prohibitions belonging to two distinct categories, he has to bring two sacrifices. In the case of sacrifices outside the Temple, presenting the sacrifice on the altar is really the last action; it is preceded first by the slaughter of the sacrificial animal and second by the sprinkling of its blood on the walls of the altar. These actions are classified as “performing”. Since the order of the actions is inverted, first “presenting” then “acting”, it follows that they are distinct and that slaughter and sprinkling are not legally derivatives of presenting. {In the <i>Sifry</i>, the interpretation is that the prohibition covers only those actions that are simultaneously a criminal offense and a disregard of a positive injunction.}</i>. Therefore, it is necessary to say that he is guilty for each action separately.
Rebbi Zeïra, Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi in the name of Cahana<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi was among the older students of Rav, Cahana mentioned here cannot be the one who went to study under R. Joḥanan but must be an older Sage (Cahana I) who already was a recognized authority when Rav returned from Galilee to Babylonia.</i>: He who is planting on the Sabbath is guilty because of sowing<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Sowing is the category, planting a derivative.</i>. Rebbi Zeïra said, he who prunes is like one who plants. If he planted and pruned on the Sabbath, according to Cahana he is guilty on two counts, according to Rebbi Zeïra only on one count. Did not Rebbi Zeïra say the pruner is like the planter, did he say the planter is like the pruner<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Pruning is a subcategory of sowing concerning the Sabbath just as planting is, but planting is not like pruning for the Sabbatical year since planting belongs to sowing.</i>? All was included in the notion of sowing; pruning was singled out for particular stringency<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Following the argument made for the Sabbath, it would not have been necessary to have pruning singled out in the laws of the Sabbatical. Since it is obvious that for the Sabbatical, pruning is a separate offense, pruning can be a subcategory of sowing for the Sabbath only as a stringency, not a leniency.</i>. Because pruning was singled out for particular stringency you want to exempt it because of sowing? There is no difference, both according to Cahana and according to Rebbi Zeïra he is guilty on two counts.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not tie a horse to the sides or the back of a cart, or a Libyan donkey to camels.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Only [wool and linen] are forbidden as <i>kilaim</i>”. It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:11" href="/Deuteronomy.22.11"><i>Deut</i>. 22:11</a>): “Do not wear <i>ša‘aṭnez</i>, wool and linen together.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 232, the text is somewhat more complete: “I would say one is only forbidden to wear it; from where do we know that one may not cover oneself with it (in a blanket)?”</i> I would say one is only forbidden to wear it; the verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:19" href="/Leviticus.19.19"><i>Lev</i>. 19:19</a>): “It shall not come on you.” If it shall not come on you I would say one may not carry a chest on his back<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A peddler’s chest full of textiles to peddle to Gentiles.</i>; the verse says “do not wear.” Since a garment is specifically useful to the body, [included are] only things useful to the body. Why was it said that “it shall not come on you?” Rebbi Niḥa bar Sava<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A Galilean Amora of the fifth generation, student of R. Jonah. Since R. Zeïra was R. Joḥanan’s student, it is clear that the second name in the list must be “R. Jonah”.

I would say, it includes even sea flax<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Shell silk, also called “byssus”, from threads, excreted by shells under water, which harden when exposed to air, used already in antiquity.</i>, even hemp; the verse says “wool and linen”; just as wool cannot have an epithet so nothing else can have an epithet. From where that [wool] has no epithet? Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="II Kings 3:4" href="/II_Kings.3.4"><i>2K</i>. 3:4</a>) “Mesha‘, the king of Moab, was a <i>nôqēd</i>;” what is a <i>nôqēd</i>?

“Only wool and linen can become impure by mold disease,” for it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:47" href="/Leviticus.13.47"><i>Lev</i>. 13:47</a>) “on woolen cloth or on linen cloth.” I could think they can become impure whether dyed or natural; the verse says “woolen cloth or linen cloth.” Just as linen is in its natural state so wool must also be in its natural state<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Braita d'Rabbi Yishmael 13" href="/Sifra,_Braita_d'Rabbi_Yishmael.13"><i>Sifra Paršat Nega‘im</i> 13(3–4</a>).

I might exclude what was dyed by humans but not what was dyed by nature; the verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:48" href="/Leviticus.13.48"><i>Lev</i>. 13:48</a>): “For <i>the</i> linen and for <i>the</i> wool<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The implied definite article restricts this to what is certainly called linen and woolen cloth, not, תכלת, ארגמן, תולעת שני, etc. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 17a" href="/Bekhorot.17a">Babli (<i>Bekhorot</i> 17a</a>) quotes a <i>baraita</i> using the same verse to exclude wool from <i>kilaim</i> of sheep and goats.</i>”, just as linen is white so wool has to be white.
We have stated two rules and they do not resemble one another. We have stated: Only wool and linen are forbidden as <i>kilaim</i>, whether dyed or white. We have stated: Only wool and linen can become impure by mold disease, but only white. Rebbi Jonah from Bostra asked before Rebbi Mana: There, you say “whether dyed or white”, but here you say “but only white”? He said to him, there is a difference because the verse repeated twice “wool, wool”; just as linen is in its natural state so also wool must be in its natural state.
<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the priestly garments mentioned in the Mishnah. A parallel is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 71b" href="/Yoma.71b">Babli <i>Yoma</i> 71b</a>.</i> Rebbi Zeïra said: It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 16:4" href="/Leviticus.16.4"><i>Lev</i>. 16:4</a>) “He shall wear a garment of holy <i>bad</i>,” growing singly<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since בד can mean (1) single strand, connected with Hebrew בדד, Arabic بدّ “to separate”, or (2) linen cloth.

In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Acharei Mot" href="/Sifra,_Acharei_Mot"><i>Sifra Aḥare</i> 1(3</a>) בד is taken to mean “double cloth”.</i>. But wool also grows in single strands<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Nothing here proves that בד means linen cloth, not woolen cloth; this shows that the modern acceptation of בד “cloth (of any kind)” was current in the times of the Yerushalmi.</i>. It is explained in tradition (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ezekiel 44:17" href="/Ezekiel.44.17"><i>Ez</i>. 44:17</a>): “There should be no wool on them when they officiate inside the inner doors<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In order to make the point clear, the verse is slightly misquoted, “inner doors” instead of “the gates of the inner courtyard”. Since the courtyard reserved for the priests had no gates, the sentence is taken as referring to the <i>ṭriqsin</i> cubit (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 8:4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.8.4.5">Chapter 8, Note 93</a>).</i>.” Therefore, on the outside wool may be on them. From where that they may wear <i>kilaim</i>? As it says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 39:28" href="/Exodus.39.28"><i>Ex</i>. 39:28</a>): “The cap of byssus, the hat-turbans of byssus, the cloth trousers of spun byssus, and the belt of spun byssus, blue, purple, and crimson<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">One has to prove that “blue, purple, and crimson” mentioned in the description of the priestly garments and the gobelins of the Tabernacle always refers to blue, purple, and crimson wool.</i>.” And it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ezekiel 44:18" href="/Ezekiel.44.18"><i>Ez</i>. 44:18</a>): “Linen turbans shall be on their heads, linen trousers shall be on their hips, they shall not belt with sweat.” You infer “byssus” from “byssus”, “byssus” from “turbans”, “turbans” from “turbans”.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This proves that שש means “linen cloth”. שש is defined by its use as material for the priests’ turbans, which are described as made of linen by Ezechiel. [The Babli (Note 14) interprets שש to mean “spun six-fold”; this is not known to the Yerushalmi.]</i> Just as crimson is made from a living being, so the rest is made from a living being<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since the red color of crimson is made from insects [<i>Sifra Meẓora‘</i> (14)], so the material of the series in which crimson appears should be of animal origin. {In Hebrew, the terms חיים and דוח חיים only apply to animals, never to plants.} Therefore, it should be some kind of wool. The next sentence then refers back to the discussion that only sheep’s wool and linen do not need a qualifier in their descriptions.</i>. Just as wool cannot have an epithet so linen cannot have an epithet.
Rebbi Jonah, Ulla bar Ismael in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: Blended wool and flax are forbidden. What can one do? One adds more than a pound of camel’s hair and makes it insignificant<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It is a general principle in Jewish law that one may not neutralize a prohibited substance by mixing it with a large quantity of permitted material. R. Eleazar notes that the Mishnah here decrees a remarkable exception in that wool and flax blended before spinning can be made acceptable by using for every pound of <i>kilaim</i> somewhat more than a pound of neutral material. This does not apply to woolen or linen threads which together in one garment always constitute <i>kilaim</i>.</i>. Abba bar Rav Huna in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">He is Rav Jeremiah in the Babli. Since R.

Vessels can only acquire original impurity if they are made to be sat on; they become actually impure if a person with gonorrhea sits on them, if they carry his “load”. In all other cases, vessels can only acquire derivative impurity; this is exemplified by a vessel standing in the same tent with a corpse. Hence, “impure by the dead” in these Mishnaiot simply means “may acquire derivative impurity.” Vessels or textiles that are only used to serve other vessels, not humans directly, cannot become impure (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 16:7" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.16.7">Mishnah <i>Kelim</i> 16:7</a>).

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Tags of weavers and washermen<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Little bits of cloth with the name of the client stitched to cloth or garment. They may not be from a material making <i>kilaim</i> with cloth or garment.</i> are forbidden because of <i>kilaim</i>.

But if there are at least two needle-stitches, so that the two ends of the thread are on the same side, this is a connection as for <i>kilaim</i>, impurity, and the Sabbath.</i>. If the two ends appear on the same side it is a connection, it falls under <i>kilaim</i>, and if he removes it on the Sabbath he is guilty. Rebbi Jehudah says, only if there are three pin-stitches.

All <i>Sifry</i> mss.

The <i>Sifry</i>, in the understanding of Maimonides, reads: “ ‘Together’ in any way, this forces you to state that sack and chest bring together.”</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Ḥanina said, not until it comes down an entire side<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">For him, woolen and linen cloth create <i>kilaim</i> only if a full seam was sown.

[This paragraph and the next are also in <i>Šabbat</i> 7 (fol. 10c)].</i>. Rebbi Yannai said, they said to Rebbi Ḥanina, get out and read! Did we not state, “if the two ends appear on the same side?” That means, only if it goes down and up.

The thread is a connection for cloth but not for the needle. Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose both say, only if it is knotted on both sides.

That does not mean that in the case of the Mishnah R. Eliezer requires three needle-stitches; maybe two needle-stitches only, and R. Eliezer may disagree with R. Jehudah about sewing.

Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: They stated only “sack”. Hence not a basket. It was found stated: The basket, the sack, and the chest bring together for <i>kilaim</i>.
