Jerusalem Talmud Demai



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The easy ones for <i>demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The definition of <i>demay</i> is given in the Introduction. The “easy ones” are those to which the laws of <i>demay</i> do not apply and which may be bought from any source without separating heave or tithe.</i> are <i>shitin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">S. Lieberman has convincingly argued that שיתין is a contraction of שחיתין “garbage fruit” in the Galilean dialect which had no ח sound (compare <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 2:4:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.2.4.2"><i>Peah</i> 2:5, Note 86</a>.) It will be explained that these are figs growing under the leaves. Since figs need much sun to ripen, normally figs grow on top of the leaves, exposed to the sun. Those growing under the leaves remain hard and inedible at harvest time and are not usually harvested. Hence, these figs are to be considered abandoned property after the harvest and are not subject to any laws of heave and tithes.</i>, lotus fruit<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Definition of Maimonides, Arabic אַלנַבַּק.

I. Löw, <i>Flora der Juden</i> 3, p. 462. Maimonides declares it to be “a relative of dill.” The Arukh declares it to be wild grapes, Italian <i>lambrusco</i>. This follows the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 40b" href="/Berakhot.40b">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 40b</a>) which defines it to be grapes that ripen only after the harvest.</i>, and capers<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Concurrent definition of Arukh (<i>cappero</i>) and Maimonides. This refers to the fruit only.</i>. Also in Judea sumac, vinegar, and coriander. Rebbi Jehudah says, all <i>shitin</i> are free except those from a tree bearing fruit twice a year, all lotus fruit are free except lotus fruit from Shiqmanah<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Identified as a village Sycaminon at the foot of Mt. Carmel, South of Haifa.</i>, and all sycamore fruits are free except those cracked open<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cracked open while still on the tree, they will become sweet enough to qualify as human food. The others are only considered animal fodder. The sweetness of cracked sycamores was already noted by Pliny, <i>Naturalis Historia</i>, Book XIII, §56. In all these instances, R. Jehudah insists that the fruits do not grow wild and/or are not abandoned.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Sages enumerated them because the majority of these kinds are collected only from abandoned property<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Either they are leftovers after the harvest and actually abandoned, or they are from shrubs and trees that are never harvested and, therefore, the fruits can be treated as abandoned even though they grow on private property.</i>.
Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, only <i>demay</i> is mentioned, hence one is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If it is certain that the tithes were not given, one is obligated to give them in full in any case, including the kinds mentioned in the Mishnah. Only if it is <i>demay</i> can one get away with giving only 1%. (This argument appears anonymously in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 40b" href="/Berakhot.40b">Babli <i>Berakhot</i>40b</a>.)</i> if they are certain. Rebbi Joḥanan said, they are free whether <i>demay</i> or certain<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The kinds enumerated in the Mishnah are not subject to any tithes.</i>. It is difficult for Rebbi Joḥanan, didn’t they mention only <i>demay?</i> Hence if it is certain, is it not obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joḥanan’s position would be acceptable if the Mishnah were in one of the tractates <i>Terumot</i> or <i>Ma‘serot</i>, but here it refers explicitly to <i>demay</i>.</i>? Rebbi La said, since at every place<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In this tractate. The mention of <i>demay</i> is a mnemotechnic device which starts tractate <i>Demay</i>. It has no intrinsic meaning.</i> he considers only <i>demay</i>, here he quotes only <i>demay</i>.
The Mishnah supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “From Akhzib<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A place whose ruins are on the seashore, just South of the Lebanese border, mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 19:29" href="/Joshua.19.29"><i>Jos</i>. 19:29</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Judges 1:31" href="/Judges.1.31"><i>Jud</i>. 1:31</a>. Along the seashore, Kezib or Akhzib denotes the northernmost point of contiguous settlement by Jews during the Second Commenwealth. As explained in the Introduction, agricultural land outside this area is in principle free from all obligations imposed on the Land. (Exceptions are discussed in Chapter 2, Halakhah 1 and, for the Tithe of the Poor only, in Tractates <i>Ma‘serot</i> and <i>Ševiït</i>.)</i> and further on<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">To the North, into Phoenician territory.</i> it is free from <i>demay</i>.” Is not from Akhzib and further on no difference between <i>demay</i> and certainty? Here also there is no difference between <i>demay</i> and certainty<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Certainty that no tithes were given.</i>.
A <i>baraita</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 1:1</a>: “The easy ones for <i>demay</i>,<i>shitin</i>, lotus fruit, and the fruit of the service tree, may be trusted everywhere to be free (from obligation of tithes), but if they are kept in storage they are obligated.”</i> disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: “If they were kept in storage they are obligated.” Did they not essentially come from abandoned property? He explains it, if most people keep them in storage<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">At such a place, nobody abandons the fruits and they are not free from tithes.</i>. Come and see, if most people keep them in storage, it is everybody’s opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Both R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish.</i> that they are obligated, be it <i>demay</i> or certain. If most people do not keep them in storage, it is everybody’s opinion that they are free, be it <i>demay</i> or certain. Half and half you cannot consider<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This would be the only practical point of difference between R. Joḥanan, who frees the fruits from tithes, and R. Simeon ben Laqish, who submits them to tithes.</i> since we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Makhshirin 2:10" href="/Mishnah_Makhshirin.2.10">Mishnah <i>Makhshirin</i> 2:10</a>: “If someone finds produce on the road, if most people store it in their houses, it is free” (since, then, everybody must give heave and tithes at his barn and the few things lost on the road are included,) “if most people transport it to sell on the market, it is obligated” (since the seller may nibble from it occasionally without tithes and the future buyer, who has no relationship to the harvester, is obligated for tithes,) “half and half is <i>demay</i>.” Hence, there seems to be no way to relax the standard for a fifty-fifty doubt.</i>: “Half and half is <i>demay</i>.” Rebbi Zeïra said, not only the easy ones for <i>demay</i> but even <i>demay</i> itself<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah <i>Makhshirin</i> does not deal with our case, but with commercial produce; hence, it has no implications here and we may reduce the difference between R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish to this particular case.</i>.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As R. M. Margalit points out, this passage seems to be Amoraic, not Tannaitic as usually associated with the expression “stated.”</i>: If one enters a town inhabited mostly by Gentiles, if there is a doubt whether the majority keep them in storage<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The kinds mentioned in the Mishnah.</i> or not, everybody agrees<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In Halakhah 2:1, in reference to a list in the Mishnah about produce that must be treated as <i>demay</i> everywhere, even outside the Land of Israel, since usually these are produce of the Land. There R. Joḥanan asserts that the requirement to treat them as <i>demay</i> equally applies to fruits bought from Gentiles or from Jews, but R. Eleazar only treats produce bought from Jews as <i>demay</i> and insists that produce bought from Gentiles is certainly not in order and one also has to give the heave. Everybody agrees with R. Meïr that Gentile ownership of land in the domain settled by the returnees from Babylonia does not free the land from the obligation of heaves and tithes, against the ruling of the Babli (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 4:6:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.4.6.9"><i>Peah</i>, Chapter 4, Notes 129–131</a>). “Everybody” referred to here, however, are R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish, whose disagreement is explained in a second case.</i> that they are obligated, be it <i>demay</i> or certain<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Demay</i> always for R. Joḥanan, certain for R. Eleazar if bought from a Gentile. Even these are “easy ones”, since the Gentiles certainly did not give heave and tithes; the twofold doubt which is the basis of the leniencies of <i>demay</i>, as explained in the Introduction, does not apply. There is only a single doubt, viz., whether the produce is obligated for tithes or not, and this, being of Biblical origin, must in case of doubt be resolved in a restrictive way.</i>. If one enters a town inhabited mostly by Jews, if there is a doubt whether the majority keep them in storage or not, everybody agrees that they are free, be it <i>demay</i> or certain<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the preceding paragraph.</i>. If there is any doubt whether there is a majority of Gentiles or a majority of Jews, that is the disagreement between Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish.
These<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the detailed discussion of the Mishnah.</i> are the <i>shitim</i>: Rebbi Simeon, the son of Rebbi Abba<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rome manuscript: R. Ayvu. However, R. Ayvu was a later aggadic preacher and nothing is known of his family. R. Simeon bar Abba was a Galilean scholar of the second generation, a relative of Samuel of Nahardea; he was a great scholar and always very poor. When Nahardea was destroyed by Odenatus, two of Samuel’s daughters were taken captive and redeemed in Galilee. R. Simeon bar Abba married first one, then after the early death of his wife the other, who also died soon.</i>: Those appearing under the leaves.

These are the early fruits, before one appoints a watchman, the late fruits, after they folded up the mats. Rebbi Illaï said in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, the early ones are obligated because of an assumption that they are being watched.”</i> Early<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">They are ripe before there is a market for them. The late ones are unripe at harvest time, so they are abandoned on the field. Here one speaks of valuable fruits, not those mentioned in the Mishnah.</i> and late fruits are exempt. These are the early fruits, before one appoints a watchman.” But does this depend on the watchman<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is an individual decision, it is not a legal standard.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, if they are not worth the attention of a watchman. “These are the late fruits, after they folded up the mats<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">To store the fruits on the field, to shield them from dirt and dust before they are transported to the farmhouse.</i>. Rebbi Illaï said in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, the early ones are obligated because of an assumption that they are being watched<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since there always is a market for <i>primeurs</i>.</i>.” Rebbi Yose ben Ḥalaphta said, <i>shitin</i> in Sepphoris are obligated because of an assumption that they are watched<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Probably, to make vegetable rennet. This statement is also Tannaitic; it is not in our Tosephta but may come from a Yerushalmi version of the Tosephta.</i>.
If the fig harvest was finished and he watches his field because of grapes, grape harvest and he watches his field because of vegetables, if a worker enters there and the owner is offended, they are forbidden because of robbery<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">(There is a similar text in Tosephta <i>Ma’serot</i> 3:12 and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 6b" href="/Pesachim.6b">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 6b</a>, but it deals with the obligation to give tithes.) By Biblical ordinance (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 23:25" href="/Deuteronomy.23.25"><i>Deut</i>. 23:25</a>), a worker is entitled to eat from the produce he is harvesting. This implies that without the owner’s consent he cannot eat from produce he is not harvesting. Hence, if the owner objects to his workers going through those parts of his property that are already harvested, the owner retains all property rights to the unripe produce still standing on the field and, <i>a fortiori</i>, the unripe produce is not abandoned, may not be taken by other people, and is not freed from the obligations of heave and tithes.</i>.

Rebbi told him: eat, because the owners already gave up their expectations for them<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">יאוש is the technical term for giving up hope to regain a lost article.

Rebbi Joḥanan asked: He shouted, and you say so<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>baraita</i> of the previous paragraph bars people from taking late fruits if they are guarded. How could Rebbi permit taking these fruits?</i>? Rebbi Jonah said, he objects rightfully. But does not a Mishnah disagree: “<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma’serot</i> 3:9. The plants mentioned are weeds used as spices. If they are close to the house and tended, they are kitchen herbs and as private property obligated for tithes.

There<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Spice-weeds are everywhere but late fruits are watched; Rebbi was in error when he applied the ruling of the Mishnah in <i>Ma’serot</i> to his case.</i>, he may say, the entire world is before you, but here, there is one basketful and I am watching it for my employer.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 1:1</a>.

The reading “free” is in all Yerushalmi manuscripts except that of R. S. Cirillo, but the latter most probably represents an emendation by its author. In all Tosephta texts, the reading is “obligated.” Since the reading is “free” in both the Leyden and the Rome manuscripts, it must be very old. Nevertheless, it must represent a scribal error, and the reading must be “obligated;” otherwise the statement would be superfluous and contradicting the following discussion.</i>.” Is it about two boxes, one beside the other or one on top of the other<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Is it restricted to a case where the buyer can directly check what he is getting (if good and fallen dates are in separate boxes)?</i>? No, here we deal with a mixed bunch. Did they start to ferment<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, the fallen dates can be used to make date liquor and are commercially valuable. If they are fallen and did not start to ferment probably they are not sweet enough to qualify as human food and are valueless.</i> or did they not start to ferment? Rebbi Mana said, we deal with fermenting ones. If they started to ferment, they should be obligated for themselves<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">And subject to <i>demay</i> even if not mixed with good dates.</i>! You cannot say that, since Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Sages detailed them because the majority of these kinds are collected only from abandoned property<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Abandoned property is exempt even if valuable.</i>. Rebbi Ḥanina said, we deal with nonfermenting ones. If we deal with nonfermenting ones they should be free even when mixed<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Since they have no value.</i>. You cannot say that, since it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This statement does not appear in any other collection.</i>: “Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose said in his father’s name that a bunch of grapes of which one berry ripened, is all connected for tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">One good grape makes the entire bunch subject to the laws of heave and tithes. Hence, one good fruit in a box makes the entire box subject to the laws of heave and tithes.</i>.” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi Zeïra and Rebbi Illaï, one adopted the first opinion, the other the second opinion. But the Sages say one does not follow either of them; those fermenting are obligated, those not fermenting are free<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">An adaptation of the Tosephta text quoted at the start of this paragraph, turned into a statement of Amoraic practice, adopted by Maimonides (<i>Maäser</i> 13:1).

<i>Gufnān</i> is <i>šāmērāh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Arabic שַמרַה, fennel.</i>. What is the difference between Judea and Galilee? Since one has a popular saying in Galilee: <i>šāmērāh</i>,<i>šĕmar mārāh</i> (its owner should watch it), would anybody compare it to spices<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">That a weed can be used in the kitchen does not make it a spice. Hence, in Galilee where fennel grows wild, it is not a cultivated plant, in contrast to arid Judea where it needs tending.</i>? That means, in Galilee it is free but in Judea it is obligated.
Coriander is <i>kusbārātā</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Formally, the feminine form of the word for coriander, but, as seen in the next Note, denoting a weed.</i>. What is the difference between Judea and Galilee? Since one has a popular saying in the South: Coriander is <i>kusbārātā</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Taking the Arabic <i>kuzbara(t)</i> for a guide, this form means wild growing adiantum (or it may mean <i>kuzbarat alṯalab</i>, pimpernel, <i>kuzbarat ḵaḍra</i>’, chervil, <i>kuzbarat alṣaḵr</i>, haircap-moss, <i>kuzbarat alḥamām</i>, Fumaria officinalis). <i>Kusbārātā</i> is not considered cultivated.</i>, would anybody compare it to spices? That means, in Galilee it is obligated but in Judea it is free.
It was stated: “Rebbi Jehudah said, in earlier times, vinegar in Judea was exempt from tithes. Since they made all their wine in purity for Temple offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In the time of the Second Temple, all wine and oil for the Temple had to come from Judea since the two blocks of Jewish settlement, Judea and Galilee, were not contiguous. Hence it was impossible to transport wine or oil from Galilee to Judea without passing over impure Gentile territory, since even Samaritan Samaria was separated from Galilee by a strip of land occupied by Gentiles.</i>, it never got sour; they made vinegar from the skins of grapes. But now, since wine turns sour<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Wine-vinegar is really wine turned sour; it is subject to all rules of wine. A similar anonymous statement appears in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).1.2">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 1:2</a>: “In earlier times, vinegar was exempt in Jehudah since it was presumed to be made from after-wine, but now it is presumed to be from wine and is obligated.”</i>, it is obligated.” The argument of Rebbi Jehudah is inverted since we stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ma‘serot</i> 5:6.</i>: “If one makes after-wine and puts in a given volume of water, if he finds exactly the same volume it is free, but Rebbi Jehudah obligates him<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first Tanna, after-wine is water which absorbed some taste from the grape skins. According to Rebbi Jehudah, it is wine mixed with water. Since they always drank their wine mixed with water, this is regular wine and subject to its rules. This contradicts Rebbi Jehudah’s statement in the earlier <i>baraita</i>.</i>.” And here he says so! Rebbi La said, in earlier times when grapes were plentiful, their skins were not counted as anything<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Afterwine was worthless and thus not subject to tithes; now it is traded as merchandise.</i>, but now that grapes are not plentiful, the skins are important.
Rebbi Huna said: Rebbi Jeremiah asked, does this not contradict Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This question seems directed both to the problem of vinegar just discussed and the statement of R. Jehudah in the Mishnah, that all lotus fruit is exempt except that of Shiqmana, since R. Jehudah and the anonymous Tosephta exempt all vinegar, even when it is known not to have been tithed. Similarly, a doubt whether lotus fruit is valued at some place should not make them obligated since there still is a twofold doubt: perhaps these fruits come from another place, and if they do come from Shiqmana, perhaps they are not gathered to be stored. This is exactly the case in which R. Simeon ben Laqish declares them to be free. There is no problem for R. Joḥanan since he equates the rules for untithed and <i>demay</i> in all these cases.</i>? Should not all lotus fruit be more than the lotus fruit of Shiqmana, should they not be free? Rebbi Yose said, explain it at a place where most people store it<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Not only do they store it but, since it is an object of trade only at this place. There is no doubt that the fruits in question are local.</i>. Rebbi Yose the Great<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Not known otherwise. Possibly it should read: Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi X. But the second name is also missing in the Rome manuscript. The question is not answered.</i> asked: Is not the entire world before him, should not all lotus fruit be more than the lotus fruit of this place and be free?

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Not following the High Priest Joḥanan who abolished the declaration of tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Maäser Šeni</i> 5:13: “The High Priest Joḥanan removed the declaration of tithes.” Since at the return from Babylonia the priests returned <i>en masse</i> but almost no Levites came, the returnees decreed to give the First Tithe to the Cohen (who automatically also is a Levite.) The declaration of tithes, to be recited when the Second Tithe was brought to Jerusalem, is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:13-14" href="/Deuteronomy.26.13-14"><i>Deut</i>. 26:13–14</a>: “You shall say before the Eternal, your God: I have eliminated the holy matter from my house, I gave it to the Levite (the First Tithe), the stranger, the orphan, and the widow (the Tithe of the Poor), following all Your ordinances that You commanded me, I did not transgress Your ordinances and I did not forget. I did not eat from it in my strict mourning, I did not eliminate it (by eating) in impurity, I did not give of it to the dead. I listened to the voice of the Eternal, my God, I did all that You commanded me.” The High Priest found it inappropriate to declare that tithes were given to the Levite when in fact they went to the Cohen.</i>.

He takes two figs, two tithes, and a tenth of a tenth.” If he takes the tithes from each basket, he takes from each basket 19 figs (10 for First Tithe, 9 for Second Tithe, since heave was already taken.) If he takes all tithes from one basket, he takes 20 for First Tithe, 16 for Second Tithe. Hence, he has to add another 2 figs to get to the required 38 figs. Then from the First Tithe, he takes one tenth as heave of the tithe.</i>: “He takes from the second basket two figs and two tenths, and a tenth of a tenth.” Why can he not take two figs, declare them to be Second (Tithe), redeem them, and return to make them heave of the tithe for any other place<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Following the recipe of R.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The following must be tithed as <i>demay</i> everywhere<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Every place that ever belonged to the Biblical Land of the Twelve Tribes, but only if the produce is from a kind which grows in the Land of Israel.

Rice from outside the Land<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rice from strains not grown in the Land are free from <i>demay</i> even if imported and used in the land occupied by the returnees from Babylonia.</i> is free for everybody who uses it.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ma‘serot</i> 4:8. All these kinds are not subject to tithes since they are not produced in the Land of Israel.</i>: “Garlic from Baalbek, onions from Rikhpah<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This place has not been identified.</i>, split beans from Cilicia, and Egyptian lentils.” Because these kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Garlic, onions, beans, and lentils, but not these sorts.</i> also grow in the Land of Israel, the Sages had to attach marks to them<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Greek σημεῖον “mark, symbol.”</i>. “But filberts, pistachios, and pine nuts, since these kinds do not grow in the Land of Israel, the Sages did not have to attach marks to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Ma‘serot</i> 4:10, from a statement of R. Yose. There (in all Tosephta manuscripts) it is implied that these nuts are also produced in the Land of Israel, but Baalbek onions etc. do not grow in the Land. R. Isaac ben Malchisedek Simponti notes that he has Yerushalmi manuscripts of both traditions.</i>” Rebbi Abun said, the Mishnah is the opposite regarding the obligation of these kinds; since these kinds do not grow outside of the Land, the Sages had to enumerate them<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That they are subject to <i>demay</i> even outside the Land, in contrast to the first Mishnah which enumerated the kinds exempt from <i>demay</i> even if grown in the Land.</i>. But is there not fig cake from Bosra<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This probably is Bosra or Bostra, on the main road that goes South from Damascus, just outside the boundaries of the domain settled by the returnees from Babylonia.</i>? It is pounded. But dates from Alexandria? They are thin. But carob from Kiari<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This place has not been identified.</i>? It is cut. But rice from the Ḥolata<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rice from the dunes (חולה) of Antiochia is mentioned at the end of this Halakhah (fol. 22d), but there it is implied that it is undistinguishable from rice grown in the Land, in opposition to the text here. (אכתר is Arabic אכת̇ר “more numerous”, there are more kernels to a stalk.) R. Simson of Sens reads: Rice from Ḥolata Aktar? It is reddish. No locality Ḥolata Aktar is known. It is also impossible to identify חולתה with Ḥuleh, since according to all versions of the Tosephta detailing the borders of the land settled by the returnees from Babylonia, Lake Ḥuleh is inside the Land.</i>? It has more numerous kernels and is reddish. But cumin from Cyprus? It is curved.
Rebbi Lazar said, they stated the Mishnah only for him who buys from a Gentile, but for him who buys from a Jew it is <i>demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10a</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text in all Yerushalmi manuscripts but it cannot be correct. Since the Mishnah speaks of <i>demay</i>, if the text is allowed to stand there would be no difference between R. Eleazar and R. Joḥanan. So either R. Eleazar must say that produce of a Gentile is certain and only that of a Jew is <i>demay</i> (following R. Meïr who declares that a Gentile cannot acquire arable land in the Land of Israel to exempt it from heave and tithes) or that the produce of the Jew is certain and that of the Gentile is <i>demay</i>. The second version is impossible since only a Jew will be expected to give heave and tithes but not a Gentile. In light of the following it is also impossible to assume that the Gentile is only the seller, not the producer. So only the first possibility remains. (Since practice follows R. Joḥanan, as indicated in the next paragraph, the problem is not mentioned in Maimonides and we do not know his reading.)</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is no difference, whether one buys from a Jew or from a Gentile it is <i>demay</i>. Rebbi Eleazar holds that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of the Gentiles<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Any produce is assumed to be untithed except if it is known to come from a Jewish producer.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan holds that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Jews. But even if Rebbi Eleazar agrees with Rebbi Joḥanan that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Jews, Rebbi Eleazar is anxious about a minority. Like that fortification<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Palisades, Greek χάραξ (cf. <i>Berakhot</i> p. 663). In the Babli it appears as כרך. The garrison in the palisades is Gentile and lives off the <i>annona</i>, a tax to be paid in agricultural products. They will sell their surplus; if all surroundings are Jewish, one buys their surplus as if it were Jewish produce, but not if some of the farmers sending their <i>annona</i> to the garrison are Gentiles. Then a testimony that one day the supply came from a Gentile source makes all their surplus subject to all tithes for him who holds that produce grown by a Gentile in the Land is subject to heave and tithes.</i>, if for one day it got supplies from a forbidden source, that day will become proof for all days. Rebbi Yose asked: If that is so, a prospective proselyte who comes to convert should not be accepted<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He can be accepted but would be prohibited from marrying a Jewish woman, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 23:4" href="/Deuteronomy.23.4"><i>Deut</i>. 23:4</a>. Since practice rules this out, according to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Yadayim 4:4" href="/Mishnah_Yadayim.4.4">Mishnah <i>Yadaim</i> 4:4</a>, every male proselyte is permitted to marry a Jewish woman and the alternative reason given for R. Eleazar is unacceptable.</i>; I say he is from Ammon and Moab, and one proselyte would become proof for all proselytes. Hence, Rebbi Eleazar must hold that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Gentiles and Rebbi Joḥanan must hold that most of the Land of Israel is in the hands of Jews.
Moreover from the following: Rebbi Zeïra sent to ask Rebbi Alexander from Ẓedoqa<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">An unidentified place in Galilee. Nothing is known about this R. Alexander.</i>, those Nicolaus dates from here, what you estimate about them, mostly from Gentiles or mostly from Jews? He said to him, we are not able to estimate about them<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If there were a need, they certainly would have decided. Hence, practice follows R. Joḥanan.</i>.
One statement supports this and a second statement supports Rebbi Eleazar. “The trader’s produce everywhere is <i>demay</i>. When is that? If most of his supply is from Jews. But if he buys from Gentiles, it is certain<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This supports our reconstruction of R. Eleazar’s text above, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.1.3">Note 11</a>.</i>.” A statement supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “Rebbi Neḥemiah stated: “Whether from a Gentile, a Jewish Samaritan<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">All commentators change the text here, to treat ישראל either as a separate entry or to move it as qualifier to עם הארץ. However, there is no manuscript evidence for such a change. Rather Rebbi Neḥemiah seems to take sides in the quarrel on whether to consider Samaritans as Jews and sides with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:1:2-19" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.1.2-19"><i>Ketubot</i> 3:1</a>, fol. 27a) against Rebbi; cf. also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 3:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.3.4.3">Chapter 3, Note 98</a>. A Samaritan observes all Biblical laws. However, since his brand of Judaism was adopted by the Sadducees, we know that he takes the verse (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:14" href="/Leviticus.19.14"><i>Lev</i>. 19:14</a>): “Do not put an obstacle before a blind man” literally, not as a general injunction not to trap the unwary; he will not take heave and tithes from his harvest for sale. His produce is certainly subject to all the laws if we accept Samaritans as Jews.</i>, or an <i>am haareẓ</i> seller, if at times he buys from the Gentile, at times from the Jew, it is <i>demay</i>.”
Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada asked before Rebbi Mana: From whom did this man buy<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The trader who has no single source of supply.</i>? If from a Jew it is <i>demay</i>, from a Gentile certain. Explain that if the trader was a Gentile and both Jew and Gentile deliver to him<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The farmers bring him their produce and he does not care who it is.</i>, it is <i>demay</i>. Rav Hoshaia objected, does not the Mishnah support Rebbi Joḥanan? As it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 17:5" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.17.5"><i>Kelim</i> 17:5</a>. Badan (<i>Wadi Badyah</i>) and Geba were places in Samaria (Tosephta <i>Kelim Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 6:10). While these varieties were mainly grown in Samaria, some were grown by Jews. But since the Jews were a minority among the Samaritans, the produce must be treated as Samaritan, subject to tithes but certainly not tithed.</i>: “Rebbi Jehudah said, they only mentioned pomegranates from Badan and grain from Geba because they must be tithed as certain everywhere.” What are we talking about? If he bought from a Jew, can it be pronounced certain? But we must deal with a Gentile. Hence, all other things are tithed as <i>demay</i>. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, we deal with certain produce from a Jew. Explain it that there was a powerful overseer of markets<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Greek ἀγορανόμος, the market supervisor.

Who is a trader<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Discussion of the <i>baraita</i> supporting R. Eleazar.</i>? Everyone who brought, repeated, and came a third time. Rebbi Jonah asked, if he brought three loads together, is he not a trader<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">“Three loads” means that he either brings three carriers or three donkeys with him, each with a full load. A rhetorical question to show that this would be an unreasonable restriction.</i>; one after the other, is he a trader? Rebbi Jonah asked, does he become a trader retroactively or only for the future? What is the difference? If someone came and brought his things in order, if you say only for the future, can he tithe from one on the other<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody bought before he became a professional trader, the produce is certain; after that, it is <i>demay</i>. Once he is a trader, one cannot tithe one <i>demay</i> for another since the one chosen may have been in order and the tithing is invalid. If the title of trader is not retroactive, he may give from the certain also for the <i>demay</i>. The question is not answered.</i>! Rebbi Mana asked: Can he, his son, and his worker combine for three loads<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are all extensions of the trader himself, would R. Jonah agree that these three do not count separately.</i>? Rebbi Jonah asked, a ship that comes from Rome and carries many kinds, do you count this only as one<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">If the ship’s owner is the seller, does he have professional status already the first time around or not?</i>?
“For fruits they did not consider either smell, or looks, or taste, or value, but only plurality<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 4:11" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).4.11">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 4:11</a>. If fruits are mixed the obligations of tithes follow the status of the group which forms a plurality.</i>.” Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If it was wine, for example new wine and old wine, they judged according to taste.
Rebbi Mana said, I went to Caesarea<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">As shown in tractate <i>Berakhot</i>, Caesarea in the Yerushalmi is usually Caesarea Philippi near the source of the Jordan river. Caesarea here is Caesarea maritima, whose leading authority was R. Isaac ben Eleazar. The Land in which all duties on produce are due is the land occupied by the returnees from Babylonia, Judea and Galilee, and, if we accept Samaritans as Jews, their land, Samaria. In the plain East of Samaria, the region between the <i>via maris</i> connecting Damascus and Egypt and the sea was mostly malaria swamps, except for the healthy strip between the first dunes and the sea. Herod built an elevated highway from the <i>via maris</i> to the sea, where he built Caesarea maritima for a Gentile population, separate from the Jewish centers. Hence, the region of Caesarea and its sand marshes never fell under the laws attached to the Land.</i> and I saw them using fig cake as free. I asked Rebbi Isaac bar Eleazar; he said to me that Zeugos<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">An otherwise unknown sage. That the authority is such a minor figure again shows that we are not dealing with Caesarea Philippi. The fig cakes at Caesarea probably had a peculiar form so that they were immediately recognized.</i> used to permit it.

The place of the cave is unknown; the only caves in the neighborhood are (burial) caves in the petrified first row of dunes North of the aqueduct from the Carmel range. Τέλαμων is a Greek mythological figure; also “base of στήλη”, Τελαμῶνες the name of colossal figures supporting pillars (E. G.).</i>. Rebbi Abba Mari said, the words of the rabbis imply that all kinds are forbidden in Caesarea. “Wheat, bread, oil, dates, rice, and cumin<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">First half of a <i>baraita</i> whose end is quoted later in the paragraph. The implication is that only these products are <i>demay</i> because they are imported; all others are free, since it does not simply say: everything in Caesarea is <i>demay</i>. In the synagogue mosaic from Reḥov, the text reads:<br>הפירות הללו מתעסרין דמיי בקסרין החטין והפת<br>חלה לעולם והיין והשמן והתמרין והאורז והכמן<br>הרי אלו מותרין בשביעית בקסרין ובישאר שני <br>שבוע הן מתקנין דמיי ויש אוסרין בולבסין<br>הלבנין מהר המלך.<br>“The following produce is tithed as <i>demay</i> in Cesarea: Wheat (bread always needs <i>ḥallah</i>), wine, oil, dates, rice, and cumin; these are permitted in the Sabbatical year, in the other years they must be fixed as <i>demay</i>. Some authorities forbid white bulbs (onions) from King’s Mountain.”</i>.” Fig cakes are not included? It is in the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Which requires <i>demay</i> “everywhere.” The sentence is the answer to the preceding question.</i>. But we have also mentioned rice and cumin; these are in the Mishnah and we have spelled them out! Those are the ones which are left out. “These are permitted in the Sabbatical year, in all other years of the Sabbatical cycle they are <i>demay</i>.” These are permitted in the Sabbatical year; why are they not Sabbatical fruits in the Sabbatical year? The Jews treat them as Sabbatical, the Gentiles are free, Jews and Gentiles outnumber Samaritans<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Since Samaritans will not hesitate to supply others for money with Sabbatical fruits that they themselves would not use; they are a minority and we may assume that all produce offered for sale at Cesarea is Gentile. Similarly, Jewish produce in the other years is <i>demay</i>; Gentile produce is <i>demay</i> because maybe it is locally grown and exempt; this outnumbers the produce that may be certain if produced by Samaritans.</i>. In all other years of the Sabbatical cycle they are <i>demay</i>, the Judean Jews put them in order, Gentiles are free, Jews and Gentiles outnumber Samaritans. How far? The inn of the pillars<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Its position is unknown. In the mosaic of Reḥov, the text reads: ועד איכן סביב לקיסרין עד צוורנה ופנדקה דטיבתא ועמודה ודור וכפר סבה ואם יש מקום שקנו אותו ישראל חוששין לו רבותינו שלום. “What is the extent of the vicinity of Cesarea? As far as Ṣavranah, the inn at Ṭaybeta, the pillar, Dor, Kefar Sabah, and any land which a Jew ever bought, our teachers worry about it; Peace (upon you).” R. Saul Lieberman (<i>Tarbiẓ</i> 45, 54–63) concludes from the last sentence that the principle of applying the Laws of the Land to the territory held by the returnees from Babylonia meant that any real estate ever held by a Jew within the territory of Biblical Israel after the return is forever subject to the Laws of the Land.</i>, the inn at Tayibeh<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">On the <i>via maris</i> North of Kefar Saba (which probably was near modern Juljulia), which in its turn was North of Antipatris, the Northern border fortress of Judea.</i>, as far as Kefar Saba.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who takes it upon himself to be trustworthy<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">To guarantee that all his produce is tithed and free from the rules of <i>demay</i>.</i> gives tithes for what he eats, what he sells, and what he buys, and he is not a guest of an <i>am haäreẓ.</i> Rebbi Jehudah said, he who is a guest of an <i>am haäreẓ</i> may be trustworthy. They said to him, for himself he is not trustworthy<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is assumed that the <i>am haäreẓ</i> will serve him <i>demay</i> from which the heave of tithes was not taken, and by eating it he potentially commits a deadly sin, how can he be trusted by his customers that tithes were taken according to all rules?</i>, how can he be trusted for others?
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “What he buys,” to eat it. But did we not state: “What he eats?” Hence, “what he buys” in order to sell it. But did we not state: “What he sells?” Hence, “what he buys” in order to sell it and “what he sells” from his own gathering.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 2:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).2.1">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 2:1</a>. As usual, the opinion of the anonymous author of the Mishnah is attributed to R. Meïr. The position taken in the Mishnah and here by R. Jehudah in the Tosephta is the collective opinion of the Sages. The sentence here is R. Jehudah’s (or the Sages’) reply that one never objected to any private person’s being the guest of an <i>am haäreẓ.</i> (What the observant person has to do in this case is described at the end of this Halakhah. The Yerushalmi accepts this relaxed standard for private persons but not for traders.)</i>: Rebbi Jehudah said, private persons never refrained from being guests of private persons of their acquaintance. Nevertheless, they used to put in order all their produce in their own houses.
Rebbi Jonah said, <i>ḥaverim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the next Mishnah, a <i>ḥaver</i> is a person who takes it upon himself to observe the rules of ritual purity in his private life, away from the Sanctuary, and to avoid becoming impure if at all possible. With the disappearance of the last ways to cleanse oneself from the impurity induced by the dead (see the Notes to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.1">Mishnah <i>Berakhot</i> 1:1</a>), fellowship was slowly transformed into the fraternity of those who followed ritual law scrupulously. Since Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose are late Amoraïm, we have to assume that for them, fellowship and trustworthiness are practically identical; see the story about R. Simeon ben Laqish in the next Halakhah, Note 154.</i> are not suspected either to eat or to serve to others<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Jonah, a <i>ḥaver</i> who is seen eating at an <i>am haäreẓ</i>’s home or inviting an <i>am haäreẓ</i> to eat with him loses his standing. There is no imputation that the home of the <i>am haäreẓ</i> would not be kosher, but his food may be impure and eating it might break the vow of fellowship. That would not apply to fruits eaten dry, for example. But the food presented by the <i>am haäreẓ</i> is <i>demay</i> by definition and it will be made clear that the vow of fellowship is a step above that of being trustworthy for tithes; hence, eating <i>demay</i> breaks trustworthiness and, <i>a fortiori</i>, fellowship. If one gives of one’s food to an <i>am haäreẓ</i>, it becomes impure by contact with the impure person which is a sure break of the vow of fellowship.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, <i>ḥaverim</i> are suspected to eat but not to serve to others<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yose holds that a <i>ḥaver</i> who is seen eating from a source considered as <i>demay</i> does not lose his standing since he might have put his food in order mentally as explained at the end of the Halakhah. In the next Halakhah, however, the statement of R. Yose is qualified to apply to trustworthy persons only, not to recognized <i>ḥaverim</i>.</i>. The Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Yose: “They said to him, for himself he is not trustworthy, how can he be trusted for others?” The words of the rabbis support Rebbi Yose, for Rebbi Ḥanina, Rebbi Yasa, said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Jehudah spoke only of the end, but at the start even Rebbi Jehudah will agree.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody takes the vow (publicly, as explained later) of trustworthiness, he must accept the rules spelled out in the Mishnah as the majority opinion. If later he is seen eating from the <i>am haäreẓ</i>’s, there is disagreement between R. Jehudah and the Sages.</i> If you say that <i>ḥaverim</i> are not suspected either to eat or to serve to others, what is the difference between start and end? As we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">A similar statement is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 2:3" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).2.3">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 2:3</a>, reproduced <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 30b" href="/Bekhorot.30b">Babli <i>Bekhorot</i> 30b</a>, but speaking of fellowship instead of trustworthiness. Again, the anonymous opinion here is R. Meïr’s in the Tosephta, and R. Jehudah’s here is that of the anonymous majority there. (Maimonides <i>Miškav Umošav</i> 10:9 follows the Babli and, hence, the opinion expressed here by R. Jehudah.)</i>: “He who takes it on himself to be trustworthy except for one thing cannot be accepted; he who is suspect in one thing is suspect in everything. Rebbi Jehudah said, he is only suspect in that thing alone.”
It was stated: “He who is trustworthy for purity is trustworthy for tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that one is not accepted for fellowship until he be trustworthy for tithes; see the next Halakhah.</i>” Rebbi Yannai ben Rebbi Ismaël stated it and explained his reason: That means, if one is a guest of his, but for the public he is not trustworthy until he accepts it publicly<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Usually, “publicly” means before at least ten adult males.

However, since it was usual that the employer feed his journeymen, Rabban Gamliel saved by giving them <i>demay</i>, and this is not permitted.</i> eat <i>demay.</i> The House of Shammai say, the administrators of charity give the tithed food to those who do not tithe, and the untithed food to those who tithe, so that it turns out that everybody eats produce that is in order<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is stated explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>, quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 17b" href="/Eruvin.17b">Babli <i>Eruvin</i> 17b</a>, that the House of Shammai disagree with the first sentence of the Mishnah and forbid to give <i>demay</i> to the poor.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Jonah said, our Mishnah speaks about poor <i>ḥaverim</i>, and about guests following Rebbi Joshua. It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Ma‘serot</i> 2:1: “Donkey drivers and private persons on the road from place to place may eat and they are free (from the obligation to tithe) until they reach their destination. Therefore, if their host gave them a separate room and they stayed there overnight, they have to tithe, otherwise they are exempt. It happened that Rebbi Joshua went to Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai at Beror Ḥayil, and some inhabitants of these localities brought them figs. They asked him, do we have to tithe? He said to them, if we stay overnight, we are obligated to tithe; otherwise, we are not obligated to tithe.” Because R. Joshua was such an important personality he and his students certainly were placed in a separate room; therefore, staying overnight alone creates the obligation of tithes. The obligation for heave and tithes only starts with the storage of the harvest. Since R. Joshua would not travel without a large group of students, keeping him overnight creates the duty to give heave and tithes. This is the explicit interpretation given in Yerushalmi <i>Ma‘serot</i> 2:3.</i>: “It happened that Rebbi Joshua went to Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai in Beror Ḥayil<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Neither name nor location of this place are certain but it is known that it was the home town of Rabban Joḥanan ben Zakkai.</i>, and some local people brought them fruits. Rebbi Joshua said to them, if they<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">His students.</i> stay overnight, we are obliged to tithe; otherwise, we are not obliged to tithe.” Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah speaks about <i>am haäreẓ</i> poor. If you restrict to poor <i>ḥaverim</i>, you lock the door before <i>am haäreẓ</i> poor<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If it becomes expensive to give to the <i>am haäreẓ</i> poor, nobody will give to them.</i>. How does Rebbi Yose hold about “the stranger?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Jonah, there is no problem; since the traveller is not really poor it is necessary to say that the Mishnah applies only to <i>ḥaverim</i> who will put their food in order. But why does R. Yose need to mention the traveller?</i>” Following what was stated: “(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:45" href="/Leviticus.25.45"><i>Lev.</i> 25:45</a>) ‘Those who dwell among you,’ to include the stranger; Rebbi Eliezer said, that means the Gentile stranger.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It is permitted to buy oneself goodwill with <i>demay</i> even though one may not satisfy a formal obligation with <i>demay.</i></i>”
It was stated: “One has to declare.” In the opinion of Rebbi Jonah, it is understood<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">One has to inform him that he receives <i>demay</i> so that he may bring it in order.</i> that the Mishnah speaks about poor <i>ḥaverim.</i> In the opinion of Rebbi Yose, the Mishnah speaks about <i>am haäreẓ</i> poor; even if he informs him, what does he gain<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>am</i> <i>haäreẓ</i> does not care, what has one gained by informing the recipient? The answer is that only a minority of the <i>amē haäreẓ</i> do not care, so why should he hurt the decent majority because of the actions of a few nonobservant persons?</i>? Because of one who does not put in order?
Rebbi Mana said, this means that he who gives in his home<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">One has to inform him that he receives <i>demay</i> so that he may bring it in order.</i> may not give from Sabbatical value because he would pay his debt with Sabbatical value. As it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>am</i> <i>haäreẓ</i> does not care, what has one gained by informing the recipient? The answer is that only a minority of the <i>amē haäreẓ</i> do not care, so why should he hurt the decent majority because of the actions of a few nonobservant persons?</i>: “Neither Sabbatical produce nor Second Tithe may be used to satisfy a loan or a debt. One does not use them for best men’s meals<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since these meals are due in reciprocity, they constitute a debt that can not be satisfied either with Sabbatical fruits, which are ownerless even if grown on the farmer’s own field, or Second Tithe, which is Heaven’s money.</i>.

(Mishnah 4) Then he saves one fig (assuming the employer gave him 100 for lunch.) Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, he should not save (but buy one with his own money and give it to the Cohen) because he reduces the work of the employer (by eating less than the allotted ration, he has less strength to work.) Rebbi Yose said, he should not save because this is a condition of the Court (that the employer must pay for the heave of the tithe.)”<br>The argument here refers to what Rabban Gamliel did. Since he is mentioned by name, what he did is not accepted. The Sages conclude that the employer must give his farmhands fully tithed food.</i> we have stated: “The worker who does not trust the employer.” There you say, the worker separates. But here you say that the employer separates<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since the action of Rabban Gamliel is not quoted as opinion of the Sages.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, there if he serves him counted portions, here if he lets him eat from the bowl<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cooked food, or figs and dates, in a big bowl from which each farmhand scoops up what he can.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Eleazar said<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The discussion refers to the first statement of the Mishnah that he who separates greens from bunches of vegetables must tithe first.

There is a difference because the one who takes it up takes it up in retail quantity and the one who abandons does not abandon wholesale. It does not even disagree with Rebbi Yose, for Rebbi Yose says that nothing may leave the power of its owners except if it is taken up; otherwise it was not legally abandoned. There is a difference here, because the one who abandons abandons wholesale, and the one who takes it up, takes up only retail quantities<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">According to R.

He naturally will tell the seller that his produce will be put in order, but he has absolutely no guarantee that the seller will transmit this information to the other buyers. However, since everything will be fine if the seller really warns the next buyers not to use his produce for tithing, no blame can be attached to the <i>ḥaver</i> who uses his own to put the <i>am haäreẓ’</i> s produce in order.

So says the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the last part of the Mishnah: “If he stopped <i>to buy</i> but saw another, better batch, he may change his mind because he did not take it up.” Since “to buy” has a connotation of “taking it,” the word is changed to “selecting.”</i>: “If he stood selecting.” So far, of the same kind.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who gives to the innkeeper’s wife, tithes what he gives her and what he takes from her because she is suspected to switch<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The motives imputed to the innkeeper’s wife (or the female innkeeper) are not clear.

This Mishnah (and the next) are quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 6" href="/Chullin.6">Babli <i>Ḥulin</i> 6a–b</a>; there, the interpretation is that the innkeeper will try to please her guests and maybe substitute fresher produce or spices for him, whereas R.

Just as Rebbi Yose said, we are not responsible for the dishonest, so Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, we are not responsible for the dishonest. It is reasonable that Rebbi Yose will agree with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, but Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel will not agree with Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Yose will agree with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel that we are not responsible for the dishonest.

If heave of the tithe falls into the produce from which it was taken, there results a major complication and a potential great monetary loss since Cohanim will pay little for produce containing heave. If the heave should be impure, the entire batch would be a total loss since, in the case which is described in the Mishnah, the heave (1%) falls into the remainder (99%) and, therefore, is turning everything into <i>dema</i>‘. In that case, and since most <i>amē haäreẓ</i> are supposed to tithe, if the untrustworthy seller asserts that heave was taken, no heave fell into the produce and all is permitted for profane use.</i>. Rebbi Simeon from Shezur<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A Tanna, student of Rebbis Joshua, Eliezer, and Tarphon from lower Galilee, today’s village of Sejur.</i> said, even on weekdays he asks the seller and eats on his information.

The First Tithe shall become the heave of the tithe and the Second Tithe shall be redeemed with coins.” Hence, it is possible to tithe mentally under the right circumstances.

Rebbi Jonah said, there he asked for himself. But here a third party asked about it.
Rebbi Jonah asked: May he ask him in a roundabout way? Rebbi Jonah asks in this way. Rebbi Jonah bought wheat from Bar Ḥaqulah.

It was stated: “Heave of the tithe from <i>demay</i> that returned to its origin makes <i>dema</i>‘<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dema</i>‘ (a word of unclear etymology, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:28" href="/Exodus.22.28"><i>Ex.</i>22:28</a>) describes profane produce mixed with heave, which is unfit for human consumption if heave and food are impure, and is food only for Cohanim and their families if both the heave and the food are pure. It can be put in order only if the amount of heave in the total is less than 1 in 101. Since heave from <i>demay</i> is genuinely holy only in a minority of cases, that heave does not necessarily create <i>dema</i>‘. (Maimonides <i>Maäser</i> 12:4 and R. Abraham ben David ad <i>loc</i>.)</i>, not to its origin does not make <i>dema</i>‘. Rebbi Simeon from Shezur said, both at its origin and not at its origin it does not make <i>dema</i>‘.” Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Zeïra: For one who says, it makes <i>dema</i>‘, it makes <i>dema</i>‘; for one who says, it does not make <i>dema</i>‘, it does not make <i>dema</i>‘; this is reasonable<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That means, I can understand R.

But if one says, in its origin it makes <i>dema</i>‘, not in its origin it does not make <i>dema</i>‘; what is the difference between in its origin and not in its origin? Rebbi Ḥaggai came up. They said, this one will say, “by Moses, I shall explain the reason<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">R.

If he separated heave, First and Second Tithes, and ate from it, he is trustworthy for that kind of food but not for any other kind, the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, even for that kind he is not trustworthy {unless he passes the formal tests of trustworthiness}; you cannot trust him for he might put in order for himself but leads others astray {by eating kosher produce but selling <i>ṭevel.</i>}”<br>The text here makes little sense. It seems that the first two words of the next clause are dittography. The implication is that the formal induction into <i>ḥaverut</i>, described in Chapter 2, does solve all problems in theory but not in practice since many people will be reluctant to wear a badge that proclaims their superiority over fellow Jews. Hence, we need some guidelines to recognize people who follow the rules without ostentation.</i>: He is trustworthy if they saw him separate the Second Tithe. It was stated: For the Second, he is trustworthy for the First, the words of Rebbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, if he trustworthy for the First, he is trustworthy for the Second. He who is trustworthy for the Second is not trustworthy for the First. What is the reason of Rebbi Eliezer?<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Yerushalmi discusses R.

Hence, if it is spelled out that he is not trustworthy, it implies that he is not trustworthy for First Tithe and the heave of the tithe. It follows that the first “trustworthy” has exactly the same meaning and in the first case he is declared to be trustworthy for First because he is believed to be trustworthy for Second.</i>.” The <i>baraita</i> is Rebbi Eliezer’s, since Rebbi Eliezer said, he who is trustworthy for the Second is trustworthy for the First. Rebbi Yose said, everybody agrees, they made it like additions to First Fruits<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">First Fruits are presented to the Temple and eaten there by the Cohen under the laws of purity of sacrifices. First Fruits are chosen when the farmer sees a first fruit forming in his orchard; then he binds a string of bast around that twig to recognize the fruit later. If he thinks that it is shabby to bring just one fruit to the Temple, he will add other fruits of the same kind to his basket. The First Fruit itself, as a sacrifice, is exempt from all heaves and tithes; the additions are not. But if the Cohen in the Temple asks the <i>am haäreẓ</i> farmer whether the additional fruits are tithed, he is by law required to believe what the farmer tells him (Maimonides <i>Maäser</i> 13:14).</i>. Just as additions to First Fruits are eaten in purity and are free from <i>demay</i>, so this is eaten as Second Tithe and is free from the First.

Abraham ben David, and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rashi on Ketubot 56b" href="/Rashi_on_Ketubot.56b">Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 56b</a>) is that the buyer is looking for old (better quality) wine and is ready to buy <i>demay</i> and tithe it if only he gets the quality desired. The interpretation of the Mishnah would be that the first informant, who directed the buyer to the second one’s store, was not an uninterested bystander, but in effect was indirectly paid for steering the stranger to the second one’s store. The plural “they may be believed” in the last sentence then would include the seller who asserted to the stranger that he was trustworthy by the rules. His trustworthiness is not invalidated by the kickback.<br>R. Simson of Sens refers “old produce” to that grown before the Sabbatical year if the question was asked in the Sabbatical. But the question here is about tithes, not the Sabbatical. Usually, “old” refers to grain that started to grow before the last Passover, since “new” grain, summer wheat planted after Passover, may not be eaten until after the next Passover (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:14" href="/Leviticus.23.14"><i>Lev.</i> 23:14</a>).

Eleazar ben Jehudah from Bartota, Tanna of the third generation, was a student of R. Joshua and teacher of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel.

Joḥanan says that, if the baker hires a <i>ḥaver</i> to knead his dough in purity, he will also be careful with heave and tithes, and the baker should tithe. If he prepares his dough in impurity, the buyer should tithe, and this is the case here. R. Eleazar holds that the Mishnah means a wholesaler, who does not have to tithe, but Mishnah 1:3 deals either with a retail baker or a private person baking for his family and guests.</i>, one case for him who works in purity and one case for him who works in impurity.

Rebbi Abin, Rebbi Shammai, in the name of Rebbi Aḥa, understood this from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 5:2 states that a person who wants to separate heave and heave of the tithe together must separate 1% for heave of the tithe. Heave of the tithe has to be given as 10% of the tithe which in itself is 10% of the produce left after heave was taken. Hence, the 1% mentioned in the next Mishnah is 1% of what is left after heave was taken. Similarly, the Mishnah does not imply that <i>ḥallah</i> is subject to the laws of <i>demay</i> but that the 1% for heave of the tithe is to be measured only after regular <i>ḥallah</i> was taken.</i>. “He who wants to separate heave and the heave of the tithe together.” As you will say there, except for that which may become sanctified as heave, here also except for that which may become sanctified as <i>ḥallah</i>.
We have stated <i>ḥallah</i> between First and Second Tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah prescribes taking heave of the tithe and <i>ḥallah</i> together, and only then to give a name to Second Tithe and to redeem it. Both tithes should have been given when the grain was first stored at the farm barn. The obligation of <i>ḥallah</i> comes much later, when grain is first made into flour and then the flour into bread dough.</i>.

Since the first heave is mentioned, one speaks about produce from which nothing at all was yet taken. Nevertheless, <i>ḥallah</i> appears between First and Second tithes.</i>: Also for certain. On that, Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Zeïra said, this means that <i>ḥallah</i> is not subject to “do not give too late.” Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Zeïra: The Mishnah is not formulated in sequence, should not <i>ḥallah</i> precede the First Tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>ḥallah</i> has the status of heave, once the obligation has started it should take the place of heave that <i>must</i> be given before any tithe.</i>?

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who wants to separate heave and heave of the tithe together takes one in thirty-three and one third<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Heave is 2% given by estimate, heave of the tithe is 1% exactly of the remainder, or .98% of the original amount. So together they would be 2.98% or 1 in 33.557, not 1 in 33.3333. This Mishnah follows the ruling of Abba Eleazar ben Gimel (<i>Terumot</i> 1:7, fol. 40d) that all heave may be given by estimate and that heave of the tithe may also be given by the owner himself, not only by the Levite who is the recipient of the First Tithe. Since the heaves are given by estimate, one has to increase the amount somewhat, to 3% or 1 in 331/3.</i> and says: One percent of what is here on this side is profane<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since the first heave must be given before the heave of the tithe, the amount designated for heave of the tithe must be declared to be profane until after heave has been designated.</i> and the remainder is heave for everything. The profane here on that side is tithe; the rest of the tithe is adjacent to it. That which I have declared as tithe is made heave of the tithe for it, (the rest is <i>ḥallah</i>,) the Second Tithe is either North or South of it and is redeemed by coins.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 5:6" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).5.6">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 5:6</a>.</i> He who wants to separate heave, heave of the tithe, and <i>ḥallah</i> together takes for heave, heave of the tithe, and <i>ḥallah</i>, that is one in 20<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The computation is not quite exact. If full amounts are taken, i. e., if it is possible to eat heave in ritual purity, heave is supposed to be 2%. Then heave of the tithe is 1% of the remaining 98%. The grain put in order therefore is 97.02% of the original amount. <i>Ḥallah</i> is 1/48 of the dough (in our case, of the grain), or 2.0833% of the remainder, 2.02125% of the original amount. Hence, the total taken should be 5.00125% of the original amount, not 5% as stated in the Tosephta. However, 1/800 of one percent is not a quantity that is verifiable by eyesight; as the Halakhah will state later, it is disregarded. Also, it is required that both heave and <i>ḥallah</i> be given by estimate, <i>not</i> by measurement; hence, the natural error in such an estimate is much larger than the small overshoot we should require for the heave of the tithe, as indicated in the Mishnah.<br>Today, when no heave can be eaten in the absence of the ashes of the red heifer, both heave and <i>ḥallah</i> are given in minute amounts to avoid destroying food.

(Maimonides <i>Maäser</i> 1:17).</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: He subsumes them all in one benediction.
So far for a Cohen or a Levi<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Normally the Israel farmer gives heave to the Cohen and tithe to the Levite (or Cohen, who also is a Levite) and then the Levite gives heave of the tithe to the Cohen. The Cohen himself, if he is a farmer, has to separate heave, tithe, and heave of the tithe, even though he keeps everything for himself, as is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:26" href="/Numbers.18.26"><i>Num.</i> 18:26</a>): “You also shall separate the heave of the Eternal,” and explained in <i>Sifry Num</i>. #120.

Rebbi Yose said, he relies on a stipulation by the Court. What is the stipulation by the Court? As far as one’s mind might err<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Even in measurements, a perfect result is not possible. Hence, any estimate that is not clearly in error is accepted as exact and the pedantic argument from before is not accepted. This argument is not directly applicable to heave of the tithe; since the Torah prescribes exactly 1%, it is not clear from where the Court should have the authority to stipulate that we accept deviations from the Biblical norm. Hence, the stipulation must refer to tithe. While tithe has to be 10% by Biblical decree, and using the food before tithe was given is a deadly sin, tithe in the hand of the Levite or Cohen is profane food after heave of the tithe was given; in contrast to Second Tithe, which retains its status of holiness until consumed in Jerusalem or redeemed, First Tithe is the absolute possession of Cohen or Levite. Hence, the amount transferred to the Levite is a transfer of profane goods and subject to the eminent power of the Court which may declare property forfeit. Since the Court has the power to set the standards for tithe, the amount of heave of the tithe is a derivative of the amount set aside for tithe.</i>.
What is a stipulation by the Court?

It is that if the Second Tithe is redeemed, that which is in excess is also redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The possibility of estimating is given not only for First, but also for Second Tithe.</i>. All this refers to dry produce; for fluids<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The method of Mishnah and Tosephta is not applicable to those fluids, wine and olive oil, which have to be tithed as Biblical commandment since these fluids will not remain static.

If somebody had 100 figs, 50 large ones and 50 small ones. If he takes from the large ones, should he take nine? If he takes from the small ones, should he take eleven? If he takes ten large ones, there might be one profane among them and we would worry lest perhaps he use that one to make it heave of the tithe for another place, but it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:26" href="/Numbers.18.26"><i>Num.</i> 18:26</a>): “The heave of the Eternal, tithe from tithe,” not profane from tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Probably a scribal error; it would be more reasonable to say “not tithe from profane,” since once produce is put in order, nothing of it can ever become heave or tithe again.

Liebermann quotes a Syriac source showing that the שפיתא used to draw wine from the storage tank was also used to transport the wine from the producer to retail stores.<br>Perhaps the word is a combination of ὑδρία, ἡ “water pot”, but also used for a vessel or urn of any kind, including “wine pot”, and κέραμος, ὁ “clay”, but also anything made of clay, including “wine jar” (E.

The lessor knows that he has to tithe.</i> a field from a Jew separates heave and delivers to him. Rebbi Jehudah says, when is that? When he gives from that field and from that kind.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are the words of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. But the words of the Sages are: From a Jew, he splits; from a Gentile, he gives heave. We have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 6:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).6.1">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 6:1</a>: “He who receives a field as sharecropper from a Gentile tithes and gives to him. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, what if the Gentile does not want to tithe his produce? But he distributes and gives before him.” It is clear that the Yerushalmi does not speak about a lease for a fixed amount, because then the Gentile would not be interested in what the Jewish tenant does, but about a sharecropper who will diminish the landlord’s part if he gives heave or tithes prior to distribution.</i>: “He who leases a field from a Gentile separates heave and then gives to him. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said: If the Gentile does not wish to give heave, I have no right to it<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Gentile is the owner and one may not give heave without authorization by the owner, it is impossible in Jewish law to give heave for the unwilling Gentile. Hence, the sharecropper may not give heave before he divides up the harvest.</i>, but he<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The farmer distributes the harvest untithed in the presence of the landlord.</i> distributes and puts it before him.”
Rebbi Zeïra, Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Yannai (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:28" href="/Numbers.18.28"><i>Num.</i> 18:28</a>): “You, also you,” to include your plenipotentiary<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">“So <i>you</i> shall lift, <i>also you</i>, the heave of the Eternal.” The expression <i>also you</i> is superfluous; since “also” always means an addition, “also you” means a stand-in. Since he is titled “also you”, it follows that he takes the place of the person authorizing him. The same explanation is given in <i>Terumot</i> 1:1 (fol. 40b/c), Babli <i>Qiddušin</i>41b, <i>Baba Meẓia‘</i> 22a.</i>. Just as you are in the covenant, so your plenipotentiary must be in the covenant. You appoint a plenipotentiary, the Gentile may not. Rebbi Yasa wanted to say that the Gentile cannot appoint as plenipotentiary another Gentile, but he can appoint a Jew. Rebbi Zeïra said, from the <i>baraita</i> itself: You appoint a plenipotentiary, does that not mean Jews? Similarly, the Gentile cannot appoint a plenipotentiary, not even a Jew. Rav Hoshaia objects: Does the <i>baraita</i> support Rebbi Joḥanan? “Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said: If the Gentile does not wish to give heave from his produce, he cannot give heave<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the opinion of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Gentile cannot appoint a Jew as plenipotentiary for Jewish ritual.</i>” Rebbi Abba said, if he confirms it after him<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This parallels the position of R. Isaac in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Terumot (Lieberman) 1:15" href="/Tosefta_Terumot_(Lieberman).1.15">Tosephta <i>Terumot</i> 1:15</a>: “If a Gentile separated heave for a Jew, even with his permission, it is not heave. … Rebbi Isaac says, if a Gentile separated heave for a Jew and the owner confirms his action, it is heave.” For a Jew, once permission is given, it does not require an additional action on the part of the owner. But the Gentile’s action is not valid unless it is explicitly confirmed by the Jewish owner afterwards; the Gentile does the mechanical work and the Jew gives the separated amount the status of heave.</i>.
“ ‘He who leases,’ means he pays in produce, ‘he who rents,’ means he pays money, ‘he who receives,’ as sharecropper for a half, a third, or a quarter<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The first two definitions are also found in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 6:2" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).6.2">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 6:2</a>.</i>”.
So far a Gentile; a Samaritan? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 7:25: “He who gives a field to a Gentile sharecropper, a Samaritan, or to somebody who is not trusted with tithes, even though one is not permitted to do so, he has to tithe for him.” Here the obligation to tithe seems to be a kind of fine imposed upon someone who does not let his field to a trusted Jew. If it is imposed on someone who gives his field to a sharecropper, <i>a fortiori</i> on him who leases his field to a Gentile.</i>: “He who gives a field to a Gentile sharecropper, a Samaritan, or somebody who is not trusted with tithes, before they come to the time of tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When the produce is prepared to be stored, the obligation of tithes begins.</i> he does not have to tithe for him; after they come to the time of tithes he has to tithe for him.” That is, at a place where Jews are present. At a place where no Jews are available<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">There is no reason to impose a fine if no qualified Jewish farmers are available.</i>? Let us hear from the following: Rebbi Simon had fields at King’s Mountain<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As noted earlier, in Amoraic times no Jews were left on King’s Mountain. This entire piece also appears in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 1:9, fol. 40b.</i>. He asked Rebbi Joḥanan, who told him: Let them lie fallow, but do not lease them to a Gentile. He asked Rebbi Joshua ben Levi who permitted it to him. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi is of the opinion that a place where no Jews are available has the status of Syria<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 7:5:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.7.5.6"><i>Peah</i> Chapter 7, Note 119</a>. The argument implies that Neḥemiah’s covenant applies only to those regions of the Holy Land outside the immediate neighborhood of Jerusalem actually settled by Jews. The territory subject to tithes and Sabbatical therefore is variable over time [S. Klein, HUCA 5(1928) 197–260.]</i>. For Syria, we hear from the following: Rebbi Ḥaggai descended into Homs. The family Astor asked him: Since no Jews are available here, we lease to Gentiles; do we have to tithe for them? He sent and asked Rebbi Zeïra. Rebbi Zeïra asked Rebbi Immi, who told him that they did not have to tithe. From this you hear that the rules of leasing follow Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 1:9: “One does not lease houses in Israel to Gentiles, not to mention fields. In Syria one leases to them houses but not fields, and outside the Land one sells them houses and leases fields to them. These are the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yose says, even in the Land of Israel one does lease houses to them and in Syria one sells to them houses and leases fields to them. Outside the Land one sells both to them.” Since one may lease fields to Gentiles, the act of leasing does not remove a field from the duty of tithes. Hence, there is no such duty on the field itself and the Gentile’s part does not have to be tithed by the Jewish landlord. The Yerushalmi’s decision is repeated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 21a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.21a">Babli <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 21a</a>.</i>. Also from the following: Rebbi Ḥanina, the son of Rebbi Abbahu, said my father had a case; he sent and asked Rebbi Ḥiyya, Rebbi Yasa, and Rebbi Immi, and they taught him that the rules of leasing follow Rebbi Yose; hence, as far as tithing for them is concerned, they<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The landlords do not have to tithe for their exempt tenants. (R. Ḥiyya here is R. Ḥiyya bar Abba.)</i> do not tithe for them.
“If<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 1:6" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).1.6">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 1:6</a>. The rule applies both to the sharecropper and to the lessee. Since the preceding Tosephta states the rules for sharecropper and lessee of a Jewish landlord, it follows that this Tosephta (and the one discussed in the following paragraph) deal with a Gentile landlord, which fits in the context of the present Halakhah.</i> he received a field to harvest for wheat<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">That the agricultural worker takes his wages in the form of the finished product: threshed wheat grain, wine, or oil. This is after the obligation of tithes started.</i>, grapes to harvest for wine, olives to harvest for oil, he tithes before he delivers.” Come and see: Before he sows, he separates heave<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">At most, the lessee separates heave; the sharecropper does not give anything before splitting with the owner. This shows that the Tosephta speaks both of sharecropper and lessee.</i>; after it was sown, he tithes? Rebbi Ḥinena said, they made a special decree for the sharecropper, so that the Land of Israel should not lie fallow. But here it is already sown.
“If<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 1:6" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).1.6">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 1:6</a>. In this case, the payment is given before any obligation of heave and tithes was incurred.</i> he received a field to harvest for early ears, grapes to harvest for baskets of grapes, olives to harvest for baskets of olives, he delivers as is.” That means, if (he is paid) in the same kind; but from another field, or from that field but not from the same kind, he must tithe before he delivers. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of the Sages in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 1:5" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).1.5">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 1:5</a>.</i>: “From the same field, whether it be the same kind or another kind, he separates heave and delivers. From another field, whether it be the same kind or another kind, he tithes and delivers.” The Mishnah follows Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel; what Rebbi Ḥiyya stated follows the Sages, and they disagree. We also may come and state that the Mishnah deals with some place where barley usually does not yield twice as much as wheat<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to another disagreement between the Sages and Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel (<i>Baba Meẓia‘</i> 9:8): “He who receives a field to sow it with barley should not sow it with wheat; wheat, he may sow it with barley. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel forbids it.” In the opinion of the Yerushalmi, this depends on the relative cash value of the crops raised; if barley yields enough to offset its cheaper price relative to wheat, the lessee is permitted to change the crop. “The Mishnah” in our text means the opinion of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, representing actual practice. [In the opinion of the Babli (<i>Baba Meẓia‘</i>106b), wheat needs a more frequent crop rotation and lying fallow than barley and the landlord can always object.] Tosephta <i>Baba Meẓia‘</i> 9:32, dealing with the subject matter of Mishnah 9:8, does not mention the point of view of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel.</i>; what Rebbi Ḥiyya stated refers to a place where barley usually yields twice as much as wheat.

He said to them, do you not agree with me that if they agreed<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In the sharecropping contract. In that case, the act which validates the contract also validates the stipulation. A <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 7:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).7.1">Tosephta (<i>Demay</i> 7:1</a>) authorizes that kind of stipulation.</i> among themselves, tithes go to the workers?

It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 7:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).7.1">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 7:1</a>: “An Israel {a Jew who is neither Cohen nor Levite} who received {as sharecropper} a field from an Israel, a Cohen from a Cohen, a Levite from a Levite, divide among themselves.”</i>: “A Cohen from a Cohen, a Levite from a Levite, an Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 7:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).7.1">Tosephta <i>Demay</i> 7:1</a>: “An Israel {a Jew who is neither Cohen nor Levite} who received {as sharecropper} a field from an Israel, a Cohen from a Cohen, a Levite from a Levite, divide among themselves.”</i> from an Israel, split the tithes.” Who needs this statement? Rebbi Eliezer; even though Rebbi Eliezer says that the tithe is theirs because they came because of it, here he agrees that they divide up the tithes.

A Cohen who received a field (as sharecropper) from an Israel, if he said to him, on condition that the tithes be mine, that is permitted.

What is forbidden is that the Cohen landlord gives the heaves to the Cohen sharecropper as part of the latter’s wages for his services, since heave may never be used to liquidate an obligation.</i>. That they be mine and yours, that is forbidden. If he received it under the standard sharecropping contract<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Any distribution of heaves that follows the local standard and is not different for a Cohen than for an Israel cannot be considered a special payment made with heave and is permitted.</i>, it is permitted, otherwise it is forbidden.” Even without that, do not the tithes belong to them<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">To the landlord and the sharecropper, as explained in Mishnah 1.

“If an Israel received (as sharecropper) a field from another Israel on condition that the tithes go to a certain person, that clause is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Distribution of tithes cannot become part of a financial package.</i>; on condition that I shall take them and deliver them to a certain person, that clause is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Demai (Lieberman) 7:1" href="/Tosefta_Demai_(Lieberman).7.1">Tosephta (<i>Demay</i> 7:1</a>) there is a positive prescription that between sharecropper and landlord of similar status, tithes must be evenly split.

You say it is forbidden if it does not follow the standard sharecropper’s contract. It turns out that Rebbi Yose holds with Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Aḥa with Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina. As Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina said, a person gives his tithes for the benefit of goodwill<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">While a person cannot trade his heaves or tithes, he can use them to create goodwill and so reap an indirect monetary benefit, or even a direct benefit if the party involved is not a Cohen. While an Israel may not take money from a Cohen for his heaves, he may take from an Israel for the promise to give all future heaves to the latter’s grandson who is a Cohen. But since it is not possible to trade this kind of goodwill, it is not considered to be money in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 64b-65a" href="/Nedarim.64b-65a">Babli (<i>Nedarim</i> 64b–65a</a>); hence, if the Cohen takes heave without consent of the owner, he cannot be sued for monetary damages (Maimonides <i>Terumot</i> 12:15). This is the only opinion mentioned in the Babli and the only one in <i>Sifry Naśo</i> (6). (Starting here, the next four paragraphs are also found in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 2:9:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.2.9.2-5"><i>Qiddušin</i> 2:10</a>.)</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, a person may not give his tithes for the benefit of goodwill<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Joḥanan does not allow any monetary advantage from giving heaves and tithes.</i>. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina? (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:10" href="/Numbers.5.10"><i>Num.</i> 5:10</a>) “Everybody shall be the owner of his holy things.” What does Rebbi Joḥanan with this? He may give them to whomever he likes<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">No Cohen or Levy may take heave or tithe by force; only the owner can decide to whom to give [<i>Sifry Naśo</i> (6)].</i>.
A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥaninah: “A vow that no Cohanim or Levites should have any advantage from me, they should take against his will<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 3:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.3.8.1">Mishnah <i>Nedarim</i> 3:11</a>. This is one of the vows the husband cannot dissolve if made by his wife since dissolution is unnecessary; any recipient of the obligatory gifts to Cohen and Levite may take them by force in this case, and the owner has no monetary gain. It seems to disagree with R. Joḥanan who says that the owner has the choice of recipient. But since the owner does not want to give what he is obligated to, he transgresses commandments of the Torah and the situation can be saved only by others disregarding his rights.</i>.” He explains it about a person who says, I cannot possibly give them <i>any</i> gifts. You should know that this is so, since we have stated: “<i>These</i> Cohanim and Levites, let others take<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Same Mishnah; if the vow excludes a certain group of people, he always can give to others.</i>.” A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “An Israel can say to another Israel, here you have a tetradrachma and give this first born to my daughter’s son, a Cohen<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Speaking of the firstborn of a cow or ewe. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 27a" href="/Bekhorot.27a">Babli (<i>Bekhorot</i>27a</a>) a similar statement is made for future heave.

They asked before Rebbi Zeïra, in that situation<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">To give money to an Israel so that he should give his heave or the firstborn of his flock to a designated Cohen.</i>, a Cohen to an Israel, what is the rule? At Rebbi Yose’s they said that he did not answer. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa said, so he said to them: In the opinion of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina, why is a Cohen to an Israel forbidden, not because it looks badly<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">That people could think that he buys the gifts for himself; this would be forbidden.

Ḥanina the rabbis, not the Bible, prohibited the farmer from having any material gain from his heave and tithes.</i>.

Then they and all olives wetted by them may become impure.

For transportation to the wine press, the baskets are then emptied into a vat, usually made of clay (or any other material that is impermeable.) If some grape berries are injured in harvesting and start oozing grape juice in the basket, that fluid will not make the grapes subject to ritual impurity since the oozing juice is lost and unwelcome to the vintner. However, in the vat the lowest grapes will be compressed by the weight of the upper layers of grapes and will start losing juice. Since that juice is poured into the winepress, it is welcome because it reduces the workload on the press. Hence, the juice will make all grapes in the vat subject to ritual impurity and selling the vat to a person unwilling to follow the rules of purity would help to make the vat impure.</i>, or an olive vat<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">The argument given for grapes essentially is valid also for olives harvested into boxes which then are emptied into a vat. The difference is that olives are not easily injured when poured into the vat, and when warmed by the weight of the olives on top will start oozing sap that contains little or no oil. Hence, the olives become susceptible to impurity only if we consider the sap to be oil, since only seven kinds of fluid enable foods to be impure (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.1">Chapter 2, Notes 136–137</a>).

Rabban Gamliel says, when the work is complete {i. e., if no more olives are added to the vat}, and the sages accept his position.”</i> to anybody but a <i>ḥaver</i> or to somebody who is known to process in purity.” Is the grape vat not from the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Since grape juice is one of the Seven Fluids, the impurity of grapes in the vat must be considered Biblical.</i>? This does not disagree with Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joḥanan had explained in the previous paragraph that even the nonobservant may eat olives in purity from the vat!</i>; just as Rebbi Joḥanan said, the little one is a restriction<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">“Restriction” means a restriction imposed by the rabbis, or the Men of the Great Assembly, not a direct Biblical ordinance. It is difficult to know what the reference means. In the opinion of R. Eliahu Fulda, one refers to a statement of R. Joḥanan reported in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 80a" href="/Kiddushin.80a">Babli <i>Qiddušin</i> 80a</a> on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Tahorot 3:8" href="/Mishnah_Tahorot.3.8">Mishnah <i>Ṭahorot</i> 3:8</a>: “If a toddler was found with a piece of dough near a dough made in purity, that dough is pure in the opinion of R. Meïr, impure in the opinion of the Sages, since toddlers will grab everything they see.” On this R. Joḥanan notes that the impurity is rabbinic and one may not burn heave if it was made impure in this way. “Little one” then would refer to a toddler. According to R. Moses Margalit, the statement refers to Mishnah <i>Ṭevul Yom</i> 3:1: “All handles of food which would transmit impurity from its original source transmit impurity for <i>Ṭevul Yom</i>. Food that is almost separated, R. Meïr says, if he takes a large piece and a small one is lifted with it, the small piece goes with the large one. R. Jehudah says, if he takes a small piece and a large one is lifted with it, the large goes with the small one. R. Neḥemiah says, that refers to purity, the Sages say, to impurity.” In this case, “small one” refers to a piece of food and R. Joḥanan notes that the restrictive attitude of the Sages represents a rabbinic decree, not an interpretation of Biblical law.<br>{A “handle” of a fruit is an inedible part by which the fruit may be moved, such as the stalk of a pear or an apple. The stalk is wood and not subject to impurity, but as handle it transmits impurity both from an impure person to the fruit and from an impure fruit to any person handling it. The detailed rules are spelled out in Tractate <i>Uqeẓin</i>.<br><i>Ṭevul</i> <i>Yom</i> means a person who had been impure, had immersed himself in water for cleansing, and now is in an intermediate state until sundown when he will be pure (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:7" href="/Leviticus.22.7"><i>Lev</i>. 22:7</a>). In the state of <i>Ṭevul Yom</i>, any heave or sacrifices he touches become unusable; the Mishnah discusses transmission of that disability.}</i>, so “vat of olives” is a restriction<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Since olives and grapes cannot be compared for the fluids extracted from them.</i>. Rebbi Ḥizqiah said to Rebbi Jonah in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah: They disagree about connections. Because everywhere “biting”<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">“Biting” means that after touching, two different things cannot be cleanly separated. The standard example are two pieces of dough which after close contact cannot be cleanly separated again.

Rebbi Jonah met Rebbi Jeremiah and asked him, did you say that? He said, that is not from me, even their enablings are restrictions. Did we not state<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jonah asked from R. Jeremiah, how does he square his stand with that Tosephta?</i>: “They agree that one does not sell a wheat stack, a grape vat, or an olive vat to anybody but a <i>ḥaver</i> or to somebody who is known to process in purity?” Is the grape vat not from the Torah? Then the olive vat should be from the Torah! What about this? Explain it following Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said, sap is counted as a fluid<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">R. Meïr holds with the House of Shammai that the sap, as a necessary precursor of the oil, has the Biblical status of olive oil. In that case, the mention of the vat of olives in the Tosephta would not be practice to be followed (neither would the prohibition of selling a wholesale quantity of wheat grain, where impurity can be imparted only if water is used in milling or if the flour later comes into contact with water.)</i>.
Rebbi Zeïra said, the reason of the House of Shammai is that a <i>ḥaver</i> should never sell olives to anybody but one who tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">The House of Shammai does not state like the House of Hillel that one may also sell to one who is certain to tithe but who is not formally a trustworthy person and therefore not obliged to tithe <i>demay</i> before selling, since a <i>ḥaver</i> is always bound by the rules of the trustworthy person.</i>.
Who are the modest ones<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in the Mishnah. This sentence appears as Halakhah 8 in the Venice print.</i>? Those of noble conduct. Rav Ḥisda said, here we have taught that those of noble conduct are called modest.
<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">In the Venice print Halakhah 9.</i>: Rebbi Eleazar said, this follows Rebbi Meïr, since Rebbi Meïr said, they permitted to sell <i>demay</i> only to the grain wholesaler<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Halakhah 3:2. R. Eleazar considers the distribution of the finished wine to the two partners as a commercial transaction; hence, the one who tithes may not give to his partner anything that is not tithed.</i>. He explains the Mishnah: The one who tithes must tithe his own part as certain<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">That means, he must give heave and tithes from his own grapes before they are pressed.

It is only possible in the way Rebbi Joḥanan said, the Mishnah is the word of everybody: The one who tithes must tithe his own part as certain, and his part anywhere as <i>demay</i>; that means one half of his part in his partner’s hand as <i>demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Since we assume that everybody gives heave and we may assume that not more than 50% of his grape juice comes from his partner’s grapes, half of what he gets must be tithed as <i>demay</i>(assuming that both of them put exactly the same amount of grapes into the press; otherwise, he tithes an amount proportional to his partner’s share in the whole.)</i>.

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If two people received a field as sharecroppers or inherited it or bought it as partners, one can say to his partner, take your wheat on this side and I shall take on that side, take your wine from this side and I shall take from the other side. But he should not say to him, take the wheat and I shall take the barley, take the wine and I shall take the oil<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">According to Maimonides in his Commentary, the first part does not refer to the laws of <i>demay</i> but to money matters. In his opinion, a splitting of the first kind, designating parts of the same crop for the benefit of either party, can be enforced in court on condition that it not hurt the other party, but a proposal of the second kind, exchanging rights to different kinds of crops, will not be supported by a court. To oppose a settlement that benefits one party without being in any way detrimental to the other is called “sin of Sodom.”<br>According to R. Simson of Sens, all this deals with the laws of <i>demay</i>; in a division of the first kind, this is simply a necessary splitting of produce. The agreement must have been reached before the harvest, when no heaves and tithes were yet due. Hence, “wine” and “oil” must mean “grapes” and “olives;” nevertheless the unequal splitting is forbidden because it too closely resembles a sale that is questionable if one of the partners is a <i>ḥaver</i> and the other an <i>am haäreẓ.</i> The position of Maimonides seems to be more acceptable since the inheritance of <i>ḥaver</i> and <i>am haäreẓ</i> is treated in the following.</i>. If a <i>ḥaver</i> and an <i>am haäreẓ</i> inherited from their <i>am haäreẓ</i> father, the <i>ḥaver</i> may say, take your wheat on this side and I shall take on that side, take wine from this side and I shall take from the other side.

However, if they switch barley for wheat or oil for wine, they certainly have to be considered as buyers from one another and a <i>ḥaver</i> is not permitted to sell anything not fully tithed to an <i>am haäreẓ.</i> The <i>ḥaver</i> would have a natural inclination to take dry produce not subject to ritual impurity.

The part he inherits under Gentile law is not his until it is delivered into his hands. Therefore, he is permitted to try to get things that are useful to him. But the moment anything idolatrous came into his legal possession, he is bound to destroy it. The Yerushalmi treats this as reasonable legal construction. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 64a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.64a">Babli (<i>Avodah zarah</i>64a</a>) treats it as a special leniency, rather than a general law.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">In the Venice print, Halakhah 11.</i> a Jew and a Gentile bought a Gentile’s house and found there idols, libation wine, and coins, he should not tell him, take the idols and libation wine, and I shall take the coins.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, not only idols, libation wine, and coins, but even if there were two idols, one shaped as a tripod<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Greek δέλφιξ “tripod” [e. g. “three-legged pot”, which might be dedicated to a temple.]</i> and one not shaped as a tripod, he should not tell him, take the one that is not shaped as a tripod and I shall take the one shaped like a tripod<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Both in the Tosephta and the statement of R.

Rebbi Zeïra said, that is correct, since even in the case of a <i>ḥaver</i> and an <i>am haäreẓ</i> who inherited from their <i>am haäreẓ</i> father and found there produce which might become impure and produce which might not, may he say to him, you take the produce which might become impure and I shall take that which might not<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">The produce that might become impure since it was in the hands of an <i>am haäreẓ</i>, must be assumed to be impure and unfit for consumption by a <i>ḥaver.</i> According to Rashi (Babli <i>Ḥagigah</i> 25b), the <i>ḥaver</i> would be guilty of transgressing the prohibition to put an obstacle before a blind person if he steered his brother the <i>am haäreẓ</i> to produce which, by the <i>ḥaver’</i> s rules, should not be eaten by a Jew.</i>? But our Mishnah disagrees: “Take the idols and I shall take money, take the wine for libations and I shall take produce.” But the end shows that there is no disagreement: “After they came into the possession of the proselyte, this is forbidden;” here, from the moment he acquired it it is as if it entered into his possession<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">In practical Jewish law, paying for real estate does not convey the title but only permits acquisition of the title. For actual possession, entering the property or some substitute symbolic action is required. However, since this real estate is acquired under Gentile law, concluding the contract has the force of conveying the title; hence, from the moment the title is transferred in Gentile law, the Jew can no longer try to give the unwanted articles to his Gentile partner. The implication is that a stipulation, contained in a transaction giving the idols to the Gentile and executed before the contract for sale of the real estate was drawn up, would be valid by the Yerushalmi’s standards.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody invites his friend for a meal<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sabbath, when tithing is forbidden.</i> but the latter does not trust him with tithes, the friend should say on Friday eve: That which I will separate in the future shall be tithe, the rest of tithe near to it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The nine tenths of the tithe that one is not required to give.</i>. That which I made tithe shall be the heave of the tithe for everything, and the Second Tithe shall be to the North (or South) and be redeemed by coins<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is understood that the prospective guest must have some coins at home, reserved for redemptions. Each time some Second Tithe is redeemed, a <i>peruṭah</i>, one-eighth of an obolus, must be deducted from the value of the coin. If all value has been used, the coin should be destroyed.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Joḥanan said: The Mishnah deals with <i>demay</i>. Hence, not with certain produce<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Either <i>ṭevel</i> or produce from which heave was taken but one is certain that no tithe was taken.</i>? A Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 7:6. Since the possibility of tithing while he is out in his fields is discussed, that Mishnah must deal with weekdays. One discusses here only the possibility of tithing at a distance, which may apply also to produce which is certain. Tithing on the Sabbath is explicitly forbidden by Mishnah <i>Sabbath</i> 2:7, but the discussion here shows that the execution of a tithing plan already spelled out on Friday may be permitted.</i> says, even for certain produce, as we have stated there: “If he had <i>ṭevel</i> figs in his house and he was in the House of Study or on the field.” If you want to say that we deal with <i>demay</i>, you cannot do so, since it is stated<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 7, a direct continuation of Mishnah 6.</i>: “If it was <i>demay</i>.” What Rebbi Joḥanan said was that it deals with <i>demay</i>. He did not say, not with certain produce, but that this Mishnah deals with <i>demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joḥanan asserted that this Mishnah deals with <i>demay</i>; he did not state that provisos can only be made for <i>demay</i>. Hence, the problem lies not in the possibility of a proviso but in its nature.</i>. What is the difference between <i>demay</i> and certain produce? For <i>demay</i>, a person may make a proviso for something that is not in his possession; for certain produce, he may only make a proviso for something that is in his possession.
Rebbi Yannai had made a proviso for certain produce<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He had no time to tithe before the start of the Sabbath. (The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 93a" href="/Yevamot.93a">Babli, <i>Yebamot</i> 93a</a>, reports that his sharecropper used to bring him fruits every Friday afternoon, and that time he was so late that R. Yannai got nervous and made a proviso since the fruits would spoil if not eaten on the Sabbath.) Since provisos for certain produce were mentioned last, they are discussed first.</i>. He asked the Great Rebbi Ḥiyya, may one fix this on the Sabbath? He said to him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:23" href="/Deuteronomy.14.23"><i>Deut</i>. 14:23</a>): “That you should learn to fear the Eternal, your God, all the days,” including the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">“You shall eat before the Eternal, your God, at the place that He shall choose to let His Name dwell there, the tithe of your grain, your wine, and your oil, the first-borns of your cattle and sheep, so that you should learn to fear the Eternal, your God, all the days.” Since the verse speaks of tithes, one may tithe on the Sabbath. {In the parallel version in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 93" href="/Yevamot.93">Babli <i>Yebamot</i> 93a/b</a>, the verse is taken to prove that one should make provisos so that certain produce on the Sabbath does not diminish one’s enjoyment of the Sabbath (interpretation of Rashi).}</i>. How did you see a way to be so lenient, my initiative<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The reading בלשי is attested to by all manuscript sources. The consensus of the commentators is that one should read בשלי, “it (a possible sin) hangs on me.” But then the final בי would be unnecessary. I am taking the word parallel to Arabic בלשׁ, “to initate, show initiative.” R. Yannai is reluctant to follow the lenient ruling of R. Ḥiyya, who praises him for his independent and careful position. [J. Levy reads מַקִּיל בַּלָּשֵי “the stick of the investigators”, the instrument of customs officials (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 15:4" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.15.4">Mishnah <i>Kelim</i> 15:4</a>) used to check whether a load of grain does not hide taxable goods.]</i> depends on me! He said to him, in the future you will carry leadership in Israel.
Rebbi Hoshaia had made a proviso for certain produce. One woman cooked vegetables she had forgotten to put in order. She came to Rebbi Hoshaia who sent Zavdi ben Levi<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">An Amora of the first generation, possibly a son of Levi ben Sissi; most of his original statements are in Aggadah.</i> to put it in order for him and for her. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal asked, would Zavdi ben Levi not have to give Rebbi Hoshaia property rights on these vegetables<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is forbidden on the Sabbath, how could Zavdi ben Levi possibly tithe on R. Hoshaia’s proviso, considering that for certain produce one may not make a proviso for produce not in one’s possession.</i>? Rebbi Zeïra asked, where do we hold? If his proviso was meant for him and for others, he does not have to give him property rights on the vegetable<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">What had been excluded was a proviso valid solely for another’s produce, as described in the Mishnah. It is a general principle accepted in all of Talmudic legislation that anything one can do for himself he can do for himself and others. Hence, a proviso valid for him and for all Jews of his locality will be perfectly legal even under the restriction outlined at the start.</i>. If his proviso was not meant for him and for others, he has to give him property rights on the vegetable. Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: It was answered, Zavdi ben Levi did not give Rebbi Hoshaia property rights on the vegetable<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, if one makes such a proviso (or, if the rabbi does,) it is advisable to make it for oneself and for all inhabitants of one’s town, as in the formula for an <i>eruv</i>.</i>.
Rebbi Yannai said, he must remember his proviso.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A worker<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">An agricultural worker who is a <i>ḥaver</i> and has to be fed by his employer during the day.</i> who does not believe his employer takes one dried fig<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Of those supplied by his untrustworthy employer.

Since he has declared one fig to be heave of the tithe, that fig must be given to the Cohen. The anonymous Tanna requires the worker to give the fig from his allotment. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel requires the worker to give a fig, but one he buys, not one given to him by his employer since he is required to eat all the food he receives from his employer in order to be strong. Rebbi Yose requires the employer to give a fig to the Cohen if the worker so requires since that is a stipulation of the Court and automatically incorporated in all work contracts.</i>. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, he should not save because he reduces the work he will be able to do for his employer. But Rebbi Yose said, he should not save because that is a stipulation of the Court.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The paragraph does not belong here but in <i>Terumot</i> 2:4, where the text is identical except for בטילה instead of בטיבולה.

Meïr then he, or his worker, can eat eight <i>seah</i> based on the tithes he gave. The Sages permit only to eat according to the percentage of the tithe that still exists. Maimonides and R. Simson give two possible interpretations, one that the Mishnah there is a corollary to the Mishnah here and deals with a worker who receives food from his employer and sees the employer give to the Levite and the poor but does not know whether he gave as tithes or as gifts. R. Hoshaiah declares that the position of the Sages in that Mishnah is identical with the position of the Tanna in our Mishnah.</i> in the name of Rebbi Hoshaiah: They considered him a worker who does not trust his employer. The following is obvious: If the produce was burned, the heave is <i>ṭevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Since heave is taken to permit the rest to be eaten, if nothing can be eaten there is no heave, and heave and tithes have to be separated anew from the remainder. This refers to the case where the produce burned before the heave was delivered to the Cohen. If the heave burned after he declared it, the farmer did his duty.</i>. If the heave is burned, when the produce is eaten the heave will have been sanctified retroactively.
What did he save? From his food he separates the heave of the tithe.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text appears in Tosephta <i>Baba Meẓia</i>‘ 8:2: “A worker is not permitted to work for himself at night and rent himself out during the day, or plough with his cow in the evening and rent her out in the morning; he should not starve himself, torment himself, or give his food to his children, because he robs his employer of the work he will be able to do.”</i>: “A man should not plough with his cow at night and rent her out during the day, he should not work for himself at night and rent himself out during the day, he should not starve himself and not torment himself because he reduces the work he will be able to do for his employer.”

He said to them, if it would spring a leak.” R. Jehudah is not mentioned in the Halakhah; since he is the senior among those who disagree, the argument with R. Meïr is his and does not obligate the other two authorities who agree with R. Jehudah on the practical rule but not on the theoretical reason. Note that in the version of the Tosephta, the wine bag is already transported to the buyer’s house and, therefore, the risk of the bag springing a leak is minimized.</i>: “Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon prohibit to do so, maybe the wine bag will spring a leak and it turns out retroactively that he drank <i>ṭevel</i>.” But the reason of one is not the reason of the other. The reason of Rebbi Yose is that maybe he will pour<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">At home, he will pour out the contents of the leather wine bag into a clay amphora for storage.

As it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">A similar statement is in Tosephta <i>Maäser Šeni</i> 3:17: “If somebody said, the Second Tithe in this container should be redeemed by that <i>as</i>, and he did not define its place, R. Simeon says, he gave it its rightful name {and it is redeemed.} The Sages say, {it is not redeemed} until he says, at the North or South end.” The next Tosephta shows that the “Sages” here follow the opinion of R. Yose. The problem is that without a clear definition, the owner may spend the redemption coin on other things. Therefore, one requires him to spell out where the coin will be taken and, since coins move around in a wallet, it is clear that he has to remove the coin from the wallet immediately and separate it.</i>: “The Second Tithe in this container should be redeemed by the tetradrachma in that wallet, it is redeemed. Rebbi Yose says, it is not redeemed.” What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? “<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Maäser Šeni</i> 4:12: “If somebody says, the Second Tithe shall be redeemed by a tetradrachma that will come out of this wallet, or the denar that will come out of that wallet, R.

Yose agrees with the Sages that if he says that the Second Tithe shall be redeemed by the new tetradrachma which will come out of this wallet, or the new denar that will come out of that wallet, he did redeem. The Sages admit to Rebbi Yose that if he said [it shall be redeemed] by the tetradrachma that was in my son’s hand, the denar that was in my son’s hand, it is not redeemed since perhaps it was not in his hand at that time.” We have to assume that R. Yose agrees only in case the owner had only one new coin of that type at the moment of the declaration.</i> If he said, the old tetradrachma or the old denar, he did redeem. The Sages admit to Rebbi Yose that if he said, the tetradrachma I shall take from my son’s hand, or the denar I shall take from my son’s hand, it is not redeemed since it was not in his hand at that time.”

In any case, there is no opposition noted by either R. Yose or R. Simeon.

There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Meїlah</i> 6:6: “If a <i>peruṭah</i> of Temple property fell into somebody’s wallet, or if somebody said, a <i>peruṭah</i> in this wallet shall be Temple property, then the moment he spent the first coin he committed larceny, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say, not until he spent the entire wallet. Rebbi Aqiba agrees that if he said, ‘a <i>peruṭah</i> from this wallet shall be Temple property,’ he may go and spend the entire contents of the wallet.” מעל refers to the particular case of larceny involving Temple property, whose private use is forbidden even if it does not impair its value (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:15" href="/Leviticus.5.15"><i>Lev</i>. 5:15</a>). Our text is a <i>baraita</i> that combines the Mishnah with Tosephta <i>Meїlah</i> 3:1: “If a <i>peruṭah</i> of Temple property fell into somebody’s wallet, or if somebody said, a <i>peruṭah</i> in this wallet shall be Temple property, then the moment he spent the first coin he must bring an <i>ašam</i> sacrifice for a possible sin, for the second coin an <i>ašam</i> sacrifice for a certain sin, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say, an <i>ašam</i> sacrifice for a possible sin is brought only for an offense which if deliberate is punished by being cut off (כרת, cf. J. Milgrom, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 1-16" href="/Leviticus.1-16">Leviticus 1–16</a>, New York 1991, pp. 457–460) or, if in error, must be atoned for by a sin-offering.”</i>: “If a <i>peruṭah</i> of Temple property fell into somebody’s wallet, or if somebody said, a <i>peruṭah</i> in this wallet shall be Temple property,” it was stated that “with the first coin he committed probable larceny, with the second one certain larceny<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The argument of the Mishnah, that with the first coin he already committed certain larceny, is easier to understand. The difference between possible and certain larceny is in the kind of sacrifice that must be brought for atonement, as stated in the Tosephta. R. Moses Margalit explains the argument of R. Aqiba that the first coin, which was on top of the coins in the wallet, is not really “in” the wallet,” but the second coin certainly is “in the wallet.”</i>, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say, with any of them he committed probable larceny, except that with the last one he committed certain larceny.” Rebbi Yudan, the father of Rebbi Mattania said, that is, if there were ten coins. But if there were only two, with the first coin he committed probable larceny, with the second one certain larceny. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: What is the difference between him who says “in the wallet” and him who says “from the wallet?<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the Mishnah and the distinction which R.

Rebbi Jonah said, in both cases it depends on the act of separation; it is as if he said, this wallet should not be freed from a <i>peruṭah</i> of Temple property<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The remaining coins cannot become profane except by either removing the dedicated piece from the wallet or designating it unequivocally as old or new, as in the preceding paragraph. In the Babli (<i>Meїlah</i> 34a), this answer is given by R. Joḥanan. But the thrust of the Babli is about retroactive clarification that is excluded here and in the entire discussion of the Yerushalmi, as recognized by <i>Sefer Nir</i>.</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish’s argument is inverted. There<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Babli <i>Meїlah</i> 13b, in explanation of Mishnah <i>Meїlah</i> 3:7: “From water {drawn from the water canal flowing through the Temple courtyard on Friday afternoon of the festival of Tabernacles, to be used next morning for the water libation} in the golden barrel {that was not a sanctified vessel and in which the water would not become forbidden by standing in a vessel overnight} one may not have any use, but use is no larceny. Once it is poured into the pitcher {the holy vessel in which the water was transported to the altar} its use becomes larceny.” R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that there is no larceny from the water of the golden barrel if one uses the excess over the three <i>log</i> that are to be filled into the holy pitcher.

Hence, what he says of the first basket is valid; what he says about the second basket is invalid, it is as if he never said it. He is in trouble with the second basket since he must separate the Second Tithe before he tithes the second basket, which is forbidden. In addition, Second Tithe must be given from tithed produce; hence the tithe of the second basket has to include the produce taken for Second Tithe from that basket.

The latter is likely since the second part of 8:16, discussed here in Halakhah 7, is corrupt, as noted by all commentators from R. M. Margalit to R. S. Lieberman. The relevant part of the Tosephta reads: “If he had before him two baskets of <i>ṭevel</i>, in each one a hundred, of which heave was taken. ‘The tithes of one are in the other one,’ the first one is tithed. ‘The tithes of one are in the other, and those of the other in the one’ the first one is not tithed.

First he takes two figs (assuming 100 figs are there in all) for heave. Then he takes two tenths for the two tithes.

Hence, ten figs of the second basket free only 90 figs of the first basket; 1/10 from above is 1/9 from below. The Tanna then requires one fig to be taken in addition to free the remaining 10 figs. Samuel protests, since 1/9 = 0.1111…, if one includes tenths, the tithing will never end since one always has to add another tenth of the preceding amount.</i>.” Samuel says, you cannot state that; when he takes one in ten he has to take one in a hundred, when he takes one in a hundred he has to take one in a thousand, when he takes one in a thousand he has to take one in ten thousand.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A hundred <i>ṭevel</i> in a hundred profane, he removes 101<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The basis of these computations is Mishnah <i>Ḥallah</i> 3:9, where it is stated that if tithed and untithed produce are mixed together, it is preferable to tithe the untithed part from other produce, but if that proves impossible the whole turns into titheable produce as far as heaves are concerned, but not for other tithes. Since we are dealing with <i>demay</i>, it is always assumed that the first heave was taken and the only problem is heave of the tithe. Hence, in our case, one has to remove the 100 as equivalent of the <i>ṭevel</i> to be tithed, and, since the profane returns to the status of untithed as far as heave of the tithe is concerned, another 1% for heave of the tithe.</i>. A hundred <i>ṭevel</i> in a hundred tithe, he removes 101<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">The tithe here is First Tithe, of which heave of the tithe has been taken.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">In the Venice print, Halakhah 8.</i>: Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, one has to specify a stipulation and say: If <i>ṭevel</i> is in my hands, it shall be tithe, but if tithe is in my hands, it shall be heave of the tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the case where <i>ṭevel</i> and tithe were mixed together and one takes 101 parts for the <i>ṭevel</i> of which the one part in excess is to be addititional heave of the tithe. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish states that heave can only be taken if it is specified from where it is to be taken. In our case, heave of the tithe can only be taken if the produce was first designated to be tithe. Hence, it is necessary to stipulate that it should be designated tithe if part of the grain originated from what was <i>ṭevel.</i></i>. Rebbi Jonah said, one has to add the converse stipulation and say, otherwise I did not do anything<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jonah’s remark is a technicality.

Joḥanan is of the opinion that both heaps are potentially profane mixed with heave, and both of them fall under the strict rules of <i>dema</i>‘ until heave is taken. But R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that heave can only be taken from a designated spot; hence, the declaration is invalid and nothing has changed. It follows that, in our case, R. Simeon ben Laqish must require a declaration which fixes the exact part from which heave of the tithe may be taken, but R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody had ten rows of ten wine jugs<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 27a" href="/Bava_Kamma.27a">Babli, <i>Baba Qama</i> 27a</a>, notes that the Mishnah starts with “jugs” and continues with “amphoras,” to indicate that Biblical כד corresponds to rabbinic חבית.</i> each, and he said that one from an outer row was tithe but he does no longer know which one, he takes two diagonally<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Greek λοξός, ή, όν “slanting, crosswise”.</i> opposite amphoras<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Let the rows be numbered by <i>i</i>= 1, 2,…,10 and the amphoras in each row by <i>j =</i> 1, 2,…,10. Then the position of each amphora is uniquely described by a couple (<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>) and the amphoras are filling a square. Also, let * denote any number from 1 to 10. The outer rows are (1,*), (10,*), (*,1), (*,10). Since the problem is not the tithe but the heave of the tithe, if one takes both amphoras (1,1) and (10,10) [or (1,10) and (10,1)] he will have taken one amphora from each boundary row and have valid heave of the tithe. From the last sentence of the Mishnah it becomes clear that in all cases, only one amphora has to be given as heave of the tithe. Hence, the interpretation here is that one takes half of each amphora chosen and pours into a new one, so that the full new amphora will be the heave of the tithe.</i>. One of half an outer row was tithe but he does no longer know which one, then he takes the four amphoras at the four corners<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Since each semi-row ends at a corner, if he takes one quarter of any of the four at the corners, one of them will be the right one.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Why does he not take two<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the second sentence in the Mishnah, when he made half a row tithe on 50 of the 100 amphoras. Why can he not declare that the other half is also tithe for the remaining 50 amphoras and reduce this case to the preceding one where he has to take only from two diagonally opposed amphoras? The answer is that the remaining amphoras are already profane, not <i>ṭevel</i>, and the method proposed is impossible. (Explanation of R. Eliahu Fulda.)</i>? Rebbi Cohen in the name of the rabbis of Caesarea: When he separated half of the heave from another place.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">There is a similar Tosephta, <i>Demay</i> 5:22–23, which first explains how to take two pitchers and the declarations to make, as in the <i>baraita</i> here. But then there is no disagreement reported but it is stated that the Cohen who drinks must immerse himself not only before drinking but between the drinks and after them, combining the rules of Rebbi and R. Eleazar ben R. Simeon. That Tosephta explains the practical rule and not the background as does the <i>baraita</i> here. Nevertheless, the text of the Tosephta cannot stand as it is in manuscript and print: “The pitchers, one of impure <i>ṭevel</i> tithe, the other of pure <i>ṭevel</i> tithe. He drinks from one and immerses himself, and drinks from the other and immerses himself, and drinks from both of them together, and needs an immersion at the end.” All commentators of the Tosephta feel compelled to rearrange the Tosephta according to the Yerushalmi.</i>: “If there were two amphoras before him, one of pure tithe which was <i>ṭevel</i> and one of impure tithe which was <i>ṭevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Only pure heave may be consumed; impure heave of oil may be used as fuel but impure heave of wine cannot be used at all. Hence, if the Cohen is the owner of the tithe, he wants to take heave so that he can drink everything.</i>, he brings two vessels and takes from each of them heave of the tithe for both of them. He then turns and lifts one vessel and says: If this one is pure, I am making it heave of the tithe; else I did not do anything. Then he turns, does the same for the second vessel, immerses himself and drinks, the words of Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Since no Cohen may eat or drink heave without first immersing himself, it is obvious that here the Cohen did immerse himself first. Hence, the immersion required by Rebbi is between the drinks from both vessels.</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says, he takes it<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">A scribal error for טובל “he immerses himself.”</i> only at the end.” What is the reason of Rebbi? I say, maybe he started drinking the impure one first<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Then he has to purify himself again for the heave since the first pitcher was profane drink.</i>. And what is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? Maybe he drank the impure one at the end. Everybody agrees that he who drinks impure liquids may not even eat heave that is in doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">If somebody drinks impure fluids (in a minimum of a <i>reviït</i>, about 135 cm<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup>) then, by rabbinic decree (<i>Zavim</i> 5:12), his body becomes impure even if the impurity was only secondary. (Biblical impurity is transferred to a person only by original impurity.) If the impurity is certain, then by rabbinic decree he is impure even if it is in doubt whether the food is heave or not. But if the drink is only suspected of being impure there is no rabbinic decree and impurity is imparted only by original impurity. The discussion here assumes that all impurities discussed are rabbinic in character.</i>. If the liquids were possibly impure, everybody agrees that he may eat what certainly is heave. But here we deal with another Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zavim</i> 5:12.</i>. What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon? Since according to both the impurity is certain, he needs immersion<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">At the end, the contents of one of the vessels certainly was impure and made his body impure.</i>. What is the reason of Rebbi? That he should not be led into drinking a <i>reviït</i><sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">If he drinks less the immersion is not really necessary; it is a reminder not to make one’s body impure by drinking a <i>reviït</i> of a questionable liquid.</i>. According to the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon, he drinks less than a <i>reviït</i><sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, no immersion at the end would be necessary. Hence, the argument is faulty because otherwise Rebbi and R. Eleazar would not quarrel, one speaking about a person drinking less than a <i>reviït</i>, the other about one who drinks more.</i>. Is Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon not afraid that he would be led into drinking a <i>reviït</i>? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the only explanation you have is our first one. Rebbi is afraid that he drank the impure liquid first and Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon is afraid that he drank the impure liquid at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, the practical rule is the one given in the Tosephta.</i>.
