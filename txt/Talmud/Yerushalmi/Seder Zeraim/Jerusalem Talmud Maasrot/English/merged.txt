Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> They declared a principle for tithes: Anything that is food<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">But not industrial crops such as indigo.</i>, is guarded<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This excludes wild growing berries, etc.</i>, and grows from the earth<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This excludes mushrooms and truffles which take their nourishment from decaying plants.</i>, is subject to tithes. They declared another principle: Anything that is food from start to end<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For example lettuce and most vegetables which could be eaten even if very small. These are subject to tithes when harvested.</i>, even though it was kept to grow, is subject to tithes small or large. But anything that is not food from the start but at the end is food<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Such as fruits, inedible in the early stages of development.</i>, is not subject to tithes until it becomes food.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “They declared a principle for tithes, etc.” It is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:22" href="/Deuteronomy.14.22"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22</a>): “You should certainly tithe all produce of your seed.” I would say, everything is subject to tithes. The verse says, “<i>all</i> produce of your seed,” this includes. Does it include garden seeds that are not eaten? It is written: “produce of your seed,” and it is written: “which your field produces every year.” How is that? Take from among them anything that is food and is guarded<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is rather cryptic since it also involves v. 23 which is not mentioned in the text. The full text of the verses is: “You should certainly tithe all produce of your seed which your field produces every year. Then you should eat before the Eternal, your God, at the place He will choose to let His Name dwell there, the tithe of your grain, your cider, and your oil, as well as the firstborn of your cattle and sheep, so that you shall learn to fear the Eternal, your God, all the days.” While the second verse refers only to Second Tithe, the insistence of the first verse. עשׂר תעשׂר, “you should certainly tithe”, is taken to mean that the rules apply to both tithes equally (<i>Sifry Deut</i>. 105). The Babli frequently (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 36b" href="/Berakhot.36b"><i>Berakhot</i> 36b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 44a" href="/Pesachim.44a"><i>Pesaḥim</i> 44a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 3b" href="/Beitzah.3b"><i>Beẓah</i> 3b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 81b" href="/Yevamot.81b"><i>Yebamot</i> 81b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 51a" href="/Nedarim.51a"><i>Nedarim</i> 51a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 54b" href="/Bekhorot.54b"><i>Bekhorot</i>54b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 120b" href="/Chullin.120b"><i>Ḥulin</i> 120b</a>) insists that the second verse restricts tithes in biblical law to grain, grapes and wine, and olives and olive oil. All other tithes are considered only rabbinic. The Yerushalmi here, by not quoting the second verse explicitly, extends biblical obligations of tithe to all fruits. However, for practical purposes the Yerushalmi declares all tithes, including grain, wine, and oil, as voluntary (rabbinic) obligations in force since the return from Babylonian captivity (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 6:1:4-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.6.1.4-5"><i>Ševi‘it</i> Chapter 6, Notes 11–13</a>). Therefore, the biblical law as explained here is applicable only to the past, from Joshua to the destruction of the first Temple, and the future, the days of the Messiah.<br>The paragraph here is shorthand for the detailed discussion, transmitted, e.g., in <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 105. Since v. 22 speaks of <i>all</i> produce, one could think that all produce is subject to tithes, including industrial crops like indigo and madder. Since v. 23 requires the tithe to be eaten, industrial crops are excluded. Nevertheless, the expression “all” must include produce not otherwise mentioned. Since v. 23 speaks only of grain, wine, and oil, it follows that v. 22 includes all other fruits and seeds. However, v. 23 excludes seeds that are not food. The <i>Sifry</i> goes on to include vegetables that are not seeds from the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:30" href="/Leviticus.27.30"><i>Lev</i>. 27:30</a>: “All tithe from the earth, from seeds of the earth, from fruits of trees, belongs to the Eternal.” Here, “from the earth” is taken to denote vegetable food that is neither seed nor tree fruit. While <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:30" href="/Leviticus.27.30"><i>Lev</i>. 27:30</a> is discussed in the next paragraph in parallel to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:22-23" href="/Deuteronomy.14.22-23"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22–23</a>, the argument of the <i>Sifry</i> is not mentioned and in the Yerushalmi it is the generally accepted opinion that tithes of vegetables are purely rabbinical, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Maasrot 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maasrot.1.1.4">Note 17</a>.</i>.
Some want to understand it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Beḥuqotai Pereq</i> 12(9); <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 105.</i>: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:22" href="/Deuteronomy.14.22"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22</a>): “You should certainly tithe,” a general statement. “All grain<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">While תבוּאה in biblical Hebrew means “yield” in general, its meaning in rabbinic legal texts is limited to “grain”.</i> of your seed,” a detail. For every general statement followed by a detail, the general statement only implies the detail. That means, only grain. From where legumes? The verse says (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:30" href="/Leviticus.27.30"><i>Lev</i>. 27:30</a>): “All tithe from the earth, from seeds of the earth, from the fruit of the tree, belongs to the Eternal.” This includes seeds of garlic, cress<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of Syriac תחלא and of Maimonides’ (<i>Ma‘serot</i> 4:6) Arabic חבּ אל-רשאד.</i> and rocket<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Śevi‘it</i> 9:1.</i>. I might think to add the upper part of arum<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The inedible part carrying the seeds.</i> and the seeds of vetch, the seeds of onions, the seeds of turnips and radishes, and all other garden seeds that are not eaten; the verse says, “from<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Talmudic interpretation gives to a prefix מ a partitive meaning.</i> seeds of the earth,” and not all seeds of the earth. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:30" href="/Leviticus.27.30"><i>Lev</i>. 27:30</a>) “From fruits of trees,” to include all fruits of trees. I might think to add acacia<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Some <i>Sifra</i> and <i>Sifry</i> sources read שקמה “sycamore”.</i> and <i>ṣalmona</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The commentators take צלמונה as a place name. {A place צלמון is mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 16:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.16.6.1">Mishnah <i>Yebamot</i> 16:6</a>. Cf. also <i>Sulmo</i>, later <i>Sulmona</i>, birth place of Ovid (E. G.).} However, since the other two kinds are trees, the word also must denote a tree, possibly connected with Accadic <i>ṣulmu</i> “black (tree)”.</i> pods, and carobs from dry land<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra</i> reads גרידה “(earth) dry and hard”. This is the basis of the translation, rather than גדירה “fenced in”. In <i>Sifry</i> most mss. read גירודה (variant of גרידה, cf. Levy’s Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 357a); one ms. reads גירוגא “willow basket”.</i>; the verse says, “from<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Talmudic interpretation gives to a prefix מ a partitive meaning.</i> fruits of trees,” not all fruits of trees.
Vegetables from where? Issy ben Jehudah says, tithes of vegetables are from their words<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear whether the obligation to tithe vegetables is an original institution of Ezra or an addition from later times.</i>.
Rav Ḥisda said, if somebody declared his standing grain ownerless, came back and retook possession, and illegally gave heave, that is heave<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Produce collected from ownerless property is not subject to heave and tithes, as deduced later in this paragraph from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:4" href="/Deuteronomy.18.4"><i>Deut</i>. 18:4</a>. In general, if somebody gives heave and tithes from exempt produce, his action is invalid and no sanctity is attached to the heave given. Standing grain is not under any obligation of heave. The obligation of heave and tithes falls on the grain when it is stored after threshing but there is a latent obligation from the time it is cut since then it is potential commercial produce. Therefore, if heave was given from standing grain, that is an invalid act; if heave was given from cut ears of grain, this is against the rules but valid. If the exempt produce was cut while in the possession of its owner, a latent obligation is on it which can be activated by his giving heave and tithes “illegally”, i. e., against the rules.<br>In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nedarim 44b" href="/Nedarim.44b">Babli (<i>Nedarim</i> 44b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 28a" href="/Bava_Kamma.28a"><i>Baba Qama</i> 28a</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 94a" href="/Bava_Kamma.94a">94a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Temurah 6a" href="/Temurah.6a"><i>Temurah</i> 6a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 134b" href="/Chullin.134b"><i>Ḥulin</i> 134b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 51a" href="/Niddah.51a"><i>Niddah</i> 51a</a>), a similar principle is established using the grape harvest as an example. The entire argument disregards the opinion of R. Yose [<i>Peah</i>6:1 (fol. 19b), <i>Demay</i> 3:2 (fol. 23b), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 4:10:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.4.10.2-4"><i>Nedarim</i> 4:10</a> (fol. 38d)] who rejects the concept of ownerless property and holds that the owner has full responsibility for his abandoned property until it is taken up and acquired by another person.</i>. What is the difference between standing grain and ears of grain? Standing grain, if he illegally gave heave before he declared it ownerless, that is not heave. Ears, if he illegally gave heave before he declared them ownerless, that is heave. Rav Ḥinena in the name of Rav Ḥisda, the same applies to a dedicated crop<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated below, a crop which is Temple property is exempt from heave and tithes, as well as from the gifts to the poor. Rav Ḥisda wants to extend this exemption to standing grain which was dedicated to the Temple and redeemed while standing. In that case, there certainly is no exemption from the gifts to the poor, <i>Peah</i> Mishnah 4:5.</i>. The words of the rabbis disagree, since Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Yannai<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumot</i> 1:5 (fol. 40d), <i>Ḥallah</i>1:3 (fol. 57c), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 4:10:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.4.10.2-4"><i>Nedarim</i> 4:10</a> (fol. 38d); as tannaïtic statement <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 109.</i>: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:29" href="/Deuteronomy.14.29"><i>Deut</i>. 14:29</a>) “The Levite shall come, because he has neither part nor inheritance with you.” You are obliged to give him from what you have but he has not. This excludes gleanings for which your and his hands are equal. Gleanings, forgotten sheaves, <i>peah</i>, and abandoned property are all equal. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the company did ask: But dedications, where your and his hands are not equal, are treated<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">By Rav Ḥisda. One continues to show that Rav Ḥisda’s statement is wrong.</i> as if your and his hands were equal. Said Rebbi Ila, what are we talking about? If the heap was made when it was ownerless or dedicated, the Torah said (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:4" href="/Deuteronomy.18.4"><i>Deut</i>. 18:4</a>) “the first of <i>your</i> grain”, not the ownerless, “the first of <i>your</i> grain”, not Temple property. But we must be talking about ears that he declared ownerless and of which he retook possession. If they were ownerless, he would be free, if dedicated, he would be obligated. If they were ownerless, he would be free, since Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Yannai: (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:29" href="/Deuteronomy.14.29"><i>Deut</i>. 14:29</a>) “The Levite shall come, because he has neither part nor inheritance with you.” You are obligated to give him from what you have but he has not. This excludes gleanings for which your and his hands are equal. If dedicated, he would be obligated, from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Peah</i> 4:5.</i>: “If somebody dedicated standing produce and redeemed it standing, it is obligated.” What is the difference between ownerless and dedicated? Ownerless [property] is outside the power of everybody, dedicated [property] is not outside the power of the Temple treasurer. Rebbi Abin said, it did not even go outside the power of its owners since he must say to him you redeem first<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The prior owner of dedicated property retains the right of first refusal when the Temple wants to sell the property (<i>Sifra Beḥuqotay Pereq</i>10).</i>.
Rebbi Zeїra, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: If somebody sowed an ownerless field, the crop is subject to tithes. Rebbi Jonah offers the language: Because he acquired the ownerless field and its growth<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Any agricultural work on an ownerless field is an acquisition (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 54" href="/Bava_Kamma.54">Babli <i>Baba Qama</i> 54a/b</a>). Therefore, sowing a field (including preparing it for sowing) is an act of acquisition and the grain never grows as ownerless.</i>.
Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada asked before Rebbi Joḥanan: Are truffles and mushrooms obligated for tithes? Rebbi Joḥanan said to him in the name of Rebbi Simai, it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:22" href="/Deuteronomy.14.22"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22</a>): “You should certainly tithe all produce of your seed.” Anything which is sown and grows. This excludes truffles and mushrooms which grow but are not sown<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">They reproduce by spores, not seeds.</i>. Rebbi Jonah offers the language: Because the earth extrudes them<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Lacking chlorophyll, they live not on air and earth but on decaying organic matter.</i>.
“Even though it was kept to grow it is subject to tithes small or large.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from the Mishnah.</i>” Does this imply that if it was not kept to grow it is not subject to tithes small or large? Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: To exclude the words of Rabban Gamliel as we have stated there: “Rabban Gamliel says, flower buds of fenugreek, mustard, and white beans are subject to tithes.” Rebbi Yasa said, did Rabban Gamliel obligate them because of food<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The seeds of fenugreek, mustard, and beans are food and subject to heave and tithes. Should this imply that any other part of these plants is also subject to heave and tithes? By the time the seeds are ripe and edible, the remainder of the chalice, developed from the flower buds, has turned into wood and is inedible. This is the opposite of the case of the Mishnah, parts of plants that are food at the beginning but non-food at the end.</i>? If it were so, what about their greenery? But Rabban Gamliel says, they are important as food, but the rabbis say, they are not important as food. In addition, from what we are stating<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maasrot (Lieberman) 3:7" href="/Tosefta_Maasrot_(Lieberman).3.7">Tosephta 3:7</a>. There, the name is R. Joshua ben Qabusai.</i>: “Rebbi Joshua said, I never wanted to tell anybody go, collect flower buds of fenugreek, mustard, and white beans and cook them, to free them from tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">While he agrees with the rabbis that these flower buds (which, it seems, have to be cooked to become edible) are free from tithes, he did not want to state this publicly since Rabban Gamliel objected.</i>.”
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maasrot (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Maasrot_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>. In the Vienna ms., the Tosephta is rudimentary as quoted here. In the Erfurt ms., it continues: For example, if somebody keeps vegetables for their seeds, they are obligated at the start and free at the end.</i>: “Everything that is food at the start but not at the end.” What is this? As we stated: “He who keeps the castor plant<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Arabic ח̇רוע identification by H. L. Fleischer.</i> for seeds, his opinion is inoperative<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since nobody plants an entire field for seeding (not to extract industrial oil from the seeds), his action does not follow agricultural practice and does not free from tithes.</i>; for single stalks it is not inoperative<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since every farmer will produce some seeds for next year’s crop.</i>.” Rebbi Jonah said, only if he collected greens<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">If he never used the plant as food when it still was edible, it is not food and is free from heave and tithes in all respects.</i>. But if he did not collect greens, do we say that wood is subject to tithes?
“But anything that is not food from the start but at the end is food, is not subject to tithes until it becomes food.” What is that? That is what we have stated next: “From when are fruits subject to tithes? Figs from the moment they start to ripen.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The last sentence of the first Mishnah is the introduction to the following Mishnaiot.</i>”

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> From when are fruits subject to tithes? Figs from the moment they start to ripen, grapes and wild grapes when they start to produce sap. Sumac and mulberries when they start to become red, and all red fruits when they start to become red. Pomegranates when they become soft, dates when they start to become bloated. Peaches when they get stripes, walnuts when they form a container. Rebbi Jehudah says, walnuts and almonds when they develop a shell.<br>Carobs from when they become spotted, and all black ones when they become spotted<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">When the originally green pods start developing black spots.</i>. Pears, golden apples, quince, and sorbs<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">These trees have been identified in <i>Kilaim</i> 1:4, Notes 73,74.</i>, when they get bald<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">When they lose their down-like small hairs.</i>, and all white ones when they get bald. Fenugreek so that a new plant grows<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">When the fenugreek seeds will produce new plants.</i>. And olives when they contain a third<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This has been explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 4:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.4.7.2"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 4:9, Note 104</a>. It really means that the olives, when pressed, yield one ninth of the amount of oil recoverable from ripe fruits.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> What means ביחילו? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, if it comes alive, as you say (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Zechariah 11:8" href="/Zechariah.11.8"><i>Zach</i>. 11:8</a>): “And their souls were too much for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 7:1:17" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.7.1.17"><i>Ševi‘it</i> Chapter 7, Note 84</a>. “Coming alive” means getting some moisture in the fruit.</i>” Rebbi Abba bar Jacob in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: When they start to become red outside<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Here and in the paragraph on mulberries, “red” means any color other than green. Figs are either green or dark violet.</i>. Do all figs become red on the outside? Rebbi Tanḥum bar Marion said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: He takes one and puts it somewhere. If that one ripens within 24 hours they are obligated, otherwise they are free.
New section. “Grapes and wild grapes when they start to produce sap.” Rebbi Zeїra in the name of Rebbi Yasa: When they are called wretched grapes<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Bad but edible. R. Isaac Simponti notes that such grapes are called <i>uve malate</i> in Italian, paralleling the language of the Mishnah.</i>. Rebbi Ayvo bar Nagari<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Tiberian Amora, student of R. Ḥiyya bar Abba and R. Ila.</i>, Rebbi Tanḥum bar Ilaї<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Elsewhere, he is called R. Tanḥum bar Ḥanilaï or bar Ḥanina; a student of R. Joshua ben Levi and teacher of R. Levi.</i> in the name of Rebbi Naḥum bar Simai: Only if their seeds are visible from the outside<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The skin becomes transparent.</i>.
Rebbi Joḥanan said: I was riding on my grandfather’s shoulder when I heard the voice of Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar who was sitting and stating: “One collects the insides of a sweet melon<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The seeds and the loose tissue in which they are embedded.</i> but one does not collect the insides of a water melon.” What is the difference between the insides of a sweet melon and those of a water melon? Rebbi Simeon ben Barsana<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 2:1:19" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.2.1.19"><i>Terumot</i> 2, Note 72</a>, he is called ben Karsana, in the Rome ms. ben Parsana.</i> said, the insides of a sweet melon are for eating, those of a water melon for sowing. If you would say so, you will end up sweeping the ground on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">It is difficult to understand what the entire paragraph means and how much to trust the testimony of a toddler. It is not known which kind of melon corresponds to <i>melopepo</i>; it must be a kind whose seeds, similar to pumpkin seeds, are food after roasting. Water melon seeds with their thick, black shell are not treated as food and never subject of separate tithe. Sweeping the floor on the Sabbath is forbidden, cf. <i>Šabbat</i> 3:4 (fol. 6a), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shabbat (Lieberman) 16:20" href="/Tosefta_Shabbat_(Lieberman).16.20">Tosephta <i>Šabbat</i> 16:20</a>. One has to assume that R. Simeon ben Eleazar permits to collect (for roasting during the week) on the Sabbath the seeds of sweet melon eaten with the Sabbath dinner; the commentary of the editors of the Talmud is that in that case, people will come to sweep their dirt floors, קרקע, to collect the seeds, which may be forbidden by biblical law. (The sweeping of stone floors, ריצפה, is only forbidden by rabbinic decree as a weekday occupation.)</i>.
New section. “All red fruits when they start to become red.” Miasha<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Usually he is called Rebbi Miasha. R. S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta kifshutah Zeraïm</i> p. 667), who holds that R. Ḥanina mentioned later is the first generation Amora, takes מיישא to be the sugar-berry-tree, <i>Celtis australis</i>, mentioned as illustration of the Mishnah. Then he starts a new sentence: “It was stated …”</i> stated: Even if only one pomegranate was soft, all<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The entire pomegranate tree is now subject to tithes.

The question is not answered, probably because it never arose in a practical case.</i>?

Rebbi Eleazar said, that is Rebbi Meїr’s. He said to him, that you should not think to say it is an anonymous opinion and, against Rebbi Yose, practice follows the anonymous opinion. Therefore, one needs to say that this is Rebbi Meїr’s and between Rebbi Meїr and Rebbi Yose practice follows Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides in his Commentary and his Code (<i>Ma‘aser</i> 3:16) treats this statement as a disagreement between Rebbis Joḥanan and Eleazar and holds that practice follows the anonymous teacher.</i>.

If [the recipient] was an important personality who does not usually eat in public, if he said, take and eat, it is as if he said, take and store.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody says to another person, here take this <i>as</i> for twenty figs that I shall choose<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">In this entire Mishnah, the fruits are still on the tree or, in the case of the watermelon, on the ground connected to their roots. In the first scenario, the fruits are chosen after the deal is closed; they are bought and, since buying induces <i>ṭevel</i>, when harvested are subject to heave and tithes. In order to avoid the heave, it is necessary that they not be harvested. This means that only single berries may be plucked, not the entire bunch, not even two grapes together; small slices must be cut off the watermelon and be eaten when the watermelon still sits on the ground connected to its root; the entire watermelon will be eaten. In most cases, this means that heave and tithes cannot be avoided if the fruit is not specified at the time of the sale.<br>In the second case the sale was concluded when there was no possibility of an obligation of heave and tithes; it is as if somebody buys an entire field of standing grain; when he harvests he is in the place of the original farmer and his produce will become subject to heave and tithes only when it is brought to storage after full processing.</i>, he chooses and eats; for the bunch of grapes that I shall choose, he selects single grape berries and eats; for the pomegranate that I shall choose, he picks single kernels and eats; for the watermelon that I shall choose, he bites off and eats. But if he said, for these twenty figs, for these two bunches, for these two pomegranates, for these two watermelon, he eats as he is used to and he is free since he bought when it was still connected to the ground.<br>If somebody hires a worker to slice figs; if that one told him, on condition that I may eat from the figs, he eats and is free; on condition that I and my son will eat, or that my son may eat in lieu of my wages, he may eat and is free, and his son may eat but is obligated; on condition that I may eat while cutting and after cutting, while cutting he eats and is free, after cutting he eats and is obligated since he does not eat because of the Torah.

Chapter 3



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody transports figs through his courtyard to cut them into pieces<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">They are not fully processed and the courtyard does not induce <i>ṭevel</i>.</i>, his children and companions<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This certainly includes his wife; it may also include hired domestic servants.</i> may eat and they are free<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since the figs are not fully processed there is no reason to require them to tithe.</i>; the same holds for laborers who work for him<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">They work on other tasks, not in processing the figs. Therefore, there is no biblical law that permits them to eat. If their meals are part of their wages the employer would pay his debts with untithed fruits and this is forbidden.</i> as long as they cannot claim their meals from him. But those who can claim their meals from him may not eat.<br>If somebody takes his workers out to the field, if they have no claim to meals from him, they eat and are free<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">They do not work on the fig trees and do not eat by biblical decree. The farmer may offer them figs on the field but this does not have the status of a gift or a sale and does not create <i>ṭevel</i>.</i>. But if they can claim meals from him they may eat single fruits from the fig tree but not from the basket or the box or the <i>muqẓeh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since any food they eat between meals reduces the amount he has to give to them, the owner cannot discharge a monetary obligation using heave and tithes. Therefore, they may eat only in the way a recipient of a gift may eat untithed food.</i>.<br>If somebody hires a laborer to work with him on olive trees and said to him “on condition to be able to eat olives,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Halakhah will explain that the laborer is hired to work around the tree but not on the tree itself. He cannot eat by biblical law; therefore his contract is treated as a sale and is subject to heave and tithes if he takes more than one piece at a time.</i>” he eats one by one and if he takes them together he is obligated. To thin out onions, if he said to him “on condition to be able to eat vegetables” he snips off leaf by leaf and eats but if he takes them together he is obligated.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> May he himself eat<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Without tithing since his status is not mentioned in the Mishnah.</i>? Rav said, he is forbidden to eat; Ulla ben Rebbi Ismael said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, this one is permitted to eat. Rav follows Rebbi Meїr<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Who declares a sale before the end of processing to induce the status of <i>ṭevel</i>. Certainly he will hold that the presence of produce in the courtyard makes it <i>ṭevel</i>.</i>, Rebbi Eleazar the rabbis. Does Rav follow Rebbi Meїr? Then even his children and domestics should be forbidden! But Rav follows Rebbi, Rebbi Eleazar the rabbis. As Rebbi Simon said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, Rebbi Yose ben Shaul in the name of Rebbi: The Sages say, one eats from what is going to the <i>muqẓeh</i> only in its place<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">At the place where the cut-up figs are fermenting and drying, everybody sees that processing is not finished and one may eat without tithing. But at other places, sliced figs may look like finished food subject to tithing.</i>. Rebbi Jacob ben Idi in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: one eats from what is going to the <i>muqẓeh</i> in its place and in other places. Rebbi Yose ben Shaul objected to Rebbi: Did we not state<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 4: As long as the carob pods have not been stored on the roof, they may be used as animal feed without tithing.

Since nobody by looking at a carob can tell whether it has been stored or not, the distinction which Rebbi makes is not applied uniformly.</i>.
According to Rav, what is the difference between himself and his children? He is forbidden because he depends on <i>muqẓeh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is the owner of the courtyard, without the evidence of continued processing the courtyard would induce <i>ṭevel</i> and the duty of tithes.</i>. His children who do not depend on <i>muqẓeh</i> are permitted. We understand his children, but his wife? Does she not have a claim for food against him<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to pay one’s debts with untithed produce. The marriage contract explicitly notes that the husband will “work for, honor, feed, and provide for” his bride “in the manner of Jewish husbands.” The language seems to imply that this is a contract following rabbinic guidelines; this is the position of Nachmanides and R. Asher ben Ieḥiel (<i>Rosh Ketubot</i> Chap. 13, Sec. 6.) Maimonides holds that nevertheless the obligation is biblical, <i>Hilkhot Išut</i> 12:2.</i>? Following him who says, the wife’s food is not from the Torah. Following what we have stated: “The court will not determine food<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Ševiït</i> 5:22, quoted also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 7:1:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.7.1.2-5">Yerushalmi <i>Ketubot</i> 7:1</a> (fol. 31b), 13:1 (fol. 34d). The husband left for an overseas trip, stayed longer than anticipated, and now the wife needs money to survive. She may sell some of the husband’s property or take a loan under the supervision of the court. She may not sell Sabbatical produce for her needs since Sabbatical produce may not be used to pay debts of any kind. But if the husband is present, she may eat of his Sabbatical fruits; since his obligation to feed his wife is only rabbinical, this is not considered paying his debts with Sabbatical produce. Similarly here, her eating from figs destined for <i>muqẓeh</i> is not considered paying a debt with untithed fruit.</i> for a wife from Sabbatical money, but she may be given Sabbatical produce to eat at her husband’s.” Can she not be considered like a worker whose work is not worth a <i>peruṭah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The smallest bronze coin, about 2 grams in weight. Amounts less than a <i>peruṭah</i> are not recognized in law. The worker cannot eat according to biblical law; what he gets is a gift and the rabbis agreed earlier that a gift has the status of a sale for the obligation of tithes. Even though the obligation of the husband to feed his wife might not be biblical, it is the consequence of a contract volontarily entered upon and it should not be possible to discharge the obligation with untithed produce (except when the wife’s income from her work is more than what she would get from her husband, in which case she is free to stipulate that she will keep her earnings for herself and not be fed by him.)</i>? It implies that she is not considered like a worker whose work is not worth a <i>peruṭah</i>. Even according to him who says, the wife’s food is not from the Torah, does she not have a claim to a dwelling<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since she has the biblical right to live in her husband’s house and courtyard, if the courtyard creates <i>ṭevel</i> for him it should do the same for her; this seems to contradict Rav’s position.</i>? Following what we stated: “If men participate<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In order to turn the dead-end street where they live into a space in which one may carry on the Sabbath, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 1:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.4.1"><i>Demay</i> Chapter 1, Note 193</a>.</i> with food without the knowledge of their wives, the participation is valid.

It was stated: All that was brought from the field to town became <i>ṭevel</i>. The <i>baraita</i> is Rebbi’s, as it was stated: “<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maasrot (Lieberman) 2:8" href="/Tosefta_Maasrot_(Lieberman).2.8">Tosephta 2:8</a>: “If somebody brought figs from the field to eat them in a courtyard exempt from tithes, then forgot and brought them into his house, he may bring them back to their intended place and eat.”</i> If somebody brought figs from the field to eat them in his unprotected courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Which does not belong to a house and does not induce <i>ṭevel</i>.</i>, then forgot and brought them into his house or the children brought them<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Without his knowledge.</i>, he may bring them back to their intended place and eat.” They said that only concerning error; therefore, if intentional it is forbidden.

We understand “not from the basket or the box<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since the harvested fruits are assembled there, they cannot be eaten as a snack; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Maasrot 2:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maasrot.2.1.5">Chapter 2, Note 21</a>.</i>”, but “or the <i>muqẓeh</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The cut-up figs are lying there singly.</i>” Not “<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 3.</i> he eats one by one and if he takes them together he is obligated”? Rebbi Isaac said, they considered <i>muqẓeh</i> as being taken together<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>muqẓeh</i> of figs is like a heap of grain.</i>.
The house of Rebbi stated: He eats normally<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If he is hired to work on olives. This statement is not in the Tosephta.</i> and is free. Rebbi Jonah asked, where do we hold? If he hired him to work with him on the olives<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">To harvest them.</i>, everybody agrees that he eats normally and is free. If he hired him to work the olive trees, everybody agrees that he eats one by one and if he takes them together he is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is not harvest time, he cannot eat by biblical law and must eat under the rules of commercial transactions.</i>. But we must hold that he hired him to thin out the olives<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">To remove those whose growth is below normal in order to direct the sap of the olive tree to the good olives. Since he removes olives he can be said to harvest and eat them by biblical decree; this is the position of the House of Rebbi. But since the thinning is a long time before the real harvest, this cannot be considered harvesting: the position of the Tanna of the Mishnah. The House of Rebbi holds that a poor worker will be ready to eat unripe, bitter, raw olives.</i>. Since the latter part is about thinning out onions, if he said to him “on condition to be able to eat vegetables” he tears them out leaf by leaf and eats but if he takes them together he is obligated.
Rebbi Ḥaggai asked the colleagues: What is the reason we stated here that “he is free”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">When he eats from the fruits.</i>? They said to him, because he is eating a snack in the field and is free. He said to them, is our Mishnah needed for that, because he is eating a snack in the field and is free<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This was already stated in Mishnah 1:4 and often since.</i>? It must be because of abandoned property since if he brings it to his house he still is free. As it is stated<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maasrot (Lieberman) 2:17" href="/Tosefta_Maasrot_(Lieberman).2.17">Tosephta 2:17</a>.</i>: “If somebody found a harvesting basket covered with leaves, that is forbidden because of robbery and is subject to tithes.” It is forbidden because of robbery since it is something with distinguishing marks<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">An object found belongs to its original owner if it carries a distinguishing mark which the owner could indicate as proof of ownership; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 2:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.2.1.1">Mishnah <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i> 2:1</a>.</i>.

How far, that he could give heave from abandoned property<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Does he have to wait before eating the fruits until it is clear that the owners will not come back and have abandoned the fruits?

He cannot give heave from abandoned property<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Since fruits abandoned before the end of processing can never become subject to heave and tithes and it is forbidden to tithe what is obligated from what is not obligated (<i>Terumot</i>1:5).</i>! “He turns it into money’s worth and eats.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">He estimates the commercial value of the fruits due to the owners should they return for their property.</i>”
Rebbi Jonah asked: Does the fixing of the price create <i>ṭevel</i> in a sale<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">This is a general question since a sale of movables is consummated only by taking possession, not by paying the amount agreed on (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 8:2:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.8.2.4"><i>Kilaim</i> 8, Note 46</a>). This is held to be a rabbinic decree; by biblical law a sale can be concluded also by paying the amount agreed on. In no case does the fixing of a price conclude the sale. The particular question here is what are the legal implications of the finder putting a monetary value on the fruits he found.</i>? Or maybe, since the owners can take it back there is no <i>ṭevel</i>? Rebbi Mana asked: Think of it if one was put<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The queer formulation as a passive is necessary here since if the finder takes one fruit by all opinions he is taking possession, becomes the owner irrevocably, and incurs a monetary debt to the original owner. For the question to have meaning, a third, uninterested, person must have put the fruit into the finder’s mouth.</i> in his mouth! Is it not unappetizing? Can he give it back? If you say so, is he not eating <i>ṭevel</i> retroactively? That means, the fixing of the price is like a sale.
‘If he found a harvesting basket in a place where most people bring to market<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Then the processing is completed and is subject to heave and tithes. Since the owner might have tithed before he lost that basket, it must be tithed as <i>demay</i>.</i>, it is forbidden to eat a snack from them and he must put it in order as <i>demay</i>. In a place where most people bring to their houses<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Then the obligation starts only when the harvest is brought to storage. In this case, one assumes that it was not tithed at all.</i>, it is permitted to eat a snack from them and he must put it in order as certain. Half and half, he puts in order as <i>demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">As spelled out later, this is if he wants to eat in the field.</i> but if he brings it to his house he must put it in order as certain.’ Rebbi Jonah asked, does <i>demay</i> create <i>ṭevel</i> for certain<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The rule given for a harvest basket found in a place where 50% move to market makes sense only if either all or none of the fruits are eaten in the field. If some are eaten in the field and tithed as <i>demay</i>, how can they then lose their status as profane and return to that of <i>ṭevel</i> for Great Heave. This seems to be impossible; cf. <i>Terumot</i> 1:4.</i>? If you would say so, does he not invert the order? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun, Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Yoẓadaq, he must spell out a condition and say: “If this is from those who bring to market, what I did is valid, otherwise, I did not do anything,” so that heave of the tithe should not contain <i>ṭevel</i> of the Great Heave<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">If heave of the tithe was taken as <i>demay</i> on the field under the reservation spelled out here and the great heave and another heave of the tithe in the house, the three heaves may be eaten by a Cohen and the remainder is fully profane. If there were no reservation made the first heave of the tithe would be forbidden even to the Cohen as <i>ṭevel</i>.</i>. ‘Half and half on the field he puts in order as <i>demay</i> but if he brings it to his house he must put it in order as certain.’ Should one not be afraid that it was from those who bring to their houses and its Great Heave would contain <i>ṭevel</i> of heave of the tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text in both mss. and the <i>editio princeps</i> but it is difficult to accept since in this case the first heave of the tithe has been declared to be profane and is given to the Cohen only because of the doubt. All commentators emend the text but their emendations do not help much. One has to say that the (slightly varied) text of the <i>baraita</i> introduces a new argument (in preparation for the answer of R. Mattaniah) which does not take the stipulation of R. Joḥanan into account. It is pointed out that not only does one run into difficulty if the basket was destined for the market but even if it was destined for the house. In that case, the first heave of the tithe (given as <i>demay</i>) is <i>ṭevel</i> for the Great Heave and cannot be eaten by the Cohen.</i>? Rebbi Mattaniah said, if he gives a name to his tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Since Great Heave has no minimum volume by biblical standards, if the basket which was put in order as <i>demay</i> now is tithed as certain, it is sufficient to declare that some minute amount of the heave of the tithe is to be eaten as Great Heave. Since for the Cohen the rules of both are identical, no difficulty is created and the solution of R. Joḥanan is unnecessary.</i>.
So far something that has no threshing floor; but of produce from the threshing floor one separates heave of the tithe but does not need to give Great Heave as it was stated: “<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">A related text in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maasrot (Lieberman) 2:17" href="/Tosefta_Maasrot_(Lieberman).2.17">Tosephta 2:17</a>. According to the Tosephta, the question in the next paragraph is pointless since tithes may be taken either from the grain or from storage.</i> If he found cleaned<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Cleaned from chaff after threshing.</i> grain on the field, in a heap it is forbidden because of robbery, dispersed it is permitted because of robbery<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">These grains are leftovers from threshing which were not collected. Therefore, they are abandoned property and legally may be taken up by any passer-by.</i>. In any case it is subject to tithes but free from Great Heave because no threshing floor is cleared unless Great Heave was taken.”
From where are tithes taken, from the house or from the field<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The question is difficult to understand since it was shown in <i>Terumot</i> 2:1 that only Great Heave must be given from the harvest at a well defined place but tithes and the Heave of the Tithe may be given from any untithed produce of the same kind. The question seems to be whether the grain collected after somebody else’s threshing is subject to tithes as a biblical law, in which case it can be used to tithe others and other grains can tithe for it, or it is rabbinic and a special case which needs special handling.</i>? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>baraita</i> is quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 4b" href="/Pesachim.4b">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i> 4b</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 9a" href="/Pesachim.9a">9a</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 41b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.41b"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 41b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 15b" href="/Niddah.15b"><i>Niddah</i> 15b</a>. It is asserted there that the fact that the grain is in a chest is in itself proof that the grain was fully tithed before storage. In contrast, the Yerushalmi seems to permit a fellow to deposit his grain in the chest and tithe from it.</i>: If a fellow died and in his estate was a chest full of grain, even if he filled it the same day it is supposed to be in order. Is it impossible that he should not have been of clouded mind at least for an hour<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Then the grain might be un-tithed even though it belonged to a fellow who was true to his obligations.</i>? Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, explain it if he died with a clear mind. Rebbi Ḥananiah in the name of Rebbi Phineas understood it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 5:9, speaking of Rabban Gamliel and his entourage on a voyage from Rome to the Land of Israel who had to tithe his grains before the holiday and did this by a promise of future delivery from storage.

Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba understood it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 4:2, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Maasrot 3:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maasrot.3.1.3">Note 14</a>.

Meїr and the Sages, tithes can be given from another storage facility.</i>: “If somebody’s produce was in a storage bin and he gave a <i>seah</i> to a Levite and a <i>seah</i> to a poor person;” that means, from the house. Rebbi Abba Mari understood it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 5:10. The Mishnah contains a <i>midrash</i> on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:13" href="/Deuteronomy.26.13"><i>Deut</i>. 26:13</a>: “I did remove the sanctified food” refers to Second Tithe and the fourth-year growth, “from the house,” refers to <i>ḥallah</i>, “and also gave it” refers to heave and heave of the tithe, “to the Levite,” refers to the Levite’s tithe, “the sojourner, the orphan, and the poor,” refers to the tithe of the poor, “following all commandments You commanded me;” therefore, if he gave heave of the tithe before the Great Heave he cannot recite the declaration, “I did not transgress Your commandments and I did not forget.” Since the house is mentioned in connection with <i>ḥallah</i> heave from dough, it is clear that heaves and tithes are supposed to be taken outside the house, i. e., in the field.</i>: “(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:13" href="/Deuteronomy.26.13"><i>Deut</i>. 26:13</a>) ‘From the house’, that is <i>ḥallah</i>.” That means, from the field.

However, if the second is picked while the first one is still there, both become <i>ṭevel</i>.<br>According to R.

If he picked and put it on a table, even a single one is obligated.” The first sentence of the paragraph states that even if he did not put it on a table but waited after softening the fig three times, he is obligated. This interpretation is the only one giving the Mishnaic expression “one gives him time” the usual restrictive meaning of “so much but not more.” The second sentence is then taken to mean that if the second fig is picked after the time allotted for the first, if the first is not yet completely eaten the existing remainder becomes obligated but the second remains free unless held together with the first.</i>.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who pickles, cooks, or salts in the field is obligated<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">All these activities are considered final processing, as explained in the Halakhah. “Cooking” means preserving by prolonged cooking; “salting” is salting to preserve.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Fire creates <i>ṭevel</i>, buying creates <i>ṭevel</i>, salt creates <i>ṭevel</i>, heave creates <i>ṭevel</i>, the Sabbath creates <i>ṭevel</i>, a secure courtyard creates <i>ṭevel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the discussion Chapter 2:2–3.

Rebbi Immi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, the most reasonable of these is the secure courtyard.
He who pickles, only if he pickles completely<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Does it become <i>ṭevel</i> only if the pickling is completed, or at least if the brine is strong enough that the vegetables would be completely cured if left in the brine for a sufficient time?</i>?

Yose ben R. Jehudah.<br>All the argument here proves is that it is possible that pickling and preserving by cooking makes <i>ṭevel</i> only if the intent was to do a thorough job.</i>.
If he pickled or cooked without the owners’ knowledge, there is a difference between Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish since these differ: If somebody made a heap [of somebody’s grain] without the latter’s knowledge, Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is <i>ṭevel</i>, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, it is not <i>ṭevel</i>. Rebbi Yudan said, there it is impossible for him not to make a heap<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">After threshing, the grain must be raked together to be used. Therefore, R. Joḥanan may hold that the heap was made with the implied consent of the owner. This is not the case for pickling olives. R. Joḥanan may hold that pickling without consent of the owner does not create <i>ṭevel</i>. Fragments of this discussion are in Chapter 1, cf.

Rebbi Jeremiah asked: If he fried in the field, what is its status<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">May it be eaten as a snack without tithing?</i>?

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody lifts out plants from his own property”, etc. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: This is Rebbi Aqiba’s. As we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Peah</i> 1:6; Notes 275–276.</i>, “He may take from the threshing floor and sow and it is free from tithes until he smoothes, the words of Rebbi Aqiba.” Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, it is the opinion of everybody. The Sages agree with Rebbi Aqiba in the matter of young plants<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In no way can taking young plants be compared to taking grains from the threshing floor.</i>. What is the difference between wheat and young plants? For wheat, it was the end of processing<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Threshing is really the end of processing for wheat.

Rebbi Aqiba agrees with the Sages in the matter of turnips and radishes because they spoil<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Taking them out of the ground is the end of processing since in the absence of refrigeration they have to be consumed immediately.</i>. Does wheat not also spoil? Wheat admits another threshing floor<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The smoothing of the heaps.</i>, these have no other threshing floor.
“If somebody collected in order to send to a friend, it is free.” Rav said, he<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The sender.</i> is forbidden to eat. Rebbi Shammai said before Rebbi Yose in the name of Rav Aḥa: Rav said this in case he brought it into a secure courtyard, following Rebbi Meїr<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, Halakhah 5.</i>. Rebbi Mana said, our Mishnah implies this: “If somebody bought standing produce, it is free.” Therefore, after it was cut it is obligated. Who is the person who holds that a sale induces <i>ṭevel</i> for produce not fully processed? Is this not Rebbi Meїr<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, last paragraph.</i>? Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, it is from Rebbi Jehudah. It was stated so<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Maasrot (Lieberman) 3:8" href="/Tosefta_Maasrot_(Lieberman).3.8">Tosephta 3:8</a>.

The colleagues asked, we can understand a vulgar who is suspect; is a Fellow suspect? Rebbi Yose said, is the vulgar not like a Fellow in matters of heave?

There, he abandons everything, here he abandons only the future growth<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that “to abandon the produce” in the Tosephta (and here in the Halakhah) means that he retains ownership of the plant (in the Tosephta) and the core of the turnip (in the Halakhah) and intends only to free the future growth. This is illegal. But irrevocable abandoning a plant to public use frees the plant from all heave and tithes legally and, since the poor profit from it, cannot be subject to rabbinic sanctions.<br>The Rome ms. has here an addition: תדע לך שהוא כן דתנינן לזרע וזרע לא כגידולין הוא “You should know that is so since we have stated ‘for seeds’.

But did we not state “outside the Land?” There is a difference, outside the Land both for the stem and future growth<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since the stem of a plant outside the Land is also outside the Land, he takes produce subject to heave and tithes by the act of taking them out of the ground and removes them completely from obligations of heave and tithes for private gain; this is subject to sanction.</i>; is here not a difference between the stem and future growth?

Whether there is a rabbinic obligation to tithe produce grown in a house is a matter of dispute between Maimonides and R. Abraham ben David (<i>Ma‘serot</i> 1:10). The position of Maimonides, that the discussion here is only about the biblical obligations, not the rabbinic ones, is supported by the next paragraph, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Maasrot 5:2:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maasrot.5.2.7">Note 83</a>.</i>; according to the Sages any later growth is free<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Since at harvest time it is produce of a house, not of a field.</i>. If he sowed in a house, removed the roof, and then made a roof over it: according to Rebbi Aqiba any later growth is free; according to the Sages any later growth is obligated.
Is there a dispute between Rebbi Aqiba and the Sages even for <i>ḥallah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">This cannot refer to the problem of one-third ripe grain since <i>ḥallah</i> is the heave from dough.

Produce exported from here to there, R. Eliezer makes it obligated, R.

There is a rabbinic obligation to give <i>ḥallah</i> from any dough anywhere. If only one of the two conditions is satisfied, is the obligation biblical or rabbinical?</i>? What do you want from Rebbi Aqiba, since Rebbi Aqiba said, produce from outside the Land which was imported into the Land is obligated for <i>ḥallah</i>? If Rebbi Aqiba would hold like Rebbi Eliezer, your question would be correct.
Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Zeїra: He sowed in a flower pot without a hole and made a hole? He said to him, now it has a hole<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">A flower pot with a hole standing on the ground is part of the earth and its produce is “produce of the field”; cf. Mishnah <i>Demay</i> 5:10, Halakhah <i>Kilaim</i> 7:8. A flower pot without a hole is not subject to the laws governing agriculture in the Land. Since practice follows the Sages, only the status at the time of harvest counts even if the produce grown in the pot is grain.</i>.
Rebbi Abun said, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel goes with the argument of his ancestor<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Why is he not called his father?</i> Rabban Gamliel.

Both for R. Ismael and for R. Aqiba, the general statements have to be interpreted in the light of the list; the money may only be spent on food. This excludes water and salt which are not food.
