Notes by Heinrich Guggenheimer on Jerusalem Talmud

Berakhot



Paragraph 1

Reading of the Rome manuscript; Leyden and Venice: נקדים. The word is Greek νεκρός “inanimate” (adj.).<br>
דהכא is the reading of the Rome manuscript and also the reading of the prints in the next paragraph. The word דהתם of the printed editions and the Leyden ms. is impossible; it is the Babylonian Aramaic equivalent of Galilean תמן.<br>

Paragraph 2

The words are in both the Leyden and Rome manuscripts, but missing in the Genizah fragments and in the text of R. Solomon Cirillo. Since they contradict the following discussion, they should be disregarded.<br>

Paragraph 3

The Venice (and Leyden) text here, כפיטם, is unintelligible. The text given here is that of the Genizah fragments and the parallel in <i>Śemaḥot</i>.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden: הוה. The text here is the only mention we have of this Amora.<br>
The unexplained word ליטור is missing in the parallel <i>Nazir</i> 7:1 (fol. 56a). It probably is a corruption and is best disregarded. It could be from נטר “to act as watchman.” R. M. Margalit assumes that a silent ע is missing, that one should read לעיטור, to annul (a document of indebtedness.) The interpretations of Z. Frankel (Latin <i>latro</i>), J. Levy (Greek ῥητώρ), and M. Jastrow (“to Iturea”) have to be rejected.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden: משמשה (both times).<br>

Paragraph 4

In the Kaufmaan manuscript of the Mishnah, the vocalization is שְׁגֵירָה, a reading not found in other traditions.<br>
A scribal error for שָׁמַע in the verse. The entire sentence is missing in the Rome ms.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and <i>Berešit rabba</i>. The Venice print has דברי, from a scribal error in the Leyden ms.<br>
The Yerushalmi text has אסכריה; the word is missing in ms. Rome. Musaphia in <i>Arukh</i>, s. v. אסדא, reads אסכדיה, as does the Gaonic Commentary to Mishnah <i>Negaïm</i> 13:1. The other commentaries of <i>Negaïm</i> 13:1 read the word as אִסְקַרִיָּא, Greek κεραία “beam; horn; projection”, which does not make sense here. σχεδία means “raft.” {The technical term רפסודה in late Biblical Hebrew might be a Phoenician term derived from Greek ῥάπτω “string or link together” (E. G.).}<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The word is missing in the Venice text.<br>

Paragraph 5

Probably a scribal error for מֵחֲבֵירוֹ.<br>
This is the reading of <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni Isaiah</i> §481. The Venice-Leyden version “R. Abbahu” is certainly corrupt.<br>
Text of the Rome manuscript; the sentence is missing in the Leyden ms. and the Venice print.<br>
In the Biblical text עַתָּה “now”.<br>
The text here is that of the Yerushalmi from the Genizah and, partially, from the Rome manuscript; the Leyden/Venice text is shortened by omission of the words in parenthesis.<br>
Text of the Rome ms., in place of דרבי in the Venice print.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript; “Rebbi Eleazar ben” is missing from the Venice text but R. Yannai is later than R. Eleazar ben R. Antigonos.<br>
This is the reading in the Rome manuscript and the Genizah fragments. The Venice print has “Rebbi Isaac” which is impossible because Rebbi Isaac is older than Rebbi Simon and because later the Talmud text refers to Rebbi Phineas.<br>

Paragraph 6

Reading of the Rome ms., Genizah fragments, and the parallel to this paragraph in <i>Midrash Bereshit rabba</i>. The Leyden ms. and Venice print have רב נחמן. The name of an Amora is impossible in a tannaïtic disgreement.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice text has לו.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. Venice print: כהדין.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Leyden manuscript and Venice print have again “R. Joshua”.<br>

Paragraph 7

The last two words are not in the Rome manuscript and are probably dittography.<br>

Paragraph 8

The Venice text here is self-contradictory: י״נהיק. שמואל לא אמר. Hence, the text chosen for the next three words is that of the Rome manuscript.<br>
The Venice text has here a superfluous אמר that is not found in the Rome ms.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. The Venice print has יוחנן על.<br>
In the Venice print and Leyden manuscript, the reading is כהתם “as there”, which makes no sense. The reading here is from the Rome manuscript; Yerushalmi התה is parallel to Babylonian חייתא “sack, sackcloth.”<br>
The Rome ms. has here an insert: מחלפה שיטתהון דבית שמאי תמן אמרין טהור והכא אמרין טמא תמן (מאוס) [מסוס] ברם הכא בעינו הוא. The word in parenthesis has been corrected following the text of the commentary of R. Abraham ben David (<i>Ravad</i>) to Idiut. “The opinions of the House of Shammai are reversed, there (<i>Idiut</i>) they say it is pure, here (<i>Berakhot</i>) they say it is impure. There it is melted into the body, here it is visible.” Since a similar discussion is given for the House of Hillel, the insertion is part of the Yerushalmi that was lost from the Leyden ms. by oversight.<br>
Name from the parallel in the Midrash. The text here has ר׳ בזירה, an otherwise unknown person.<br>
Insert following the text on <i>Bereshit rabba.</i> The omission in the other sources makes no sense since Rav Huna preceded Rebbi Abbahu. The note “Rav Huna in the name of Rav” is missing in the parallel (Babli <i>Pesaḥim </i>54a).<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden: במעשיו.<br>

Paragraph 9

Probably a scribal error for פקרו, but there is no manuscript evidence. In the parallel, <i>Bereshit rabba</i> 8(8), the text reads: כל מקום שאתה מוצא פתחון פה למינין “any place where you find that herectics can open their mouth”. There, the entire sequence is found.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice: קוסנתירו, <i>Arukh</i> reads קוסטינר. Late Latin <i>quaestionarius</i>, “torturer, executioner.”<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript; Venice print מים.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice: אבסקטא, but in <i>Avodah zarah</i> 1:9, the Venice text is equal to the Rome text here. Greek ἀβάσκαντα, “secure against witchcraft, free from harm” (D. de Lara in כתר כהונה). In the Babli, <i>Avodah zarah</i> 20a/b, Rabban (Simeon ben) Gamliel is reported to have quoted a verse (<i>Ps.</i> 104:24): “How great are Your works, o Eternal!”<br>
This is the text of the Mishnah in the Halakhah, fol. 14c. In the separate Mishnah, fol. 13c: שכחו וגבורתו מלא עולם.<br>
This word is missing in the parallel <i>Sukkah</i> 1:2 and is superfluous.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Soṭa</i> and the Rome manuscript here. The Venice print has an unintelligible והפסיד “he lost”.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice print has טונוס טרופוס.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice print has רחתת, an otherwise unknown word that cannot be derived from Rabbinic רחת “winnowing shovel.”<br>

Peah



Paragraph 1

Reading of the parallel in <i>Qiddushin</i>. The Venice text has אביו instead of אכין; two easily made substitutions.<br>
This is the reading of the parallel in <i>Qiddushin</i>. The Venice text here has צמות “assembly”. The requisition is from the government, probably for service with the army<br>
This is the reading of the parallel sources and of S. Cirillo; the Venice print has “reaping”, which certainly is incorrect.<br>
This is the text in the parallel <i>Kilaim</i> 8:1; the word is missing in the manuscripts here.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Leyden manuscript and Venice print have “<i>peah</i>” by an obvious scribal error.<br>
The text follows the parallel <i>Nedarim</i> 7:1; here: לירק.<br>R. Isaac ben Ḥaqolah is a contemporary of R. Joshua ben Levi. He was student of most of the Amoraïm of the first generation and teacher of many of the third.<br>

Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3

Reading of R. Shelomo Cirillo. The Venice print and manuscripts have נמרידה; Z. Frankel corrects the last, unintelligible, word to נמרירה. That change is also implied by the commentary of R. Moshe Margalit. R. Eliahu Fulda does not comment on the passage.<br>
Language of the Mishnah and the Rome manuscript.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript only.<br>
In the Bible text: מצורות.<br>
Reading of R. S. Cirillo. The Leyden ms. and Venice print have כִּי.<br>

Paragraph 4

Reading of R. Simson of Sens and R. Solomon Cirillo. The Venice print has “התנן”, which is certainly incorrect.<br>
Text of the Rome ms. here and the Venice print in the parallel <i>Giṭṭin </i>8:3, fol. 49c. Venice print here: אדם זוכה לחבירו במציאה. The verse reads ואני בעניי.<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Baba Meẓi‘a</i>. The Venice print has here בשם which makes no sense since this is clearly a report of a dialogue.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript, quote from the Mishnah. Venice: רבן שמעון בן גמליאל.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., <i>Sifra Qedošim</i> 1:10, and the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Šabbat</i> 23a). Venice: קנויה.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice print has: במחלוקת “in disagreement.”<br>
This is the text of the Leyden manuscript before correction and of the Rome manuscript. But the corrected text of the Leyden manuscript and the Venice print reads פטוּרין. However, the parallel in the Mishnah <i>Ḥallah</i> 3:3 in all sources reads חייבין. According to the text the two parts of the Mishnah are completely parallel. According to the Venice print, the two statements “but after the time of tithes” and “and the treasurer finished it” are identical and one of them is redundant.<br>
במרוח is the text of the Venice print here, במחלוקת the text of all sources in <i>Ḥallah</i> 3:3.<br>
Reading of Rome and R. Solomon Cirillo manuscripts. Venice print and Leyden ms.: ליתן.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. Since all other occurrences show that R. Ḥizqiah was R. Jeremiah’s student, the reading here of the Venice print/Leyden ms. “R. Jeremiah, R. Ḥizqiah” must be a scribal error. In the next paragraph, the Venice print also has the reading given here.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms.; the Venice print has “R. Jehudah”; no R. Jehudah is ever mentioned as opponent of R. Simeon ben Laqish.<br>

Paragraph 5

Reading of the parallel in <i>Šeqalim</i> 1:2, in the Venice print מד.<br>
The vocalization of this word is tentative. Z. Frankel notes that probably this is one of the many scribal mix-ups of י for ו and one should read a <i>nif‘al</i> לְהִצּוֹל; this form is translated.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice print has שאינו which is contradicted by the last sentence of the paragraph.<br>
Reading of R. Simson of Sens. In the Leyden manuscript and Venice print, אם אמר.<br>
Reading of the Leyden (first hand) and Rome manuscripts. The corrected Leyden ms. and the Venice print have: מַה לִי בְּתוֹךְ הָעִיר מַה לִי בְּתוֹךְ שָׂדֵהוּ.<br>

Paragraph 6

This paragraph is also in <i>Nedarim</i> 4:10 where the text is somewhat better preserved.<br>
In <i>Nedarim</i> דַּייָנָא. In the Rome manuscript ר׳ יימא. Since he is not mentioned again, the correct name cannot be established.<br>
This is the text in <i>Nedarim</i>. In Peah, אינו, a scribal error as seen from the next sentence.<br>
Reading of R. S. Cirillo. The Venice print has a garbled: חד בא רבי אמר חדא.<br>
Reading of the Tosephta. The Venice print has אומר ליה.<br>
Or Lia, La, Illaï. This is the reading of R. S. Cirillo’s manuscript; the name is missing in the other sources. (It cannot be Rebbi Jehudah the Prince since it is introduced by אמר, not by תנא, as noted by R. Z. Frankel.)<br>
Readings of R. Simson and the Cirillo manuscript. In the Venice print and Leyden manuscript: בגין תבואה שבכרם.<br>

Paragraph 7

Manuscript readings of R. Abraham ben David בְּדַבְּרָה “on the grazing area,” i. e., if the area is given over to animals to graze the harvest is finished.<br>
All manuscript sources of the Mishnah except the Leyden manuscript have either נקרצת or נקצרת.<br>
This text follows the parallel <i>Maäser Šeni</i> 5:3, the Venice text here has: ... שבית שמאי יש לו.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. The Venice print has a superfluous בעי.<br>
Text of <i>Maäser Šeni.</i> Venice print: את, which is chronologically impossible.<br>
Text of the parallel in <i>Pesaḥim </i>4:9; here the text reads לא הקדישו.<br>

Paragraph 8

Reading of R. Simson of Sens, the Venice print has הוּא.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice print has unintelligible כו דא.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript and R. S. Cirillo. The Venice print and Leyden manuscript have נהגין, identical with the Mishnah text.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript, the Mishnah manuscripts of the Yerushalmi tradition, and the first hand of the Leyden manuscript. The second hand and the print have: הסעודה.<br>
Missing from the Venice print, the word is in all manuscripts.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice print has ארגדון, the Leyden ms. ארגרון. The word אגרון is not in the Talmudic dictionaries but was used by Rabbenu Saadiah Gaon as title of a book, “collection.” D. Sperber (Roman Palestine 200 – 400, Ramat Gan 1974), devotes an entire chapter (XXII) to this passage. He prefers the reading ארגרון which he identifies with Greek ἀργύριον “small silver coin”.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript, this is the standard language of the Yerushalmi. Venice print: אנא “please.”<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The Venice print has ליטול; this is contradicted by the following reference, עוֹד הִיא לִיתֵּן, which presupposes a ליתן earlier.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. Venice print: בשר צפרים “bird meat”.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript and the Mishnah manuscripts in the Maimonides tradition. The Leyden manuscript and Venice print have חכמים, a conflation of two verses: (<i>Ex</i>. 23:8) “Do not take bribes, for bribes blind the seeing and adulterate just sayings.” (<i>Deut</i>. 16:19) “Do not take bribes, for bribes blind the wise and adulterate just sayings.”<br>
Reading of <i>Arukh</i> and R. S. Cirillo. Venice print: אגנטין.<br>

Demai



Paragraph 1

Reading of the Leyden manuscript. In the Venice print, as well as the Kaufmann manuscript of the Mishnah, שיקמה, perhaps by dittography from the next sentence. In the Rome manuscript, שיקמונה.<br>
Reading of all manuscripts. The print has a typographical error הבעיר.<br>
It seems that here a second ספק has been omitted.<br>
Reading of R. Simson of Sens; the word fell out by haplography.<br>
Reading of Rome manuscript. The Venice text and Leyden manuscript have אבל, which is contradicted by the next clause.<br>
Text of the Rome manuscript, this is also the name quoted in several other passages in the Yerushalmi. The Venice/Leyden text has זבינא.<br>
Reading of Midrash and <i>Šeqalim</i>. The Venice print has יתבון “they sat”.<br>

Paragraph 2

Reading of the Rome manuscript; Venice print: אחר.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript. The word is missing in the Venice print. For יהודאי, Rome reads יהו ודאי which is not impossible.<br>
Reading of Rome manuscript. Leyden and Venice: רטיבתא “the moist one.”<br>
Reading of Venice text. In the Leyden ms: בולכסין; in the Reḥov mosaic correctly בולבסין, Greek βολβός, “root, bulb, onion”; Latin <i>bulbus</i> “bulb, onion” or other garden vegetable mentioned as <i>bulbus</i> <i>fabrilis</i> in <i>Ed. Diocl</i>.<br>
Reading of the Rome manuscript, the last two words missing in the Venice print. R. Ḥiyya the student of R. Joḥanan is always R. Ḥiyya bar Abba.<br>
Also cf. reading of the Rome ms: הכליניקי. R. S. Lieberman proposes to read לכניקי, explained as [πλατεῖα] λαχανική “[market of] vegetable kind.” One might read כליניקי as κλινικοί “physicians” [making house calls to patients in bed (κλίνη)]. For food the physician may be feeding his patient, cf. Chapter 3, Notes 18–19.<br>
A superfluous word, probably scribal error.<br>
The Rome ms. and the Vienna ms. of the Tosephta read: בית בדיא.<br>
Text of the Rome ms. and R. S. Cirillo, missing from the Leyden ms. and Venice text.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: שהן which is redundant in the syntax of the Yerushalmi. The reference is to the statement of R. Mana above that there were towns on the Golan heights which were permitted but in his time, when the center of Jewish settlement was moving from Galilee to the Golan heights, they became Jewish and forbidden.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Venice: עשׂוי שׁל צימוקין אלא נן.<br>
In a related discussion, Halakhah 5:1. (The reading מה is from the Rome ms., Venice print: מאן.)<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden have ר׳ אילא who is mentioned in the paragraph in disagreement with the colleagues.<br>
Reading of all Mishnah and Yerushalmi manuscripts. The Venice print is garbled at this point: את שדרכו למדוד בדקה ומדדו בגסה בגסה ומדדו בדקה בא טפילה דקה בגסה.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice print and Leyden ms. have טמן, easily explained as reading error ני → ט.<br>

Paragraph 3

Reading of the Rome ms. and all Medieval sources. Venice has לכלי, in the parallel <i>Ma‘serot</i> 2:3, fol. 49d, לבני.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden: ברסנא. The Rome reading is supported by the few other places in which this author is quoted; cf. <i>Ḥallah</i> 4:3,<i> Šabbat</i> 1:8, <i>Eruvin</i> 1:7. The tradent was a student of R. Aḥa; nothing more is known about him.<br>
This word, while in the mss., must be considered an intrusion from the preceding sentences.<br>
Text of the Leyden manuscript, missing from the Venice print.<br>
Parallel in ‘<i>Abodah zarah</i> 2:3, fol. 41b, where the reading is: בְּעָא קוֹמֵי רִבִּי מָנָא רִבִּי חֲנִינָא. Since R. Ḥanina is mentioned in the conclusion, he should be mentioned here also. At the end, instead of מַתְּרִיס לְקֳִבֵל רִבִּי אָחָא it reads מַתְּרִיס לְקִבְּלֵיהּ, referring to Rebbi Mana. The Amora in that case must be R. Ḥanania, not R. Ḥanina. The last reading, “R. Aḥa,” is not too likely either but not impossible.<br>
It seems that there is some confusion of two Tosephtot in the order of sentences here. The translation follows a reordered text:<br>אָמַר רִבִּי יְהוּשֻׁעַ בֶּן קָבֻסַּיי כָּל־יָמַי הָייִתִי קוֹרֵא<br>הַפָּסוּק הַזֶּה וְהִזָּה הַטָּהוֹר עַל הַטָּמֵא טָהוֹר אֶחָד מַזֶּה<br>עַל טָמֵא אֶחָד. עַד שֶׁלָּמַדְתִּיהָ מֵאוֹצָרָהּ שֶׁל יַבְנֶה.<br>הָדָא אָֽמְרָה שֶׁטָּהוֹר אֶחָד מַזֶּה עַל כַּמָּה טְמֵאִין.<br>וַחֲכָמִים אוֹמְרִים אֲפִילוּ כּוּלּוֹ גּוֹי וְיִשְׂרָאֵל אֶחָד<br>מַטִּיל לְחוֹכוֹ דְּמַאי. דְּתַנֵּינָן אֶצֶל הַנָּכְרִי כְפֵירוֹתָיו.<br>אָמַר רִבִּי לָֽעְזָר חֲכָמִים שֶׁהֵן בְּשִׁיטַּת רִבִּי מֵאִיר.<br>רִבִּי יוֹחָנָן אָמַר חֲכָמִים מַמָּשׁ. בְּעוּן קָמֵי מַה טַעַם.<br>אָמַר כַּד תְּסָאבוּן אֲנָא אֲמַר לְכוֹן. מַה הֲוָה מֵימַר<br>לְכוֹן כְּמַה דְאָמַר מֵאֵילֵיהֶן קִבְּלוּ עֲלֵיהֶן אֶת<br>הַמַּעְשְׂרוֹת. שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר בָּא בְּעֵי נִיחָא לְטָהֳרוֹת לֹא<br>אָמַר לוֹן מִפְּנֵי גֶדֶר טָהֳרוֹת. לְמַעְשְׂרוֹת לֹא אָמַר<br>לוֹן מִפְּנֵי גֶדֶר מַעְשְׂרוֹת. לְקֳדָשִׁים לֹא אָמַר לוֹן<br>וְאִילּוּ אָמַר לוֹן מַה הֲוָה מֵימַר לוֹן. גַּבֵּי מַעְשְׂרוֹת<br>כְּמָאן דְּאָמַר מֵאֵילֵיהֶן קִבְּלוּ עֲלֵיהֶן אֶת הַמַּעְשְׂרוֹת.<br>

Paragraph 4

Reading of Rome ms. and R. Simson. Venice: עולי עולה.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Venice: אנא.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Venice: ואיתקרין; see ספר ניר p. 32a, כפשוטה תוספתא p0. 246.<br>
Reading of all manuscripts, Mishnah and Yerushalmi. In the Venice print by mistake: Eleazar.<br>
This word only appears in the Leyden ms and universally is declared a scribal error. However, the argument given at the end of the first paragraph of the Halakhah shows that it is genuinely part of the Yerushalmi Mishnah.<br>
Reading of Midrash <i>Threni Rabbati</i> on <i>Thr.</i> 1:3, R. Simson of Sens and, it seems, that of Maimonides in <i>Maäkhalot Asurot</i> 10:20. The manuscripts and the Venice prints have מעשר שני, and this must have been Maimonides’s reading in his youth when he wrote his Commentary to the Mishnah, since there he gives a totally different explanation for the Mishnah than that given by the Halakhah.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., missing in the Venice print, but clearly implied by the next sentence.<br>

Paragraph 5

Text of the first hand in the Leyden ms. The Munich ms. of the Babli has מהחולין. The prints have מאה חולין which makes no sense.<br>
In the best manuscripts of the Mishnah, and the Munich ms. of the Babli, this is missing. It came into the Mishnah from the Tosephta quoted at the start of the Halakhah. The only ms. of the Yerushalmi which does not have this addition is that of R. S. Cirillo; there the omission is probably the author’s and not from a ms. before him.<br>
Reading of R. Simson of Sens. Manuscripts and Venice print: שלישי. The question is how much difference can there be between two batches of bread so that they may be tithed together according to the anonymous Tanna. Probably one speaks here about flatbread with a long shelf life.<br>
Text of Rome ms. and R. Simson. Venice text: רִבִּי יוֹסֵי בְשֵׁם רִבִּי יוֹנָה בְשֵׁם חִזְקִיָּה which clearly is missing a name since Rebbis Yose and Jonah were colleagues.<br>

Paragraph 6

Reading of the text in <i>Terumot </i>1:1, fol. 40c. The reading here is אותן “they”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Text of Venice print: קבל ממנו שדה לקצור בשחרי.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. In <i>Baba Meẓia‘</i> 9:8, R. La’s readings is: אין.<br>
Reading of R. Simson: שהמעשרות שלהן.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Venice: מתעשר.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. The word is missing in the Venice print but is required by the context.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and all Mishnah manuscripts. The Leyden ms. and Venice print have למעשרות; almost certainly a scribal error.<br>

Paragraph 7

Reading of the Rome ms.; Venice and Leyden: להחליט “make it absolute.”<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice: אדהי תנא that may be read as one word “because he made a proviso.”<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Šabbat</i> 18:1, missing in the texts here.<br>
Reading of the Parallel in <i>Šabbat</i> 18:1. The reading here is garbled:לגין שהוא טבול יום ומילאהו מן החבית מעשׂר טבל. אם אמר הרי זה תרומת מעשׂר מחלל. אמר הרי זו תרומה מחלל. אם אמר הרי זה עירוב לא אמר כלום.<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Šabbat</i> 18:1, all but the first two words of the sentence are missing here.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. The name is missing in the Venice print; it was correctly supplied from the Babli by R. S. Cirillo and R. E. Fulda.<br>
Here starts Halakhah 7 in the Venice print.<br>
This is the reading of the Yerushalmi and Tosephta manuscripts (<i>Demay</i> 8:16), but it obviously should read שְׁלֹשִׁים.<br>
Halakhah 9 in the Venice print.<br>
In the Venice print, Halakhah 10.<br>

Kilayim



Paragraph 1

The Rome ms. has בכל מקום שני מינין for a full parallel with the previous sentence. This probably is the better text.<br>
Vocalization by מלאכת שלמה from ms. In one manuscript of the text, and in the ms. of a Gaonic commentary, גנים.<br>
Reading of R. Simson. In the Rome ms. conflated חסדיגרון, in the Leyden ms. הסדיגרון.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden: יסיח לי, but in <i>Pesaḥim</i> 2:5, fol. 29c, the reading is also יסי חלי as explanation of חרחבינה, one of the bitter herbs used for the Passover <i>seder</i>.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Leyden: אלא.<br>
Reading of R. Simson: תני תנא רבי נחמיה.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. and <i>Arukh</i>. A diminutive of Aramaic פּוּגְלָא, “radish,” applied to some kind of small radish.<br>
In Mishnah manuscrips also עזרד, עוזרד, חזרד.<br>
Reading of R. Simson. Yerushalmi mss: דרכון, <i>Arukh</i> דרקון (“dragon”!).<br>
Reading of Rome ms. <i>Kaphtor waperaḥ </i>reads כורסילבנון. Leyden has כירבי לבנון “Lebanese cabbage,” which is impossible; R. Simson reads קירבו לבנין “white innards.”<br>
Reading of Rome ms. and R. Simson. Leyden: ר׳ יוחנן. The latter reading is impossible since in talmudic theory an author cannot himself declare that his statement is necessary.<br>

Paragraph 2

In Halakhah 2, כְּגוֹן.<br>
The Rome ms. here has quite a different reading, … כן אנא יהיב קל that seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the text.<br>
Missing in the Venice print, but appearing in the quote a few lines later and in mss.<br>

Paragraph 3

Reading of the parallel in <i>Šabbat</i> 9:2, which has better readings. The word is missing in the Leyden/Venice texts here.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Šabbat. </i>Here ויאנא.<br>
The usual technical term is לא צורכא דלא.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice has מתליא by a change of liquids <i>l - n.</i> Everywhere else the authority quoted is the father of Rebbi Mattaniah.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., parallel to the Mishnah. Venice: ששה.<br>
Rome ms.: שֶׁלֹּא יְהוּ.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Venice and Leyden: גין “protection”. In the next paragraph, all sources read בין.<br>

Paragraph 4

The space needed to tend a vineyard is a path 4 cubits wide so that the ox-drawn cart of the vintner may move there. Even though the House of Hillel forbid sowing if the minimal width is less than eight cubits, if somebody sowed illegally on a smaller patch neither the seeds nor the vines become “sanctified” as long as a minimal distance of 4 cubits is observed everywhere (Mishnah 7:3).<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Most older commentators emend the text to this reading since two parallel rows generate only one space between them. Venice and Leyden: תרין.<br>
In the Venice print: ר׳ יונה, but in the two parallels in <i>Eruvin</i> and <i>Sukkah </i>ר׳ יוחנן. Since the statement is bracketed by statements of R. Simeon ben Laqish and R. Joḥanan, the reading ר׳ יונה would be an anachronism. The Babli in <i>Eruvin</i> 11a reports the statement in the name of R. Simeon ben Laqish. It cannot belong to an Amora two generations younger.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and the Venice parallels in <i>Eruvin</i> and <i>Sukkah</i>. Venice print here: שהפיאה.<br>
In both parallels: רבי הושיא.<br>
This is the text of the Rome ms. and of the Venice parallels in <i>Eruvin </i>and <i>Sukkah</i>. The Venice text here is defective: אין תימר מלמעלן לא אמר ר׳ חגי כלום.<br>
The extent of what becomes forbidden to use is detailed in the Halakhah.<br>
Reading of the Rome and the Mishnah mss. Leyden:עשרה .<br>

Paragraph 5

Reading of Rome ms. and R. Simson. The reading of the Leyden ms. and Venice print, עשׂרים, is impossible since 20–10 = 10.<br>
The last three words are the reading of the Rome ms. Venice: כמו.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden:על גבי גפנים .<br>
It is clear from the context that one must read אַרְבָּעָה. This is the reading of Maimonides (<i>Kilaim</i> 7:22) but not that of the two manuscripts.<br>
Reading of the Venice print and the Leyden ms. Rome ms:בלקט .<br>
Reading of R. David ben Zimra, R. Simson, and R. Isaac ben Malchiṣedeq Simponti. As B. Ratner has pointed out, it seems that the entire sentence was missing in the ms. before R. Joseph Karo (כסף משנה on Maimonides, <i>Kilaim</i> 5:9).<br>
Reading of all sources, including the Rome ms., except the Leyden ms. and the Venice print.<br>
Reading of R. Isaac Simponti. In the Leyden and Rome mss., קרינטון, possibly Greek κήρινθος “bee-bread”. As noted by the gloss in the Krotoszyn edition, κρίνον, τό, “white lily, <i>Lilium candidum</i>” is used in Sirach (39:14) for Hebrew שושנה, in the Syriac translation שושנת מלכא. In Herodotus, κρίνον means “Egyptian bean” (<i>Nelubium speciosum</i>), cf. Chapter 1, Note 45. Maimonides translates שושנת המלך by Arabic שקאק אלנעמאן “anemone”.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Venice: החיטין.<br>

Paragraph 6

Reading of both mss. and the Venice print. This reading is impossible since “R. Ḥanina” here is R. Ḥanania, the fifth generation Amora and colleague of R. Mana, R. Jonah’s son. R. Ḥanina cannot possibly be the first generation Amora, a generation before Rebbis Joḥanan and Simeon ben Laqish. Therefore, one has to read ר יוֹסֵה.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. here and all sources in the parallel <i>Ševi‘it</i> 1:9, fol. 33c.<br>

Paragraph 7

Reading of the Genizah fragment and R. Eliahu Fulda. The other texts have צמד גפן, the Babylonian term for cotton. Since the plant is called “vine” it must be a potentially perennial plant from the family of Malvaceas, cotton, a linden-tree grown for its bast, or jute from a kind of <i>Corchorus</i>.<br>
This word is missing in the Rome ms.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and one ms. quoted by R. Solomon Adani in his Mishnah commentary. Venice: כרם ולא כלאים.<br>
Text of the Mishnah. In the Yerushalmi mss.: לבעלין.<br>
In Babli <i>Baba Qama</i> 9a, Rav Huna prescribes that for meritorious deeds one never should pay more than one third over the going rate. (Maimonides follows the opinion of Rav Huna who has precedence over Rav Sheshet in matters of ritual).<br>

Paragraph 8

Reading of the mss. Venice print: שמו.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. The word is missing in the Leyden ms. and Venice print.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice: ולא כן נן.<br>

Reading of the Rome and all <i>Sifry</i> mss. Venice: לך.<br>
Missing in the Rome ms.<br>
In the parallel in <i>Ketubot</i> 12:3 (fol. 35a), ר׳ דוסא. In the parallel <i>Gen</i>.<i> rabba</i> 100(3), ר׳ דוסתאי, Dositheos. The text in <i>Gen</i>.<i> rabba</i> seems to be the original text from which the one here is an abbreviation.<br>
In the parallel <i>Ketubot</i> 12:3 (fol. 35a) גּוֹבֵיהֶן. This word has been translated. The word used here (“their hills”) is probably a misspelling explained as writing from the spoken word.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice: ייעול.<br>
Reading of the Leyden ms. סכותא is Onqelos’s translation of Hebrew צופים (<i>Num</i>. 23:14). The printed editions have here and in <i>Ketubot</i> סכנתא “danger”. In the parallel [<i>Gen</i>. <i>rabba</i> 33(3)], the students are appointed to go with him to the אשונא so he should not stay too long and endanger himself. אשונא is shown by L. Ginzburg (Notes to Kohut’s <i>Arukh</i>, p. 436) to be Syriac אשחונא̇ “<i>calidarium</i>, sauna”; Lieberman (הירושלמי כפשוטו ע׳ יא) translates סכותא by <i>unctuarium</i>.<br>
Reading in <i>Ketubot</i>. The reading here is איסקבטיריי.<br>
Reading in <i>Ketubot</i> and Rome ms. The two words are missing in the Venice text.<br>
Reading in <i>Ketubot</i>. The reading here is מיתבינין.<br>
Reading in <i>Ketubot</i> and Rome ms. Venice: זמן תמן.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., supported by the other occurrences of the word. Leyden and Venice: קובלין. Cf. Greek κολόβιον “short sleeved tunic”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms: גב. This is a Babylonism.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice: זבינא “the seller”, otherwise unknown.<br>

Sheviit



Paragraph 1

Reading of a Genizah fragment. In the other mss: ארבעים.<br>
Reading of the parallel, <i>Orlah</i> 1:3 (fol. 61a), here: ואתיא כרבי יהושע כדתני רבי יושע אומר.<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Orlah</i>, instead of בפורי here.<br>

Paragraph 2

Reading of most Mishnah mss., the Yerushalmi from the Genizah and the Rome ms.; Leyden ms. and Munich ms. of the Babli: מזבלים. However, in the Halakhah the Leyden ms. also has מיבלים (as a correction.)<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden: חמא. No Rav or Rebbi Ḥuna bar Ḥama is known from the Talmudim.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Nedarim </i>7:1 (fol. 40b) and of a Genizah fragment here. Venice: מאן הורו כן.<br>

Paragraph 3

Reading of the Rome ms. Venice: .בר<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i> 1:4. Here: שאינה.<br>

Paragraph 4

Reading of the parallel in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:6, fol. 21b, where this and the following paragraphs are found. Venice: אני עבר<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Sanhedrin</i>; Venice דמיין.<br>
The word is missing in the Venice print.<br>
The last word is only in the parallel in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> fol. 44b. The sentence has no place here but refers to Mishnah <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:10: “One does not make dough or form breads with a baker who works in impurity but one may bring bread with him to the retail store.” On this, R. Ammi notes that a Jew following the rules of purity may not take pitta breads out of the oven together with someone who does not follow these rules.<br>
Word missing in Venice print.<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 5:1; the text here reads יתן.<br>
Reading of a Genizah fragment. Leyden ms. and Venice print:משיזהלו , a <i>hapax</i> of undetermined meaning.<br>
The last five words are only in the Leyden ms.<br>

Paragraph 5

The last word is only in the Rome ms.<br>

Paragraph 6

Reading of the Rome ms., word missing in Leyden ms. and Venice print but certainly original. The text in the Yerushalmi is largely unexplainable. The <i>baraita</i> exists in three more versions: The mosaic of the Synagogue of Reḥov [published by J. Sussman, <i>Tarbiz</i> 43(1974) 88–158, 45(1976) 213–257], <i>Sifry Deut</i>. #52, and Tosephta <i>Ševiït</i> 4:11. The last two sources have many incompatible variant readings, cf. the editions of Finkelstein and Lieberman.<br>S. Klein points out that Caesarea Maritima is mentioned under its preHerodian name of Straton’s Tower, which shows the old roots of the <i>baraita</i>. But the differences between the sources may derive not only from scribal errors but, in particular in the detailed description of the border between Acco and Caesarea Philippi, from changes in the actual border of Jewish settlement from Mishnaic to Byzantine times.<br>Text from Reḥov.<br>
Reading of Rome ms. Venice text: א״ל (i. e., אמד ליה).<br>

Reading of Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: אעלליה לי, to be read as אעל ליה לי.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. The word is missing in the Leyden ms. and Venice print.<br>

Reading of the Leyden ms. and Venice print only, by dittography.<br>
Word missing in the Venice print.<br>
Reading of Rome ms., as conjectured by all commentators. Venice and Leyden: R. Jonah.<br>
The parallels are in Midrash <i>Gen</i>.<i> rabba</i> 79(6), <i>Eccl</i>.<i> rabbati</i> 10(11), Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 33b–34a. The text here is deficient in several places; the text of the Babli is clearly derivative. The best text is that of <i>Gen</i>.<i> rabba</i> on the verse (<i>Gen</i>. 33:18): “He graced the entrance to the city,” which is explained as “they were putting up duty free shops and selling at wholesale prices.” Since the verse is given here also as a reason (in a shortened and rather incomprehensible connection), it is best to give the entire text from <i>Gen</i>.<i> rabba</i>, which is explicit where the text here is cryptic:<br>“R. Simeon ben Ioḥai <i>and his son R</i>.<i> Eleazar</i> were hidden in a cave for thirteen years during the time of persecution [after the war of Bar Kokhba]. They ate dry carobs until their bodies were covered with rust. At the end of thirteen years he went and sat at the entrance to the cave. He saw a catcher out to catch birds. When he heard a heavenly voice saying <i>dimissus </i>[acquitted], it escaped, <i>when he heard </i>spicula <i>[arrows]</i>,<i> it was caught</i>. He said, no bird will be caught without Heaven, much less a human. He went out and saw that words of intercession were given <i>and the decree had been rescinded</i>. They came and bathed in the hot waters of Tiberias. His son said to him, all this benefit we had from Tiberias and we do not cleanse it from the slain? He said, we need to do something good as our forefathers did when they were putting up duty free shops [ἀτελής] and selling at wholesale prices. What did he do? He took lupines, cut them up and threw <i>the pieces</i> down in irregular fashion. Everywhere there was a slain body, it was floating <i>and they removed it</i>.<i> Everywhere there was no impurity</i>,<i> the lupines remained unmoved</i>.<i> He put up signs indicating which places were pure and which impure until he had cleansed it completely</i>. A <i>vulgar</i> Samaritan saw him and said, should I not make a fool of this old Jew? He took a corpse (<i>some people say from the cooper’s market</i>,<i> some say from the sackmaker’s</i>), went, and buried it where the ground was purified. The next morning, he came to them and said, did you say that bar Yoḥai purified Tiberias? Come and see this corpse! R. Simeon bar Ioḥai saw by the Holy Spirit that he had put it there. He said, I decree that the upper one shall go down [die] and the lower one come up [live]. So it happenend to him. He [R. Simeon bar Ioḥai] went up to spend the Sabbath in his house. When he passed by Magdala <i>of the dyers</i>, he heard the voice of <i>Nikai</i> the scribe who said, <i>did you not say</i> bar Ioḥai purified Tiberias? <i>They found a corpse</i>! He said, It should come upon me if I <i>did not have traditions in the number of the hairs on my head</i> that Tiberias is pure, <i>except places X and Y</i>.<i> Were you not in the meeting when we declared it pure</i>?<i> You broke down the fence of the Sages; about you it was said </i>(<i>Eccl</i>. 10:8): ‘<i>He who tears down a fence will be bitten by a snake</i>’! Immediately he turned into a bone heap.”<br>When Herod Antipas built Tiberias on the site of the Biblical Raqqat, he destroyed a cemetery (Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i>, XVIII. 2. 3) so that no priest or anybody keeping the laws of purity could visit there. Therefore, up to the time of R. Simeon ben Ioḥai Tiberias was only a place of the vulgar.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and R. Eliahu Fulda. Leyden and Venice: שדייו “he threw it”.<br>

Paragraph 10

Reading of the Rome ms., missing in the Leyden ms. The word makes the text much clearer but it might be an intrusion of Babylonian style.<br>
From the parallel in <i>Makkot</i> 1:5 (fol. 31a); title missing here. Rav Amram was a Babylonian Amora, probably a student of Rav Sheshet and Rav Ḥisda.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: <b>אם</b>.<br>
The last three words are only here, not in the parallel <i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:1 (fol. 46c).<br>

Reading of the Rome ms., missing in Leyden and Venice texts; cf. <i>Sefer Nir ad loc</i>.<br>
The Leyden and Venice texts add here והשוטה “and the insane”, an intrusion from Mishnah 1 absent in the Rome ms.<br>

Reading of the Rome ms. Venice and Leyden: במי עקרו.<br>

Reading of the Rome ms. and the text in <i>Ketubot</i>. Leyden and Venice: ר׳ נתן, an impossible text for chronological reasons.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Ketubot</i>. In <i>Terumot</i>, the words קטנה and בוגרת are switched in the print and Leyden ms. Rome: הַבָּא עַל אֲחוֹתוֹ בוֹגֶרֶת יִלְקֶה וִישַׁלֵּם. שֶׁכֵּן הַבָּא עַל אֲחוֹתוֹ דְּאֵינוֹ לוֹקֶה.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Ketubot</i>. In <i>Terumot</i> .מַכּוֹת וְהַתְרָייַת תַּשְׁלוּמִין<br>
The words in parentheses are not in <i>Ketubot</i> and are not relevant since monetary claims do not need cautioning.<br>
Text from <i>Ketubot</i> and a parallel <i>Pesaḥim</i> 2:3 (fol. 29a/b). Text of <i>Terumot</i>: בְּמֵזִיד בִּתְרוּמָה בְּשׁוֹגֵג בְּחוֹמֶשׁ מֵזִיד בִּתְרוּמָה וְשׁוֹגֵג בְּנָזִיר מֵזִיד בִּתְרוּמָה וְשׁוֹגֵג ‏בְּיוֹם הַכִּיפּוּרִים.<br>

Paragraph 8

Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden: הבזבוזין “the spendthrifts”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: באתריה “At the place”. That reading makes no sense. The reading of the Rome ms. is difficult since (a) R. Ḥiyya had twin daughters, Pazy and Martha, and (b) it should say “her father”, not “his father.” However, the Yerushalmi cannot be judged by standards of style.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. פסתיטון, of the parallel in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (and <i>Tanḥuma Wayešev</i>) פסינתטון. In the parallel in the Babli, <i>Avodah Zarah </i>30a, אפסינתין is explained by the Gaonim and R. Ḥananel as name of the plant ἀψίνθιον, τό “wormwood, <i>Artemisia Absinthium</i>”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: א״ר (אמר רבי) “Rabbi … said”.<br>

Reading of the parallel in <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan</i>. Text here: כרית.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Pesaḥim</i>. Text here: ירמיה ר׳ בשם חזקיה “Ḥizqiah in the name of R. Jeremiah.” If “Ḥizqiah” is correct, then “R. Jeremiah” must refer to the Babylonian Rav Jeremiah, cf. <i>Berakhot</i> 1, Note 13; neither of whom is connected with Caesarea. One cannot read “R. Ḥizqiah” since R. Mana II was his student, not in Caesarea.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Pesaḥim</i>. Text here: לוֹ “him”.<br>

The details of the spelling of <i>Or Zarua‘</i> are Babylonian, not to be taken as testimony of Yerushalmi spelling. The omission in the Leyden ms. is by oversight from ר׳ חנינה to ר׳ חנינה.<br>
In <i>Or Zarua‘</i>:אבא . This reading has been translated.<br>

Paragraph 11

In <i>Avodah Zarah</i>: אומן. That word has been translated.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., R. Simson, and R. S. Adani. Venice and Leyden: אם.<br>
Since the remainder is coarse flour, it is food for somebody else and may not be thrown away.<br>
Reading of the Leyden ms. The Venice print has an unintelligible כמי נוי. The Rome ms: כמינויין “the holy corresponds to its count;” since consecrated food of the Temple can become impure in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th degrees, it is implied that for them afterwine is forbidden to the fourth degree. This reading was already conjectured by R. Moses Margalit; it was accepted by R. S. Lieberman. Since this reading parallels the interpretation of the Babli, it has to be rejected.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: הרוסן “the bride”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden: נחלק “split, distributed”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden: והדליק “if he lit”; this language is proper for the quote of the same <i>baraita</i> below.<br>

This is not mentioned in the Babli or in Maimonides’s Code. The inedible parts of a sacrifice, totally stripped of their meat, are profane after the meal.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice:על .<br>
Superfluous word, missing in Rome ms.<br>
In Rome ms: לסגניס. Zuckermann, <i>Talmudische Münzen und Gewichte,</i> Breslau 1862, explains as <i>*dusignum,</i> supposed to mean “doubly coined, overstruck”, accepted by Levy, Krauss, and Sperber. However, H. L. Fleischer already has pointed out that no composites of <i>duo</i> with the singular are known. While the exact nature of these coins is unknown, from the text it is reasonable to derive the word from δυσγνωσία, ἡ, “difficulty of knowing”, δύσγνωστος, ον (adj.) “hard to recognize” (E. G.).<br>
Reading of Rome ms. שמחללן; an intrusion from the next sentence.<br>
Rome ms.:שכן . This reading is assumed in the next sentence.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: אחר מקום “after place”.<br>
The Rome ms. has here and in the third sentence: R. Jonah. However, R. Yose mentioned here is not the late Amora but the teacher from the intermediary generation between Tannaïm and Amoraïm who appears in the Babli as Rav Assi, older than R. Yose ben Ḥanina. The reading of the Rome ms. has to be rejected.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: בי פירא “ditch house”.<br>

Paragraph 2

Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: Joḥanan.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: בר ייכל.<br>
In the Leyden ms., the first hand has ברביעית מעות, the corrector writes ברביעית כסף. The Venice print has simply ברביעית. The Rome ms. has ורביעית מעות “and a quarter (denar) in coin.” This might be the best reading in the Mishnah.<br>

Paragraph 3

In the Rome ms. עבדין “one does”, as in the text in <i>Ševi‘it</i>.<br>
Words missing in the Rome ms. Since the commentators all feel obliged to emend the words to something else, they are not translated.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. מפרן, generally considered a corruption. The Leyden text, Babylonian מפקרן “declared it abandoned”, is an obvious scribal error.<br>
The word is missing in the Rome ms.; in the Leyden ms. it is added by a second hand. Most probably it should be disregarded; as it was by R. S. Cirillo.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: אם רוב “if most of”. It is unlikely that less than a <i>quartarius</i> have legal consequences.<br>

Paragraph 4

Word missing in the Rome ms. The end of the paragraph shows that “Abba” here is a title, not a name.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: בתרין אלפין וחמשין ריבוא “with 2000 and 500’000.”<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden: תשעה “nine”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and the Venice print. The Leyden text is: פּוֹדִין מַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁינִי כִּשְׁעַת הַזּוֹל וְלֹא כִּשְׁעַת הַיּוֹקֶר כְּמוֹת שֶׁהַשׁוּלְחָנִי לוֹקֵחַ לא כְּמוֹת שֶׁהוּא מוֹכֵר. <br>
Missing in Rome ms., probably correctly.<br>
Missing in the Rome ms. and the parallels in <i>Eruvin</i> 7, fol. 24c, <i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:9, fol. 47b.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., confirmed by the Leyden ms. in the quote of this statement in the next paragraph. Leyden and Venice here: אבא.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms.; required by the following. Leyden and Venice: ר̇ יודה.<br>
In the parallel source דוקייא δοκία “beams” (δοκίον, τὸ, “plank”).<br>

Paragraph 5

Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: מקבל “receives”.<br>
Reading of the parallels. Here בד׳ “son of Rebbi”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and the parallels. Leyden and Veniceחנניה .<br>
Here the quote עצם is missing; added in translation from the parallels.<br>
Reading of the parallels. Text here: קמצון “stingy”, but in the ms. the reading ן is in doubt.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: וצבעייא.<br>
In the Rome ms: בהיידא איסרטא “on which road”.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and the text in <i>Peah</i>. Leyden and Venice: ר׳ יוּדה.<br>

Challah



Paragraph 1

Reading of the parallel in <i>Pesaḥim</i>. Here: ר׳ אחווה ור׳ זעירא.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., sentence missing in Leyden ms. and Venice print.<br>
Reading of the parallel text in <i>Roš Haššanah</i> 1:4 (fol. 57b). Text here: בר אבוי “son of his father”. The paragraph might have been inserted here to indicate that the “16<sup>th</sup> of Nisan” to be counted in the diaspora is the 17<sup>th</sup>.<br>
From the text in <i>Ma‘serot</i> and a Genizah fragment; not in the Leyden ms. and the Venice print.<br>

Paragraph 2

Reading of the Rome ms. and the text in <i>Berakhot</i>. Venice text: יעקב.<br>
Missing in the Rome ms., resulting in a smoother text.<br>

Paragraph 3

Reading of a Genizah fragment. The two mss. read התם, a Babylonism.<br>
Reading of the Genizah fragment. In both mss., ר׳ חייה בשם is missing but is required by the next sentence. Similarly, only the Geniza ms. reads יסא in the next sentence but even it reads יוסי in the last. But even there, one must read יסא for יוסי the last two times. R. Zeïra must have been very old when he was walking supported by his student’s student R. Yose while he himself was mainly a student of R. Assi’s contemporary R. Ḥiyya bar Abba.<br>
Reading of the Genizah fragment. Mss.: עליה.<br>
Reading of the Genizah fragment. Mss.: וכי.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden, Venice, and the Genizah fragment take this word together with the first of the next paragraph and read קדשתנו.<br>
Word missing in Rome ms. but necessary for the text.<br>
Reading of the Geniza fragment. Mss.: משום.<br>
The Geniza fragment here has an additional שהוא טיבולא which seems to be a duplication.<br>

Paragraph 4

Reading of a Genizah text. Leyden and Venice: חייבין.<br>
Reading of the Mishnah <i>Ṭevul Yom</i> 2:5 and a Genizah text here. Reading of the Leyden ms. and Venice print: שקדס, of the Rome ms. שקדש, showing that the misreading ד-ר, ס-ם was already in the common source of the two mss.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and the parallels in Babli <i>Bekhorot</i> 55a, Tosephta <i>Bekhorot</i> 7:3. Leyden and Venice: בנותני, an unidentified place. Kefar Othnai was near the location of ancient Megiddo.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., confirming the conjecture of most commentators. Leyden and Venice: ר׳ יודה.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: הדמים “the money”. The latter reading cannot be correct since redemption of special dedications would have to refer to movables which in the next paragraph are declared to be for any Cohen.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: הפסח, a text correct by biblical but not rabbinical usage.<br>

Orlah



Paragraph 1

Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice: ילמד. The Leyden text implies that one discusses the position of R. Yose the Tanna, “R. Yose might understand the text …” But the parallel with R. Jonah shows that <i>R.</i> <i>Yose</i> here is the late Amora, colleague of R. Jonah, and both discuss the position of R. Yose the Tanna in the Mishnah. This not only shows that the Rome version is correct but it strongly supports the position of Maimonides (in his Code, <i>Ma‘aser Šeni</i> 10:3, and the third version of his Commentary) that R. Yose in the Mishnah explains the rule and is not a lone dissenter.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden (corrected) זמודה, Leyden uncorrected and Venice ומודה “and agrees”.<br>
The text given here is that of the Rome ms. The text of the first hand of the Leyden ms. is almost identical: אָמַר רִבִּי יוֹנָה עִיקַּר עָרְלָה צְרִיכָה לֵיהּ וְאֵין עִיקַּר עָרְלָה פָּחוֹת מִשָּׁלֹשׁ שָּׁנִים. אָמַר רִבִּי יוֹסֵי עִיקַּר רְבָעִי צְרִיכָה לֵיהּ כָּל־שֶׁאֵין לוֹ שָׁנִים אֵין לוֹ עָרְלָה אֵין לוֹ רְבָעִי; the text of the first corrector isאָמַר רִבִּי יוֹנָה עִיקַּר עָרְלָה צְרִיכָה לֵיהּ וְאֵין עִיקַּר עָרְלָה פָּחוֹת שָּׁנִים. אָמַר רִבִּי יוֹסֵי עִיקַּר רְבָעִי צְרִיכָה לֵיהּ כָּל־שֶׁאֵין לוֹ עָרְלָה אֵין לוֹ רְבָעִי. It seems clear that the corrector could not understand the text because of the missing שלש in the last sentence; his correction can be disregarded.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., word missing in the Leyden ms.<br>
From the parallel in Nazir (Note 137); the text here reads רבי יוסי.<br>
From the parallel in Nazir (Note 137); the text here reads רבי פדיה. It seems that Bar Pedaiah shared his uncle Bar Qappara’s open disdain of the patriarchate which caused him never to be ordained. In the Babli (<i>Ḥulin</i> 98a), the statement is by R. Joshua ben Levi in the name of Bar Qappara. The opinion of R. Assi is not mentioned there.<br>
From the parallel in Nazir, missing in the Rome ms.<br>
<i>Sifra Qedošim Parašah</i> 3(2).<br>
From the parallel in Nazir and the Rome ms.<br>
In the Rome ms., ממאה, from the missed previous sentence. This makes it likely that the missing sentence (Note 144) was in the common <i>Vorlage</i> of both mss.<br>
Dittography; the text in parentheses is not in the Rome ms.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leyden and Venice have unintelligible שסיפקו.<br>
Here, a phrase is missing which appears in <i>Terumot</i> 5:9: אַף טוֹחֵן הוּא בַּתְּחִילָּה וּמַתִּיר. מַתְנִיתָא דְּרִבִּי יוֹסֵי דְּרִבִּי יוֹסֵי אָמַר.<br>
Text in <i>Ševi‘it</i> and Rome ms., missing in Leyden ms. and Venice print.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and the parallel in <i>Avodah Zarah</i>. Leyden and Venice: מתניתא.<br>
In the Leyden ms. פורח “it flies”; already corrected in the Venice print.<br>

Paragraph 2

This sentence is not in the Rome ms.<br>
Reading of the first hand of the Leyden ms., crossed out by the corrector, probably in error.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms.; Leyden and Venice: לוליבא. Elsewhere he is called בן לוליאני (cf. the Italian form <i>Lugliani</i>). A fifth generation Galilean Amora, student of R. Samuel. Therefore, “Samuel” mentioned here is not the first generation Babylonian Samuel but the fourth generation Galilean R. Samuel bar Abba.<br>
In the verse: אחת.<br>

Paragraph 3

Reading of the text in <i>Pesaḥim. </i>The reading here, “R. Joḥanan”, is a scribal error.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Pesaḥim. </i>The reading here, ולא יאכל עליו חמץ, is not a biblical verse.<br>
Reading of the original scribe of the Leyden ms.; Greek κερκίς, -ίδος. Reading of the corrector and the prints: כרכר.<br>
Reading of the first hand of the ms. here and in <i>Ketubot</i>. Corrector (only here) and print: הודו.<br>

Paragraph 16



Paragraph 17

The word in parentheses was first written by the scribe, with the word in brackets on top of it. This seems to be a correction by the scribe himself; the word in parentheses should be deleted.<br>

Paragraph 9

This word should be deleted since there is no verse containing this expression. The argument is that while one would expect the accents to be טָמֵ֣א לָנֶ֡פֶשׁ “impure by a corpse,” the first word carries <i>legarmeh,</i> a dividing accent, טָמֵ֣א ׀ לָנֶ֡פֶשׁ, correctly translated “impure, [e. g.,] by a corpse.” Babli 93a, <i>Sifry Num.</i> 69.<br>

The scribe (text in parentheses) and the corrector [text in brackets] intend to write the same. The scribe’s spelling is phonetic; under the influence of Greek ב only had the v-sound given by double <i>wav. </i>Intended is the the biblical root בדה “to be lying.”<br>

Yevamot



Paragraph 1

The argument of all commentators is accepted that this word is a slip of the pen and should be disregarded.<br>
The main place of this Halakhah is Halakhah 13:1.<br>
Reading of the parallel in 13:1. Text here: שיתגדל.<br>

Paragraph 2

This text is corrupt. The translation takes the sentence to be a quote from Mishnah <i>Bekhorot</i> 8:1 and reads מִשֶּׁבָּאת.<br>
Reading of ms. A (see the Introduction) confirming a conjecture by R. M. Margalit. In the ms: חלוצתו, as in the next sentence.<br>
Reading of ms. A, missing ms. L and <i>editio princeps</i>, but necessary for the understanding of the text.<br>
Reading of ms. A; in the Leiden ms. as in the Mishnah והוציאוה; since the statement is qualified as a <i>baraita</i>, some deviation from the text of the Mishnah must be expected. This <i>baraita</i> is quoted by Rabba bar Rav Naḥman in Babli 25a and seems to be underlying Tosephta 4:5.<br>
Missing in the parallel in <i>Qiddušin</i>; the context requires that the word be deleted even though ms. A also has it.<br>
Correct reading of ms. A. Ms. L: רב.<br>
Sic!

Paragraph 3

In both mss., the middle of the Mishnah is indicated only by a few words. Ms. L: וכנס היבם מן. Ms. A: יכנוס ח̇ ייב̇ הייבום. The full text, translated in small print, reads: יִכְנוֹס אֶת אִשְׁתּוֹ. מֵתָה הַיְּבָמָה יִכְנוֹס.<br>
Missing in the L text here, taken from the parallel in Halakhah 4:10. Most of the text is in ms. A.<br>
Reading of ms. A. In ms. L: ר׳ יודה, unknown as Amora.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: כשיהא.<br>
Missing in ms. A; devoid of sense in the context.<br>
Reading of ms. A and the first hand of ms. L. Miscorrected text in L: הוי.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: מה.<br>
Reading of ms. A; ms L: הא.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms L: חליצה אינו קניין.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: אחותו.<br>
The word is missing in the Mishnah and is deleted in ms. L by the corrector; therefore it is missing in the <i>editio princeps</i>. It is found in ms. A. From Halakhah 3:4 it is clear that the word was omitted from the Mishnah by a scribal error (cf. א. שכטר, המשנה בבבלי וּבירושלמי, מוֹסד הרב קוּק, י-ם תשיט) and was wrongly eliminated from the text.<br>
It is clear that one must read פטור instead of קיניין. The next sentence is missing in ms. L; it is clear that the scribe of ms. L already had the error before him since ms. A also reproduces it. The sentence in brackets is only in ms. A, it is missing in ms. L since its scribe left out a sentence from קיניין to קיניין. It is unlikely that the insertion in A is a deliberate correction.<br>
In the ms.: ביר׳, a copyist’s error (not caught by the editors).<br>

Paragraph 4

Scribal error, copying a frequent expression; it is not reasonable to follow the commentators in simply deleting the word. The sentence is a copy of the corresponding one in <i>Sifry Deut</i>. #289: יָצָא זֶה שֶׁכְּבָר שְׁמוֹ מָחוּי. This makes eminent sense and is the basis of the translation.<br>
The question whether an unborn child can inherit and receive gifts is discussed in Babli <i>Baba Batra </i>141b/142a, Yerushalmi <i>Baba Batra</i> 9:1 in a similar way. The opinion of R. Eleazar is attributed to (the slightly older) Rav Huna in the Babli.<br>
Either this word is misspelled (some suggestions are בתינה, בתה), or a word is missing.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L and <i>editio princeps</i>: במשהו “in the least amount”.<br>
Reading of <i>editio princeps</i>. In ms. L: לשמונה.<br>
Reading of ms. A. In ms. L, this sentence is identical with the preceding.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: ממנא.<br>
From ms. A, missing in ms. L; necessary for the context<br>
From ms. A; ms. L: יוסי; since clearly the reference is to R. Yasa (Assi); that reading has to be rejected.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: מאן.<br>
Reading of the parallel to this paragraph in Halakhah <i>Qiddushin</i> 3:14. The reading here, הכא על אחות חלוצתו, is impossible since for everybody except R. Aqiba the sister of the performer of <i>ḥalîṣah</i> is forbidden only rabbinically and her child is acceptable to marry into the priesthood.<br>

Paragraph 5

The text (with minor changes) is from Halakhah 2:1 and explained there, Notes 12–20.<br>
Reading of Rashba. In <i>editio princeps</i>, רבן גמליאל בר׳ שמעון but the edition of the ms. indicates that the letter ב is not a safe reading. The reading of Rashba is required since the full name of Rabban Gamliel would have to be either רבן גמליאל ברבן שמעון or רבן גמליאל בן שמעון following the style of his son רבן שמעון בן גמליאל.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: שמע.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: ,דתניא a lapse into Babylonian spelling.<br>

Paragraph 6

Reading of the Mishnah and ms. A. Ms. L: חלץ.<br>
Reading of ms. A. In ms. L and the <i>editio princeps</i>, the last clause is formulated in the feminine for both parties: אם היתה פיקחת אוכלת. חרשת אינה אוכלת!<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L and <i>editio princeps</i>: אנס “he raped”<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L and <i>editio princeps</i>: חול.<br>
Text from ms. A.<br>Ms. L and <i>editio princeps</i>: מַה טַעֲמָא לֹא אָֽמְרוּ רִבִּי לָֽעְזָר וְרִבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן נִישּׂוּאִין פּוֹסְלִין אוֹתָהּ מִלּוֹכַל בִּתְרוּמָה. מַה עֲבַד לָהּ רִבִּי לָֽעְזָר וְרִבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן. מִשּׁוּם שֶׁהוּא רָאוּי לוֹכַל אוֹ מִשּׁוּם שֶׁאֵינוֹ רָאוּי לוֹכַל. נִשְׁמְעִינָהּ מִן הָדָא אִם לֹא יְדָעָהּ מִשּׁוּם מַה נַעֲשֶׂה פְצוּעַ דַּכָּא וּכְרוּת שָׁפְכָה הֲרֵי יֹאכֵלוּ. אָמַר רִבִּי לָֽעְזָר. דְּרִבִּי לָֽעְזָר וְרִבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן הִיא. אִית לָךְ מֵימַר. הָדָא מִשּׁוּם שֶׁהוּא רָאוּי לֶאֱכוֹל וְהָכָא מִשּׁוּם שֶׁהוּא רָאוּי לְהַאֲכִיל. אָמַר רִבִּי יוֹסֵי בֵּירִבִּי בּוּן. לֹא סוֹף דָּבָר מִן הַנִּישּׂוּאִין. נִבְעֲלוּ בֵּין מִן הָאֵרוּסִין בֵּין מִן הַנִּישּׂוּאִין פְּסוּלוֹת. לֹא נִבְעֲלוּ בֵּין מִן הָאֵרוּסִין בֵּין .מִן הַנִּישּׂוּאִין כְּשֵׁירוֹת.<br>What is the reason that Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Simeon did not say that marriage disables them from eating heave? What do Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Simeon in this case? Because he may eat or because he is not fit to eat? Let us hear from the following: “If he did not know her why his testicles became injured or his penis cut off, these they enable to eat.” Rebbi Eleazar said, this follows Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Simeon. You have to say, here it is because he enables to eat, there because he enables to eat. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, not only from marriage. If they had copulated whether betrothed or married, they are disabled; if they had not copulated whether betrothed or married, they are enabled.<br>The text is seen to be corrupt.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: שאינו.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: על ידי אחר.<br>
Text of the first hand of ms. L and ms. A. The corrector of ms. L inserted נַעֲרָה וְלֹא בוֹגֶרֶת. בְּתוּלָה וְלֹא ,מוּכַּת עֵץ, a dittography which makes no sense here.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L יכניס.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: שאל פיריו מהו ייתב לאמה בגויה.<br>
Reading of ms. A. Ms. L: שֶׁהָיָה יוֹשֵׁב בְּצִילָּהּ שֶׁל בָּנִים. It may be that this “masculine” sentence is the original text.<br>

Paragraph 7

Reading of the Spanish authors, Nachmanides and Rashba (to Babli, 66a). Ms. L: שיהיה, making this and the preceding sentences identical.<br>
Reading of <i>editio princeps.</i> Ms. L: אינן.<br>
A scribal error.<br>
Missing in the text, supplied from the second quote in this paragraph.<br>

Paragraph 8

Reading of the parallels. Text here: בוגרת by dittography from the preceding sentence.<br>

Paragraph 9

This is the text in the ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>. Probably one should read כאן as in the next paragraph.<br>

Paragraph 10

Text from <i>Soṭah</i> 1:2. Reading here: כהן.<br>
Text from <i>Soṭah</i> 1:2. Reading here: יודה.<br>
The text in parentheses is dittography and is missing in <i>Soṭah</i> 1:2.<br>
Text from <i>Soṭah</i> 1:2. The reference is to R. Ḥiyya bar Abba. Reading here: אחייה. Probably the Babylonian name Ḥiyya is a contraction of the Biblical Aḥiyya.<br>
Word missing here, inserted in <i>Soṭah</i> 1:2 by the corrector.<br>
Reading בר instead of בשם רבי, from the text in Halakhah 15:4. The last word תני is read with Halakhah 15:4 אתנו = אַתְּ (הִ)נּוֹ “you are him”.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Qiddushin</i>. Here: מבן.<br>
Missing in <i>Qiddushin</i>, out of place here.<br>
Reading (דּוּ = דְּהוּא) in <i>Qiddushin</i>. Here: די.<br>
Reading in <i>Qiddushin</i>. Here: גיטי.<br>

Inserted from the parallels in the next Halakhah, Halakha 10:7, and the <i>editio princeps.</i><br>
Missing in <i>Ketubot</i>.<br>

Paragraph 14



Paragraph 15

From the parallel text in <i>Ketubot</i> 4:6.<br>
The text in parenthesis is the ms. text here; the text in brackets is R. Abun’s original statement in <i>Giṭṭin</i> 1:1. The <i>Giṭṭin</i> text is the only one which makes sense.<br>
The ms. indicates that the reading is either אתנו or את נו. The second reading is acceptable, לֵית אַתְּ הִנּוֹ “you are not he”. In Chapter 10, the reading is תני<br>
Samuel’s father. The story implies that Abba bar Abba did outlive Rav since “the students of Rav” only appear in cases after Rav’s death.<br>
Reading of the parallels in <i>Nazir</i> 3:7, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5:2. The ms. reading here is בזמנה “in the timing”.<br>
Text from the parallels. Text here: רב אידי “Rav Idi”.<br>
Text from the parallel in <i>Sanhedrin</i> (this sentence missing in <i>Nazir</i>). Text here: המה.<br>
The text in parenthesis is from ms. A only; probably it is copied from above by an unthinking scribe.<br>
From here to almost the end of the Tractate, there is no text from Ms. L available. The text given here is that of the <i>editio princeps.</i> For the rest of this chapter and part of the following, ms. A is available. The remainder of this paragraph is inconsistent there and reads: <br>וְתַנֵּיי דְּבֵית רִבִּי כֵן. תַּנָּא בְשֵׁם רִבִּי נְחֶמְיָה. הוֹלְכִים אַחַר דֵיעוֹת. הֵיךְ עֲבִידָה. שְׁתֵּי נָשִׁים וְאִישׁ עָשׂוּ אוֹתָם כִּשְׁנֵי עֵדִים וְעֵד אֶחָד. הָדָה אָֽמְרָה בְאִשׁ וְאִשָּׁה. אֲבָל אִם הָיוּ מֵאָה נָשִׁים וְעֵד אֶחָד עֵד בְּעֵד אִינּוּן.<br>“In the House of Rebbi they stated it this way. It was stated in the name of Rebbi Neḥemiah: One follows the opinions. How is that? Two women against one man they considered as if there were two witnesses against one witness. What you say refers to a man and a woman. But if there were a hundred women against one [male] witness, they are like one witness against one witness.”<br>
From ms. A, word missing in <i>editio princeps.</i><br>
In ms. A: אוֹמֵר לוֹ צֵא. לָצֵאת יְדֵי שָּׁמַים. “One says to him go, to be clean before Heaven.” The addition of לצאת may be a gloss.<br>
In ms. A: בשיש, בשאין.<br>
In ms. A: אילא.<br>
Ms. A adds: תַמָּן אָֽמְרִין בְשֵׁם רַב. כָּאן בְְּשְׁנִּשְׁבַּע. כָּאן בְּשֶׁלֹּא נִשְׁבַּע. “There (in Babylonia) they say in the name of Rav …” which must mean that this is the received explanation in Babylonia to the exclusion of any other since <i>Rav</i> Jeremiah was a Babylonian. The same language is in the parallel <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 3:3 (fol. 8d), a text from the hand of a different editor.<br>
Here, ms. A and the parallel <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 3:3 have an addition: רִבִּי יִרְמְיָה בָּעֵי. אִם בְּשֶׁנִּשְׁבַּע. הָיָה לוֹ לִשְׁתּוֹק וְלֹא לִישָׁבַע. It would seem that this is an extraneous addition from the redaction of <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i>, since R. Jeremiah is reported below to have another question and his text here is ascribed there to R. Yose.<br>
Added from ms. A and the parallel <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 3:3; missing in <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
From ms. A and the parallel <i>Baba Meṣi‘a</i> 3:3; <i>editio princeps</i> גזול.<br>
The reading of ms. A is intelligible: וְאִם לָאו לֹא הָיָה לוֹ לִשְׁתּוֹק “otherwise, he should not have to be quiet.”<br>
Reading from ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i>: לְהוֹרוֹת “to instruct”.<br>
Both in ms. A and in <i>editio princeps</i> the reading is גילה.<br>
Reading from ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i>: מִסְפָּר “number”.<br>
In ms. A corrected מן הדה “from the following”, the more idiomatic expression.<br>
This sentence is missing in ms. A; the ms. probably is correct since the introduction “she is believed if …” is missing.<br>

Paragraph 16

Text from ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i>: האשה שהלכה, a misquote from the preceding chapter.<br>
Reading of ms. A. In <i>editio princeps</i> a misprint: שני.<br>
Reading of ms. A. <i>Editio princeps:</i> אחר.<br>
Reading of ms. A; missing in <i>editio princeps.</i><br>
Reading of ms. A; missing in <i>editio princeps</i>. The reading of ms. A is required by the next sentence.<br>
Reading of ms. A; missing in <i>editio princeps.</i> The text of the <i>editio princeps</i> also makes sense.<br>
Reading of ms. A; in <i>editio princeps</i>: ר׳ בא בר זימנא. Everywhere else the name is בר זמינא.<br>
In the Babli, the nose and the forehead.<br>
Reading of ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i> has the Babli form Resh Laqish.<br>
From ms. A; missing in <i>editio princeps.</i><br>
Reading of ms. A. Editio princeps: ר׳ בריה ורב פפי.<br>
Reading of ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i>: ואלזא ליה.<br>
Reading of ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i>: צלוב.<br>
Reading of Ms. A. <i>Editio</i> <i>princeps</i>: <i>לציתותי</i>.<br>
Reading of Ms. A. <i>Editio</i> <i>princeps</i>: <i>מוציא</i>.<br>
Reading of ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i>: <i>הספר</i>.<br>
From ms. A.<br>
From ms. A. <i>Editio princpes</i>: שלישי “a third party”. Cf. Note 98.<br>
In the <i>editio princeps</i>, the statements appear twice, first as אָבַד פְּלוֹנִי נֶהֱרַג פְּלוֹנִי and then as given in the text. Ms. A has only the text as given. In the entire paragraph, the spelling follows ms. A.<br>
Reading of ms. A. <i>Editio princeps</i>: בשלישי “in the third.<br>
Here ends ms. A.<br>
Reading of the parallel. Here: R. Aḥa in the name of R. Ḥinena in the name of R. Ḥanina. The doubling of the expression “in the name of” is a sure sign of a corruption.<br>
Reading of the parallel; the word is missing in the text here.<br>
Reading (shortened from ואבד) of the parallel in <i>Giṭṭin</i>. Reading here: ייבד.<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Giṭṭin</i>. Reading here: R. Ze‘ira. That reading is impossible since R. Mana II was a student of R. Ze‘ira and R. Ze‘ira was three generations removed from R. Mana I. But it is documented from other sources that R. Ezra was a student of R. Mana II.<br>

The entire clause is replaced in the Geniza ms. by: הרי זה בור “he is a boor”.<br>

E. Urbach in בעלי התוספות,<sup>5</sup> ירושלים ת̇ש̇מ̇ה̇.<br>
Tosaphot לִכְשֶׁתִּשְׁתֶּה “when she will drink (the paramour will be checked out)”. This reading implies that the water acts on the paramour at a distance. The text before us could be read either as לִכְשֶׁיִּשְׁתֶּה “when he (the paramour) will drink (on the husband’s demand)” or, befitting the context, as לִכְשֶׁיַּשְׁתֶּה “if (the husband) will make (the wife) drink”. As explained in the Introduction to <i>Berakhot</i>, medieval authors are not to be considered as ms. sources, even if the passage is quoted for itself, not in the course of an argument where paraphrases are common. The reading of Tosaphot is not a reason to question the ms. text.<br>
The scribe wrote מבדקונַיה. It seems that the ms. before him had מבדקוניה, “to check him out”, but the scribe recognized that the masculine was inappropriate and indicated that one should read מבדקונַהּ, “to check her out”.<br>
While this is the text in both mss., one has to read מַעֲשֵׂר.<br>
This refers to the Second Tithe, food that the farmer retains for himself and his family, to be eaten in purity in Jerusalem. On that occasion, he has to declare in the Temple that he “did not separate it while impure” (<i>Deut.</i> 26:14; <i>Bikkurim</i> 2:2). This implies that Second Tithe becomes desecrated by impurity and must be redeemed. The question is whether eating Second Tithe in any state of impurity is a criminal offense, for which the punishment is whipping. The thesis advanced here is that Second Tithe has a status equal to heave, so that tertiary impurity makes that tithe unusable.<br>The Babli certainly agrees that the statement of R. Joshua is not an endorsement of the practice since it quotes Mishnah <i>Tahorot</i> 2:2 in which R. Joshua disagrees with R. Eliezer whom R. Aqiba follows.<br>It is always held that first tithe after separation of the heave of the tithe is totally profane in the hand of the Levite, even if consumption is restricted to Levites of good standing.<br>
From the Rome ms., missing in the Leiden ms.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>: אוכל “food”.<br>
From the Rome ms., missing in Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps.</i> The Rome ms. everywhere writes rabbinic חרס for biblical חרש.<br>

Paragraph 6

Reading of a Geniza fragment. In the Leiden ms., the reading may be either בהן “in the case of” or כהן “as the case”.<br>
Reading of a <i>Geniza</i> fragment; missing in Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. and a <i>Geniza</i> fragment; missing in Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>

From a <i>Geniza</i> ms. Missing in Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
From a <i>Geniza</i> ms. Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i> ובא בעלה עליה כהן, an unidiomatic word order.<br>

Reading of the Rome ms. and the Geniza fragment; missing in Leiden ms.<br>
Missing in Rome ms. and Geniza fragment; is in Leiden ms. but makes no sense.<br>

Paragraph 7

Reading of the Rome ms. Leiden text and <i>editio princeps</i>: להלן “away from”.<br>
Illegible in Leiden ms., from <i>editio princeps</i> and Rome ms.<br>
From the Rome ms. Leiden: בָעֵי “asked”.<br>
The following sentences, while correct in themselves, seem to be out of proper order. They have been translated in the conjectured correct order indicated by the numerals in the text.<br>
That the people as a whole will be punished for secret sins of an individual. Moses had explicitly ruled out responsibility of the public for hidden deeds of the individual, <i>Deut</i>. 29:28.<br>In the Babli, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 43b, the position of R. Simon ben Laqish is similar to that of the Tanna R. Jehudah. The responsibility of the public for hidden deeds of the individual is denied by R. Nehemiah.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., missing in many Mishnah mss., the Leiden ms., and <i>editio princeps</i>. In the Babli, the paragraph of the king is mentioned before “blessings and curses,” but that also is irregular since someone reading from the Torah should never scroll backwards. Cf. the variant readings of the Babli (Note 213) p. 198, Notes 98,99.<br>

Paragraph 8

From the Rome ms. The Leiden ms. before correction has לעכב “as a necessary condition”, deleted by the corrector. The Rome text is correct as shown by the repetition in the same paragraph.<br>
From the Rome ms. The insertion is necessary since “to have power” always is expressed by ספק ביד.<br>
The Genizah text adds: וּפְעָמִים הָיָה מַתְרֵי עִימָּהֶם “and sometimes it was encamped with them.”<br>
In the Genizah fragment: כַקִּירוּי “acted as roof”. This is the better reading.<br>
In <i>editio princeps</i> and the Genizah fragment, not in the Leiden ms.<br>
From the Genizah fragment, not in the Leiden ms. or <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
In the Genizah fragment: אָמַר לָהֶן “he said to them” (to the Levites)<br>
From the Genizah fragment, not in the Leiden ms. or <i>editio princeps</i>. The word seems to be required by the context.<br>
Reading of the Geniza ms. Leiden and <i>editio princeps</i>: יורם מפני יהוא “Joram because of Jehu.” Cf. Babli <i>Horaiot</i> 11b.<br>
Insert from the Genizah ms., missing in Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i> here but found in the parallel in <i>Šeqalim</i>.<br>
Reading of the Geniza ms. Leiden and <i>editio princeps</i> here and in <i>Šeqalim</i>: ענתונדריה.<br>
A Babylonism, found also in <i>Šeqalim</i> 6:2.<br>
In <i>Šeqalim</i> אוֹרְכָּן “their length”. But then the original scribe had “the width of the Ark”, corrected (probably wrongly) into “the length of the Ark.”<br>
This text was also the original scribe’s in <i>Šeqalim</i>, corrected into: תֵּן מֵהֶם חֲצִי טֶפַח לְכָל־כּוֹתֶל נִשְׁתַּייֵר שְׁנֵי טְפָחִים לְסֵפֶר תּוֹרָה. “Take half a handbreadth for each wall, there were two handbreadths left for the Torah scroll.”<br>
The text in <i>Šeqalim</i> adds: וְרָחְבָּן שִׁשָּׁה “and their width six handbreadths”; the original scribe had שְׁלֹשָׁה “three”. The correction, as also an earlier one (Note 94) is based on the Babli and must be rejected since the uncorrected reading is confirmed as Yerushalmi reading by Tosaphot <i>Menaḥot</i> 99a, <i>s. v</i>. מלמד.<br>
In <i>Šeqalim</i>: תֵּן אָרְכָּן שֶׁלַּלּוּחוֹת לְאָרְכּוֹ שֶׁלָּאָרוֹן “If the lengths of the tablets were in the length of the Ark”. This text is the correct one since in the text here the second case is identical with the first.<br>
From the Rome ms., confirmed by the end of the paragraph.<br>
From the Rome ms., missing in Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
The vocalization is from the Leiden ms. In the Genizah ms., one reads רובא, probably רוֹבָא. The usual rabbinic pronunciation is רִיבָה.<br>
From the Genizah fragment; missing in ms. Leiden, <i>editio princeps, Sifry Deut</i>. 196 and the Babli, 44a.<br>
Reading of the Genizah fragment:וְעִשָׂאוֹ שְׁתַּייִם  הָיָה גָּדוֹל וְעָשָׂאוֹ קָטָן אֶחָד.<br>
Added from the Genizah fragment. If פיסים are commercial taxes, following Levy’s interpretation in his Dictionary, then the statement implies that the exemption from military duty applies only to a person not gainfully employed for a year. Therefore, one should hesitate to declare the absence of this text in the Leiden and Rome mss. an omission. In a Babli source, <i>Tosephta</i> 7:24 (Erfurt 23), it is stated that those who return from the front do pay taxes.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms., with all Mishnah mss. Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>: קִישּׁוּי “the difficulty (of war)”; but in the Halakhah the text agrees with the Mishnah mss.<br>
ולראות חרב שלופה reading of the Rome and Genizah mss. The Leiden ms. reads וחרב שלופה.<br>
From the Rome and Geniza mss., missing in the Leiden ms.<br>

Paragraph 9

From the Rome and Genizah mss., missing in Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
From the Genizah ms., missing in Rome and Leiden mss. and <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
Reading of the Genizah ms., in Rome and Leiden mss. here בכל מקים but correctly in the parallel <i>Roš Haššanah </i>3:1.<br>
From the Genizah ms., missing in the other two mss.<br>
From the Genizah ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>. In Leiden ms. והיה, an easily corrected mistake.<br>
In the Genizah ms.: בירבי סימון. It is difficult to decide between the readings since neither name appears a second time.<br>
From the Genizah ms. In the Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>: נֹאמַר כָּל־אוֹתָן אַרְבַּע עֶשְׂרֶה שָׁנָה מְצוּייָנִים הָיוּ “we may say, all these fourteen years they were identified” (the case simply never happened). There are no conclusive arguments for or against either reading.<br>
From the Genizah ms. Leiden: ומוברין “they move him”; a reading which seems quite impossible since an unknown corpse has to be buried at the place it was found. In the Tosephta, 9:l (both versions), וחופרין וקוברין “they dig and bury”. <i>Editio princeps</i> (from the first hand of the Leiden ms): וּמוכרין “and they sell”, certainly an impossible reading.<br>
Text of the Genizah. The Leiden text is fragmentary here. In the parallel <i>Sanhedrin</i> 1:3, the arguments of R. Simeon and R. Jehudah are switched.<br>
Reading of the Genizah ms. The Leiden ms. switches the two expressions. The entire argument is modelled after one in <i>Peah</i> 6:9, Notes 151–154; it is possible that the Leiden text refers to <i>Peah</i> as “here” and <i>Soṭah </i>as “there”.<br>
A clear misspelling, faithfully copied in <i>editio princeps</i> and some medieval authors. Unfortunately, only the letters פר. are readable in the Genizah ms. The translation presupposes the reading לִסְפָר.<br>
From the Genizah ms., required by the historical context, missing in the other sources.<br>
Reading of the Rome and Genizah mss., missing in the Leiden ms. {The student of R. Jonathan was R. Samuel bar Naḥman; the Amora R. Samuel, student of rabbis Abbahu and Ze‘ira, lived two generations later.}<br>
From the Rome ms. Missing in the Leiden ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>. The addition is good style but not absolutely necessary.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leiden and <i>editio princeps</i>: טריפה.<br>
Reading of the Genizah ms. The other mss. and <i>editio princeps</i> read תמן.<br>
Text from the Genizah, missing in the other two mss. and <i>editio princeps</i>. The text from the Genizah is required since (1) R. Simeon ben Laqish cannot differ with a Tanna without tannaitic support and (2) R. Ila’s statement makes no sense without it.<br>
Reading of the Rome ms. Leiden ms: מתני׳ “the Mishnah”. The Genizah ms. has here only a reference to the other occurrences of this text.<br>
In the Genizah ms: הרוצחן.<br>
Text from the Genizah ms., missing in the other mss. and <i>editio princeps.</i><br>
Missing in the Leiden ms. here; exists in the other mss. and the text in <i>Ma‘aser Šeni.</i><br>
Redundant text, not in <i>Ma‘aser Šeni.</i><br>

In the Leiden ms.: ומי. The text follows the other two mss. here and all sources in <i>Ma‘aser Šeni.</i><br>
In the Tosephta, חבטו “he hit him”. This is more fitting for the lictor and this version is used for the translation. (There is no Genizah source any more at this point).<br>
From the Rome ms. Leiden and <i>editio princeps</i> והחזירו “who returned him.”<br>
In the Leiden ms. (not in <i>editio</i> <i>princeps</i> or the Rome ms.) one finds here an insert, a commentary that entered the text from the margin: פירוש הוא זה תרגומא הברה. הברה בלשון מקרא בת. בת הברה היא. שלא הקול ממש היו שומעים אלא הברת קול: “This is a commentary: the translation is <i>echo.</i> An echo in biblical language is called <i>bat. Bat</i> is an echo. For they did not really hear a voice but the echo of a voice.”<br>
In the parallel <i>Thren</i>. <i>rabba</i> 5, the ו is missing. That seems to be correct since the Rav Jeremiah here needs a qualifyer to his name. He is not Rav Jeremiah, the elder authority in Rav’s academy.<br>
This word is not in the parallel in <i>Peah</i>. But since this an oath formula, it is not necessary to delete the word.<br>
Read חֶסֶד both times.<br>
Added from the Genizah text. While the defective Leiden text is also reproduced in <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the Genizah text is confirmed by Rebbi's argument at the end of this paragraph and Sifra Wayyiqra Pereq 6(2).

Ketubot



Paragraph 1

Addition from the parallel text in <i>Megillah</i> 4:4 (75a 1. 74), missing here in ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
The queer spelling in the ms. was read in <i>editio princeps</i> as לא הכל ממנה לחוב לבנה “she is not believed to damage her son”!<br>
The words in brackets are from <i>Demay</i>, those in parentheses from <i>Ketubot</i>. The text from <i>Demay</i> seems preferable.<br>

Paragraph 2

This word appears both in the ms. and <i>editio princeps</i>; it seems a copyist’s error.<br>
This word is missing in the ms. but appears in <i>editio princeps</i>.<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Yebamot</i>. Reading here לִידֵי “on behalf of”.<br>
This word is not in <i>Yebamot</i>; it should be read since לא מסתברה דלא is a standard formula.<br>
From a parallel text in <i>Giṭṭin</i> 3:4 (45a 1.4). The text here has the unexplained word דוגין.<br>
Here starts Halakhah 11, even though in the ms. and <i>editio princeps </i>this title appears only towards the end.<br>

Paragraph 3

This word is in the ms. and <i>editio princeps</i> but should be deleted.<br>
From the text in Terumot; missing here.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Terumot</i>; here: מַכּוֹת “flogging”.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Terumot</i>; here: יוֹם הַכִּיפּוּדִים “the Day of Atonement”, whose desecration is punished by extirpation.<br>
From the text in <i>Sanhedrin</i>. Text here: גְּדוֹלָה “an adult”, which certainly is an error.<br>
From the text in <i>Šebuot</i>, missing here.<br>
Written in the text here, missing in <i>Šebuot</i>.<br>
From the text in <i>Šebuot</i>, here חייב “he is obligated”.<br>

Paragraph 4

Text from the parallel <i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:3, line 64. The text here is unintelligible.<br>
Not in the text in <i>Yebamot</i> and out of place here.<br>
Reading of the quote in <i>Arukh</i>, <i>s. v</i>. ערך, and in (the differently formulated) parallel in <i>Baba Batra</i> 9:6, 17a 1. 20. The ms. text reads: קְצַץ הוּא “Did he fix a price?” which was emended by the corrector who prepared the <i>editio princeps</i> into: קְצַץ הוּא אֲבִיד “if he [the doctor] fixed the price, it is lost [you have to pay yourself].” The emendation appears as a distortion of the text.<br>
This was the first (correct) word written by the scribe who then (incorrectly) crossed it out and replaced it by “son” to produce a meaningless sentence.<br>

Paragraph 5

In Halakhah 12:1 בְּמָה.<br>
From the text in <i>Nedarim</i> and the Mishnah, missing here.<br>
A corrector’s addition; it is found in all parallel texts, where it is necessary, but it is not clear whether the word is necessary here.<br>

Paragraph 6

This word, “for sons”, does not make any sense in the context. With all commentators it seems necessary to read לכנוס “to marry definitively” with the easily explained changes ו - י ,כ - ב.<br>
From a similar text in <i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:3. Text here: לא גבי “He does not collect.”<br>

Paragraph 7

From the parallel in <i>Qiddušin, </i>missing here in ms. and <i>editio princeps.</i><br>
The correct spelling is in <i>Qiddušin:</i> קולסיתה “her head gear”.<br>
This is the reading in <i>Qiddušin.</i> Here: קררוה which is incomprehensible. In the Babli, 75a, in a similar but not identical argument, the word כִּפָּה “cap” is used.<br>
One has to read: וכפפו.<br>

Paragraph 8

One has to read: ביציאתה “at her exit” instead of במציאתה “on the occasion of her finding.”<br>
This is the text of the parallel in <i>Bikkurim.</i> Text here: שאין אדם “for no person”.<br>
It seems that one has to read בְּעָרִיס (this is the word translated).<br>
This sentence has several corrections in the ms. It seems that the scribe first wrote שֶׁאִין עָבַד הַגִּזְבָּר וְתָפַס אֵין מוֹצִיאִין מִיָּדוֹ “if the administrator acted and took it, one does not take it from him.” This is a correct sentence but unvocalized it is misleading because of the simultaneous use of Aramaic אין “if” and Hebrew אין “not”. Therefore, the scribe crossed out the first אין and replaced it by לו, read לוּ “if” which the corrector then completed (somewhat redundantly) to אִילּוּ. The scribe also changed עבד “acted” to עבד “acted wrongly” and crossed out (mistakenly) the second אין. The best version is the original text.<br>

Paragraph 9

From the parallel in <i>Baba batra </i>8:6. The reading here is יוסטתא which is inconsistent with the second mention of the name. {Both <i>Juste</i> and <i>Justine </i>probably are provincial forms of <i>Justus, Justinus</i> (E.G.).}<br>
Added from <i>Baba batra</i> 8:9 (16c 1.20) (Tosephta <i>Baba batra</i> 8:4), missing here in ms. and <i>editio princeps;</i> cf. Note 76.<br>
This word is not in the primary <i>Qiddušin</i> text.<br>
This should be read as כְעֵד already corrected in <i>editio princeps. </i>The text in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 8:6 is formulated differently.<br>
In the Babli, <i>Šebuot</i> 48a, R. Eleazar holds (with Rav Ḥisda here) that the heirs swear the heir’s oath (Note 177) in any case. R. Abin’s statement is rejected.<br>
The vocalization is from the ms., characteristic for Italian/Ashkenazic texts which almost never write <i>qamaṣ.</i><br>
The consensus of all commentators is to read דמתון.<br>
The consensus of all commentators is to readאבד כרטסין .<br>

Paragraph 10

Probably one should read רבכון, i. e., רַבְּכוֹן “your teacher” (R. Mana) instead of רַבָּנִין “the rabbis”.<br>
Almost certainly this should be שמים “one assesses”.<br>
Instead of this word “was running”, <i>Sefer Ha‘iṭṭur</i> 42a reads הֲווָת “it was”. The reading of the ms. may be confirmed as <i>lectio difficilior</i>.<br>
The name is missing in the ms., it was added from the parallel in <i>Baba</i> <i>qama</i>, supported by <i>Sefer</i> <i>Ha‘iṭṭur</i> 42a, as required from the text below.<br>
In the text, either מן is superfluous or a word is missing and it should read מן השני.<br>

Paragraph 11



Paragraph 12

In the ms: ואין “they do not.” This is an obvious scribal error which has been corrected from the quote in Halakhah 1.<br>

Paragraph 13

The text in parentheses, “in the Sabbatical year”, is the ms. text. The text in brackets, “when he was dying” is that of the quote by Aliasi <i>Baba batra </i>#887. However, there the text is different: מי ששלח ממדינת הים ואמר ינתנו אלו לבני בנותיו בכלל ואם אמר בשעת מיתה אלו לבני אין הבנות בכלל. “If somebody <i>sent from</i> overseas and said, certain things should be given to <i>my</i> sons, his daughters are included. If he said that when he was dying, certain things should be given to my sons, his daughters are not included.” While the ms. text is corrupt and the translation follows Aliasi, the hybrid ms.-Aliasi text cannot really be considered as representing the original.<br>
This and the following paragraphs are from <i>Nedarim</i> 4:2, explained there in Notes 20–44. Variant readings from there are denoted by <b>נ</b>.<br>The present paragraph refers there to Notes 20–26. The Mishnah in <i>Nedarim</i> explains what a person can do for someone else about whom he has vowed that he should not have any usufruct from him. According to Ḥanan, a person in that situation could support the other’s wife in his absence since he has no legal right to recoup his money.<br>
Sentence missing in the <i>Ketubot </i>text.<br>

Nedarim



Paragraph 1

This looks like a slip of the pen for תְּמוּנָה, which is indicated thus in the translation.<br>
This looks like a slip of the pen for אִילּוּ, which is indicated thus in the translation.<br>
It seems that one should read את instead of אם, as suggested by the later discussion. The translation uses אַתְּ “you”.<br>
This seems to be an error for הָקָרְבָּן  and is translated as such.<br>

Paragraph 2

This is the text in the ms. and <i>editio princeps</i> all three times in this paragraph. It seems that one has to read תּוֹדָה all three times; the translation assumes that reading.<br>

Paragraph 3

Reading of the Parallel 9:1. The text here reads חלה “it fell” or “it fell sick”.<br>
This is the reading of the text in <i>Šebuot</i>. Here, the reading is קַבָּרִין “grave diggers” which might be a misreading for קָרוּכִין Latin <i>carrucha, - ae, f</i>. “four-wheeled travelling and state coach”.<br>
In <i>Šebuot</i> תְּמַנְיָא מֶסוֹסטֻלָא “eight spaces between pillars”. The underlying Greek is μεσοστύλιον, τό, “space between columns.”<br>
In <i>Šebuot</i> קָרוּכִין דְּמַלְכוּתָא “a state coach”, cf. Note 39.<br>
In <i>Šebuot</i> וְאִם בִּמְרוּבַּע “if square, why must it be large?”<br>
In <i>Šebuot</i>, the reading is קוּרִי פָּלֻּי בּרֶיכּסוֹן which N. Brüll (Jahrbuch für jüdische Geschichte und Literatur 1, p. 130) reads as κύριε πολὺ βρέξον “o Lord, give abundant water”, as first verse of a prayer for rain. S. Lieberman, in a full discussion of this text (יונית ויונות בארץ ישראל, Jerusalem 1962, pp. 25–27), points out that the invocation of God’s name in a vain prayer is forbidden by the Third Commandment and that the characterization as “vow” is only a reference to that Commandment.<br>
This is the reading of the Mishnah in the Babli.<br>

Paragraph 4

In the parallel in <i>Megillah</i>, הֲנָייַת מַאֲכָל “use of food”.<br>
In the parallel in <i>Megillah</i>, זוסטא.<br>
Text from the parallel in <i>Ketubot</i>. Here: שֶׁיָּמוּת עַבְדוֹ “that his slave should die”, which has no connection to the text referred to.<br>
Text from the parallel in <i>Ketubot</i>, missing here.<br>
Text in <i>Šebuot</i> וְהָהֵן דַּהֲוָה רַבָּה “which one is better?”<br>
Text from <i>Šebuot</i>. Missing in the text here.<br>
Reading of the corrector. Reading of the scribe and <i>editio princeps</i>: מַפְחָת “diminishes”.<br>
Reading of the corrector. Reading of the scribe and <i>editio princeps</i>: אֲשׁוֹנָה “the glow”. The vocalization of the text is from the ms. In the Tosephta (2:7): He sweats with him in a small sauna.<br>
Rashba (<i>Novellae ad</i> 41b) reads מי סויכוס, Ravad (Note to Maimonides, <i>Hilkhot Nedarim</i> 6:9) reads מיכירוס. There is no traditional explanation for the words. Lieberman (<i>Tosephta</i> <i>kiFshutah Šabbat</i> p. 284) reads one word: <i>missorium</i>. {Perhaps <i>mistarius, - ii, m</i>., from <i>misceo</i> “to mix”, “vessel in which wine was mixed with water” (E. G.).}<br>
Rashba (cf. Note 81) and Ravad (cf. Note 81) read קַדָּחִין “one draws”. This has been taken as basis for the translation.<br>
An intrusion of Babylonian spelling.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Peah</i> 6:1 (Note 17). Text here: בדמיה “by its value”.<br>

Paragraph 5

It seems that one should read הַנּוֹדֵר. This is the basis of the translation.<br>
From the parallel text in <i>Baba</i> <i>Qama</i> 9:14. Since <i>Neziqin</i> may be from a different editing team, it is not certain that the text is exactly what is missing here, but the question which follows indicates that it cannot have been much different.<br>
From the text in <i>Baba Qama</i>, missing here. Since R. Yose ben Ḥanina was a younger contemporary of Rav Jeremiah but R. Yose the Amora came 4 generations after him, the reading is reasonable. In the Babli, 47a, the quote is in the name of Rava, an older contemporary of R. Yose the Amora.<br>
The ms. is vocalized אסַרו, identifying ־ָ and -ַ, as usual in Ashkenazic (Italian and German) medieval mss.<br>
Reading of the quote in Rosh (R. Asher ben Ieḥiel) to <i>Giṭṭin</i> 35b. In the ms. there is an erasure here, on which is written פ׳ דילמ׳ בקביוסטיסא “explanation: perhaps in gambling”. The last two words are printed in the <i>editio princeps</i> but because of the Babylonian/rabbinic דילמא they cannot represent the text. {It seems that in his notes for his dictionary, J. Levy misread לח (38) for לה (35). The error was faithfully copied by the compilors of later dictionaries (Kohut, Jastrow, Krauss).}<br>

Paragraph 6

This is the reading of the first hand in the mss. The corrector (followed by <i>editio princeps</i>) has unexplained אתי.<br>
This is the reading of the Mishnah in the Babli.<br>
From the text in <i>Sanhedrin, </i>missing here.<br>
In the text here, missing in <i>Sanhedrin.</i> The text in <i>Sanhedrin </i>seems to be the correct one.<br>
From the text in <i>Sanhedrin</i>. The reading here is a singular, מעשׂה.<br>
Reading of the text in <i>Sanhedrin </i>and in the Bible. Text here ויכלו (וַיְכַלּוּ “they finished”).<br>
This is the reading in three of the four parallel texts. In <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the reading is הַדּוֹחַק; cf. the author’s The Scholar’s <i>Haggadah</i> (Northvale 1995) p. 298.<br>
Missing here, appears in all parallels.<br>
Reading of the parallel texts. Here ר׳, i. e., רִבִּי.<br>
In all parallels, the quote is <i>Lev</i>. 23:2.<br>
Reading of the parallel in <i>Sanhedrin.</i> Reading here: רַב.<br>

Paragraph 7

This is the text of the scribe of the ms. The corrector changed it to וּמוּתָּר “but he is permitted”, copied by <i>editio princeps</i>. It is obvious that both “forbidden” and “permitted” was in the text before the scribe, as preserved in the Tosephta (3.5) and the Babli (54b):<br>In this text, the expression “similarly” makes sense and the anonymous majority are inclusive as R. Aqiba is here, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel is narrow in his definition as the rabbis are with vegetables. The Babli, 54b, simply states that R. Aqiba and Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel are on opposite sides in this discussion.<br>
From the text in <i>Ḥallah.</i> Here: פַּת סְתָם, which is the text in the next argument.<br>
Both in <i>Berakhot</i> and in <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan:</i> נכפית. This has been taken as basis for the translation.<br>
In <i>Berakhot</i> קלבינטרין,<i>in Mo‘ed Qaṭan:</i> קלמנטרין.<br>
In <i>Mo‘ed Qaṭan:</i> מִשֶּׁיְּשִׁיפֵם.<br>

Paragraph 8

This is the spelling in the Babylonian Mishnah and most independent Mishnah mss. קפל “to fold”, כפל “to double up”.<br>

Paragraph 9



Paragraph 10

In the text quoted by Naḥmanides (<i>Halakhot</i>, 11:1) מוּפָר “it was dissolved”. It is to be noted that the text quoted by Naḥmanides can be trusted to mirror the Yerushalmi text as to content but not as witness to the text; e. g., he writes Babylonian חייא, תנא for Yerushalmi חייה, תני.<br>
From Naḥmanides. Ms. and <i>editio princeps</i> עַצְמָהּ “her own”, which they are in any case.<br>

Paragraph 11

Greek πόποι is classically an exclamation of surprise, anger, pain, etc.; it is later explained as “divinities, gods”. While the husband avoided using Hebrew or Aramaic expressions for God’s name, the Greek in this case has the meaning of “God of Israel”; this classifies the act as an oath, which R. Yasa refused to annul. The husband swore that his wife should no longer enter his house, i. e., he forced himself to divorce her and pay her the divorce settlement.<br>
<i>Num</i>. 30:14.<br>
In the Biblical text, in Demay, and in the <i>editio princeps</i> here: לוֹ. The ms. text is the only one making sense here.<br>

Nazir



Paragraph 1

In <i>Arukh</i>, <i>s. v.</i> פונדק, the reading is פונדק. This is the basis of the translation, from the Greek κάρυον Ποντικόν “Pontic nut, filbert”.<br>

Paragraph 2

From the <i>editio princeps</i>. The scribe deleted an inappropriate word שכן “since” but both he and the corrector failed to replace it.<br>
Commentators read this as פְּדָיוֹ “if he redeemed it.” This reading is accepted in the translation.<br>

Paragraph 3



Paragraph 4

These three words seem not to belong anywhere in this paragraph; they are not translated.<br>

Paragraph 5

Read אַחֵר; see the reading in <i>Terumot</i>.<br>
Read: כְּפִתְרָה “as explanation”.<br>

Paragraph 6

Clearly, this should read עָשָׂה “did” instead of אָמַר “said”.<br>
A word is missing, which can be conjectured to be תַעַר; see the commentary to this sentence.<br>

Paragraph 7



Paragraph 8

Read: שְׁבוּעוֹת (already corrected in <i>editio princeps</i>).<br>

Paragraph 9

An alternative spelling of תְּפוּשָׂתוֹ.<br>
In ms. and <i>editio princeps</i> this is the start of Halakhah 4.<br>

Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3

The expression תַּמָּן תַּנִּינָן is the standard reference to a Mishnah (other than the one under discussion). Since the reference is to a clause in the Mishnah under discussion, the word תנינן is a learned scribe’s slip of the pen; it is missing in the Geniza text.<br>
Here ends the Geniza ms.<br>

Paragraph 4



Paragraph 5

Vocalization of the ms.<br>

Paragraph 6

A Babylonism.<br>
The usual Babylonian form of Galilean נוֹמוֹס.<br>

Paragraph 8

This has to be read אדם with the text in <i>Peah</i>.<br>

Paragraph 9

This word is a scribal error.<br>
Necessary text added from <i>Yebamot</i>, missing here.<br>

Kiddushin



Paragraph 1

Reading of the <i>editio princeps</i>. The corrector wrote בהונקו. No root הנק is known.<br>
From here on there exists a parallel text of an Ashkenazi ms. edited with partial variant readings by J. Sussman in <i>Kobez al Yad</i> xii (xxii), Jerusalem 1994, pp. 112 ff. In the Notes, this text will be referred to as A, the Leiden ms. as L.<br>
In L the word is partially vocalized ששַנה; by the rules of grammar it should be ששָנה. The vocalization is intended to show that the translation should be “because it repeated”, to exclude the reading of A (and uncorrected L) ששינה “because it changed”.<br>
Vocalization of the ms. (As usual in Medieval European texts, <i>pataḥ</i> takes the place of <i>qāmaṣ</i>)<br>
Word missing in A. If the word is accepted in the text, “seven” would have to be corrected to “six.” But the reading “seven” is confirmed by A.<br>
In the ms: לאחזותו, a metathesis not detected by the corrector.<br>
This is Babli terminology, for Yerushalmi תנינן. The sentence was added by the corrector; obviously it was added as an (unnecessary) emendation of the text, not from a different ms.<br>
From here to the end of the Halakhah, there are parallel texts in <i>Peah</i> 1:1 (Notes 209–213, 16b 1. 43 ff., <b>פ</b>) and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 10:1 (27c 1. 41 ff., <b>ן</b>) The introduction is missing in both texts; this indicates that the original place of the text is here in <i>Qiddušin</i>.<br>

Paragraph 2

This word is an echo of the preceding text. Instead of אוֹכֶלֶת בִּתְרוּמָה one should read either active  אָֽכְלָה or passive נֶאֱכֶלֶת.<br>
This shorter version is that of the Mishnah in the Babli.<br>
Quoted in the Babli, <i>Bekhorot </i>11a. The translation follows the Babli in reading בּוֹ “in it” instead of בן “son” of the ms.<br>

Paragraph 3

Vocalization of the ms. The standard Livorno vocalization used in this book would require חָֽזְרָת.<br>
Probably this should be אמ׳, to be read אָמַר (<i>Qorban Ha‘edah</i>).<br>

Addition of E, confirmed by a Genizah fragment. At first look, the argument seems to prove that double restitution be required only for animals whose firstborn are either given to the Cohen (cattle and sheep, <i>Ex</i>. 34:19), or for which a substitute is given to the Cohen (donkeys, <i>Ex</i>. 34:20,13:13). The extended arguments in the Babli, 64a, and even more so in <i>Mekhilta</i> <i>dR</i>. <i>Simeon</i> <i>ben</i> <i>Ioḥai</i>, p. 194, note that the explicit mention of “stolen goods” shows that the list is incomplete and, therefore, no restriction is intended..<br>
