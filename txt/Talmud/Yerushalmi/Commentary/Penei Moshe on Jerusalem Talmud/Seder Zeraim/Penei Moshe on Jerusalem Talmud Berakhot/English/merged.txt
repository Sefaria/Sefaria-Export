There are voices in them. Meaning that sometimes you can find more voices in them than in the Written Law (Torah), as it is taught in the Mishnah of Sanhedrin, and we bring it before us.
[It is written:] "Do not defile them" (Micah 2:7). This scripture is in the book of Micah, where the prophet spoke in the name of the Lord, and it is fitting to prevent them from prophetic words, since they are not attentive and despise His words, as it says, "Do not defile them; they will not defile Baal gods, and they will not be shamed" (Micah 2:7). Because they only desire false and deceitful words, as it concludes there: "He sets out like a wind and spreads lies and deception, saying, 'I will prophesy to you about wine and strong drink' and he shall be the prophet of this people" (Micah 2:11). Therefore, the Lord commanded to prevent them from prophetic words. However, with the words of the elders, we do not find this to be the case. Even though they are not attentive, the Torah says, "They shall explain to you the meaning of the judgment, and the one who acts presumptuously shall be punished, and they will not listen to their words" (Deuteronomy 17:11). It means that the words of the elders are more stringent than the words of the prophets.
פלימנטרין. One who comes on behalf of the king to execute and supervise certain matters is called "frumentarius" in Latin.
סמנטרין. A sign or letter from the king.
ברם הכא ע"פ התורה אשר יורוך. When they say so, this is the command of the Torah without a sign or a symbol; you should believe them.
