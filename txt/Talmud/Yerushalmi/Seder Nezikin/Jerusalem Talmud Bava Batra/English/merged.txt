Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Condominium owners<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">They own separate houses built facing one courtyard; they want to build a wall so that each house opens to its own courtyard.</i> who want to make a separation in the courtyard build the wall in the middle. At a place where commonly one builds with unhewn stones, or hewn stones, or half-bricks<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the definition of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 3a" href="/Bava_Batra.3a">Babli (3a</a>). In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Habakkuk 2:11" href="/Habakkuk.2.11"><i>Hab.</i> 2:11</a> the word means “wood splinter”.</i>, or bricks, everything follows local custom<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If one of the parties wants to build following local custom, he can force the other party to agree with him.</i>. For unhewn stones, each partner gives three handbreadths. For hewn stones, each gives two and one half handbreadths. For half-bricks, each gives two handbreadths. For bricks, each gives one and a half handbreadths<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A wall made of half-bricks is wider than one made of whole bricks since the mortar between the pieces takes up an additional half handbreadth.</i>. Therefore, if the wall collapsed<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If a wall collapsed and it is no longer known who built it, one has to assume that it was built following these rules.</i> the place and the stones belong to both of them.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Condominium owners who want to make a separation,” etc. As we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 1:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.1.5.1">Mishnah 7</a>.</i>: “One does not subdivide a courtyard unless each party has four cubits.” They said, there if the two parties do not agree<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is spelled out in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 1:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.1.5.1">Mishnah 7</a>: one party may force the dissolution of a condominium if each party will be left with a legal minimum of space.</i>. But here if both parties agree<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It says explicitly that “they wish to make a separation.” In that case they are not bound by minimal conditions (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 2b" href="/Bava_Batra.2b">Babli 2b</a>).</i>. And you may even say, here if the two parties do not agree<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the next sentence, “they wish” means “either of them may wish”.</i>. If this one wishes, one forces the other; if the other one wishes, one forces this one. Rebbi Joḥanan said, one forces for courtyards; one does not force for roofs<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is assumed that the parties wish to build the wall in order to insure privacy, so that one party cannot see what the other is doing in his courtyard. The courtyards were always in the back of the houses, not visible from the street. One assumes that both buildings are one-storey houses and that the wall will be built high enough that from one flat roof the neighbor’s courtyard cannot be seen. There remains the question what is meant by “splitting because of the roof.”</i>. Rebbi Nasa wanted to say, in case of a courtyard which is higher than the roof<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Two houses built on a hillside; the courtyard of the upper one is higher than the roof of the lower. According to R. Nasa, the owner of the lower house cannot go to court to force the owner of the upper house to build a wall which will guarantee the privacy of the lower house.</i>. But in case of a roof which is higher than the courtyard, one forces<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As noted before, the wall must be built high enough that from one flat roof the neighbor’s courtyard cannot be seen.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan wanted to say, in case of a courtyard which is higher than the roof one forces<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, the inhabitants cannot but see what is going on in the lower house. This violates the privacy rights of the inhabitants of the latter; the former can be forced to construct a fence which will bar them from looking down.</i>. But in case of a roof which is higher than the courtyard, one does not force<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the use of the roof is infrequent, the damage done to the other party by an occasional glance is minor and does not warrant the construction of a fence. The Babli disagrees in the name of Samuel, 2b.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Similarly for a vegetable garden<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">An irrigated area of intensive agriculture.</i>; a place which customarily is fenced in, he must fence in<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If one of the parties wishes to construct a fence the other party is forced to contribute land and money to its construction.</i>. But in an agricultural area<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">בקעה is a region of extensive agriculture.</i>, a place which customarily is not fenced in, one does not obligate him. But if he<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">One of the farmers.</i> wishes, he builds inside his land and makes a façade<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A smooth face; the wall or fence must be covered with smooth stone plates. This characterizes the fence or wall as private property of a single owner.</i> to the outside; therefore if the wall collapses both land and stones are his.<br>But if they<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Two property owners in the agricultural area.</i> did it with mutual agreement they build the wall in the middle and make façades on both sides; therefore if the wall collapses<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If a wall collapsed and it is no longer known who built it, one has to assume that it was built following these rules.</i> both land and stones belong to both of them.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Similarly for a vegetable garden,” etc. It was stated: For a vegetable garden, whether it be a place where it is customary to build a fence, or a place where it is not customary to build a fence, one forces<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">As pointed out in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 4a" href="/Bava_Batra.4a">Babli, 4a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a> is ambiguous in the case of a place where it is not customary to fence in vegetable gardens. From the first sentence, one would infer that one would not force one farmer to participate in the costs of a fence which his neighbor wants to put up, but from the second sentence it seems that only in agricultural areas he does not have to participate. The Babli restricts the power of the court to order participation in the building of a fence to places which do not have a declared policy against erecting fences. It is possible to read this into the Yerushalmi text.</i>. But in an agricultural area, at a place where it is customary to build a fence one forces; where it is not customary to build a fence one does not force.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Somebody’s [property] surrounded another’s on three sides. If he fenced in the first, and the second, and the third sides, one does not hold [the other] liable. Rebbi Yose said, if the latter then fenced in the fourth side, one rolls everything over to him<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since he now uses the three fences put up by the other owner for his own purposes, the latter can ask for half the cost of erecting the other three fences.</i>.<br>If the wall of a courtyard collapsed, one obligates him<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">If one of the parties wants to rebuild, the other is forced to share the costs.</i> to rebuild up to four cubits. There is a presumption that he gave, unless he brings proof that he did not give<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">If later the party which rebuilt the wall claims that it was not paid by the other party, he is the claimant and the burden of proof is on him.</i>. Higher than four cubits one does not obligate him, but if he built an adjacent wall, even though he did not put on roofing, one rolls everything over to him<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">If only one party is in charge of rebuilding, he cannot claim reimbursement for the costs of raising the wall higher than four cubits, even if the wall which had collapsed was higher. But if the party which is not in charge then builds a wall on his own property in the full hight of the separation wall, at a right angle to it, and now has three walls, the two newly built ones and his house, which he may use to create a new roofed space, he uses the full hight of the rebuilt wall and has to pay his share for the full hight.</i>. There is a presumption that he did not give, unless he brings proof that he gave<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">If he did not pay his full share, putting the roofing on the other person’s wall would be illegal. Therefore, the rules of torts apply rather than those of civil claims. Since it is common usage that the second party pays only for the costs of building up to four cubits, the presumption is that he did not pay for his share of the part of the wall which exceeds the customary height.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Somebody’s [property] surrounded another’s,” etc. <b>Halakhah 5:</b> “If the wall of a courtyard collapsed,” etc. Rav Ḥuna said, only at the rate he is building now<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Commentary to Mishnah 4. The farmer who only built one fence has to pay to the one who built three at most half the cost of his fences if they were built like the fourth (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 4b" href="/Bava_Batra.4b">Babli 4b</a>). E reads בְּשַׁעַר “at the rate” instead of L’s בְּשָׁעָה “at the time”; the reading of E was translated.</i>. For if he built it arched<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Commentary to Mishnah 5. The wall was built in the way of Roman architecture, sturdy Roman arches with a thin filling below and a flat top. This saves material but costs more in labor.</i>, he had to build arched. But here if it was built arched and he built it with bricks, he can collect the cost of arches, and if it should collapse, he has to rebuild it<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The party which rebuilt the wall can require to be paid for the quality of the previous wall, but if it was executed with inferior material or workmanship he has to rebuild it at his own expense.</i>.
“Rebbi Yose said, if the latter then fenced in the fourth side, one rolls everything over to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">While this is a quote from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.1.3.1">Mishnah 4</a>, Rav Huna’s remark refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.1.3.1">Mishnah 5</a>.</i>” Rav Ḥuna said, one rolls over the length of the wall to him<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the new wall built by the other party who did not construct the original wall higher than four cubits starts in the middle of the wall of partition, he has to pay for the elevation of the wall of partition in its entire length. This also is Rav Huna’s opinion in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 6a" href="/Bava_Batra.6a">Babli 6a</a>, opposed by the authoritative Rav Naḥman who holds that he only has to pay for that part of the wall which he uses for his own purposes.</i>.
So far lengthwise. What about its width?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah refers to the case that the new wall be built at a right angle to the dividing wall; the builder then intends to put on logs which form the roof parallel to the dividing wall, between his house and his new wall. He uses the dividing wall only as back wall for his new room; the dividing wall does not carry any weight. Nevertheless, it is enough to make him responsible for half the cost of the entire dividing wall. The problem now is about a wall built parallel to the dividing wall, where the house will form the back wall of the new room to be constructed. If the owner of this piece of land pays half of the cost of the dividing wall, may he put his logs on it to form a roof over his new room?</i> Rebbi Nasa said, the wall of the courtyard is only made to save for him<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The purpose of the wall is to create privacy, rather than to carry any weight.</i>. They<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The members of R. Nasa’s school.</i> intended to say that if he wanted to make a roof, he cannot make a roof<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">If the wall was not built for weight-carrying from the start, no party can put any weight on it. E has an additional argument:<br>וְחָזַר וְתַנָּה. סָמַךְ לוֹ כוֹתֶל אַחֵר אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁלֹּא נוֹתַן עָלָיו אֶת הַתִּקְרָה מְגַלְגְּלִין עָלָיו אֶת<br>הַכֹּל. הָא אִם רָצָה לִקְרוֹת אֵינוֹ מַקְרֶה.<br>He (R. Nasa) repeated and stated: “but if he built an adjacent wall, even though he did not put on roofing, one rolls everything over to him.” Therefore, even if he wanted to make a roof, he cannot make a roof.<br>The inference which his students wanted to draw from his statement already follows from the text of the Mishnah. The payment required is just for the wall as is, not for any additional use.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, explain it by his beams<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">מָרֵישׁ is a weight-carrying beam. The person building a wall parallel to the dividing wall might put up vertical beams at the two ends of the dividing wall and use them together with his newly constructed wall to make a wooden frame on which to place the roof beams. Then he gets a room of which the dividing wall simply is a wall but carries no weight. The payment of half the cost of the dividing wall is enough to make this a legitimate construction.</i>.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One forces him to build a porter’s lodge and a door for the courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Any owner of one of the houses opening to the courtyard can take the other owners to court and have them contribute their fair share to the building and maintenance of a secure entrance to the courtyard. According to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 11:17" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).11.17">Tosephta <i>Bava meṣi‘a</i> 11:17</a>, the condominium can force an absentee landlord to contribute to this but to nothing else.</i>.

One forces<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The town administration can force contributions from all property owners to projects concerning their common safety.</i> him to build a wall for the town with double doors and bolt. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, not all towns<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Villages usually are unwalled.</i> are appropriate for a wall.

Twelve months; if he bought an apartment he immediately is an inhabitant of the town.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One forces him to build,” etc. Rebbi La said: So it is; the way of a provident person is to build himself a wall, as it is said<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 10:15" href="/Proverbs.10.15"><i>Prov.</i> 10:15</a>.</i>: “The wealth of the rich is the fortification of his might, etc.” It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Similar, but materially different, texts are in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 8:6:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.6.8"><i>Peah</i> 8:7 (Notes 105–106</a>), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Peah (Lieberman) 4:9" href="/Tosefta_Peah_(Lieberman).4.9">Tosephta <i>Peah</i> 4:9</a>.</i>: “If he stayed there for thirty days he is like the townspeople for the charity chest, for clothing six months, for assessments<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For imperial taxes imposed on the locality as a lump sum.</i> and penalties<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Greek ζημία; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 1:1:18" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.1.1.18"><i>Peah</i> 1:1, Note 84</a>.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not divide the courtyard unless there be four cubits for each one<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In a common courtyard, the four cubits in front of the door of each house along its entire width are for the private use of its owner. Therefore, the 4 cubits mentioned here are measured starting at a distance of 4 cubits from the house along the entire width of the house, as stated by R. Joḥanan in the Halakhah and the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 11a" href="/Bava_Batra.11a">Babli, 11a</a>. According to the Babli, the four cubits are personal property only in front of the doors.</i>, nor the field unless there be nine <i>qab</i> for each one<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Qab</i> is short for <i>bet qab,</i> the area to be sown by one <i>qab,</i> 1/6 <i>se’ah,</i> of seed grain. The <i>bet se’ah</i> is defined as 2500 square cubits. Therefore, the <i>bet qab</i> is 416 2/3 square cubits. The rules will prevent the division of estates from resulting in plots too small to be worked on. For the majority, the minimal size of an inherited field is 3750 square cubits.</i>; Rebbi Jehudah says, nine half <i>qabbim</i> for each one<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">1875 square cubits.</i>. Not the vegetable garden unless there be half a <i>qab</i> for each one<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">208 1/3 square cubits.</i>; Rebbi Aqiba says, the area of a quarter [<i>qab</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">104 1/6 square cubits.</i>. Not the dining hall, nor the storage room, nor the dovecote, nor the stole, nor the bathhouse, nor the olive press unless there is one for each of them. This is the principle: Anything which is divided and retains its name one divides, otherwise one does not divide. When is that? If the two of them do not agree. However, if both of them want it, they may divide even if it is less<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The rules are guidelines for the courts for the resolution of disputes; they do not restrict the ability of the parties to contract following their wishes.</i>. But Holy Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">A scroll of biblical texts.</i> they should not divide even if both of them want it.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One does not divide the courtyard,” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the four cubits which they mentioned are outside the four cubits of the doors. Bar Kappara stated thus: One does not subdivide a courtyard unless there be eight cubits for each party<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In a common courtyard, the four cubits in front of the door of each house along its entire width are for the private use of its owner. Therefore, the 4 cubits mentioned here are measured starting at a distance of 4 cubits from the house along the entire width of the house, as stated by R. Joḥanan in the Halakhah and the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 11a" href="/Bava_Batra.11a">Babli, 11a</a>. According to the Babli, the four cubits are personal property only in front of the doors.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the four cubits which they mentioned are not acquired by him<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">They remain condominium property.</i> but they are for him to park his animal temporarily and unload his package<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The co-owners of the courtyard may freely pass through these four cubits but not temporarily use the space otherwise; the owner or renter of the house may use it to load and unload animals and carriages but not as permanent storage area.</i>. Rebbi Jonathan asked: did they only say for him to park his animal temporarily and unload his package temporarily<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Is it possible that these rights not be connected with property rights?</i>? It was found stated: also the circular enclosure of a cistern has four cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 11:15" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).11.15">Tosephta <i>Bava meṣi‘a</i> 11:15</a>.

They said in the House of Rebbi Yannai: the chicken coop also has four cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 11b" href="/Bava_Batra.11b">Babli, 11b</a>, R.

<sup class="footnote-marker">56*</sup><i class="footnote">The entire paragraph is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 5:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.5.1.3"><i>Nedarim</i> 5:1, Notes 16–20</a>. The courtyard is there for entering and leaving the houses. Any other use is possible only if it does not disturb other inhabitants of the courtyard.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Banaiah. Everything the co-owners can prevent one another from doing in the courtyard except laundering because of the honor of the daughters of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 57b" href="/Bava_Batra.57b">Babli 57b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Mattaniah said, this is at a place where women do the laundering, but not at a place where men do the laundering. And what was said, except laundering because of the honor of the daughters of Israel, only that in his own four cubits he may prevent it. And what was said, everything the co-owners can prevent one another from doing in the courtyard, in the entire courtyard except in the other person’s own four cubits where he cannot prevent him. But if the place was at an incline, even in the other person’s own four cubits he can prevent him, since he may tell him: you are pouring out in your domain but it flows down into mine.
<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">A parallel but materially different treatment of the same subject is in <i>‘Erubin</i> 7:11, 24d lines 12–16.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon. If anybody does not want to participate in an <i>‘eruv</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">A major bone of contention between Sadducees and Pharisees in Second Temple times was the interpretation of <i>Ex.</i> 19:26: “Nobody shall leave his place on the Sabbath day.” It is agreed that this implies that one may carry things at will at “one’s place”, i. e., in one’s house, and that one may not carry in the public domain. As a matter of principle, it is agreed that a condominium space, such as a courtyard, does not qualify as “one’s place.” In pharisaic interpretation, this is only a rabbinic interpretation; it is not biblical. As a consequence, there is a rabbinic possibility to turn the courtyard into a common space by collecting contributions to symbolically prepare food for a common meal of all dwellers around the courtyard and depositing it in one of the houses. This is called <i>“ ‘eruv</i> (mixing) of courtyards”. The whole idea of <i>‘eruv</i> is rejected by Sadducees who consider reliance on it as a breach of the biblical Sabbath prohibition. It is similarly possible to turn a dead-end alley into a common courtyard of all dwellers there by affixing either a vertical lath or an horizontal beam at the entrance to the alley and then treating the alley and all courtyards which open into it as one large courtyard where then carrying is permitted. But if even one dweller in a courtyard or a dead end alley rejects the entire idea of <i>‘eruv,</i> no <i>‘eruv</i> can be made. The presence of Gentiles is irrelevant for purposes of making an <i>‘eruv.</i></i> one enters his house and makes the <i>‘eruv</i> against his will. But was it not stated: if he does not want to make an <i>‘eruv,</i> if he does not refuse one enters his house and makes the <i>‘eruv</i> against his will? Because he does not refuse. But not if he does refuse<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">One Sadducee living in a courtyard makes the <i>‘eruv</i> impossible for the entire dead end alley.

Rav Huna said, a courtyard is divided by the number of doors<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 11a" href="/Bava_Batra.11a">Babli 11a</a>. According to Rashi, Rav Huna speaks about distribution of an inheritance in case the father willed a house in his compound to each child but did not specify anything about the surrounding areas. These then are distributed in proportion to the doors of the houses each child inherited.<br>According to Maimonides (<i>Šekhenim</i> 2:1) condominium ownership in the courtyard is determined by the number of doors opening into it from each house.</i>. Rav Ḥisda said, the <i>baraita</i> refers to manure. It was stated as follows: “For the cooking stove one handbreadth, for manure according to doors, for the covered walkway according to people.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">This text is thoroughly corrupt. The mention of the cooking stove may refer to the minimal distance of a cooking stove from a wall (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 2:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.2.2.1">Chapter 2, Note 22</a>); but probably it does not correspond to anything.<br>The remainder of the text is a corruption of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 11:12" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).11.12">Tosephta <i>Bava meṣi‘a</i>11:12</a>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are three regions for claims of undisturbed possession: Judea, Transjordan<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">According to some interpretations, the region between the Judean foothills and the Mediterranian; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 9:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.9.2.1"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 9:2, Note 39</a>.</i>, and Galilee.

In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 38a" href="/Bava_Batra.38a">Babli, 38a</a>, this opinion is explained as following Rav’s opinion that the injured party may protest anywhere, not necessarily in the presence of the person in actual possession.</i>.
Rebbi Ḥanina said, the years of <i>‘orlah</i> are in dispute between them<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Mishnah and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 3:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.3.2.2">Halakhah 2</a>.

It also is possible that the statement refers to the dispute between R. Aqiba and R. Ismael. Since R. Aqiba only requires minimal preparation for a harvest, he will recognize years in which the trees cannot be harvested as included in the time required for a claim of undisturbed possession. R. Ismael, who requires extensive preparations, will not recognize those years.</i>.
Rav said, there can be no claim of undisturbed possession from a fugitive, nor one made from one country to another.

Samuel’s position is clear; he holds that a protest can be made before any court which will sign a dated statement which may be used before the court at the place of the disputed real estate without time limit. For the position of Rav, two explanations are given there. One is that he holds that a protest must be made in person and that his statement about the Mishnah was to explain the thinking of the Tanna, not his own. Another is that he also holds that a protest can be submitted in any court but that such an appearance in a distant court can be expected only from a fugitive because of nonpayment of taxes or other debt but not from a person accused of a capital crime. Also, the choice of the word “country” instead of “province” refers to a country outside the Roman Empire, such as Persia or India, from where any communication might be difficult or impossible.</i>.

Ḥiyya seems to ask a similar question relative to agricultural property. חוּליה means “ring”, from the root חלל, חול “to describe a circle”, but it is not clear that חליה is the same as חוליה.The translation in the text follows R. Eliahu Fulda, not to leave the sentence untranslated. He reads חליות מחולקות as “half circles” formed by pliable twigs, such as willow branches, with both ends planted on the ground to support branches of fruit trees heavy with fruit. He also derives the <i>hapax</i> ברות from ברר “to select”. [Starting with the Constantinople edition (1622), all printed editions read לכרות “to cut off”, which replaces an unknown word by one well-known but devoid of sense in the context.] But one could as well read ברות as Arabic بُرَاة “hunter’s hut” and refer the question to the watchman’s hut and ask about the status of such a hut built with split rings formed of any material.

Since the Yerushalmi does not explain the Mishnah, one must have recourse to the Babylonian sources. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Batra (Lieberman) 6:4" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Batra_(Lieberman).6.4">Tosephta 6:4</a> supports Rabbenu Hananel’s explanation of פיטסאות as “junk”: “If somebody buys amphoras and they turn out to be פיטסות and broke, the seller has to return the price of the amphoras but not the value of the wine.” The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 97b" href="/Bava_Batra.97b">Babli, 97b</a>, is somewhat ambiguous: תאנא פיטסות נאות ומגופרות “It was stated: <i>pitassot</i> half-baked and sulphured.” It is not clear whether פיטסות is a noun or an adjective. An addition in the Munich ms. of the Babli, referred to by Rashbam, explains that instead of being fired in a kiln, the inner walls of the clay vessel were lined with sulphur, which then was lit, burned off, and gave the impression of a finished vessel while it was only superficially baked.<br>The three sources of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Batra (Lieberman) 6:3" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Batra_(Lieberman).6.3">Tosephta 6:3</a> have different texts:<br>Vienna ms.: קנקנים מקבל עליו עשר נאות פיטסות מגופרות למאה<br>Erfurt ms.: למאה קנקנים מקבל עליו עשר פוטסות נאות מגופרות<br>Editio princeps: קנקנים מקבל עליו עשר נאות פינוסות פוניסות מגופרות למאה<br>If the ms. before the Venice printer was none too clear, it was easy to misread ט as נו; therefore the <i>editio princeps</i> may count as confirmation of the Vienna text which clearly defines פיטסות as an adjective: “Barrels, he has to accept ten half-baked, <i>pytswt,</i> sulphured per hundred.” S. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta kiFshutah Bava batra</i> p. 396) explains פיטסאות as Greek πισσωταί “pitched”. Since Tosephta <i>Abodah zarah</i> 8:1 uses standard Hebrew זפות for “pitched”, there is no reason why a Greek word should be used here. A clay vessel used for storage of fluids must be waterproofed; good vessels also are pitched. Therefore, פיטס is a word of unknown etymology, an adjective which denotes inferior quality which upon close inspection could have been detected. {But also cf.

So far the son [inherits from] the father. The father from the son? Since the son only inherits by the father’s power, is it not logical that the father on whom the son depends inherit from him?

Rebbi explained it by a parable; to what can this be compared? To two brothers, co-owners who left Egypt. One had nine sons, the other a single son. They inherited ten <i>bet kor.</i> Each of them takes a <i>letekh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Half a <i>bet kor</i>.</i>.

Dositheos ben Jehudah.<br>The text here is inconsistent in several places. If together they took ten <i>bet kor,</i> each of them took a <i>bet kor</i> rather than a <i>letekh,</i> half a <i>bet kor.</i> If the fathers were above the age of twenty at the Exodus, there is no reason why the sons of one should be co-owners with the son of the other. If they were below age twenty at the Exodus, they should have survived and the entire question could not be raised. Therefore, one has to assume that the grandfather was alive at the time of the Exodus and the entire allotment was returned to the <i>grandfather,</i> from whom each son inherited the claim to half the estate which was then split for the ten grandsons.</i>.
Rebbi Dositheos ben Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">A contemporary of Rebbi.</i> explained it by a parable; to what can this be compared?

Parables, situated in never-never land, cannot be subjected to stringent logical analysis.</i>. It turns out that the son of one takes half and the sons of the other take half.
Rebbi Joḥanan objected: “I shall bring you to your forefathers’ land, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">A misquote of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 6:8" href="/Exodus.6.8"><i>Ex.</i> 6:8</a>.

According to Rashbam (Commentary to <i>Bava batra</i> 10:1), the document was written with wide spaces between the lines, then was folded and sewn so that the document text was hidden and a witness signed the fold on the back. The number of witnesses must equal the number of folds. But the text below indicates that the text was written before it was folded and sealed. A valid document must be folded at least three times.<br>The basic use for “knotted” documents was for real estate transactions, probably to hide the financial data from public knowledge. Such a document was certainly impossible in Egypt, where all real estate transactions had to be filed with the State registrar. Its validity in rabbinic tradition is given a biblical basis. It seems from the discussion in Babli <i>Bava batra</i> 10 that the use of “knotted” documents among Jews was mainly a Palestinian peculiarity (such documents have been found in the Judean desert.) In fact, it was a typically Greek form of document (cf. S. Lieberman, יװנית ויװנות בארץ ישראל Jerusalem 1962, p. 20 ff.)</i> one on its back.

Rebbi Ḥananiah ben Gamliel says, a knotted one whose witnesses signed inside<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Following the rules of open documents.</i> is valid since one can turn it into a simple one. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, everything follows local custom.

The same argument is stated in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 160b" href="/Bava_Batra.160b">Babli, 160b</a>.</i>”, that is the knotted [document]. “And the open,” that is the simple, part of the knotted<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The text of the document, whose formulation is identical whether sealed or public.</i>. “And the orders and the rules”; orders and rules differ between these, for one is with two [witnesses], the other with three<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A public document needs two witnesses, a sealed (knotted) one at least three.</i>; one in it, the other on its back<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A simple document is signed by the witnesses on the recto of the sheet, starting exactly one line after the end of the text.

Rebbi Idi in the name of Rebbi Jeremiah. The practice for a knotted one is the following. One writes the lender’s name, and the borrower’s name, the witnesses’ names, and the time. Then one knots it and repeats the text below<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, one folds the document and writes the main text a second time on the outside, followed by the witnesses’ signatures, and ties the document.

But should one not be afraid that maybe he falsifies<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">How can the witnesses be sure that the writer of the document will not falsify the document after they affixed their signatures?

Joḥanan holds that a predated bond is totally invalid; R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that it only counts from the time of signing, parallel to Rav Huna’s opinion here. As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Batra 10:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.10.10.1">Note 114</a> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.10.1.1"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 10:1 Note 2</a>), a bond creates a mortgage lien on behalf of the creditor which is not removed by sale of the property.
