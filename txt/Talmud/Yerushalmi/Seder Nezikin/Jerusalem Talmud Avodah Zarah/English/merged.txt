Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Within three days before Gentile holidays one is forbidden to trade with them, to lend them and to borrow from them, to give them loans and to ask them for loans, to pay debts to them and to accept payment from them<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to buy from an idolator or repay one’s debt because this provides him with money for his idolatrous celebration. It is forbidden to sell to him because he will buy things for his celebration. One may not lend him vessels or animals for he will use them for his celebration. One may not borrow from him because this will make him feel important.</i>. Rebbi Jehudah says, one may accept payment from them because this hurts him. They told him, even though it hurts him now he will enjoy it later<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The feeling that he got rid of his debts will make his idolatrous celebration more happy.</i>. Rebbi Ismael says, three days before and three days afterwards are forbidden but the Sages say, before their holidays it is forbidden, after their holidays it is permitted.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Within three days before Gentile holidays,” etc. Rebbi Ḥama bar Uqba understood all from here: <i>Bring your sacrifices in the morning, on the third day your tithes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Amos 4:4" href="/Amos.4.4"><i>Am</i>. 4:4</a>, speaking of the sinful service of the Golden Calf of Beth El.</i>.

What about this? There, they checked and found that they supplied their needs in one day and forbade them one day. But here<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In Palestine. The expression גָּלִיּוֹת usually means Babylonia; the plural does not imply that any of these restrictions were followed in Egypt or other parts of the Roman Empire.</i> they checked and found that they cover their needs in three days and forbade them three days.
How does Rebbi Yose uphold this verse, <i>bring your sacrifices in the morning</i>, etc<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since for him the Mishnah has no biblical basis; the cessation of commerce with idolators either is rabbinic or an old popular custom. The entire sermon is reproduced in <i>Yalqut Šim`oni Prophets</i>§542.</i>? The verse speaks about Jeroboam’s kingdom. When Jeroboam became king over Israel he started seducing Israel and said to them come, let us worship pagan worship. Pagan worship is lenient. This is what is written, <i>let us go against Jehudah, cut it down, break it up, and appoint a king in it, the man from Ṭabeal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Is</i>. 7:6. The tradition that Ṭabeal is a place rather than a personal name was accepted by the Medieval commentators of Prophets. According to Rashi the name is coded; one has to replace letter nby <i>n</i>+/-11; then טבאל becomes רַמְלֵא, a city founded after the Arab conquest.</i>. Rebbi Abba said, we checked all of Scripture but did not find a place named Ṭabeal. But it treats its worshippers well. The Torah said, <i>selected him from all of the tribes of Israel to be a priest for Me</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Samuel 2:28" href="/I_Samuel.2.28"><i>1S</i>. 2:28</a>.</i>.

The reason of the Northern Kingdom’s apostasy is traced to the cost and onerous rules of Torah practice.</i>. Rebbi Yudan, Rebbi Mattaniah’s father, said, the verse only serves to mention the shame of Israel. <i>The day of our king, the princes are sick from wine’s heat, he draws the mockers by his hand</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 4:5" href="/Hosea.4.5"><i>Hos</i>. 4:5</a>.</i>.

He told them, it is late in the evening; I am drunk and not drunk<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">He claimed that his mental faculties were slightly impaired.</i>. Everybody is drinking; but if you wish, go and come in the morning. That is what is written, <i>for their heart is like an oven while they are lying in ambush; all night long their baker is sleeping.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 4:6" href="/Hosea.4.6"><i>Hos</i>. 4:6</a>.</i> All night long their baker did not sleep. <i>In the morning he is burning like fire of a conflagration</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 4:6" href="/Hosea.4.6"><i>Hos</i>. 4:6</a>.</i>. In the morning they came to him. He told them, I do understand what you want but I am afraid of your Synhedrion lest they kill me. They told him, we shall kill them; this is what is written, <i>that all are glowing like an oven and eat their judges</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 4:7" href="/Hosea.4.7"><i>Hos.</i>4:7</a>. All of Talmudic literature assumes that the legal system imagined for late Hasmonean rule was that of the Davidic kingdom.</i>. Rebbi Levi said, they killed them, as is written, <i>if a corpse is found</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 21:1" href="/Deuteronomy.21.1"><i>Deut</i>. 21:1</a>.

Rebbi La said, they deposed them; <i>The day of our king, the princes are profaned from wine’s heat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14,</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 4:5" href="/Hosea.4.5"><i>Hos</i>. 4:5</a>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Deriving הֶחֱלוּ in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 4:5" href="/Hosea.4.5"><i>Hos</i>. 4:5</a> from חול “to be profane”.</i>; the day when princes were profaned. <i>From wine’s heat</i>, they were addicted to wine. <i>He draws the mockers by his hand</i>: When he saw a serious person he placed two scoffers next to him who asked him, which generation was preferred over all generations? He told them, the generation of the Exodus. But did they not practice pagan worship? He answered them, because they were beloved they were not punished. But they told him, be quiet for the king wants to do the same. Not only that, but they made one and this one made two. <i>He put the one up at Bethel; the other he gave to Dan</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 12:29" href="/I_Kings.12.29">1K. 12:29.</a></i>.
The haughtiness of Jeroboam damned him absolutely<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Jeroboam is the only person of those mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 11:5:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.11.5.5">Mishnah <i>Sanhedrin</i>11:2</a> as having no part in the Future World who is not rehabilitated in the Yerushalmi Halakhah. The following argument is reproduced in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 101b" href="/Sanhedrin.101b">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i>101b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Jacob said, Jeroboam became king at the end of a Sabbatical year. This refers to what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 31:11" href="/Deuteronomy.31.11"><i>Deut</i>. 31:11</a>.</i>, <i>at the end of seven years, at the time of the Sabbatical year, on the festival of Tabernacles, when all of Israel comes to appear before the Eternal, your God, at the place which He shall choose, you shall read this Torah in the presence of all of Israel to their ears.</i> He said, if I am asked to read<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">By tradition, on this occasion it is the king who has to read selected portions (Mishnah <i>Sotah</i>6:7). It is presumed that the same was true for the First Temple. There is no provision that two kings could read alternate portions, or if they did, the local king certainly would have precedence. The assertion of the book of Kings that there was a perpetual state of war between the Northern and the Southern kingdoms in the time of Jeroboam (<a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 15:6" href="/I_Kings.15.6"><i>1K</i>. 15:6</a>) is interpreted as a war of words conducted in the House of Study.<br>Another tradition (mentioned frequently but not undisputed) holds that nobody is allowed to sit in the Temple but a Davidic king (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 5:10:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.5.10.2-4"><i>Pesaḥim</i>5:10</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 3:2:2-7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.3.2.2-7"><i>Yoma</i>3:2</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:7:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.7.7.2-3"><i>Soṭah</i>7:7</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 101b" href="/Sanhedrin.101b">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i>101b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 40a" href="/Sotah.40a"><i>Soṭah</i>40a</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sotah 41a" href="/Sotah.41a">41a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 25a" href="/Yoma.25a"><i>Yoma</i>25a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 78a" href="/Kiddushin.78a"><i>Qiddušin</i>78a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tamid 27a" href="/Tamid.27a"><i>Tamid</i>27a</a>). If Yeroboam would have to stand while Rehabeam was sitting, an impossible situation would be created.</i>, I have to stand. They will say, the local king has precedence. But if I am reading as second, it is a shame for me. If I do not read, it is a disgrace for me. And if I let them go<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Letting the people go to Jerusalem while he remains at Sichem would emphasize the legitimacy of Rehabeam’s rule.</i>, they will ascend and desert me. They will go to Rehabeam, Solomon’s son. This is what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 12:26" href="/I_Kings.12.26"><i>1K</i>. 12:26</a>.</i>: <i>If this people would go up to sacrifice in the Temple in Jerusalem will this people’s heart return to their master, to Rehabeam</i>. What did he do? He made two golden calves and wrote on their hearts, “they will kill you.” He said, any king who will succeed me will look at them<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The king would see the words engraved on the calves and understand that their purpose was to prevent people from observing the assembly in Jerusalem which would undermine his rule.</i>. Rebbi Ḥuna said, <i>companions of ingenious conjurations</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 58:6" href="/Psalms.58.6"><i>Ps</i>. 58:6</a>.</i>. Anybody who joined with him he will make a coconspirator<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Correctly reading the first חבר in the verse from the root meaning “to connect” but the second from the homonym meaning “to conjure, to practice sorcery.” Since all kings of Israel adopted his institution of official worship at Bethel as long as that place existed, they became his co-conspirators.</i>. Rebbi Ḥuna said, <i>a slaughtering place deepened by seducers</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 5:2" href="/Hosea.5.2"><i>Hos</i>. 5:2</a>.</i>, for he deepened in crime. He said, anybody, I shall kill anybody who makes this public<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The reason for the worship of the calves was never made public. Therefore, the sin was the king’s only.</i>.
Rebbi Abin bar Cahana said, we find that Jeroboam also invented Sabbaths and holidays. That is what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 12:32-33" href="/I_Kings.12.32-33"><i>1K</i>. 12:32–33</a>.</i>: <i>Jeroboam made the holiday in the eighth month, on the fifteenth of the month, like the holiday in Jehudah, and went on the altar; so did he at Bethel to sacrifice … in the month which he invented</i>. “In addition to” is written<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Qere</i> is מִלִּיבּוּ “by his invention”; the <i>Ketib</i> is מִלְּבַד “in addition” (or “except”). This is read to mean that in addition to the holiday month which he invented, he invented something else. By comparing the expression used in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:38" href="/Leviticus.23.38"><i>Lev</i>. 23:38</a>, the “else” is found to be the Sabbath, justifying R. Abin bar Cahana’s statement. (Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bamidbar Rabbah 21:23" href="/Bamidbar_Rabbah.21.23"><i>Num. r</i>. 21:23</a>.)</i>, as you say, <i>in addition to the Sabbaths of the Eternal</i>.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 6b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.6b">Babli 6b</a>. While trade is forbidden, the proceeds of an illegal trade are not.</i>: If one transgressed and traded with him, it is permitted. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Yose, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Even on his holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Disputed by the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 6b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.6b">Babli 6b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Avodah Zarah 1:3" href="/Tosefta_Avodah_Zarah.1.3">Tosephta 1:9</a>.</i>. It was stated so:<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Avodah Zarah 2a:1:3" href="/Tosafot_on_Avodah_Zarah.2a.1.3">Tosaphot 2a, <i>s.v</i>. אסור</a>.</i> When was this said? About a Gentile whom he does not know. But with a Gentile of his acquaintance it is permitted since he is flattering him. It was stated: If one enters a town and finds them celebrating, he celebrates with them because he only is flattering them.
A <i>ducenarius</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Latin, “referring to 200”. If this describes an administrator, the reference is to an official such a prefect, procurator, receiving a salary of 200 <i>sestertia</i>(2’000 gold <i>denarii</i>), if a soldier, a commander of 200 men.</i> honored Rebbi Jehudah the Prince<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The grandson of Rebbi.</i> with a plate full of <i>denarii</i>. He took one of them and sent the remainder to him. He asked Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish who said, he shall bring the value to the Dead Sea<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">“Bringing something to the Dead Sea” means destroying it, since the Dead Sea corrodes and destroys all metal thrown into it. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 6b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.6b">Babli 6b</a>.</i>. But was he not an acquaintance and it was in the past? Rebbi Abbahu said, did not Rabban Gamliel ben Rebbi asked me, may one go to a fair<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This refers only to fairs which are in honor of some divinity. There is no limit to visits to government-organized fairs (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Avodah Zarah 1:3" href="/Tosefta_Avodah_Zarah.1.3">Tosephta 1:7</a>).</i>, and I forbade it to him, although it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Avodah Zarah 1:3" href="/Tosefta_Avodah_Zarah.1.3">Tosephta 1:8</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 13a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.13a">Babli 13a</a>.</i>: “one goes to fairs and buys there male and female slaves.” Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, not only Jewish slaves<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Circumcised slaves who were property of another Jew. This cannot refer to Jews sold as slaves since it is very meritorious to redeem Jews from slavery and does not need special permission.</i> but even Gentiles, because he brings them under the wings of the <i>Shekhina</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine Presence. Since the slave becomes a semi-Jew, in the words of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 13b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.13b">Babli (13b</a>) buying Gentile slaves “diminishes the number of idolators in the world.”</i>. What about this? Rabban Gamliel was a minor personality and Rebbi Abbahu desired to confine him<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">R. Abbahu did not want to abrogate the general permission for a meritorious intent to visit fairs dedicated to pagan divinities; he only thought that a public personality who probably would be unable to define the limits between per- mitted and forbidden intent should not give a bad example to the people.</i>. But Rebbi Judan the Prince was an important person and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish wanted to limit the matter<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">While trade is permitted, accepting gifts distributed by a pagan on his holiday essentially is forbidden even though the gift should be accepted to improve intercommunal peace.</i>.
One understands “to lend;” “to borrow” from them? Because he increases his reputation. One understands “to give them loans;” “to ask them for loans”? Because he increases his reputation. One understands “to pay debts to them;” “to accept payment from them”? That he should not say, his pagan worship had helped him<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 6b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.6b">Babli 6b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Abba bar Tevelai in the name of Rav: If it was a loan in danger of being lost it is permitted. It was stated thus: A loan in danger of being lost, by witnesses. A loan not in danger of being lost, by document<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 102a" href="/Bava_Kamma.102a">Babli <i>Bava qamma</i>102a</a>.</i>.

How is this? A loan not in danger of being lost, by pledge. A loan in danger of being lost, not by pledge. It was found following the former [opinion]: A loan in danger of being lost, by witnesses. A loan not in danger of being lost, by document.
There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Mo`ed qaṭan</i>1:5 (in the Mishnah editions, 1:7.) Babli <i>Mo`ed qaṭan</i>9b.</i>: “Rebbi Jehudah says, a woman should not apply lime because it disfigures her<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">On the semi-holidays which are the intermediate days of the Passover and Tabernacles holidays, one should not do what one can do before the holiday. Therefore one cannot get a haircut on the holidays and men cannot trim their beards. Rebbi Jehudah holds that a woman cannot get a beauty treatment in the form of a face mask of lime which will remove all facial hair and will make her cheeks more red by increased blood circulation. Since his name is attached to this prohibition while the others are stated anonymously it follows that the majority of the Sages hold that a woman can get such a treatment at any time.<br>It would seem that one should write נִיבּוּל as <i>pi`el</i> but since the Babli consistently has ניוול they must have heard the Galileans pronounce the word with a soft ב (which does not exclude that Galilean בּ also was pronounced <i>v</i>; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 2:4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.2.4.5"><i>Berakhot</i>2:4 Note 167</a>.)</i>.” Rebbi Ḥanina and Rebbi Mana. One said, they disagreed about lime which she removed on the holiday, but lime which she removes after the holiday is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Even for the Sages. While it is forbidden to marry on a holiday since the joy of holidays should not be mixed with the joy of marriage, a girl certainly can get engaged to be married on a holiday. The beauty treatment described was applied mainly to single girls to make them more marriageable. A treatment which terminates only after the holiday is a misuse of holiday time.</i>. But the other says, they disagreed about lime which she removes after the holiday. But lime which she removes during the holiday is permitted. We did not know who said what. From what R. Ḥanina, Rebbi Yose said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Jehudah is consistent. Just as Rebbi Jehudah said there, temporary disfiguration is disfiguration, so he says here<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In our Mishnah where he holds that the temporary pain the Gentile feels when repaying his debt is sufficient to wave the prohibition of commerce.</i>, temporary pain is pain. This implies that they disagreed about lime which she removed on the holiday, but lime which she removes after the holiday is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This therefore is not only R. Ḥanina’s opinion but stated practice.</i>.

This refers to the Red Cow (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19" href="/Numbers.19"><i>Num</i>. 19</a>) whose ashes are needed to cleanse people from the impurity of the dead. The Cow is not a Temple sacrifice; how far the restrictions imposed on sacrificial animals and the officiating priests apply to the Cow and its officiants are old matters of dispute between Sadducees and Pharisees (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Parah 3:3" href="/Mishnah_Parah.3.3">Mishnah <i>Parah</i>3:3</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Parah 3:7" href="/Mishnah_Parah.3.7">7</a>) and among the rabbis themselves. One of the biblical requirements is that the Red Cow never carried a yoke (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19:2" href="/Numbers.19.2"><i>Num</i>. 19:2</a>). In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Parah 2:1" href="/Mishnah_Parah.2.1">Mishnah <i>Parah</i>2:1</a>, a first statement of R. Eliezer validates a pregnant Red Cow for the ceremonies; the reason is explained in Mishnah 4 by his student’s R. Illai’s son R. Jehudah, that a bull mounting the Cow on his own cannot be considered making her carrying anything; only copulation by human intervention makes the ox the equivalent of a yoke. The majority rejects the ruling; it considers the Cow and its fetus as two separate beings but v. 19:3 requires the Cow alone to be taken. These restrictions do not apply to ordinary sacrifices. R. Eliezer then forbids buying a Red Cow from Gentiles since a sodomized animal is unfit for the altar; the Sages disagree since without reason one does not suspect that such a thing happened; this would make the Mishnah here unreasonable. (The last generation R. Yose bar Abun even introduces buying a Red Cow from a Gentile into a story about R. Eliezer; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 1:1:22" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.1.1.22"><i>Peah</i>1:1 Notes 99</a> ff., <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:7:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.7.5"><i>Qiddušin</i>1:7 Notes 607</a> ff.) <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 23a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.23a">Babli 23a</a>.</i>” Rebbi Jonah asked, why do we not explain it according to everybody, following what Rebbi Eleazar said in the name of Rav: Even one who says it is permitted to sell [says] it is forbidden to leave alone<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">One may not leave the animal alone with a Gentile. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 1:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.1.6.2">Chapter 1:6, Note 165</a>.

Explain it following Rebbi Eliezer, since Rebbi Eliezer said “it may not be bought from Gentiles.” They wanted to say, where do Rebbi Eliezer and the rabbis disagree?

The question arises whether R. Eliezer will agree with this or not. The assumption here is that R. Eliezer will agree that sacrifices can be bought from Gentiles but not the Red Cow, whose ceremonies in pharisaic theory were made with many non-scriptural restrictions because of an important difference with Sadducees in matters of ritual purity (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Parah 3:7" href="/Mishnah_Parah.3.7">Mishnah <i>Parah</i>3:7</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Parah 3:8" href="/Mishnah_Parah.3.8">8</a>).</i>” But since the rabbis answer to Rebbi Eliezer <i>all sheep of Qedar will be assembled for you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 60:7" href="/Isaiah.60.7"><i>Is.</i>60:7</a>.

The same argument is quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 24a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.24a">Babli 24a</a>.</i>, this says that Rebbi Eliezer disagrees about everything.

In the preceding paragraph it was established that the Jew’s wine stored with the Gentile under certain conditions remains permitted for usufruct. Then the question is why wine does not follow the rules of produce, that if stored by the Gentile it follows the rules of Gentile produce. While for grain this implies release from the obligations of heave and tithes, for wine it should imply prohibition of all usufruct. The answer is given in the next paragraph (having no parallel in the Babli) that the person who frees grain from heave and tithes forbids wine stored with the Gentile for usufruct.</i>.

This implies that usufruct of pagan worship is forbidden, usufruct of heave is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Since usufruct of pagan wine is forbidden, the rules of declaring an amount as insignificant do not apply; the most minute amount makes the entire product forbidden whereas less than ½% of heave in food leaves it permitted for everybody.</i>.

Jehudah permits since he improves it.” But some people do not want to drink alcohol-free cooked wine. The problem really is whether the vintner is permitted to cook his wine before he gave heave since (a) with the diminution in volume of the wine he diminishes the volume of heave to be taken and (b) not every Cohen may be willing to accept cooked heave wine.</i>. We do not know who said what. Since Rebbi Joḥanan said, Rebbi Jehudah inverted his reasoning but Rebbi Eleazar said, it was not inverted, there for the Cohen, here for the owners, it follows that Rebbi Joḥanan said because he reduces the number of drinkers.

Halakhah 7

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rebbi Jehudah said, Rebbi Ismael asked Rebbi Joshua when they were walking on a road, why did they forbid Gentiles’ cheeses<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">They were forbidden in Mishnah 6 for all usufruct without any obvious reason.</i>? He told him, because they make them with stomach of cadaver<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">The rennet is taken from the stomach contents of cattle killed by Gentiles and therefore automatically have the status of cadavers. Since the rennet causes the milk to curdle, its addition cannot be said to be insignificant. Therefore one understands that the cheeses are forbidden as food. Since the rennet is produced from an animal and cheese (including kosher cheese made by Jews) is made by cooking milk with rennet, it could be forbidden for all usufruct as meat cooked in milk following R. Simeon ben Ioḥai (<i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael Masekhta deKaspa</i>20).</i>. He answered him, is not the stomach of an elevation offering<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">An elevation offering is burned completely on the altar.

Eating from a cadaver is a simple infraction which requires no sacrifice; eating from an animal dedicated as elevation sacrifice is both an infraction and larceny requiring a sacrifice.</i> more serious than the stomach of a cadaver and they said, a Cohen who is not repulsed may burn it raw<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">The Cohen may eat the stomach contents raw since they are considered excrement; the rennet therefore cannot be considered meat and the Gentile’s cheese should be permitted even as food! For the expression “to burn” for “to slurp” see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 2:7:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.2.7.7">Note 321</a>.</i>; they did not agree to this but said one has no usufruct<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">While the previous statement is essentially correct there is a (customary or rabbinic) rule that it would not be decorous to do so; one refrains from using any part of the animal (except the hide given to the priests, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:8" href="/Leviticus.7.8"><i>Lev</i>. 7:8</a>) as a practical rule.</i> but does not commit larceny<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">As a rule of biblical law.

Since the Song is read as a dialogue between God (m.) and Israel (f.), the theological interpretation depends on the vocalization which was not directly expressible before the invention of vowel signs. The interpretation given in the Halakhah requires the identification of דּוֹדִים as “friends, lovers” rather than “friendship, love.”</i>? He<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">R. Ismael.</i> told him, <i>for your (f.) friendship is better</i>. He<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joshua.</i> answered, it is not so since the next verse implies it, <i>by the scent of your (m.) good oils</i><sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Song of Songs 1:3" href="/Song_of_Songs.1.3"><i>Cant</i>. 1:3</a>. As in most cases, the proof is from the part of the verse not quoted. The verse ends: <i>therefore girls love you</i>. Since the Song of Songs clearly celebrates heterosexual love, the speaker must be a female addressing a male.<br>The following interpretation of the Mishnah follows S. Naeh [שלמה נאה, טובים דודיך מיין, מבט חדש על משנת ע״ז ב:ה; מחקרים בתלמוד ובמדרש, ספר זכרון לתירצה ליפשיץ, י-ם 2005 ע' 434-411.]. There are two problems. What is the relationship of the Mishnah 7 and the first part of Mishnah 8 to the second part of Mishnah 8? Also the discussion in Mishnah 8 does not seem to make sense. Since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Song of Songs 1:2" href="/Song_of_Songs.1.2"><i>Cant</i>. 1:2</a> starts: <i>May he kiss me with kisses of his mouth</i>, it should be clear that the speaker is the female. Why should R. Ismael, who everywhere else requires that a verse be interpreted according to its plain sense, suddenly switch speakers in middle sentence? Why does R. Joshua refer to 1:3, when a referral to 1:2 would be more appropriate? The unvocalized text of 1:2–3 has a chiastic structure: It starts clearly with the masculine, has a middle section which could be read in the masculine or the feminine, and ends again with the masculine.<br>R. Ismael proves convincingly that there is no biblical basis for the prohibition of Gentile cheese; it is purely rabbinical. It can be regarded as a “fence around the law” only with regard to the prohibition of intermarriage, since it is designed to make social intercourse between Jews and Gentiles as difficult as possible. Then the question arises as to the status of the much more important prohibitions oil and wine. The prohibition of oil clearly is rabbinical even though it is mentioned as particularly meritorious in <i>Daniel</i>; no reason could be found in dietary laws to prohibit Gentile cold pressed virgin olive oil. While wine actually used for pagan libations is biblically forbidden, the extension of the prohibition to almost any wine moved in any way by a Gentile, even one adhering to a faith not practicing libations (or even prohibiting the drinking of wine), must be considered rabbinical. Now wine in mentioned in v. 1:2 and oil in v. 1:3. The discussion between Rabbis Ismael and Joshua is about the status of the prohibitions of wine and oil.<br>As mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 2:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.2.7.1">Note 306</a>, any rabbinic reference to the Song of Songs unquestionably reads sentences put into the mouth of the female as coming from the congregation of Israel (as represented by its rabbinical leaders) and that of the male as referring to God. R. Joshua asks R. Ismael about his opinion about the actual rules referring to Gentile wine. The latter, by putting the reference to wine in the mouth of the male, asserts that the prohibition of Gentile wine essentially is God’s decree, is biblical. R. Joshua, the overriding authority, informs him that the references to wine and oil have equal status; since the prohibition of oil in almost all cases has no pentateuchal basis, the prohibition of wine also in almost all cases is purely rabbinical (Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 5:4:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.5.4.6">Halakhah 5:4, Note 67</a>).</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Rebbi Jehudah said, Rebbi Ismael asked Rebbi Joshua,” etc. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Because [most]<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Added from the Genizah text, necessary for syntactic reasons.</i> calves there<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">This shows that the Mishnah underlying this Halakhah is not the one given in the separate Mishnah in the Yerushalmi but the one found in the Babli and Maimonides: R.

Rebbi Joḥanan heard this and said, my teacher taught us well, since if one slaughters for pagan worship even its excrement is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore even R.

Rebbi Yose said, a ring is recognizable<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">It never was part of the animal and did not become forbidden by its slaughter for idolatry.</i>; excrement is part of its body.
<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">For this paragraph there exist two additional witnesses, the Leiden ms. in <i>Beṣah</i>1:1 (60a ll. 39–54, <b>ב</b>) and a Genizah text (<i>Yerushalmi Fragments</i>, pp. 156–157, <b>בּ</b>) of the same. The source clearly is the <i>Beṣah</i> text even though the argument is from <i>Avodah zarah</i> and the reference to <i>Beṣah</i> is a side remark.<br>“Gentile’s stomach content” naturally means “stomach content of animal slaughtered by a Gentile.”</i> Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: At first they were saying, one curdles neither with the stomach content of the carcass<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">An animal which was not slaughtered following the rules of ritual slaughter. whose flesh therefore is forbidden as meat.</i> nor with the stomach contents of the Gentile. They changed to say, one curdles with the stomach content of the carcass but not with the stomach contents of the Gentile. Rebbi Abba bar Zavda, Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac asked: Does this negate the declaration of Rebbi Eliezer, since Rebbi Eliezer said, the thoughts of the Non-Jew are about pagan worship<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Beṣah</i> text seems better: Does this (i. e., the prohibition of Gentile rennet) follow R. Eliezer (whom practice does not follow in general) since it treats Gentile rennet as more problematic than the one derived from a carcass? Since here practice is said to follow R. Eliezer, the tradition seems questionable; one has to search for parallel traditions either to confirm or to reject.</i>? Rebbi (Assi) [Yasa]<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian form of the name (in parentheses) has to be deleted in favor of the Galilean form used in the three parallel sources [in brackets].</i> came in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Originally, they said, one does curdle [neither]<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">To be added by the unanimous testimony of the other three sources and the later arguments.</i> with carcass stomach contents nor with Gentile’s stomach contents. They changed to say, one does curdle with carcass stomach contents and with Gentile’s stomach contents. The language of a <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Stomach contents of a Gentile or a carcass is forbidden following the original teaching. (The stomach contents of a torn animal which suckled from a qualified one are permitted following the later teaching; the stomach contents of a qualified animal which suckled from a torn one are forbidden following the later teaching.) [The stomach contents of a qualified animal which suckled from a torn one are forbidden following the former teaching, and the stomach contents of a torn animal which suckled from a qualified one are permitted following the later teaching.]<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">The ms. text (in parentheses) is inconsistent. It has to be replaced by the text of the other three sources [in brackets] which is consistent with R. Joḥanan’s statement in both versions since for dietary laws a “torn” animal has the same status as a carcass.<br>A “torn” animal is one of which a vital organ is impaired or defective, the most common one being tuberculous lesions of the lung. If a cow is known to suffer from a defect which makes it “torn”, its milk is forbidden as drink but as stomach contents it becomes excrement and is no longer forbidden. (Karaites deny the existence of internal <i>ṭerefa</i> and prohibit as torn only the victims of predator attacks as described by the verse, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:30" href="/Exodus.22.30"><i>Ex.</i>22:30</a>.)</i> And even if the House of Shammai would argue like the House of Hillel in the first teaching, an egg is a growth of its body; the contents of the stomach come from the outside<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">This now connects the discussion with <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 1:1:2-10:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Beitzah.1.1.2-10.3">Mishnah <i>Beṣah</i>1:1</a> which states that the House of Shammai permit the use on the holiday of an egg laid on that day while the House of Hillel forbid it. The problem is to understand the position of the House of Hillel since the preparation of food is permitted on a holiday (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:16" href="/Exodus.12.16"><i>Ex</i>. 12:16</a>). According to the Babli and one opinion in the Yerushalmi the prohibition applies only to eggs laid by chickens raised to produce eggs. Then the mother was not food at the start of the holiday. While the egg is food according to everybody, for the House of Hillel it cannot change its character from non-food to food on the holiday. Then the question is raised why milk which is prohibited as food before being ingested by a ruminant becomes permitted by the animal’s stomach. In this question, the revised ruling in matters of rennet would agree with the stance of the House of Shammai. But the answer is that the two cases cannot be compared; the stomach contents of an animal never were part of the animal and do not have the latter’s status.</i>. It parallels what Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It happened to the son[s]<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">The plural is attested to in the three parallel sources and required by the context.</i> of (Rebbi) Jehudah ben Shamua<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">The parallels unanimously state the name as Jehudah ben Shemu`ai without a rabbinic title.</i> that wolves tore more than 300 of their flock. The case came before the Sages who permitted their stomach contents<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">The latter teaching which permits rennet from animals prohibited as meat is confirmed by a ruling in an actual case.</i>.

Rebbi Ismael stated: In the Torah there are forbidden matters and permitted matters. There are easy parts and severe parts.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are three houses. A house which one built originally for idolatry is forbidden. If he whitewashed it or ornamented it for idolatry and renovated, one removes what he renovated. If he introduced there an idol and removed it, it is permitted.

But in fumigating the burning itself is the valuable act and is forbidden. R. Eliezer permits to bring the profit to the Dead Sea as long as it is not clear that the action was forbidden.

As explained in <i>Sanhedrin</i>, a criminal conviction in rabbinic theory is possible only if criminal intent was proven by the testimony of two eye witnesses that the perpetrator had duly been warned of the criminal nature of his intended act.

Rebbi Abba did not say so, but if the cistern became libation wine, the flow did not become libation wine; if the flow became libation wine the cistern became libation wine. What Rav Huna said in the name of Rav, the jet is like the cistern, for Rav Huna is of the opinion, just as the cistern becomes libation wine so the jet becomes libation wine. There, they say in the name of Rav, the touch of a Gentile makes libation wine. Rav Naḥman bar Jacob said, only when it is flowing<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">A libation consists of shaking the wine as an homage to the gods.

An Aramean fell into a cavity.

This does not make any sense here. The word is Arabic <b>زلف</b> “to approach, advance toward”. One brings baskets or mats of willow weave and approaches his arms from below so that his hands are in the air above the wine and cannot move the wine.</i>.
Simeon bar Ḥiyya was instructing Ḥiyya bar Rav.

May a Gentile make libation wine with his mouth? Rebbi Ada in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: A Gentile cannot make libation wine with his mouth. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: A Gentile can make libation wine with his mouth.

Halakhah 9

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One may stamp with a Non-Jew in the wine press<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">The grapes are pressed not by a mechanical device but by people stamping on a wooden plank on top of the grapes. All the wine produced is libation wine forbidden for all usufruct. Therefore one could think that a Jew would be forbidden to receive wages for pressing the grapes. But it was explained in the preceding Halakhah that the grape juice turns into wine only by flowing into the cistern below the press. Therefore the Jew may receive wages for pressing the grapes whose juice will not be forbidden at the moment of pressing.</i> but one may not harvest with him<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">This Tanna is of the opinion that it is forbidden to cause impurity to fruits of the Holy Land. Since the grapes become impure by being handled by the Non-Jew, a Jewish agricultural worker observing the rules of purity may not help in the Non-Jew’s harvest (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.1"><i>Berakhot</i>1:1, Note 3</a> and <i>Introduction to Tractate Demay</i> p. 349–350).</i>. With a Jew who works in impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Working at a time when it was still possible to follow the rules of impurity, a Jew making his wine in impurity was a sinner since he caused his heave and tithes (which are biblical obligations for grain, olive oil, and grape wine) to be impure and therefore forbidden to be consumed by the Cohen. Grapes harvested for wine making are placed in a vat for transport to the wine press. The fluid oozing out of injured grape berries are collected in the vat and also used for making wine. This fluid is welcome; therefore it prepares the grapes for impurity as explained in <i>Demay</i>2:3 Notes 136,137, 141. An observant Jew harvesting together with an unobservant one is guilty of helping to cause impurity to fruits of the Land. There really is no intrinsic reason to forbid pressing the grapes which already are impure; the prohibition to help in pressing is a general rule “not to support sinners”.</i> one neither stamps nor harvests with him but one transports with him amphoras to the wine press and brings with him from the wine press<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Transporting empty amphoras to the wine press is not connected with any impropriety; it is not even forbidden to fill impure wine into pure amphoras which thereby will become impure. Transporting amphoras filled with impure wine from the wine press is permitted since all forbidden action was in the past.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One may stamp with a Non-Jew in the wine press,” etc. Rebbi Jonah said, that is, you say only if they walked over it crosswise<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Since Gentiles are considered impure under the rules of a sufferer from gonorrhea (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 36b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.36b">Babli 36b</a>), the moment a Gentile steps on the planks on top of the grapes everything is impure by “stepping on” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 3:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.3.6.2">Chapter 3:8, Note 181</a>). It is not really necessary that the Gentile walk on the plank in two different directions. Since then the entire contents of the wine press are impure: the Jew does not help to make them impure.</i>. But if they did not walk over it crosswise, it does not apply. Rebbi Yose asked, if they walked over it crosswise, even following the earlier teaching<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">There seems to be no reason for R. Jonah’s rule since the entire harvest becomes impure at harvest time, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 4:9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.4.9.1">Note 132</a>. There never should be any reason not to press grapes with a Gentile.</i>? As it was stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Avodah Zarah 8:1" href="/Tosefta_Avodah_Zarah.8.1">Tosephta 7:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 55b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.55b">Babli 55b</a>.</i> “Originally they were saying that one harvests grapes with the Non-Jew and stamps with a Jew who works in impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">In both sources, one reads: “Originally they were saying that one <i>does not</i> harvest grapes with the Non-Jew and <i>does not</i> stamp with a Jew who works in impurity.” This text must be supposed also for the quote here. If one holds that it is forbidden to cause impurity to the fruits of the Land then one may not harvest with the Gentile because this is the moment when the grapes become impure.</i>. They changed and said, one does not harvest grapes with the Non-Jew nor stamp with a Jew who works in impurity, but one stamps with a Gentile and helps him as long as it did not disappear from sight. Once it disappeared from sight it became libation wine<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The second part of this <i>baraita</i> parallels the Mishnah; it is missing in the Tosephta. In the Babli text it reads “one <i>does not</i> stamp with the Non-Jew”; this is explained as a precaution because if the Gentile has a small harvest and decided to make red wine by leaving the skins in the fluid, the easiest way would be to plug the pipe leading to the cistern and use the press itself to let the wine ferment. Then the act of pressing makes libation wine and the Jew’s wages would be forbidden for usufruct. The Yerushalmi very reasonably does not consider this a possibility.</i>”.
What is Rebbi Jonah’s reason? Because it already became impure when it was prepared by the grape harvest<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">As explained before, this is R. Yose’s argument.</i>. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? They were pure by biblical standards. You are the one who decided that they be impure<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">This is R. Jonah’s argument. There is no biblical impurity for Gentiles; the laws of impurity are uniquely formulated for Jews. The imputation of impurity (permanent and irrevocable) for Gentiles is rabbinical (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 36b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.36b">Babli 36b</a>). The exclusion of Gentiles from the Temple precinct is not because of impurity but because of their being disqualified.</i>. The strength of Rebbi Yose is the following, as Rebbi Yose said in the name of Rebbi Hila<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The source of this statement (in another context) is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Challah 3:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.3.2.2"><i>Ḥallah</i>3:2, Note 53</a>.</i> It should be logical that one may (free)<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">This text makes no sense either by itself nor in this context. <i>Ṭevel</i> is produce under the obligation of heave from which heave was not yet taken; it may not be consumed. By all standards a person is not only permitted but obligated to free his <i>ṭevel</i> by separating the heave. The text in <i>Ḥallah</i> correctly reads: “a person may make his <i>ṭevel</i> impure by biblical standards.” The main point of the argument is given there but omitted here. Heave not only must be consumed in purity but it is stated in Num. 18:8 that the priests have a special duty to guard heave from impurity. It follows that this duty does not apply to <i>ṭevel</i>, which therefore may be allowed to become impure; disagreeing with the hypothesis underlying the Mishnah.<br> The quote here refers to a different subject. Heave given to Aaron in his quality of priest is pure heave for which he can exercise his duty to watch it and consume it in purity. But once produce has incurred even a doubt of impurity it can no longer be consumed by the Cohen; this eliminates not only the duty of guarding it but all rules made to safeguard it. If the rules of purity no longer can be observed there remain no restrictions on harvesting and pressing grapes with a Gentile.</i> his <i>ṭevel</i> as it is written, <i>you should give from it the Eternal’s heave to Aaron the priest</i><sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:27" href="/Numbers.18.27"><i>Num</i>. 18:27</a>.</i>. You have to give it to Aaron in his quality of priest. But here, since you cannot give it to Aaron the priest in his quality of priest, you may make it impure.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody hires a worker to work for him on libation wine, his wages are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">If a Gentile hires a Jewish worker specifically to work on his wine, the wages are forbidden to the worker for all usufruct. The rule which makes it impossible for the Jewish worker to be hired in this way is purely rabbinical; it is not implied by the fact that libation wine is forbidden for usufruct for a Jewish owner.</i>. If he hired him for other work, even though he told him, transport an amphora of libation wine for me from one place to another, his wages are permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The moment that libation wine was not mentioned at the time of the hiring, there is no obligation on the worker to refrain from being occupied with libation wine.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody hires a worker,” etc. Does he not give him his wages? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: They fined him a fine<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A customary restriction without justification in law.</i>.

And what Rebbi Joḥanan taught those of the House of Rebbi Yannai that they should not accept in their hands<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">While the paragraph in general looks like a bad copy of the one in <i>Ševi`it,</i> the reading בידיהן “in their hands” is superior to the reading בדיהן “of their olive presses” of both <i>Ševi`it</i> mss. There is no question why one should be paid in wine for using an olive press.</i> wine as wages but money, he taught them following Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Neḥemiah<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Who in <i>Ševi`it</i>(8:4 Note 69, Tosephta 6:21) forbid to pay for anything, even for food, with sabbatical produce.</i>. Rebbi Ilai said, this <i>baraita</i> deals with idolatrous produce<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This reading is quite impossible; idolatrous produce does not exist. In <i>Ševi`it</i>: “forbidden produce”, stored sabbatical produce at a time when wild animals no longer can find produce on the fields, which has to be consumed immediately.</i>. As Rebbi Abbahu said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, in matters of libation wine they fined him a fine.
If he transported for him amphora against amphora<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The language is not clear and the proposed interpretations are unfounded. It seems that the worker is not paid as a worker for his time but as a contractor by the piece, and is not paid in money but receives an (empty) amphora.<br>In the entire paragraph it is equally possible not to read the sentences as apodictic statements but as questions.

If he worked for him for goodwill, do you impound his property in the value of his wages?
If he worked for him half a day in prohibition and half a day in permission. If he was selling profane [food] and Second Tithe together, [the buyer] has the choice of treating as profane what he chooses and as Second Tithe what he chooses<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is not found in any parallel source but no opposing opinion is noted. While it is necessary to “give a name” to the Second Tithe due for a harvest, it is not necessary bodily to separate it from the remainder of the harvest. If the farmer does not intend to bring his tithe bodily to Jerusalem, he may sell it and transfer its sanctity to the money. The buyer then has to separate tithe from profane food but is not restricted in his choice; cf. Introduction to Tractate <i>Ma`aser Šeni</i>.</i>. Is this the same here? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ševi`it</i>8:4 Note 65. In the first case the worker is hired as a contractor, in the second as a worker who has to be paid for his time.</i>. If somebody hires a worker to bring wine to a sick person; if he delivered [the employer] has to pay him, otherwise he does not have to pay him. But if he told him, wine for a sick person from place X, an apple for a sick person from place X, whether or not he delivered he has to pay him, for he pays the wages of his feet. And here, does he not pay the wages of his feet<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">There is no reason to impound the wages for the time he worked in a permitted way.</i>?
Rebbi Jeremiah asked, if he hired him to break amphoras of libation wine; is it forbidden anyhow<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 63b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.63b">Babli 63b</a> the question was asked by Amoraim of the second generation and answered in the negative.</i>?
Assi said, the proceeds of libation wine in the hands of a Gentile are prohibited<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">They are not forbidden to the Gentile, only to a Jew who knows that this money was received as payment for wine whose usufruct is forbidden to Jews. From the argument in the text it seems possible that one should read; “Assi said, the proceeds of libation wine in the hands of a Gentile and the proceeds of an idol in the hand of a Gentile, Rebbi Jonathan said it is permitted, Rebbi Joḥanan said it is prohibited”, since in the proof texts wine and idols are always treated in parallel. On the other hand, the preceding text (Notes 11–12) notes that the prohibition of wine, a purely rabbinic custom, follows much stricter rules than the biblical prohibition of idols.</i>. The proceeds of an idol in the hand of a Gentile, Rebbi Jonathan said it is permitted, Rebbi Joḥanan said it is prohibited. A <i>baraita</i> supports one and a <i>baraita</i> supports the other. A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan: “A Gentile who owed money to a Jew should not tell him, wait until I sell libation wine, until I sell an idol, and I shall give it to you. I am saying, maybe he exchanged.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 64a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.64a">Babli 64a</a>. If the Gentile tells the Jew that he gives him money received for forbidden wine or idols, the Jew may not accept since we must assume that the Gentile tells the truth. In the Babli’s tradition, this is accepted by everybody; in the Yerushalmi this is particular to R. Joḥanan.</i>” A <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Jonathan: “A Gentile who owes money to a Jew may sell libation wine and give to him, an idol and give to him. Because of the bad impression?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This is read as meaning that in all cases the Jew may accept the money and does not have to worry that people will say that he accepts idol money. The Babli would interpret the <i>baraita</i> as stating that the Jew may accept the money as long as the Gentile does not explicitly declare it as idol’s proceeds.</i>”
<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The entire paragraph has a parallel in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 54b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.54b">Babli, 54b</a>.

Rebbi Ḥanina said, a disagreement between Rebbi Ismael and the rabbis. Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose said, forbidden. But the rabbis say, permitted.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If libation wine fell on grapes, one should wash it off and they are permitted; but if they were split they are forbidden.

This is the principle: Anything where the taste improves the use is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">If the taste of the forbidden wine improves the taste of the food on which it fell.</i>; anything where the taste does not improve its use is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">If the spill was accidental, it is not necessary that the wine actually diminish the value or enjoyment of the food on which it fell.</i>, such as vinegar on broken beans<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In the Halakhah both here and in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 67a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.67a">Babli (67a</a>) R. Joḥanan restricts this to wine falling on a dish of hot broken beans or peas.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If libation wine fell on grapes,” etc. Our Mishnah if their seal is not loosened. But if their seal was loosened they are as injured<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Grapes which still sit on the vine with intact skin are sealed; if libation wine falls on them one washes the bunch and it is permitted.

How do you treat them<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">What is the reason that injured grapes on which libation wine fell are forbidden?</i>? Like wine in wine or wine in a dish<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">If wine of one kind is mixed with wine of another type, for wine cognoscenti this definitely is spoilage.

<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is an intrusion here; it should be placed at the end of the Halakhah since it refers to the last statement in the Mishnah, forbidden vinegar on broken beans.

Ḥiyya the Babylonian to be careful if he quotes <i>Is</i> 8:17, “I am waiting (וְחִכִּיתִי) for the Eternal”, not to blaspheme by saying “I am hitting (וְהִכִּיתִי).” Now שְׁחַלַיִים are watercresses, not making sense for the context. The root שהל is not documented in Hebrew or any of the Talmudic Aramaic dialects; but one of the many meanings of Arabic سمل is “to purge, to act as laxative.” This is taken as the meaning here. It cannot be determined whether the word was pronounced with שׁ or שׂ, even though שׁ is more likely.</i>. If it was hot and one cooled it down? Then even hot it should be forbidden since usually it cools down<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">An implied answer to this question is found in the Babli: Vinegar in the cold dish improves the taste and therefore makes it forbidden.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A Non-Jew who with a Jew was transporting wine jugs from one place to another, if it can be presumed to be watched it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Jew transports kosher wine and hires a Gentile as help.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A Non-Jew who was transporting,” etc. Rebbi Samuel said, it happened that a Non-Jew was transporting wine jugs with a Jew from one place to another.

You may be of the opinion that Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel’s statement was a leniency, but rather it is a stringency. For the opening of the rabbis leaves little of the cover<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">While Rabban Simeon requires time for the cover to dry, he envisages the possibility that the Gentile drill a small hole in the cover, whereas the rabbis only contemplate the removal of most of the old cover.</i>.

Ismael Mišpatim</i> 10) it is agreed that it is obvious that a stoned animal was not ritually slaughtered and therefore is forbidden as meat but it is noted that the prohibition as food is necessary anyhow to show that if the ox was ritually slaughtered after conviction by the court, the slaughter is ineffective and does not permit the carcass to be eaten. Everybody agrees that if the ox was correctly slaughtered before a trial could be held the meat is kosher. The Babli has to find the prohibition of usufruct in another part of the verse which makes the prohibition one of rabbinic interpretation rather than biblical.<br>Louis Ginzberg in his <i>Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah</i> (New York 1909) p. 280 has published a leaf of selections from the entire tractate. The passage referring to the paragraph under discussion reads there (vocalization added):<br>וְשׁוֹר הַנִּסְקָל. סָקֹ֨ל יִסָּקֵ֜ל הַשּׁ֗וֹר וג׳ מִמַּשְׁמַע שנ׳ סָקוֹל יִסָּקֵל וְכִי אֵין אָנוּ יוֹדְעִין לֹא יֵאָכֵל. מַה תַלְמוּד לוֹמַר לֹא יֵֽאָכֵל֙. אֶלָּא שֶׁהוּא אָסוּר בַּאֲכִילָה וְאַסוּר בַּהֲנָייָה. ר׳ אַבָּ׳ בְשֶׁם ר׳ יוֹחָנָן כָּל־מָקוֹם שנ׳ לֹא יֵאָכֵל לֹא תֹאכְלוּ … אִסוּר<br>And an ox which was stoned. <i>The ox should certainly be stoned</i>. From the meaning of what was said, <i>shall certainly be stoned</i> would we not know that it cannot be eaten? Why does the verse say, <i>it shall not be eaten</i>? But that it is forbidden for eating and forbidden for usufruct. Rebbi Abba[hu] in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Any place where it says <i>shall not be eaten, you shall not eat</i> [it is forbidden for eating and forbidden for usufruct.]<br>The addition to the text is from `<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Orlah 3:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Orlah.3.1.3"><i>Orlah</i> 3:1 (Note 10</a>) or <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 2:1:2-16" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.2.1.2-16"><i>Pesaḥim</i> 2:1</a> l. 15.

And the calf whose neck was broken. <i>There, there</i>. Since <i>there</i> mentioned further describes a prohibition of usufruct, also <i>there</i> said here implies prohibition of usufruct<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 29b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.29b">Babli 29b</a>, <i>Sifry Deut</i>. 207.

And the birds of the sufferer from skin disease. <i>Any pure bird you may eat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:11" href="/Deuteronomy.14.11"><i>Deut</i>. 14:11</a>.</i>, this is the living bird. <i>But the following you may not eat of them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:12" href="/Deuteronomy.14.12"><i>Deut</i>. 14:12</a>.</i>, that is the slaughtered one<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifry Deut</i>. 103, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 57a" href="/Kiddushin.57a">Babli <i>Qiddušin</i> 57a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 82a" href="/Chullin.82a"><i>Ḥulin</i> 82a</a>. Since first it is said, <i>any pure bird you may eat</i>, which is immediately followed by <i>but the following you may not eat of them</i>, this implies that not only may one not eat the impure birds listed later but also some pure birds. Of the two pure birds used for the purification ceremony of the healed sufferer from skin disease, one is slaughtered (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:5" href="/Leviticus.14.5"><i>Lev</i>. 14:5</a>). The other is released (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:7" href="/Leviticus.14.7">v. 7</a>); since it is nor recognizable it cannot be forbidden to anybody who might catch it. Therefore the slaughtered bird must be the one pure bird which was correctly slaughtered and nevertheless is forbidden as food. The parallel sources also presuppose that the remains of the slaughtered bird, after its blood has benn used, is forbidden for usufruct but no explicit reason for that is given. One must assume that this is one of the cases where a prohibition as food implies prohibition of usufruct (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 5:12:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.5.12.3">Note 155</a>).</i>.

Since the only other case where the neck of a four-legged animal has to be broken is the atonement for an unsolved murder case, the rules of the latter have to be applied to the case where a rancher refuses to redeem the first born of his donkey. Since the rule has moral justification in the parallel sources, “he refused to give value to the Cohen; therefore value has to be denied him”, the rule has to be considered rabbinic rather than biblical.</i>.

Halakhah 14

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A wine press of stone which a Gentile had pitched one has to wipe dry<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">If the wine press is hewn into the local limestone, the walls of the vat under the press into which the pressed juice flows have to be made impermeable. If this is done by sealing with pitch, something has to be done that the pitch does not spoil the wine. The usual way of neutralizing the pitch was to wash it down with wine. The Yerushalmi does not specify how the wiping dry has to be done, probably because it was generally known, but the Halakhah implies that first everything has to be washed down with water for an extended period. The Babli specifies that in washing down an abrasive powder has to be used.</i> and it is pure. But one of wood, Rebbi said he shall wipe it dry but the Sages say he must remove the pitch<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Since wood is more absorbent than stone, a new insulation has to be applied.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A wine press of stone which a Gentile had pitched,” etc. Our Mishnah is Rebbi’s. “One of wood, Rebbi said he shall wipe it dry but the Sages say he must remove the pitch.” For pottery it is not following Rebbi, as it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 74b" href="/Avodah_Zarah.74b">Babli 74b</a>.
