Jerusalem Talmud Makkot



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How are plotting witnesses treated<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is one of the Ten Commandments not to testify falsely. In addition, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:16-20" href="/Deuteronomy.19.16-20"><i>Deut.</i> 19:16–20</a> prescribes that a “plotting” false witness has to be punished by the penalty which would have been imposed on his victim had his testimony been found true. By rabbinic definition, a “plotting” witness is one whose testimony not only is false but shown to be impossible, in that there are witnesses to the fact that he testified to be eye witness of a fact which he could not have seen since at the time it was supposed to have happened he was at another place (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 5:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.5.1.1"><i>Sanhedrin</i> Chapter 5, Note 3</a>). There are cases when plotting perjury is proven but the penalty cannot be imposed. Then the false witness must be punished for breaking the Eighth Commandment, which is the standard punishment decreed for breaking any prohibition for which the penalty was not specified, fixed in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:3" href="/Deuteronomy.25.3"><i>Deut</i>. 25:3</a> as at most 40 lashes (which, because the court marshal might err in his count, is limited to 39 lashes).<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Makkot 2b" href="/Makkot.2b">Babli (2b</a>) disagrees with this explanation; it classifies simple perjury as “actionless crime” for which no penalty is possible; this clearly is not the Yerushalmi’s position (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 4:8:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.4.8.4"><i>Ketubot</i> 4:4 Note 196</a>.)</i>? “We testify about this man that he is the son of a divorcee or a woman who had received <i>ḥalîṣah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The son of a Cohen from a woman he is prohibited from marrying (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:7" href="/Leviticus.21.7"><i>Lev</i>. 21:7</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:14" href="/Leviticus.21.14">14</a>) is desecrated; he cannot function as a priest and the priestly revenues are forbidden to him. The divorcee is biblically forbidden to the Cohen. The widow receiving <i>halîsah</i> from the former husband’s brother is forbidden rabbinically; her son is rabbinically desecrated, which for practical consequences does not make any difference.</i>” One does not say that he should be decreed to be the son of a divorcee or a woman who had received <i>ḥalîṣah</i> in his stead, but he is flogged 40 [lashes]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If the witness is not a Cohen, declaring him as son of a divorcee would not change his status at all. If he is a Cohen, declaring him as son of a divorcee would punish not only him but also his descendants, against the biblical text as explained in the Halakhah.</i>. “We testify about this man that he is obligated to go into exile<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The unintentional homicide (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 35:9-34" href="/Numbers.35.9-34"><i>Num.</i> 35:9–34</a>).</i>.” One does not say, this one should go into exile in his stead but he is flogged 40 [lashes]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the Halakhah, the perjurer is barred from fleeing to a city of refuge.</i>. “We testify about this man that he divorced his wife but did not pay her <i>ketubaḥ</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When in fact the woman is still married to her husband. Then the witness could be fined only if in the future the <i>ketubah</i> would not be paid, i. e., if the woman stayed married to her husband and predeceased him. He can be fined the current discounted expected value of such a <i>ketubah</i>.</i>” Would he not finally have to pay her <i>ketubah</i> today or tomorrow? But one estimates how much would a man be willing to pay for the <i>ketubah</i> of this woman in case she would be widowed or divorced, but if she died her husband would inherit from her.

Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, if two alternatives are presented to the court, one chooses one of them<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As a general principle, no crime can be punished by more than one punishment.

This justifies the alternative presented in the preceding paragraph.<br>The text is copied from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 7:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.7.1.3"><i>Terumot</i> 7:1 Note 14</a>; also <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 7:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.7.2.2"><i>Bava qamma</i> 7:2, Note 30</a>.</i>.

<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Babli <i>Qiddušin</i> 77a, <i>Sifra Emor Pereq</i> 2(7–8).</i> It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:15" href="/Leviticus.21.15"><i>Lev.</i> 21:15</a>. This verse is written for the High Priest, but it is applied to all priests who marry women forbidden to them.</i>: <i>He shall not desecrate his issue in his people</i>. Not only his issue will be desecrated; from where also she<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:7" href="/Leviticus.21.7"><i>Lev.</i> 21:7</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:14" href="/Leviticus.21.14">14</a> the “desecrated woman” is mentioned in the list of women forbidden to the Cohen. The verse implies that the daughter of a Cohen from an illicit union is conceived desecrated. There is no verse which spells out the conditions under which a woman otherwise may become desecrated. There is a verse which specifies that the daughter of a Cohen married to anon-Cohen or mother of a non-Cohen child is disqualified from priestly revenues (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:12-13" href="/Leviticus.22.12-13"><i>Lev</i>. 22:12–13</a>), but not desecrated. Since the “desecrated woman” is always mentioned together with the prostitute, it is inferred that sexual offenses of a woman desecrate her.</i>? Is this not a logical inference? Since the issue, which did not sin, is desecrated, should she, who committed a sin<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">On the face of it, the verses only imply that the male Cohen who marries an unsuitable woman commits a sin. Since both <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:7" href="/Leviticus.21.7"><i>Lev</i>. 21:7</a>, addressed to the common priest, repeat the verb “do not marry”, this is read to mean that the first mention is the prohibition for the male to marry, the second the prohibition for the female to agree to be married (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 9:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.9.1.3"><i>Yebamot</i> 9:1 Note 13</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:12:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.12.3"><i>Qiddušin</i> 3:14 Note 243</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Emor, Chapter 1 12" href="/Sifra,_Emor,_Chapter_1.12"><i>Sifra Emor Pereq</i> 1(12</a>), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 84b" href="/Yevamot.84b">Babli <i>Yebamot</i> 84b</a>).</i>, not logically be desecrated? He himself is a counter example, since he committed a sin but was not desecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse emphasizes that his children will be desecrated, it implies that the father himself is not desecrated (even if he consorts with a Gentile or a slave); <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Emor, Chapter 2 8" href="/Sifra,_Emor,_Chapter_2.8"><i>Sifra Emor Pereq</i> 2(8</a>). The son of a Cohen from an illicit union is desecrated from conception; he does not <i>become</i> desecrated. This implies that no male Cohen may <i>become</i> desecrated; he may, however, become unfit for his office.</i>. No. If you argue about a man who is not desecrated in any circumstance, what can you say about a woman who is desecrated in many circumstances<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In order to avoid circular reasoning it is necessary to classify “disqualified” with “desecrated”. Then it follows that there exist classes of females desecrated for the priesthood without equivalent among males.</i>? Since she is desecrated in many circumstances, it is logical that she should be desecrated. If you wish you can say “not to desecrate”, <i>not to desecrate</i>, about somebody who was qualified and became desecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The text of this sentence is in doubt. There is no biblical verb חוֹל “to profane” as required by the reading here and in the Babli. In <i>Sifra</i>, most texts read יחלל both times; but from Ravad’s commentary one sees that the first time he read יַחֵל (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 30:3" href="/Numbers.30.3"><i>Num</i>. 30:3</a>), identical in meaning with יְחַלֵּל.<br>As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Makkot 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Makkot.1.1.4">Note 16</a>, actively “to desecrate” implies the existence of an object which is not yet desecrated. Since any child of the illicit union of a Cohen is intrinsically desecrated, it cannot be <i>made</i> desecrated. Since the male is not desecrated, the use of the active יְחַלֵּל therefore implies that the female is desecrated.</i>.
Bar Pedaya said, the desecrator was not desecrated: how can this one be desecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This refers back to the Mishnah. Since the male is not desecrated by marrying a divorcee, the Cohen who is a perjured witness cannot be declared desecrated.</i>?
Witnesses found guilty of plotting. Rebbi Joḥanan said, <i>falsehood, falsehood</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 21:18" href="/Deuteronomy.21.18"><i>Deut</i>. 21:18</a>: <i>Behold, a witness of</i> <i>falsehood is the witness</i>, <i>falsehood he spoke about his brother</i>. The repetition of the term indicates that every single falsehood in testimony subjects the witness to a separate penalty.</i>. Witnesses found guilty of plotting and then found guilty of lying<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In the same testimony, the witnesses were found guilty of “plotting”, of rendering impossible testimony, and then of false (but possible) testimony. If this is a civil case, where the witnesses have to pay for “plotting”, can they still be flogged for false testimony? R. Johanan says yes, R. Eleazar and R. Simeon ben Laqish say no, as discussed at length in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 7:1:3-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.7.1.3-6"><i>Terumot</i> 7:1 Notes 7–29</a>, in particular Note 19 (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.1.6"><i>Ketubot</i> 3:1 Note 29</a>).</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, <i>falsehood, falsehood</i>. Rebbi Eleazar said, <i>evildoer, evildoer</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The text is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 7:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.7.1.5"><i>Terumot</i> 7:1 Notes 21–23</a>.

Since for the <i>evildoer</i> subject to the death penalty there is no fine accompanying the death penalty, so for the <i>evildoer</i> subject to whipping there is no fine accompanying whipping.
Bar Pedaia said, <i>he</i> <i>shall flee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:5" href="/Deuteronomy.19.5"><i>Deut</i>. 19:5</a>, speaking of the homicide. Cf. Notes 4,5.</i>, not his plotters.

One asks, how much would a person pay for the <i>ketubah</i> of this [woman], maybe she would die during her husband’s lifetime and her husband would inherit from her, or maybe her husband would die during her lifetime and this one would inherit her <i>ketubah</i>.

Did we not state: “If somebody slaughters a cow and divides it up on New Year’s Day”? And Rebbi Eleazar said, this follows Rebbi Jehudah. But can he require payment on New Year’s Day? As Rebbi Abba said in the name of Rebbi Zeˋira: Since he could not ask him for payment, it is as if he could not believe him. And since he could not believe him, it is as if he could not pay him. And here, because he could have given him but did not give, the first [debt] is turned into a loan.
Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rav: If somebody gives a loan to a person on condition that the Sabbatical not remit it, the Sabbatical does not remit it, as we have stated: “to return them after ten years instead of returning them after thirty days”.

It was stated: “For thirty days he will not come.” What means “for thirty days he will not come”? Samuel said, if somebody gives a loan to a person without specifying details, he has no right to ask for payment until after 30 days. Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Read: “Rav”, cf. the variant readings.</i> Jehudah came and explained: <i>The Sabbatical year, the remitting year, is close</i>. Is not the Sabbatical year the remitting year? Why does the verse say, <i>the Sabbatical year, the remitting year, is close</i>? Lest you say, I am not permitted to ask for payment until after 30 days; after 30 days the debt will be remitted and I will not collect. Therefore, it must say, <i>the Sabbatical year, the remitting year, is close</i>. Did not Rebbi Abba bar Mamal, Rav Amram, Rav Mattanah say in the name of Rav: If somebody makes a loan to another person stipulating that he will not press for repayment, the Sabbatical will remit it? It was found stated by Rebbi Ismael: <i>The Sabbatical year, the remitting year, is close</i>. Is not the Sabbatical year the remitting year? Why does the verse say, <i>the Sabbatical year, the remitting year, is close</i>? Lest you say, the entire six years his vineyard is available, his field is available but after six years the debt is remitted and I cannot collect. Therefore, it must say, <i>the Sabbatical year, the remitting year, is close</i>.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Witnesses become plotters only by their own testimony. How is this?

Rebbi Jehudah says, this is <sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Alfasi and Maimonides read the word as <i>isatis</i> “indigo”, that the second group which taints the others’ testimony “tints” them. This is rejected by <i>Arukh</i>, based on a Gaonic responsum which identifies איסטיסית with קוביוסטית “gambling”. R. Hananel and Maimonides read the word as אסטסיס, the Syriac form of Greek στάσις “conspiracy”, or possibly ἀστασία “uncertainty” (Levy, who also considers the forms ἀσταθής, ἄστατος). Rashi considers the word as Semitic, עדות סטיא “incredible testimony” that the second group should be able to testify against all others.

That is what we have stated: “Only the first group is executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Mishnah 7. Since R. Jehudah holds that wholesale disqualifications are not believable, why should the first group of witnesses be condemned when all others, testifying to the same facts, are not?

Since the forest is a place where the person injured and the one causing the injury both may enter, this excludes a private courtyard where the person injured and the one causing the injury may not enter together.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The following are flogged<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As a matter of principle, all transgressions of biblical prohibitions are punishable by flogging unless specifically exempted. The rules are spelled out by Maimonides in his Commentary to this Mishnah. It is under stood that a sentence of flogging can be passed only after a trial based on the testimony of two witnesses both to the fact of the crime and the necessary warning given to the perpetrator.<br>A crime punishable by the death penalty can never lead to a sentence of flogging, even if the death penalty cannot be imposed because of a material or technical obstacle. Crimes punishable by extirpation or Death by the Hand of Heaven are subject to flogging, since in this case the earthly punishment guarantees the sinner his part in the World to Come (Mishnah 17).<br>A crime punishable by a fine cannot lead to punishment by flogging. Crimes done by speech without accompanying action are not punishable by flogging, except swearing falsely, substituting sacrifices (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:10" href="/Leviticus.27.10"><i>Lev.</i> 27:10</a>), and cursing using the Name which is a potential capital crime.<br>A crime connected to a positive commandment cannot lead to punishment by flogging as long as the positive commandment still can be executed (Mishnah 4).<br>The infraction of a positive commandment cannot be punished.

Halakhah 11

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How does one flog him? One binds both his hands on both sides of a pillar. The beadle grabs his clothing. If it tore, it tore; if it unravelled, it unravelled, until he uncovers his heart. A stone is put behind him on which the beadle stands with a strip of calf’s leather in his hand, folded one into two and two into four, and two strips<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Two double strips of calf hide and two single strips (of donkey hide).</i> go up and down in it.<br>The handle is one hand-breadth long; its width is one hand-breadth, and it reaches to his belly.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> All those subject to extirpation are no longer liable to extirpation once they were flogged, as it is said, <i>your brother would be despicable in your eyes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 25:3" href="/Deuteronomy.25.3"><i>Deut.</i> 25:3</a> prohibits to degrade the criminal, the flogging must stop immediately.</i>.
