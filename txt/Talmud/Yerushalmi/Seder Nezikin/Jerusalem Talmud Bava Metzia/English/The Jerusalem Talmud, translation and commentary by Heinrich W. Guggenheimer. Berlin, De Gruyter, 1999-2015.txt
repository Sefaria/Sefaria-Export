Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The main application of the Mishnah is to bankruptcy problems where the amount available for distribution is not sufficient to cover all claims. The principle underlying the distribution has been explained at length in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 10:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.10.4.1"><i>Ketubot</i> 10:4, Note 62</a>.</i> If two persons hold on to one toga and each of them says “I found it” [or] “it wholly belongs to me”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Each of them has to grab a similar length of cloth, to establish equality of claims.</i>, each of them has to swear that he owns no less than half of it and they shall divide it evenly<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There are no witnesses nor other kinds of proof; the case has to be settled by judicial oath. It is obvious that if the two claimants do not agree to possess the object in common it has to be split evenly. If both of them are ready to swear that the object entirely belongs to him, at least one of them is swearing falsely. Since the formulation of the oath is in the hand of the judges, they must be careful not to teach the parties to swear to a falsehood; they cannot let them swear about full ownership, for the court is warned (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:1" href="/Exodus.23.1"><i>Ex.</i>23:1</a>) “not to lend a hand to a wicked person to be an extortionary witness”, i. e., it is forbidden to administer an oath to a known felon (Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 7:4). But if each party only swear to the amount it actually will receive, it is possible that both swear to the truth. The formulation “no less than” implies that the oath is true even if one of them is the full owner; the language of the oaths does not contradict the claims brought before the court.</i>. If one says “it wholly belongs to me” and one says “half of it belongs to me”, the one who says “it wholly belongs to me” shall swear that he owns no less than three parts<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">3/4. The language of “parts” follows the Egyptian (and Roman) pattern; <i>n parts</i> always means <sup class="footnote-marker">n</sup>/<sub>n</sub><sub>+1</sub>.</i> and the one who says “half of it belongs to me” shall swear that he owns no less than a quarter<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Ketubot,</i> the underlying principle is: “Amounts in doubt are split evenly”. If neither party has proof by document or witnesses and A claims 100% of an amount available but B only claims 50%, 50% are assigned to A as undisputed amount. The remaining 50% are in dispute and have to be split evenly; each of the the parties receives 25%.</i>. The first one takes three parts, the second takes a fourth.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If two people hold on to one stole,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A parallel but different text is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.1.4"><i>Ketubot</i> 2:1, Notes 12–15</a>.</i> It was stated: One person said to another, give me the mina<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek <i>mina</i> of 100 drachmas (denars). <i>Zuz,</i> “half sheqel” is the talmudic name of the denar.</i> which you owe me. He answered, it never happened. He went and brought witnesses that the other owed him 50 <i>zuz.</i> The elder Rebbi Ḥiyya said, the confession of the witnesses is the same as his own confession; he has to swear about the remainder<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text, formulated as R. Ḥiyya’s statement, is quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 3a" href="/Bava_Metzia.3a">Babli, 3a</a>. The oath required here is the biblical “oath imposed by the judges”, Mishnah <i>Ševu‘ot</i> 6:1 based on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex.</i> 22:8</a>. The rabbinic interpretation of the biblical expression אֲשֶׁר יֹאמַר כִּי הוּא זֶה is “if he [the defendant] agrees that there be a case.” If the defendant in a civil suit, in which there are no witnesses or documents, denies the entire claim, he does not have to swear a biblical oath (he may have to swear a rabbinical oath). But if he agrees to part of the claim, he has to swear a biblical oath to free himself from the remainder. Only if the claim is advanced as tentative, then any admission by the defendant is a gift to the claimant and by rabbinic rule no oath of any kind is due. (Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 5:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.5.10.1"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 5:3, Note 84</a>).</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the confession of the witnesses is not the same as his own confession that he should have to swear<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex.</i> 22:8</a> insists on the defendant’s agreeing to part of the claim, witnesses can never force a judicial oath. This opinion is not mentioned in the Babli. In <i>Ketubot</i>(<i>loc. cit.</i> Note 7), R. Joḥanan denies that the oath is biblical; its rules cannot be determined by biblical arguments.</i>. Rebbi La said, Rebbi Ḥiyya the elder’s statement is implied by “if two people hold on to one stole”. Since he holds on to half of it, is it not as if he brought witnesses that one half belongs to him? Could one not say that he swears and collects<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is refuted. Since each party claims the entire stole, each one is disputing half of a claim. There is no claimant nor defendant; even R. Ḥiyya must agree that the oath imposed by the Mishnah is not biblical.</i>? Is this a similar case<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Ḥiyya, the case of the <i>baraita</i> is biblical; R. La’s argument is impossible. (In <i>Ketubot,</i> R. La quotes R. Joḥanan’s statement in the next paragraph.)</i>?
This topic<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The oath prescribed in the Mishnah.</i> came up between Rebbi Abba bar Mamal and Rav Amram. One said, one does not entrust an oath to a suspect person<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">How is this oath possible? Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.1.1.1">Note 3</a>.</i>. The other said, one does not even formulate an oath for such a one<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The formulation of the oath in the Mishnah still leaves the court open to a charge of administering an oath which helps a person to be dishonest since one could read the text as: “An oath that I have no claim to it, less than half.” Therefore, a positive statement of claim has to be inserted into the formula. The same formula is attributed to Rav Huna in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 5b" href="/Bava_Metzia.5b">Babli, 5b</a>.</i>. Rav Huna said: “An oath that I have property rights to it to the amount of no less than (the value of a <i>peruṭah</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Reading of the Leiden ms., a scribal error.</i> [half of its value]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Text of E, confirmed by the Babli.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, if it is about this, it is an institutional oath<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">He disagrees with R. Ḥiyya and holds that the oath is purely an <i>ad hoc</i> instituted rabbinical ordinance. In the words of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 3a" href="/Bava_Metzia.3a">Babli (3a</a>), “lest it be easy to assert unfounded claims on another person’s property.”</i>.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 1:15" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).1.15">Tosephta 1:15</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 1:1:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.1.1.9"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 1:1, Notes 68–71</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 7a" href="/Bava_Metzia.7a">Babli <i>Bava meṣi‘a</i> 7a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 170a" href="/Bava_Batra.170a"><i>Bava batra</i>170a</a>.</i>: “If two persons were holding a document<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">An IOU; the persons involved are the creditor and the debtor.</i> and one said, it is mine but I had lost it; the other said, it is mine since I paid you. The document should be validated by its signatories, the words of Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that a paid IOU either should be torn up or the receipt should be written on the document or be attached to it.</i>. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, they should split<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that a paid IOU either should be torn up or the receipt should be written on the document or be attached to it.</i>.” Rabbi Eleazar said, it all depends on who is holding the signatures<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since only the signatures validate the document. He follows the reformulation of the Mishnah in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta (1:1</a>): “If two people hold on to one toga, each one takes what he holds in his hand.” Presumably they split the remainder.</i>. Rav Ḥisda said, if this<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The opinion reported in the name of R. Eleazar the Amora.</i> is true information, it follows Rabban Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since for Rebbi an IOU without a receipt is valid, irrespective of who holds it.</i>.
One says, half is mine; the other says, a third is mine. The one who says that half is his shall swear that no less than a quarter be his; the one who says that a third is his shall swear that no less than a sixth be his. The principle involved: One only swears on half of what he agreed to<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">On the face of it, the paragraph is unintelligible. R. E. Fulda comments: “I do not feel empowered to emend.” The corresponding <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).1.2">Tosephta (1:2</a>) is clear:<br>“One says, <i>all</i> is mine; the other says, a third is mine. The one who says that all is his shall swear that no less than five parts (5/6) are his; the one who says that a third is his shall swear that no less than a sixth is his. The principle involved: One only swears on half of what he agreed to.”<br>In the case of the Tosephta, the second claimant surrenders 2/3 to the first. Only 1/3 is in dispute; it is split evenly. The first one receives 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6; the second receives 1/6. Rabbinic practice decrees that one only swears on half of the amount which is in dispute; in this case each would swear that he owns no less that one sixth in addition to what he has by consensus [Maimonides, <i>Ṭo‘en weniṭ‘an</i>9:8 (<i>Maggid Mišneh ad</i> 9:9), <i>Šulḥan ‘Arukh Ḥošen Mišpaṭ</i> 138:2 (Note)].<br>In the Yerushalmi the total of the claims only adds up to 5/6; they can be satisfied in full. There is no reason why anybody should swear. One has to explain the <i>baraita</i> as dealing with a case of bankruptcy in which the claims themselves are not sufficiently documented and can each be considered only by an affirmatory oath.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If two persons were riding on an animal or one was riding and one was walking, each of them says “it wholly belongs to me”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It will be explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.1.3.1">Mishnah 3</a> that the finder is not the person who first saw the abandoned property but the one who lifted it to acquire. It would be reasonable to expect that if a walker and a rider simultaneously came upon some lost property the walker had a better chance to grab the object first. But in the absence of proof these arguments are irrelevant to the court; both parties must be given equal standing.</i>, each of them has to swear that he owns no less than half of it and they shall divide it evenly. If they agree<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Even after the court gave its verdict, the parties are free to come to an amicable settlement.</i> or if they have witnesses, they divide without an oath.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If two persons were riding on an animal,” etc. Rebbi Ḥuna said: It was stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">A different, incompatible version is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 65b" href="/Kiddushin.65b">Babli, <i>Qiddušin</i> 65b</a>, in the name of Rav Aḥdevoi bar Ammi who lived a generation before R. Ḥuna and was known for his construction of impossible situations.</i>: “A woman comes<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">From overseas, without identification papers.</i> riding on an animal and two men lead her. She says: these are my slaves; the donkey and the load are mine. Each of them says: this is my wife, the other is my slave, and the donkey and the load are mine<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since the rules of court proceedings state that “once somebody testified (under cross-examination), he cannot testify a second time”, they cannot come back to court and change their statements (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 10:3:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.10.3.3"><i>Ševi‘it</i> 10:5 Note 96</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bikkurim 3:4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.3.4.5"><i>Bikkurim</i> 3:4 Note 72</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.4.3"><i>Ketubot</i> 3:3 Note 56</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 18b" href="/Ketubot.18b">Babli <i>Ketubot</i> 18b</a>). In line with the principles of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.1.1.1">Mishnah 1</a>, the court has to impose a solution compatible with all statements.</i>. She needs a bill of divorce from both of them<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since the woman denies being married and there are no witnesses, she certainly has no claim to <i>ketubah</i> from either of the men. From <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.10.1">Mishnah <i>Qiddušin</i> 3:11</a> it would seem that therefore she can marry another person without a bill of divorce, as stated explicitly in the Babli; but the formulation in the Yerushalmi does not seem to support this statement.</i> and has to manumit both of them. They have to manumit one another. In the donkey and the load they are equal co-owners.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Somebody was riding on an animal when he saw a find and said to another person: “give it to me”. If [that one] took it and said: “I acquired it”, he acquired it<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since ownerless property only can be acquired by action, never by intent or declaration (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 5:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.5.4.3"><i>Ketubot 5:5,</i> Note 100</a>.</i>. If after he had handed it over, he said: “I acquired it first,” he did not say anything<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The rider acquired the object by grabbing it in his hand; he is the presumed owner. The walker is now a claimant and “the burden of proof is on the claimant”. If he did not articulate his claim before handing over the object there can be no witnesses and no proof.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Somebody was riding on an animal,” etc. Rebbi Isaac says, from this rule one cannot infer anything, not from its beginning nor from its end. “Somebody was riding on an animal when he saw a find and said to another person: ‘give it to me’. If [that one] took it and said: ‘I acquired it’, he acquired it”. If he had said, “acquire it for me”, he would have acquired it. That means, from this rule one cannot infer anything, not from its beginning nor from its end<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Pene Moshe</i> points out, this refers to the disagreement between R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 4:6:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.4.6.4"><i>Peah</i> 4:6, Note 112</a>), on whether a person can acquire a find for another person by lifting it. The Mishnah does not help in solving the dispute. The first sentence does not help since it does not exclude that had the rider said, “acquire it for me” instead of “give it to me”, the walker would have acquired it for the rider by lifting and would not have been able to claim that he acquired it. The second sentence does not have to be quoted since it obviously is irrelevant for the disagreement between R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish.</i>.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody saw a find and fell upon it<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Without moving the find, it is not acquired. The second person in grabbing the find must have moved it a little; therefore, he acquired it.</i> when another person grabbed it, the one who grabbed it acquired it. If one saw people running after a find<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Lying on an open field after it was harvested, before the field was ploughed.</i>, after an injured deer, after young pigeons unable to fly, and he said: “my field shall acquire it for me”, it acquired it for him<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">A person’s real estate acquires for its owner any property lying there of which he is cognizant; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 6:2:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.6.2.4"><i>Giṭṭin</i> 6:2, Note 71</a>.</i>. If the deer was running normally, or the pigeons were flying, and he said: “my field shall acquire it for me”, he did not say anything<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Animals and birds on a field are not lying there; real estate cannot acquire moving objects.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody saw a find” etc. Rabbi Simeon ben Laqish said [in the name of] Abba Cohen bar Delaiah<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">“Resh Laqish” for “R.

If a person stands in the public domain, an ownerless object is within four cubits of him but of no other person, then he has the right to acquire the object and no other person has the right to enter the circle of four cubits around him to take the object. It is clear that taking possession requires intent by the acquirer (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 10" href="/Bava_Metzia.10">Babli <i>Bava meṣi‘a</i> 10a/b</a>).</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, only if it fell into his hand<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">No acquisition in the public domain can be effected by thought.</i>.

A poor person acquires <i>peah</i> by taking it.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One who found documents of indebtedness containing an alienation clause should not return them since the court will foreclose on their basis<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The standard document of indebtedness was written as a mortgage covering all the real estate in the debtor’s possession at the moment of the execution of the deed. In contrast to general Egyptian and Roman practice the debtor was allowed to sell his real estate, but the alienation clause stated that the sale did not break the mortgage lien. If the debtor was unable to pay, the creditor could have regress on the buyer, who then would have to sue the debtor for his loss. The finder might not return the deed which he found since the mortgage might have been paid but the receipt somehow became separated from the document. If the deed was returned to the creditor, the latter might use it against an innocent buyer who would not know that it had been liquidated. This standard mortgage might have its root in the Ptolemaic and later Roman-Egyptian <i>obligatio omnium bonorum,</i> but probably it came with its Accadic name <i>šatārum</i> “written document” from Babylonian practice.</i>. If they do not contain an alienation clause, he should return them since the court will not foreclose on their basis<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Since the deed cannot be used against a third party, one assumes that the debtor has the means to prove that the debt was paid. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 1:5" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).1.5">Tosephta, 1:5</a>, the formulation is: should return it if the debtor agrees.</i>, the words of Rebbi Meïr. But the Sages say, in no case should he return them since the court will foreclose on their basis<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">They rule that an alienation clause is always implied in a written bill of indebtedness; its absence only shows the incompetence of the scribe formulating the contract.</i>.

Following this opinion of Rebbi Meïr, to what purpose does he return it? To cover the mouth of his pitcher<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">In this context, the remark is a <i>non sequitur.</i> It seems to refer to another tradition of R. Meïr’s, quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 13a" href="/Bava_Metzia.13a">Babli, 13a</a>, by Samuel: A contract containing no alienation clause cannot be used to foreclose.

Lieberman suggests to read תַּמָּן אוֹמְרִים “there (in Babylonia), they say” instead of “but the Sages say.” This then properly refers the entire discussion to positions of R.

As the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 12b" href="/Bava_Metzia.12b">Babli, 12b</a>, explains, the problem with this is that the mortgage might have been executed in April but the loan was given only in October.

Therefore, the Babli restricts the permission to mortgage deeds with which the title to the land is immediately deposited with the creditor, the Egyptian ὑπάλλαγμα (cf. R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Which finds are his and which ones does he have to make public<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 2:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.2.5.1">Mishnah 6</a>, there is a biblical requirement that the finder not return a found object unless the person claiming to be the owner clearly identifies the object by some marks or properties not generally known. Therefore, objects without identifying properties cannot be returned and become the finder’s immediately since it may be assumed that the owner immediately gave up hope of recovery, so that an ownerless object was picked up.</i>? The following finds are his: If he found scattered produce, scattered coins<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If these are common produce or common coins, they have no identifying marks nor can they be identified by the place where they were lost.</i>, bundles of grain in the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Small bundles which are blown away by the wind or moved by passing animals or people; they cannot be expected to be found at the place where they were lost. Since most farmers make such bundles, their shape is no identifying mark.</i>, or fig cakes, baker’s loaves, strings of fish, cuts of meat, local fleece-wool, bundles of flax, or strips of purple wool<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">All these are local products, made uniformly by several producers and, therefore, without individual identifying marks.</i>; these are his<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli and most independent Mishnah mss.: “The words of R. Meïr.” Since an anonymous Mishnah is supposed to be R. Meïr’s, the addition is unnecessary. The individual opinions expressed in the next Mishnah are clarifications, not dissenting opinions.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Which finds are his,” etc. From where may an owner’s hopelessness<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That a lost article becomes ownerless the moment the owner realizes his loss since he has no hope of recovery. Then appropriating a find which has no distinguishing marks is not theft. This leaves open the question, discussed at length in the Babli, why keeping a find without marks is not theft even before the original owner became conscious of his loss.</i> be deduced from the Torah? Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Yehoṣadaq: “So you shall proceed with his donkey,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:3" href="/Deuteronomy.22.3"><i>Deut.</i> 22:3</a>: “So you shall proceed with his donkey, so you shall proceed with his garment, so you shall proceed with anything <i>lost by your neighbor and which you found</i>; you cannot avoid taking notice.” As usual, the argument is about a part of the verse which is not quoted. The clause in Italics seems to be superfluous; if he did not lose and you did not find, there would be no case. It must be that you found something which can be traced back to your neighbor.</i>” etc. What is lost by him but may be found by anybody you have to make public. But what is not lost by him but may be found by anybody you do not have to make public. This excludes the owner’s hopelessness about that which was lost by him or anybody.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> But the following must be made public<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Because there are distinguishing marks which the legitimate owner can identify if only the bare fact that such-and-such an item was found was made public.</i>: If one found produce in a container or simply a container, coins in a wallet or simply a wallet, heaps of produce, heaps of coins<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The amount and kind of the coins can be indicated.</i>, three coins one on top of the other<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The particular way in which the coins were arranged is a distinguishing mark.</i>, bundles of grain in a private domain<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Small bundles which are blown away by the wind or moved by passing animals or people; they cannot be expected to be found at the place where they were lost.

Pitchers of wine and pitchers of oil he has to make public.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “But the following must be made public,” etc. Rav Jehudah says three coins of three kings<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Three coins from three mints are certainly an identifying mark. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 25a" href="/Bava_Metzia.25a">Babli, 25a</a>, this is a statement by the Galilean R. Ḥanina.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar said, or even three from one king if they form a tower<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">If the loser can indicate both the kind of coin and the way they were arranged, he is identified as the owner. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 25a" href="/Bava_Metzia.25a">Babli, 25a</a>, the only arrangement counted as identifying mark is that of a tower, the coins one on top of the other.</i>? Of three kings and they are in three towers? Or even three of one king as a tower<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is the final answer. The claimant must identify either three different mintings or one kind of coin and the way they were arranged. Then it would be improbable that the arrangement was accidental.</i>.
“Pitchers of wine and pitchers of oil he has to make public.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This quote from the Mishnah is out of place since one continues the discussion of single coins found.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan said, if it was like a tripod<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Three coins forming a regular triangle. This arrangement does not count as identifying mark.<br>A corral is an enclosed space where nobody dwells permanently. If there are three tool sheds or three cow sheds in the corral, it may well be triangular.</i> one does not have to make it public. What means, like a tripod? For example, a corral belonging to three people. Since one does not know to whom to return it, he does not have to make it public. Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This clearly refers to R. Yose the Amora, not the Tanna ben Ḥalafta. The meaning of the mention of “R. Ḥalafta” in his statement is not clear.</i> said, one understands from here that if a person went behind Rebbi Ḥalafta and a denar fell down from them, since one does not know to whom to return it, he does not have to make it public<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">If there are no identifying marks and there is a doubt even between only two people, the find does not have to be returned.</i>. Simeon bar Abba was walking behind Rebbi Eleazar; a denar fell down from him. Simeon bar Abba presented it to him. He answered, I already had given up hope about this. They said, Rebbi Eleazar only intended it for Rebbi Simeon bar Abba because he was poor<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since he refused to accept alms, R. Eleazar found a way to give him money in a way understood only by scholars</i>.

If one found a vessel on garbage heaps, if it was covered he should not touch it<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">One may not touch other people’s property which possibly was deposited somewhere, neither lost nor abandoned, since, as Maimonides writes (<i>Gezelah wa‘bedah</i> 15:1), in the worst case the owner would lose his property and in the best he would be obligated to provide a distinguishing mark to regain his property.</i>, if in the open he should take it and make it public<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">An intact vessel usually is not abandoned.</i>.

He came and asked Rav, who told him, you did not act correctly. He said, shall I return it?

Abba bar Zavda says in the name of Rav that “if possibly it was deposited, one should not take it, but if he took it, he should not return it.” In Rashi’s interpretation, one has to advertise the find. Following Maimonides (<i>l</i>. <i>c.</i> <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 2:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.2.4.1">Note 42</a>), the finder keeps it. Ravad disagrees and holds that since the finder took it illegally, he cannot acquire but the object must lie untouched until the prophet Elijah comes and determines the owner. The last two opinions can be read into the Yerushalmi text which notes that the owner probably gave up hope of recovery and, therefore, could not regain the object even when the find was advertised.</i>.
It was stated: What one found on a garbage heap he has to make public, for garbage is moved<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Also quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 25b" href="/Bava_Metzia.25b">Babli, 25b</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 2:11" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).2.11">Tosephta 2:11</a>. S. Lieberman explains that, in contrast to the garbage heap in the public domain mentioned in the Mishnah, one speaks here of a private garbage heap which periodically is emptied into a landfill. Therefore, everything lying there is either abandoned or lost and must be taken and advertised.</i>. What one found in a heap or an old wall<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">A wall is old if it no longer shields anything.</i> belongs to him, for I am saying that it belonged to the Emorites<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 2:12" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).2.12">Tosephta 2:12</a>.

If it was opening to the inside, even from from the middle to the outside belongs to the owner of the property; if it was opening to the outside, even from the middle to the inside belongs to the finders.
“If he was renting out to others, even what is inside the house belongs to him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This quote is not really connected with the following, which refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 2:2" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).2.2">Tosephta 2:2</a>, in which R. Simeon ben Eleazar states that “what is saved from the mouth of a lion or a wolf, from the surge of the ocean or a river, or found on a public thoroughfare, belongs to the finder since the owners had given up hope.” Since this is stated as an individual opinion, it follows that the anonymous majority require publication in all cases.</i> Rebbi Jeremiah says, they disagree about a hostelry<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Greek πανδοκεῖον, τό.</i>, but in a courtyard everybody agrees that he is required to make it public. Rebbi Yose said, they disagree about a courtyard, but in a hostelry everybody agrees that it belongs to its finder.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “What one found in a store is his,” etc. Rebbi Eleazar said, so is the Mishnah: On his chair, on his counter<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 26b" href="/Bava_Metzia.26b">Babli, 26b</a>, in the name of R.

The language of the Yerushalmi rather points to the opposite conclusion, <i>viz.,</i> that they are the storekeeper’s or the banker’s.</i>.

His students said to him, Rabbi, in order to make it easier for you we want to buy a donkey, then you will not have to work so hard. They went and bought a donkey from a Saracen; a pearl was hanging on its neck. They came to him saying, because of this you will not have to work anymore. He said to them, why? They told him, we bought for you a donkey from a Saracen and a pearl is hanging on its neck. He asked them, does its owner know about this? They answered, no. He told them, go and return it. But did not Rav Huna, Bevay bar Gozlan, in the name of Rav say, they objected before Rebbi: Even according to him who says that an object robbed from a Gentile is forbidden, everybody agrees that what he lost is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 113b" href="/Bava_Kamma.113b"><i>Bava qama</i> 113b</a>.</i>.

Simeon ben Shetaḥ wanted to hear: Praised be the God of the Jews, more than any gain in this world.
The following implies the same. Rebbi Ḥanina reports the following case: The elder rabbis bought a heap of wheat from the household of the general and found in it a bundle of denars. They returned it to them. They said, praised be the God of the Jews.

She said, praised be the God of the Jews.
Rebbi Samuel bar Sosarṭai went to Rome. The queen had lost her דילניה but he found it. A herold went through the city: One who will return it within 30 days will receive such and such; after 30 days his head will be lifted from him. He did not return it within 30 days. After 30 days he returned it. She asked him, had you not been in the city? He answered, yes. She asked him, had you not heard the voice of the herold? He answered, yes. She asked him, what did he say? He answered, one who will return it within 30 days will receive such and such; after 30 days his head will be lifted from him. She asked him, why did you not return it within 30 days? He answered, one should not say that I acted out of fear of you, but out of fear of the Merciful. She said to him, praised be the God of the Jews.

But if he took care the way people take care, he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Taking care of money is no different from taking care of any other object. If his care would have been enough for a vessel, it is enough for coins.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody deposits coins with another person,” etc. Rebbi Yose said: One understands from this that in case a man gave <i>plyṭvryn</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">E reads first פליסורין, then כליסורין. The first reading is supported by the text quoted by Menaḥem di Lonzano. S. Lieberman reads this as Greek κλυστήριον, “a clyster”, which fits the context. The explanations proposed by earlier commentators are not reasonable.</i> to another in the market place and that one handed it over to his underage son or daughter, if they were stolen or lost he is not liable since I say that nobody is in the market place because of <i>plyṭvryn</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">If private matters are handed over by the depositor in an inappropriate manner, the trustee is not required to behave appropriately.</i>.
When did they say that the unpaid trustee swears and is absolved? If he took care of it the way caretakers do: He locked as he should, tied as he should, put it into his money-belt<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">E reads instead of באפונדתו (from the Latin <i>funda</i> “money belt”) באפר אפורין which S. Lieberman reads as Greek παράφορον “loose belt”.</i>, tied it into his poncho and kept it in front of him, put it into a cupboard, a chest, or a safety box; if they were stolen or lost he is required to swear but not liable to pay<sup class="footnote-marker">73a</sup><i class="footnote">The unpaid trustee does not swear automatically if the object entrusted to him is lost; the judges have to find that he is entitled to swear.</i>. If there are witnesses that he did so, he even is freed from the oath. He locked carelessly, tied carelessly, put it on his back<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">E has an addition: “He hung it outside his money-belt, tied it into his scarf and put it on his back.”</i>, left it on his roof; if it was stolen he is liable for payment. If he put it at a place where he usually keeps his own things, if it was kept safe as it should have been he is not liable, otherwise he is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">A person careless with his own belongings is not absolved from liability if he proves that he treated others’ property no worse than his own.</i>.

Halakhah 8

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> “If somebody deposits coins with a money changer, if they are tied together, he may not use them, if loose, he may use them. With a householder, whether tied together or loose he may not use them<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah in the Babli and the independent Mishnah mss. adds: Anybody permitted to use the money is liable if it is lost; anybody not permitted to use it is not liable (beyond the usual liability of the unpaid trustee) for coins.</i>. The storekeeper is like a householder, the words of Rebbi Meïr; Rebbi Jehudah says, like a money changer.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody deposits coins with a money changer,” etc. Rav Huna said that Rebbi Jeremiah<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian, known as Rav Jeremiah in the Babli.</i> asked how<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">What is the meaning of “tied together” which prohibits the money changer from using the coins. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 43a" href="/Bava_Metzia.43a">Babli, 43a</a>, a statement attributed by different mss. to different authors states that only money deposited under seal cannot be used.</i>? Tied under seal or tied together without seal. If you say under seal, without seal he may. If you say without seal, so much more under seal.

Halakhah 9

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If a person appropriates a deposit<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Illegally.</i>, the House of Shammai say, he shall be hit by less or more<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">He pays the larger of its values at the time of deposit and at the time it should have been delivered to the depositor.</i>, but the House of Hillel say, [at the price] at the time of delivery; Rebbi Aqiba says, at the time of claim. If somebody intends to take the deposit, the House of Shammai hold him liable but the House of Hillel say, he is liable only from the moment he takes it<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah in the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Babli adds: “For it is written (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:7" href="/Exodus.22.7"><i>Ex.</i> 22:7</a>): If he did not stretch out his hand to his neighbor’s possession.” It is not in the mss. of the Babli or the Mishnah. The verse implies that theft occurs only by a thief’s act of acquisition, such as moving the object.</i>. How is this? If he tilted the amphora<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">But the amphora never lost contact with the floor on which it was standing and no part in contact with the floor changed position.</i> and took a <i>quartarius,</i> and then it broke, he pays only for a <i>quartarius</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Because the trustee-thief acquired only the <i>quartarius</i> of wine.</i>. If he lifted it<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Thereby acquiring the [responsability for the] amphora.</i> and took a <i>quartarius,</i> and then it broke, he pays for all.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If a person appropriates a deposit,” etc. So is the Mishnah: At the time of claim in court<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The “time of claim” mentioned in the Mishnah is not the time of the claim of the owner on the trustee for return of his property but the moment the case is brought to court. Since the court is supposed to hear each case on the day it was brought, the value of the object can be determined by asking local dealers.</i>. Rav Jeremiah in the name of Rav: Practice follows Rebbi Aqiba<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The Babli agrees in the name of Samuel, 43b.</i>. Even though the House of Hillel disagree with him? Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya: It happened that there was a case and Rebbi instructed following Rebbi Aqiba. Rav Hoshaia said, if there are no witnesses. But if there are witnesses, everybody agrees with Rebbi Aqiba’s position<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 43b" href="/Bava_Metzia.43b">Babli, 43b</a>, even R.

And what is the reason of the House of Shammai? “Any talk of criminality.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex.</i> 22:8</a>.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A general reference to this Mishnah and the first paragraph of the Halakhah is in D.

But it is universally accepted that in rabbinic practice payment only establishes a <i>claim</i> to ownership and possession, not a <i>fact.</i> This is to avoid fraudulent transactions in which the seller sells non-existent goods and then claims that they were lost, e. g., by fire, between sale and delivery when they already were owned by the buyer but not yet in his possession. On the other hand, in a barter transaction taking possession by one party automatically transfers both ownership and possession to the other party (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:6:2-6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.6.2-6"><i>Qiddušin</i> 1:6</a>). If a person loses because the other party who took money in a commercial transaction then refuses to go through with the sale and offers to refund the money, he can ask the court to publicly curse the defaulting party but he has no legal way to force completion of the sale (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 4:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.4.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>). But if the buyer took possession of the merchandise, then the sale is completed; the seller can force payment in court and is not required to take the article back. This means that transactions involving money are considered a kind of barter in which coins always are passive but never active objects of barter.<br>There is no doubt that gold or silver bars are merchandise, objects of trade and barter. The question is about coins. If gold coins are exchanged for silver coins and vice-versa, the question is which of the species are considered as merchandise and which as coins in the transaction. The Babli and all sources depending on it (Mishnah and Tosephta mss.) state that “Gold acquires silver but silver does not acquire gold,” the opposite of the Yerushalmi. The Halakhah states that originally, the Yerushalmi Mishnah was identical with the Babli; the change can be dated to the early Third Century.<br>D. Sperber has argued convincingly that this is not a question of gold or silver standard since both the Roman and the Parthian, later Persian, empires actually were on a gold-and-silver standard. But the Persian empire never experienced the disastrous manipulation of silver coinage which started with Caracalla and ended with the hyper-inflation of the military anarchy, only to be brought under control by Diocletian’s currency reform. By contrast, even the worst Roman emperors did not adulterate gold coinage (if they minted gold at all.) Therefore, in Babylonia silver coin was the common vehicle of trade while gold coin was used only in very large transactions or as a vehicle for hoarding. This means that silver coin was “money” but gold coin was “merchandise” even when gold coin did not trade at an agio over the official ratio. But in the Roman empire in the period of formulation of the Mishnah (roughly 190–230) silver coins changed from dependable vehicle of commerce to objects to be disposed of as quickly as possible; silver became a merchandise relative to gold coin.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Silver acquires gold,” etc. This is a summary of the matter: Anything worth less that the other acquires the other. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said, who stated this? Rebbi Simeon ben Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 44a" href="/Bava_Metzia.44a">Babli 44a</a>.</i>. His father told him, change your opinion and state the following: “Gold acquires silver.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The version accepted in Babylonia sees the world as it should be; not the temporary state at the beginning military anarchy in the Roman empire when the currency was manipulated.</i>” He told him, I do not change my opinion since when your faculties were unimpaired, you instructed me to state: “Silver acquires gold.” The word of Rebbi implies that gold is like produce<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It has the power of merchandise to transfer possession and finalize a deal.</i>. The Mishnah implies that silver is like produce<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It has the power of merchandise to transfer possession and finalize a deal.</i>. [Rebbi Ḥiyya’s <i>baraita</i> implies that gold is like produce<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Metzia (Lieberman) 3:13" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Metzia_(Lieberman).3.13">Tosephta 3:13</a>.</i>, but his word implies that silver is like produce, as in the following:]<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Addition of E. The characterization of the Tosephta as Galilean might raise doubts as to the genuineness of the addition.</i> The elder Rebbi Ḥiyya’s daughter lent denars<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gold denars.</i> to Rav. She came and asked her father, who told her: Take from him good and full weight denars<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 44b" href="/Bava_Metzia.44b">Babli 44b</a>. The problem here is the prohibition of taking interest, which is defined as “payment for waiting” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Metzia 65a" href="/Bava_Metzia.65a">Babli 65a</a>). Therefore, it is forbidden to lend merchandise on condition to receive the same amount of merchandise in return at a specified future time since in the meantime the value of the merchandise might have increased and the lender would be repaid more in monetary value than what he lent out. It is required to determine the monetary value of the articles to be lent before they are transferred. The only exceptions are (a) short term loans and (b) bridge loans where the borrower already owns the borrowed items while they are stored at another locality. If R. Ḥiyya holds that silver is merchandise, how can he allow his daughter to lend gold coin against gold coin? The Babli explicitly states that during the term of the loan, gold rose in price against silver.</i>. Do we learn from Rebbi Ḥiyya’s daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The story is irrelevant for the problem of this Halakhah since Rav states in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 5:5:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.5.5.8">Halakhah 5:7 (Note 135</a>) that between close relatives the taking of interest is permitted. Rav was the student of his uncle R. Ḥiyya until he returned to Babylonia in 218; he was R. Ḥiyya’s daughter’s cousin. All we can learn is that Rav’s statement is really R. Ḥiyya’s. [S. Abramson in <i>Sinai</i> 89 (1981) pp. 217–218.] It is not stated whether the lender was Pazi or Martha.</i>? Rebbi Idi said, also Abba, Samuel’s father, asked before Rebbi: May one lend denars against denars<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gold denars.</i>? He answered him, it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The answer of a young R. Jehudah ben Rabban Simeon.</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, also Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish both instruct: It is permitted to lend denars against denars. <i>Qerat</i> against <i>qerat</i> is permitted, <i>lekan</i> against <i>lekan</i> is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Sperber’s analysis (<i>l. c.</i> pp. 92–93) makes it probable that the last sentence is not R. Joḥanan’s and R. Simeon ben Laqish’s, but is the editor’s deduction from the preceding statement. He notes that <i>qeraṭ</i> can either be the Greek κεράτιον, a gold weight, 1/1728 <i>libra aurei,</i> in Dioclation’s system equal in value with the silver <i>siliqua,</i> 1/24 <i>solidus,</i> or Syriac קרטא, <i>quarta</i>(<i>pars sicli</i>), one denar. Since we are dealing with coins, the preferred meaning is that of <i>siliqua,</i> an honest silver coin which did not exist during R. Joḥanan’s lifetime. <i>Lekan</i> was proposed in <i>Ma‘aśer Šeni</i> 4:1, Note 22, as “small measure or weight”, i. e. local small change which in the Mishnah had been defined as merchandise when compared with silver. {The computation of R. Eliahu Fulda in <i>Ma‘aśer Šeni</i> 4:1, who wanted to prove that the <i>lekan</i> was 1/62.5 of a <i>solidus,</i> was already shown to be in error by H. Y. Sheftel [Encyclopedia of biblical and rabbinic coins, measures, weights, areas, and time, Berdiczew 1907 (Hebrew)]}.</i>.
There, we have stated: If anything is given instead of money, if one entered in possession, the other is obligated for its exchange<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.4.1.1">Note 2</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.6.1"><i>Qiddušin</i> 1:6, Note 521</a>.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, they stated this only about an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox; but heap against heap one did not acquire. Rav Jeremiah in the name of Rav: Even heaps among heaps he did acquire<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.6.2"><i>Qiddušin</i> 1:6, Note 525</a>. If one of the parties took possession, the other party automatically obtained possession of the exchanged property.</i>. Rebbi Abba bar Mina in the name of Rav: One who exchanged אברוקלון against אמברוקלון did acquire<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The reading of R. Ḥananel and <i>‘Arukh</i> is: One who exchanged אמבורקלין against אמבורקלין did acquire. <i>Arukh</i> explains as “bundles of sheets” which in Italian (dialect of Rome) would be called ברוקלי (variants ברוקלון, ברוקלו) or (תרצילו, טורצלי, תרוצולו, תורצלו) .טרצילו. The second word is identified by Krauss in <i>Additamenta ad librum Aruch Completum</i> as <i>turzello.</i> M. Sachs (J. Levy, S. Krauss) identifies אמבורוקלון as Latin <i>involucrum</i> “wrapper; covering; envelope”, from <i>involvo</i> “to wrap up, roll up.”. <i>Turzello,</i> from Latin <i>tortus</i> “a twisting, winding”, from <i>torqueo</i> “to twist, to turn” is an acceptable translation of <i>involucrum.</i> In this interpretation, the statement implies that the laws of barter also apply if something is exchanged against an object of the same kind. It is difficult to understand why this should not be so.<br>H. Y. D. Azulay, in his פתח עיניים, quotes from the ms. of R. Menaḥem di Lonzano בדיקלין באמה בדיקלין. E: אמלוקנין באמבוליקין.<br>However, Maimonides connects the statement with the later Mishnaiot whose subject is the cancellation of a sale because of overcharging by the seller or underpaying by the buyer. He reads the statement as meaning that a barter is concluded the moment one of the parties takes possession of the object coming to him, and no legal recourse exists for the party realizing that he made a bad bargain. He must hold that אברוקלון and אמבורוקלון are two different objects. It is possible that he reads the two words as “needle” and “silk cloth” since he writes (<i>Mekhirah</i> 13:1): “One who barters vessels agains vessels or animals against animals, even a needle for silk cloth or a kid goat for a horse, has no claim of overcharging since he might prefer a needle to silk cloth.” The horse is specifically exempt from the rules of overcharging in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 4:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.4.6.2">Halakhah 4, Note 132</a>. (Ravad objects and thinks that Maimonides misunderstood the Yerushalmi.) The commentary <i>Migdal ‘Oz</i> (R. Šem-Ṭob Gabbai) readsאמבורקלין אמטרקלין, but gives no explanation of the words beyond noting that these clearly denote different objects.</i>.

If the bride now is in her husband’s house, the husband has to prove that she was already blemished at the preliminary wedding when he agreed to be financially responsible for her. Similarly, the rule is that if the donkey was in his first owner’s stable when the buyer found it with a broken leg that the stable’s owner has to prove that it was healthy at the time he took possession of the cow.</i> and he told them, look at the next statement: “Once she entered the husband’s domain, the husband has to prove.” Would not the father have to prove? But you are saying that the husband has to prove; here also, the owner has to prove.

The missing starting sentence would indicate that the parties to a trade determined the monetary value of the animals traded. No money actually changed hands because they agreed that the prices of the items exchanged were equal. The question now arises whether the transaction has to be classified as sell-and-buy, in which case each party has to take possession by an act of acquisition, or as barter, when the taking of possession of one party automatically transfers possession also to the other party.</i>(Rebbi Abba, Rav Jehudah in the name of Samuel: One had a cow and one a donkey.

Then the buyer had second thoughts and offered the seller a donkey instead of money. If now they exchange the animals, it is not barter. Since the first to take the other’s animal takes something for which he did not pay, and the sale was not a credit sale, he cannot have acquired the animal until the other party also takes his. The only problem left open is whether the second party also has to execute a conscious act of acquisition; this is required by R. Yose but waved by R. Abba.</i>. Would the donkey be acquired? Rebbi Abba said, he acquired. Rebby Yasa said, he did not acquire. Rebbi Mana said, there is a situation in which Rebbi Yose would agree: A man said to another, I want to sell my cow.

In the morning he went and found him open for business. He asked him, what are you doing here? He answered, I want to collect the denars in the draft I have on you.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Cheating<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Overcharging (or underpaying) the current rate, forbidden in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:14" href="/Leviticus.25.14"><i>Lev.</i>25:14</a>.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One hands a cow or a donkey over for care as well as anything which works and eats<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text also of most Mishnah and Babli mss.; only the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Babli follows Rashi in reading: “One estimates the value of a cow and a donkey and anything which works and eats <i>for the middle</i>,” i. e., the owner of the animal and the person who cares for it and is the beneficiary of its work split any increase or loss arising from the animal 50–50. Maimonides, whose Mishnah text is identical with the Yerushalmi and the mss., does not comment on it, but in his Code (<i>Šutafim</i> 8:3) formulates that the owner and the tenant farmer share profits on a 50–50 basis; he does not mention that the farmer has to carry 50% of the risk and even 100% of the risk if the animal dies through of his fault (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 5:4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.5.4.5">Note 102</a>). In modern terms the Mishnah states that an investment is not a loan, and that the worker and the capitalist who provides the means of production are free to conclude any contractual arrangement.<br>While the dictionaries and the commentators identify this שם with Aramaic שם “to estimate, determine its value”, for the translation it is identified with Arabic سام، سوم “to impose a task” (“to let graze freely” in the <i>af‘ala</i> stem). In the Halakhah, both meanings are used.</i>. At a place where one usually divides the young immediately, one divides; at a place where one usually raises them, they should be raised. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, one hands over a calf with its mother, a foal with its mother<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the calf is not productive, the tenant farmer is obligated to provide food and care for his share in its future value.</i>, and one invests in improving a field and does not worry about interest<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">It is legal for the tenant farmer to ask the landlord to invest money in his field, to be repaid by future increases in yield. That is yield of investment, rather than interest.</i>.

If they fell to the outside, the lower ones were apt to break<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There are no parallels to the <i>baraita,</i> but it seems that one has to switch the statements: If the broken stones were black like the inside of an oven, they probably were foundation stones. If stones fell away from the house and are broken, they were upper floor stones (<i>Responsa Radbaz</i> vol. 5, #2112; cf. <i>Tosephta kiFshutah Bava meṣia‘</i> p. 304).</i>.
“If one of them recognized his stones, he takes them, and they are debited to his account.” Rebbi Hoshaia said, this means that the hand rules on one side<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear what the sentence means. It seems that R. Hoshaia’s problem is that both rules given in the Mishnah, i. e., that all broken stones probably from a certain place are debited to the owner of that place, and that the person who recognizes his stones takes them for his account, disregarding a certain margin of error. If property rights (“hand”) are given to one side, it rules over the entire lot in dispute. This seems to contradict common sense.</i>. There<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Demay</i> 7:9, Notes 128–129.</i>, we have stated: “A hundred <i>ṭevel</i> in a hundred profane, he removes 101. A hundred <i>ṭevel</i> in a hundred tithe, he removes 101.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As explained there, the <i>ṭevel</i> in question is tithe of which heave of the tithe was not taken and which therefore is forbidden for consumption to anybody not a Cohen. The question is why 101 has to be taken as <i>ṭevel</i> rather than 100. The question is answered by R. Yose.</i> Rebbi Yose said, if you say that he takes 100, I would say that only profane came to his hand and the other remains <i>ṭevel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">While this is extremely unlikely, it is possible and the legal rule is based on this possibility.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The ground floor and the upper floor belong to two different persons<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Following the Babli, Maimonides and Rashi explain that the house is the property of the person dwelling in the lower apartment; the dweller in the first floor rented his apartment.

Then the expenses for necessary repairs have to be borne equally by both of them. If one of them refuses to pay his part, the other brother may use his apartment as a temporary dwelling.</i>; if the upper floor sprang a leak and the owner of the ground floor does not want to fix it, the owner of the upper floor descends and dwells below until he fixes the upper floor for him.
