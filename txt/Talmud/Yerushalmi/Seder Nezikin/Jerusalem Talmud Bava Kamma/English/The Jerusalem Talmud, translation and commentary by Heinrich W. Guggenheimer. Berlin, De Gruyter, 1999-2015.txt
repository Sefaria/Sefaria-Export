Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are four main categories of damages<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Most rules of payment for damages may be derived from the examples of damages treated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21-22" href="/Exodus.21-22"><i>Ex.</i> 21–22</a>, as explained in the Halakhah.</i>: The bull<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">An agressive bull goring with his horns; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:28-32" href="/Exodus.21.28-32"><i>Ex.</i> 21:28–32</a>;35–36.</i>, and the pit<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A person digging a pit in the public domain is responsible for any damage caused by his action; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:33-34" href="/Exodus.21.33-34"><i>Ex.</i> 21:33–34</a>.</i>, and the devourer<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Damage caused by an animal other than goring: feeding (“the tooth”) and trampling (“the foot”), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:4" href="/Exodus.22.4"><i>Ex.</i> 22:4</a>. The Aramaic root בעי is found in Pseudo-Jonathan to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 22:2" href="/Numbers.22.2"><i>Num.</i> 22:2</a> as translation of Hebrew לחך “to devour”. The unusual expression מַבְעֶה is used to subsume two legal terms under one.</i>, and the setting on fire<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:5" href="/Exodus.22.5"><i>Ex.</i> 22:5</a>.</i>. The bull is not like the devourer, nor the devourer like the bull<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since goring, trampling, and devouring are all ascribed to the same animal, the question arises why the bull has to be mentioned in two different categories both in the Mishnah and in the biblical text. The details are given only in the Babli: An animal which gores is intent on causing damage; therefore the rules are different for known agressive or generally not agressive animals since these require different levels of supervision. But the rules for damage caused by feeding and trampling are the same for all animals.</i>; neither of them who are alive is like the pit<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">It is obvious and confirmed by all other sources that the positions of “pit” and “fire” have to be switched.</i> which is not alive, nor either of them which move in causing damage is like the fire<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">It is obvious and confirmed by all other sources that the positions of “pit” and “fire” have to be switched.</i> which does not move in causing damage. The common theme of them is that they are usually causing damage and you are obligated to watch them, and if damage was caused the person causing the damage is obligated to pay the damages in best quality land<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If the person causing the damage cannot pay, the person collecting damages can foreclose the culprit’s land with the highest value per unit of surface area. As biblical law, this applies to damages caused by unattended animals, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:4" href="/Exodus.22.4"><i>Ex.</i> 22:4</a>.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “There are four main categories of damages,” etc. The bull means the horn, as is written: “If a man’s bull smite another person’s bull,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:35" href="/Exodus.21.35"><i>Ex.</i> 21:35</a>.</i>” etc. So far a harmless animal<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It has no history of attacking other animals.

The same explanation of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:4" href="/Exodus.22.4"><i>Ex.</i> 22:4</a> by <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 32:20" href="/Isaiah.32.20"><i>Is.</i> 32:20</a> is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 2b" href="/Bava_Kamma.2b">Babli, 2b</a>.</i>: “Those who <i>send</i> the foot of bull and donkey.” And it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 5:5" href="/Isaiah.5.5"><i>Is.</i> 5:5</a>.</i>: “Remove its cover and it will be despoiled,” that is the tooth, “tear down its fence and it will be trampled,” that is the foot.

We have stated: “Four main categories of damages.” But Rebbi Ḥiyya stated thirteen<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 9:1" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).9.1">Tosephta 9:1</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 4b" href="/Bava_Kamma.4b">Babli 4b</a> in the name of R. Hoshaia. The list contains 9 items; together with the 4 mentioned in the Mishnah there are 13.</i>: Damages, suffering, medical costs, loss of earning power, shame<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">These five kinds of payment are due for injuries suffered at the hands of another person, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 8:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.8.1.1">Mishnah 8:1</a>; it is based on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:19" href="/Exodus.21.19"><i>Ex.</i> 21:19</a>. “Suffering” means [payment for]bodily pain; “shame” refers to [payment for] mental anguish caused by loss of face.</i>; the unpaid trustee, and the borrower, the paid trustee, and the renter<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">These four entries do not refer to kinds of payments for damages but to the obligations of persons who hold other people’s property in case that property is lost, stolen, or damaged, as specified in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 7:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Metzia.7.6.1">Mishnah <i>Bava meṣi‘a</i> 7:9</a> (based on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:6-12" href="/Exodus.22.6-12"><i>Ex.</i> 22:6–12</a>). The unpaid trustee does not pay if he can swear that he did not use the property; the borrower pays for everything; the paid trustee and the renter have to pay for what was lost or stolen but may swear that it was not their fault if the damage was caused by an act of God or forcible robbery.</i>. Say now, what we stated [refers to] responsibility for damages<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A literal translation would be: “Qualification for damages”. The reference is to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>: “Anything which I am obliged to guard, I qualify [myself as responsible] for damages.” [Noted by S. Pinchas, <i>New explanations of some unclear passages in the Yerushalmi,</i> Sinai 133 (2004) 174–180 (Hebrew); but the relation was already noted by Eliahu Fulda.]. All damages payable for actions of one’s animals are really fines for the owner’s negligence in watching his animal.</i>. What Rebbi Ḥiyya stated [refers to] both responsibility for damages and bodily injury<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 4b" href="/Bava_Kamma.4b">Babli, 4b</a>, this explanation is attributed to Samuel.</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai asked: How can we state “four main categories”? If everything was said about one bull; let us state “three,” if it was said about three bulls, let us state “five”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Of the categories of damages indicated in the Mishnah, three refer to actions of cattle: goring, trampling, and feeding. If one classifies the damages according to their origins, there should be three (cattle, humans, fire); if by categories there should be five.</i>! But as it is presented in the verse, thus it is presented in the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">22,</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>foot</i> and <i>tooth</i> are interpretations of one and the same verse, they are counted as one in the Mishnah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A similar expression is used in <i>Berakhot</i> 2:4 (Note 192).</i>.
The derivatives of the horn<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In a differently formulated version in <i>Šabbat</i> 7 (9d l. 61), “pushing” is missing. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 2b" href="/Bava_Kamma.2b">Babli, 2b</a>, the list is even shorter. In <i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael, Mišpaṭim</i> 12, the formulation of the list is attributed to R. Josia. The Babli’s list is also in <i>Mekhilta dR. Simeon ben Ioḥai, Mišpaṭim,</i> p. 278.</i>: Goring<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The biblical expression (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:28" href="/Exodus.21.28"><i>Ex.</i>21:28</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:31" href="/Exodus.21.31">31</a>) used to describe the attack by an animal on a human.</i>, hitting<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex.</i> 22:35, used for attacks on other animals.</i>, biting<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Since the animal bites with the intent of causing damage, biting is put in the category of goring, “horn”, rather than under feeding, “the mouth”.</i>, wallowing, kicking, and pushing<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Pushing with its body, not its horns.</i>. Rebbi Isaac asked: Hitting and goring are fundamental<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Anything mentioned in the biblical text is fundamental; any damage not mentioned in the biblical text is a derivative of one of the biblical causes.</i>, and you call them derivative? But he starts with the fundamentals and ends with the derivatives<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli, this is a declarative statement.</i>.
Derivatives of the pit: The entire third Chapter of Mishnah <i>Neziqin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava qamma</i> Chapter 3. The “pit” is the paradigm for any obstacle put in the public domain by a private person.</i>. Rebbi stated: Somebody put a glowing coal in the public domain, another person came and stumbled over it while a flask was in his hand<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A typical scenario discussed in Chapter 3.</i>. If as a consequence that person’s clothing was singed and the flask in his hand was broken, he<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The person who caused the accident by leaving the burning coal in the public domain.</i> is obligated for the flask because of ‘pit’, and for the garments because of ‘fire’.
Derivatives of the ‘foot’: It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 1:6" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).1.6">Tosephta 1:6</a>; a different version in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 17b" href="/Bava_Kamma.17b">Babli 17b</a>.</i>: For an animal which entered a private property<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:4" href="/Exodus.22.4"><i>Ex.</i> 22:4</a> limits strict responsibility of the owner to an animal of his which causes damage “on another person’s field”; full damages for <i>foot</i> and <i>tooth</i> are due only for damages caused on private property of a person other than the animal’s owner.</i> and caused damage, whether by its forefoot, or by its hindfoot, or by its horn<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Not by goring but by causing damage walking.</i>, or by the yoke on it, or by a sack on it, or by the carriage it was drawing, one pays full damages. And one who causes damage in a <i>karmelit</i> pays full damages<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence refers to the topic of Chapter Two and states that the notion of “private domain” for torts is not identical with the same notion for property rights. <i>Karmelit</i> is a part of the public domain not really accessible to the public. The two main examples are “the sides of a thoroughfare”, the part of a street close to the houses if that part is not easy to use for walking because of stairs extending from houses or the fronts of the houses do not form a straight line. The other is “valley”, a rural access path which is public domain, not a thoroughfare but meant only as path for use by the farmers working adjacent fields. For the rules of the Sabbath, <i>karmelit</i> is neither private nor public.</i>.
Derivatives of the tooth. They wanted to say that if a cow ate barley<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 19b" href="/Bava_Kamma.19b">Babli 19b</a>. It will be established later that the owner of an animal is guilty of negligence if he does not prevent his animal from causing foreseeable damage. But if the animal shows unusual, not foreseeable, behavior, he pays only half the damage caused by it. One might assume that if an animal eats anything that does not belong to its regular feed the owner should pay only half of the damages. This is rejected; all edibles are potential feed for all animals.</i>, or a donkey ate leeks, or a dog licked olive oil, or a pig<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rashba reads: “A cat ate a large piece of meat”.</i> ate meat, all of these are derivatives of the tooth. Rebbi Isaac said, all these are of the essence of the tooth. But did we not state “derivatives of the tooth”? If it stepped on a skin full of oil<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The animal steps on a container of olive oil, breaks it, and by this has its foot drenched in oil. One has to judge this under the rules of damage by “tooth”, not “foot”.</i>, since its body enjoys anointing. As one says in general, the tooth eats and the body enjoys, so also here the body enjoys. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: If in walking if was disgorging grasses<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Usually ruminants lie down while ruminating. Kosher animals are all ruminants. If an animal was ruminating while walking, losing some of its cud in walking and thereby causing damage: is this foreseeable or not foreseeable damage?</i>, what is the rule? Rebbi Yose said, just as one who puts a burning coal to<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The expression מניח ל is very unusual. One would have expected either מניח ב or an additional word like מַנִּיחַ סָמוּךְ לִרְשׁוּת הָרַבּים “puts close to the public domain”. This may be intended here, <i>viz</i>., that the hot coal was put on the border but not strictly inside the public domain.</i> the public domain, it causes damage as far as it moves<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The animal is expected to cause damage anywhere it moves; the damage is foreseeable.</i>. What does this mean? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, explain it if somebody puts a knife close to the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">And somebody in the public domain is hurt by it. He shows that this damage has to be judged under the rules of damage by fire.</i>. As you say there, if the fire touches one side, it trembles in its entirety, so also here, a human touches<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The knife.</i> on one side and trembles in his entirety. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Levi: If a pit is full of water and a small lamb fell in, if water enters its ears it trembles in its entirety, so here it trembles in its entirety. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: If in walking it tore out grasses with its body or its horns, what is the rule? Is this out of the ordinary? It is its common behavior<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The animal’s owner is responsible for the entire damage.</i>.
Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac: If “the bull” had not been written, I would have inferred the bull from the pit<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">He wants to prove that the different categories mentioned in the biblical text are necessary; one cannot be subsumed under the other.</i>. Since for the pit, which is not usually moving, one has to pay full damages, not so much more for the bull which usually is moving<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">But for damages inflicted through goring by an animal which has no history of doing so the owner pays only half, <i>Ex..</i> 21:35.</i>? Either since for the pit one pays full damages, also the bull pays full damages, or since the bull pays half damages, also for the pit one should have to pay half damages<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This is the preceding argument in a different formulation. Since the rules of payment are different for bull and pit, they cannot be subsumed under one rule.</i>. If “the bull” had not been written, I would have inferred the bull from the pit; if “the pit” had not been written, I would have inferred the bull from the pit. Why was it stated here? Because there are many things<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The later text shows that one should read here: “Because there are many things to be stated;” the differences between the rules for bull and pit are many.</i>. Similarly, the seat is not like the bed and the bed is not like the seat<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In the rules of impurity of the sufferer from gonorrhea, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 15:4-5" href="/Leviticus.15.4-5"><i>Lev.</i> 15:4–5</a> proclaims the impurity of his bed and v. 6 that of his seat. Why do seat and bed have to be mentioned separately? In the <i>baraita</i> of R. Ismael (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Braita d'Rabbi Yishmael 5" href="/Sifra,_Braita_d'Rabbi_Yishmael.5"><i>Sifra,</i> Introduction 5</a>) the rules common to seat and bed are declared valid for any implement used for human rest, as illustration of the third hermeneutical rule “a principle derived from one paragraph”.</i>. One understands that the seat is not like the bed. The seat a square <i>ṭephaḥ</i> large can become impure; the bed four <i>ṭephaḥim</i> large can become impure<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Meilah 18a" href="/Meilah.18a">Babli <i>Me‘ilah</i> 18a</a>. While textiles in general can become impure, small snippets cannot. Cloth being woven cannot become impure unless it has a size which makes it usable. This depends on the intended use. Cloth intended as cover of a seat becomes impure once it contains a square of side length of one handbreadth (probably 9.1 cm); for the cover of a bed one requires a square of four handbreadths.</i>. Because He declared a bed four <i>ṭephaḥim</i> large as impure, would a seat a square <i>ṭephaḥ</i> large become impure<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">There is no logical necessity here. The rules for the impurity of beds are detailed in <i><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Metzora, Chapter 2" href="/Sifra,_Metzora,_Chapter_2">Sifra Meṣora‘, Pereq Zabim, Pereq 2</a>, Parašah 2;</i> those for seats are in <i>Pereq</i> 3:1–4.</i>? If the seat had not been written, I would have inferred seat from bed. Why was it stated here? Because there are many things to be stated. Similarly, the paragraph on lighting the candles is not like the paragraph about exiling the impure and the paragraph on exiling the impure is not like the paragraph about lighting the candles<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Baraita</i> of R. Ismael (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Braita d'Rabbi Yishmael 6" href="/Sifra,_Braita_d'Rabbi_Yishmael.6"><i>Sifra,</i> Introduction 6</a>) as illustration of the second part of the third hermeneutical rule “a principle derived from two paragraphs”; the main argument is in <i>Sifry Num.</i> 1. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:1-4" href="/Numbers.5.1-4"><i>Num.</i> 5:1–4</a>, Moses is instructed to <i>command</i> the Children of Israel to remove lepers, sufferers from gonorrhea, and those impure from the impurity of the dead from the camp. It is noted that the command was executed immediately. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 8:3" href="/Numbers.8.3"><i>Num.</i> 8:3</a> it is stated that Aaron lit the lights in the Sanctuary exactly as the Eternal had <i>commanded</i> Moses. R. Ismael infers that everywhere in the Pentateuch, a <i>command</i> is to be executed immediately (and permanently).</i>. If the paragraph about exiling the impure had not been written, I would have inferred the rules of the paragraph on exiling the impure from the paragraph on lighting the candles. Why was it stated here? Because there are many things to be stated<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">As Ravad notes in his Commentary to <i>Sifra,</i> these differences are nowhere noted.</i>. So what is equal about them is that they are “command” here and in future generations, so everything by “command” is for here and for future generations<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Tzav" href="/Sifra,_Tzav"><i>Sifra Ṣaw</i> 1:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 21:1-24:23" href="/Leviticus.21.1-24.23"><i>Emor Parašah</i> 13:1</a>;</i>. Rebbi La said, it is necessary that all<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The four categories mentioned in the Mishnah.</i> be written; and the bull teaches that the owners have to deal with the cadaver<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:36" href="/Exodus.21.36"><i>Ex.</i> 21:36</a>, speaking of the bull with a history of goring, requires the owner of the goring bull to pay full damages and concludes “the cadaver shall be his.” This “his” (and the parallel in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:34" href="/Exodus.21.34">v. 34</a>) is interpreted as “the claimant’s” in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 10b" href="/Bava_Kamma.10b">Babli 10b</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 53b" href="/Bava_Kamma.53b">53b</a>; <i>Mekhilta dR.

The argument is that since full damages are due, one could assume that the payor had acquired the carcass and no mention of it would be necessary.</i>. But it is written, “and the cadaver shall be his”, and it is written for the pit, “and the cadaver shall be his”<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">This seems to disprove R. La’s statement. If the same rule is explicit for the agressive goring bull and the pit, one would have to assume that it does not hold for any other kinds of damages.</i>! Rebbi Ismael said, this excludes real estate which cannot be moved<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This is difficult to understand since real estate cannot fall into a pit. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 6:14" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).6.14">Tosephta 6:14</a>, one excludes payment for broken vessels if there is no residual value in the pieces.</i>; it excludes a human because there can be no usufruct from him in death<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 6:14" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).6.14">Tosephta 6:14</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 53b" href="/Bava_Kamma.53b">Babli 53b</a>.</i>. But the fire teaches for all of them that one is responsible for accidents<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">This is another commentary on R. La’s statement. Also damages for losses by fire teach another principle. Since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:5" href="/Exodus.22.5"><i>Ex.</i> 22:5</a> reads “If fire gets out of control … the person who started the fire has to pay,” even if he started the fire perfectly legally on his own property. This establishes general liability for damages caused by accident. A similar text is in <i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael Mišpaṭim</i> 14. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 26b" href="/Bava_Kamma.26b">Babli, 26b</a>, derives a similar principle from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:24-25" href="/Exodus.21.24-25"><i>Ex.</i> 21:24–25</a>.</i>.
Rebbi Yose said: This means that a person who injured another first has to pay even if he later becomes injured, as is written: “He who injures an animal has to pay for it,” he has to pay the diminution in value<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The statement of R. Yose belongs to the discussion of the last part of the Mishnah, that if damage was caused the person responsible is obligated to pay for the damages. The sentence starting with “as is written” does not belong to R. Yose’s text.</i>.
New Paragraph. “If damage was caused the person responsible is obligated to pay for the damages,” etc. Rebbi Ḥanina said, “he who injures an animal has to pay for it<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 24:18" href="/Leviticus.24.18"><i>Lev.</i> 24:18</a>, incorrect quote.

Is it subject to a declaration of notoriety in a matter extraneous to its body<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The verse makes a clear distinction between “harmless” cattle, which are not known to gore humans, and “notorious” cattle which have a history of such attacks.

Rebbi Eleazar said: If it produced dung, one pays full damages. For if it were not so, what would we say? He has to have a receptacle handy? That is to say, if it does not do so habitually.

Therefore, cow dung in a place open to cattle, such as a grazing area or a public road, cannnot be a cause for damage claims. This is the statement missing in the text, to which the note “for if it were not so” refers. The question remains whether in using a road, e. g., passing through a market place, the herder has to make sure that his animals are safely away from any merchandise. If there is an animal whose preferred place for defecating is near edibles, its owner is required to follow it, bucket in hand, to avoid having to pay full damages.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If his jar was broken in the public domain and another person slipped on the water or was hurt by one of its shards, he must pay. Rebbi Jehudah said, if intentionally, he has to pay; if unintentionally, he is free.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If his jar was broken in the public domain,” etc. Rebbi Eleazar said, they disagree at the moment of the accident. But after the accident everybody agrees that he must pay<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As explained at length in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 29" href="/Bava_Kamma.29">Babli, 29a/b</a>, Rebbi Jehudah holds that in using the public domain one has to be mindful of others who use the same space. Therefore a person who runs into the scene of an accident is negligent and has no claim for damages. The majority hold that follow-up accidents are the responsibility of the person who caused the first accident. R. Jehudah will agree that if he did not remove the obstacle which the accident created, he becomes ‘owner’ of his ‘pit’ by biblical decree.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the disagreement is both at the moment of the accident and afterwards<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since the public domain is strewn with shards and other debris, these are ownerless and no responsibility can be pinned on anybody.<br>The position of R. Joḥanan is not clear in any of the Talmudim. The Rome text presents two opinions attributed to R. Johanan, the one quoted here and “they disagree at the moment of the accident, but after the accident everybody agrees that he is free.”</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan objected to Rebbi Eleazar: If he does not have to pay at the moment of the accident, is it not an inference <i>de minore ad majus</i> afterwards<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That he should be freed from liability as explained in the preceding Note. Rome text: “is it not an inference <i>de minore ad majus</i> that afterwards he has to pay?” In S. Lieberman’s opinion (in his notes to A. H. Freimann’s edition of the Rome text), the Rome ms. represents an amalgamation of two different sources.</i>? Why should he be free at the moment of the accident? For a person declares his damaged property in the public domain as ownerless<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Accepted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 29" href="/Bava_Kamma.29">Babli, 29a/b</a>.</i>. A <i>baraita</i> supports both of them, as it was stated: “The Sages agree with Rebbi Jehudah that somebody who puts down his stone or his load in the public domain does not have to pay if another person stumbled over it, for on this condition did Joshua distribute the Land<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody has the right to fair use of public property. It is perfectly normal that one should be able to put down one’s load for a time before continuing on his journey, and other people have to be aware of this and be considerate. Private property on public grounds becomes ‘pit’ only at the moment it is left there unsupervised.<br>In general, “conditions on which Joshua did distribute the Land” refer to public uses of private property; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 13:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.13.7.2"><i>Ketubot</i> 13:7 Note 107</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 7:1:21" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.7.1.21"><i>Nazir</i> 7:1 Note 40</a>. This condition is not mentioned in any other source.</i>.” Therefore, if Joshua had not distributed the Land on this condition, he would have to pay. In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan, if he intended use of the potsherds<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the discussion of what R. Jehudah calls “intentional accident” which makes the owner of the jar liable. If the owner of the jar intends to use the shards (e. g., as writing material), he does not declare them ownerless and the reason given for freeing him from payment does not apply.</i>. In the opinion of Rebbi Eleazar, if he intended to cause damage<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">If he does not clean up after the accident, he shows that he does not care about what happens to others; this explains R. Eleazar’s opinion that after the accident even R. Jehudah requires payment.</i>. Rebbi Ze‘ira and Rebbi La both say that Rebbi Jehudah agrees with the Sages that one has to pay if he declares his bull who gored in the public domain ownerless. Stationary damage cannot be compared to walking damage.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who pours out water in the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Illicit use of public domain.</i> is liable for the damage if another person is hurt because of this. He who puts away a thorn, or glass, or who fences his fence with thorns, or [owns] a fence which collapsed into the public domain, is liable for the damage if other persons are hurt because of this<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is somewhat too compressed. If somebody puts away dangerous things (a thorn, broken glass) in the public domain he is liable for any ensuing damage. The same holds if he fences in his orchard by a thorny hedge and the thorns grow into the public domain; he is liable for hurt caused within the public domain. If any of his property, fence, or wall collapses into the public domain, he is liable for any damages caused.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “He who pours out water in the public domain,” etc. Rav Huna said, when he was falling to the ground. But if his garments were dirtied, one is liable. Rav said, even if his garments were dirtied, he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since the text is confirmed by the parallel mss., it cannot be amended. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 30a" href="/Bava_Kamma.30a">Babli, 30a</a>, Rav holds that the person pouring out the water is liable only for clothing, not for injury to the person slipping in the water; Rav Huna objects. Since pouring out water is intentional, even R. Jehudah (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.3.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>) will agree that ‘pit’ was created at the moment of the pouring; in this case there is no difference in liability during or after the pouring. One has to conclude that the Yerushalmi reports a Babylonian tradition diametrically opposed to that reported in the Babli: Everybody agrees that for personal injury the person who is to blame has to pay; for vessels it is a dispute (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 3:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.3.1.8">Note 34</a>).</i>. The word of Rav implies one is not liable for ‘pit’ damages of vessels.
“If somebody hides a thorn or [a piece of] glass in another person’s wall; if the owner of the wall then tears it down and a third person is hurt, he is liable. The pious people of earlier times used to take them out<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This is the text of the mss. and the Tosephta; it was changed by the corrector of the Venice edition to מצניעין “they buried them”.</i> into their fields, lower than three handbreadths so that the plough would not lift them<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 2:6" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).2.6">Tosephta 2:6</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 30a" href="/Bava_Kamma.30a">Babli 30a</a>. It is unclear who has to pay; probably it is the person who put the glass into the hole in the wall. In the interpretation of the Babli, he only has to pay if the wall was already weakened and one could foresee that it had to be taken down; this certainly is not the position of the Yerushalmi.</i>.”
New Paragraph. “He fences his fence with thorns.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, explain it according to everybody if it grew outwardly<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">If the thorns grow into the public domain, the owner of the hedge is responsible. If the hedge is cut exactly at the border of the private domain, most authorities in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 30a" href="/Bava_Kamma.30a">Babli, 30a</a>, hold that people do not walk too close to a wall or a hedge and, therefore, the owner of the hedge is not liable for injuries occurring on his property line.</i>. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Ze‘ira: Why do we not explain it following Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah who said, three [handbreadths] close to a domain are counted with the domain<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In Babylonian sources, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 50a" href="/Bava_Kamma.50a">Babli 50a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 6:4" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).6.4">Tosephta 6:4</a>, he is quoted as requiring any potential danger in a private domain to be at least <i>four</i> handbreadths away from the boundary.

“A fence which collapsed into the public domain.” Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: This is Rebbi Meïr’s, since Rebbi Meïr said, one is liable for damage caused by inaction.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody take out his straw and his pressed olives,” etc. What did he acquire? The House of Yannai said, the increase in value.

Ḥizqiah said, only if he turned it over to acquire<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This now refers to cow dung. The parallel mss. and Medieval quotes all have an additional sentence: If he did not turn it over with the intention of acquiring, it was not acquired.</i>.

Rebbi Aḥa said, would that not<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with the Rome fragment לית for ליי in the text.

For a first theft he cannot be prosecuted as rebellious son; one would expect that all the rules of theft apply to him. But he cannot be prosecuted as rebellious son if he never was convicted of the first theft. Of the 200% of the stolen amount which the law on theft requires him to pay, the first 100% are restitution. But the second 100% are a fine. Can the fine be collected if in some indeterminate future the conviction might be an integral part of a capital case?</i> Or since he is warned of a capital offense should he be freed? Let us hear from the following: If somebody steals another’s wallet<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The theft occurs in the victim’s home. The thief is guilty of theft at the moment he lifts the wallet; he is guilty of desecrating the Sabbath only when he removes it from the house into the public domain.</i> and removes it on the Sabbath he is liable since he already is liable for the theft of the wallet before he comes in conflict with the holiness of the Sabbath.

Here<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The case of the rebellious son.</i> also, even though he is forewarned of a capital offense, you say that he has to be liable. Rebbi Yannai bar Ismael said, Rebbi Hoshaia follows his own opinion, as we have stated: He who takes out is guilty even if he did not put down<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">For the rabbis, the Sabbath is desecrated only by a complete prohibited action. Transport has three parts: Lifting an article, transporting it (which under certain circumstances is prohibited on the Sabbath) and putting the article down. For the rabbis, a person cannot be prosecuted for desecration of the Sabbath if he takes an object in a private domain, takes it out to the public domain and never stops moving until the end of the Sabbath (R. Joḥanan in <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 2b l. 40, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 31a" href="/Ketubot.31a">Babli <i>Ketubot</i> 31a</a>). R. Hoshaia disagrees. However, the reason might be that he follows Ben Azai (<i>Šabbat</i>1:1, 2c l. 41; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 31b" href="/Ketubot.31b">Babli <i>Ketubot</i> 31b</a>) who holds that walking is like standing still.

Therefore, if both obligations do not fall on him simultaneously, he is liable.

If a bull of orphans and guardians went out and did damage, what is the rule? Rebbi Joḥanan said, [the damage is paid] from the orphan’s property.

Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina follows Abba Shaul and Rebbi Joḥanan the rabbis, as it was stated there: “A guardian appointed by the orphans’ father shall be made to swear; if he was appointed by the court he shall not be made to swear,” for the court will check him out. “Abba Shaul says, it is the other way around,” a guardian appointed by the orphans’ father shall not be made to swear; it would be as if he would take a pledge from him. If he was appointed by the court he shall be made to swear, since a person will do much to be called trustworthy.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A bull gored a cow and her fetus<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A dead fetus after a miscarriage.</i> was found beside her. If it is not known whether she gave birth before she was gored<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, the owner of the bull would not have to pay for the miscarriage.</i> or gave birth after she was gored, he pays half the damages for the cow<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The normal amount for damage caused by a tame bull.</i> and a quarter for the fetus<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since the owner of the cow cannot prove that the bull caused the miscarriage but neither can the owner of the bull prove that his animal did not cause it, and the bull’s attack on the cow is proved by two witnesses, the claim of damages for the fetus is “money in doubt” which is split evenly, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.1.3"><i>Ketubot</i> 2:1, Note 9</a>.</i>.<br>And similarly, if a cow gored an ox and her calf is found next to her, but it is not known whether she gave birth before or after she gored<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If at the moment of her goring the calf was part of her body, it is available to be sold to cover the damages. But if it was born before the goring, it is not available to the owner of the bull. Therefore, the claim of the bull’s owner on the calf cannot exceed a quarter of its value.</i>, he pays half the damage from the cow and a quarter from the calf.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A bull gored a cow”, etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a slight reformulation of a passage in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.1.3"><i>Ketubot</i> 2:1, Notes 9–11</a>.</i> Do all cows have miscarriages? Should we follow the majority of cases? This implies that in criminal cases and in money matters one does not apply a majority argument. Rebbi Yose said, in another case they applied a majority argument in criminal cases and in money matters, as Rebbi Aḥa stated: <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 3:6" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).3.6">Tosephta 3:6</a>.</i>“If a camel was in heat among camels and one finds one of them dead, I am saying that certainly the one in heat killed it.”
<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In mss. and <i>editio princeps,</i> this paragraph is part of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 5:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.5.1.2">Halakhah 1</a>. But it clearly refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 5:1:1-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.5.1.1-3">Mishnah 2</a>.</i> And Rebbi Yannai said, so is the Mishnah: He pays half of the damage from the cow and the owner of the calves returns a quarter to the owner of the cow<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He refers the Mishnah to the case where the rancher sold the expected calf of his pregnant cow to a third party. The owner of the bull has to be indemnified by the cow’s owner alone, but the latter has regress on the calf’s owner up to a quarter of its value.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 46b" href="/Bava_Kamma.46b">Babli, 46b</a>, has another approach: If the cow is available, he collects half his damages from the cow. If the cow is not available, he collects a quarter of his damages from the calf.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, each of them gives half<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that the owner of the bull has to collect separately, first half of his claim of half the the damages up to a quarter of the calf’s value and then the remainder from the cow’s owner.</i>. What is the difference between them? If the calves died. According to him who said, he pays half of the damage from the cow and a quarter of the damage from the calf, each one pays his part of the damage. According to him who said, he pays half of the damage from the cow and the owner of the calves returns a quarter to the owner of the cow, one pays the damage, but the other one says, I did not want these, here they are before you<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the carcass of the calf is not worthless, he may return the dead bodies and claim his money back.</i>.
“And similarly, if a cow gored an ox,” etc. Rebbi Abun bar Cahana asked before Rebbi Immi: Because it is in doubt; therefore if it were certain, each one would give half<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Why is the calf treated on an equal footing with the cow? Is not the calf here only an appendix to the cow?</i>? Would I say that a foot of a person is the entire person? Each one would give half? He said to him, the Mishnah deals with a notorious animal<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It is difficult to accept this reading since the Mishnah clearly speaks of half damages, but it is confirmed by all quotes of this paragraph in Medieval sources.</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A similar text is in Tosephta <i>‘Arakhin</i> 3:9,10.</i>“Its foot is sold to you,” he sold half<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The side to which the foot belongs.</i>. “Its second foot is sold to you,” he sold half of the [remaining] half<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since he did not say that he was selling the other half, something is not sold. Therefore, sale of the unborn calf can be treated as sale of a quarter interest in the cow. If the cow were notorious, the owner of the calf would be liable as holder of a quarter interest in the cow.</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, all these traditions are Levi’s<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As the Babli points out, 46a, both Mishnaiot have to be rejected. Instead of an appeal to Symmachos’s principle that “one splits money in doubt”, one rules that “the burden of proof is on the claimant” and in the absence of witnesses the owner of the injured animal has no chance to prove any claim he might have on the calf. R. Simeon ben Laqish seems to attribute to Levi the acceptance of Symmachos’s rule in these cases.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If a potter put his pots in a private courtyard without permission and an animal of the owner broke them, [the owner] is not liable; if [the animal] was hurt, the owner of the pots is liable. But if he puts them there with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If a potter put his pots,” etc. If he put his pots in a private courtyard without permission and a bull came from another place and broke them, he<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The bull’s owner.</i> is not liable.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody put his produce in a private courtyard without permission and an animal of the owner ate them, [the owner] is not liable; if [the animal] was hurt, the owner of the produce is liable. But if he puts them there with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If somebody put his produce in a private courtyard,” etc. If he put his produce in a private courtyard without permission and a bull came from another place and ate them, he is not liable. If it was hurt by them, he is not liable. This implies that the ‘tooth’ is not liable in a courtyard which belongs to neither party.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody put his bull in a private courtyard without permission and the owner’s bull gored it or his dog bit it, [the owner] is not liable; if it gored the owner’s bull, he<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The bull’s owner.</i> is liable.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If a bull intended [to hurt] another bull but hit a woman who then had a miscarriage, he is not liable.

The argument of the rabbis seems inverted. There they say, including what is hidden; but here they say, except what is hidden?

But if there are witnesses, everybody agrees with Rebbi (Yose)<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">One has to read: Jehudah, with Rosh (Chapter 6, #16).</i> as it was stated: <sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 6:24" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).6.24">Tosephta 6:24</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 62a" href="/Bava_Kamma.62a">Babli 62a</a>.</i>“If it was a stack of wheat sheaves covered with barley or a stack of barley sheaves covered with wheat, he pays for a stack of barley.” As the following: A person deposited a tied sack with another person, when something happened.

[ ]<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Add with Rosh and Alfasi (#125): “Rav said.”</i> He swears and collects<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The text is elliptic; it is best explained following Nahmanides (and all Spanish commentators of the Babli.) The first problem is what is the connection between the story and the question at hand; the second is why the claimant may swear and collect. Nahmanides (as quoted by Rashba <i>ad</i> <i>62a</i> and others) thinks that the sack was lost in a fire; the owner of the sack claims payment from the person responsible for the fire. Now Mishnah <i>Šebuot</i> 7:1 states that in general one only accepts an oath of a person who can absolve himself of payment by the oath. To collect money based on an oath is possible only in very few cases, one of them being the victim of a robbery. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 62a" href="/Bava_Kamma.62a">Babli, 62a</a>, it is stated that R. Jehudah equates loss by fire to loss by robbery. Since the Yerushalmi holds that the Sages mostly agree with R. Jehudah, everybody must hold that the victim of a fire may swear and collect. In the case described, since the sack was deposited tightly tied, the argument of the person with whom the sack was deposited (who may have set the fire himself), that the sack might have contained scrap metal, is not more than a conjecture and may be disregarded.<br>By the biblical law of deposits (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:6-8" href="/Exodus.22.6-8"><i>Ex</i>. 22:6–8</a>), the person holding the deposit has to swear that he did nothing to impair the deposit; then he is not liable. If he set the fire, he cannot swear and, therefore, should be required to pay without the other side being forced to swear. However, this only applies if the nature of the deposit was known. If the contents of the sack were not ascertained by the trustee when he accepted the sack, the rule that the person who cannot swear must pay is irrelevant.</i>.

Let us hear from the following: Bar Ziza’s sharecropper deposited a pound<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">A Roman pound, 345 g, an enormous value in the early 3rd Century.</i> of gold with somebody.

Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose died; the case came before Rebbi Ḥiyya who said, that argument<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">R. Ismael ben R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The obligation to make double restitution<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The general punishment of a thief, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:3" href="/Exodus.22.3"><i>Ex</i>. 22:3</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8">8</a>.</i> is more frequent than that of paying quadruple or quintuple restitution since the obligation to make double restitution applies both to living things and to inanimate objects; but the obligation of paying quadruple or quintuple restitution only applies to oxen and sheep, as it is said: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:37" href="/Exodus.21.37"><i>Ex</i>. 21:37</a> decrees quintuple payment for stolen cattle sold or slaughtered by the thief and quadruple payment for stolen sheep or goats.</i>” etc. He who steals from a thief does not pay double restitution, nor does the one who slaughters or sells after a thief pay quadruple or quintuple restitution.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The obligation to make double restitution is more frequent,” etc. From where does he get this?

The question is whether testimony becomes invalid only after the witness has been convicted of a felony or by his felonious act. While in general testimony of a criminal becomes unacceptable only after conviction, perjury carries its own conviction and all testimony rendered after one which was determined to be perjured automatically becomes void.<br>The argument presented by R. Ze‘ira is based on the end of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 7:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.7.3.1">Mishnah 3</a>: If the first testimony was perjured, the second testimony becomes void.

This proves that a later discovery of perjury invalidates testimony retroactively.</i>. Explain it by warning<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Criminal intent can be proven only if the person was duly warned that his intended action was criminal (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 8:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.8.1.4"><i>Kilaim</i> 8:1 Note 9</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:1:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.7.1.7"><i>Soṭah</i> 7:1 Note 26</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 8:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.8.1.6"><i>Nazir</i> 8:1 Note 46</a>). The court before accepting testimony has to warn the witnesses of the consequences of perjury. If both groups of witnesses were warned simultaneously, there is only one testimony and R. Ze‘ira’s argument does not prove anything.</i>, as it was stated: “Rebbi Yose said, when has this been said? For two testimonies with two warnings.

If they were standing and testifying against him on then tenth of Nisan that he had stolen an ox on the first of Nisan. He slaughtered or sold on the tenth of Nisan. They were shown to be perjured on the fifteenth of Nisan. Any testimony which they delivered between the tenth and the fifteenth of Nisan is retroactively disqualified. Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, explain it if they deliver their testimony in one group and you cannot infer anything, as we have stated: <sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Batra (Lieberman) 2:9" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Batra_(Lieberman).2.9">Tosephta <i>Bava</i> <i>batra</i> 2:9</a>. A person claims ownership of real estate currently in the possession of another person. Neither party has documentary proof. The claimant can show that he was a prior owner or is the heir of a prior owner. The person in possession claims to have bought or otherwise legally acquired the property. If the person can show by testimony that the claimant had failed to protest during three years in which he had undisturbed and continuous possession, the court will declare him the legal owner.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If one gave something to artisans to repair and they broke it, they are liable.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One who robbed from a proselyte,” etc. Ḥilfai and Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina said, this is Rebbi Yose the Galilean’s, as Rebbi Yose the Galiean explained: Of what does the verse speak? About one who robbed from a proselyte, swore to him, who then died, that he would pay the capital and the fifth to the priests and the reparation offering to the altar. “If the man have no relative,” he who needs atonement is obligated; this excludes the one who does not need atonement. Rebbi Aqiba explained when he came from Zephyrium<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly the town in Cyprus (Cape Paphos).</i>: About one who robbed from a proselyte, swore to him, who then died, that he would pay the capital and the fifth to the priests and the reparation offering to the altar, as it is said: “If the man have no relative,” etc. The only person in Israel who has no relative is the proselyte. Rav and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, it is Rebbi Aqiba’s who said that the wrongly acquired property has to be returned in any case<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The paragraph is elliptic; its meaning can be ascertained from the parallels in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 109a" href="/Bava_Kamma.109a">Babli 109a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 10:16" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).10.16">Tosephta 10:16</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Bava Kamma (Lieberman) 10:17" href="/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma_(Lieberman).10.17">17</a>, <i>Sifry Num.</i> #4 (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bamidbar Rabbah 8:7" href="/Bamidbar_Rabbah.8.7"><i>Num. rabba</i>8(7</a>), <i>Yalquṭ</i> #701). Both R. Yose the Galilean and R. Aqiba agree that “the man without relative” must be a proselyte who failed to start a Jewish family. (In <i>Sifry,</i> this statement is attributed to R. Ismael.) The rules of inheritance imply that the property of the deceased proselyte becomes ownerless; therefore anything held by another person at the proselyte’s death becomes property of the holder. If the robber confessed his guilt after the proselyte’s death, the money becomes the Eternal’s property Who gives it to the priests. If the robber confessed his guilt to the proselyte, even if the proselyte agrees to payment at a later date, turning the debt into a loan, when he dies the robber does not acquire the money since he cannot atone for his guilt as long as the money is in his hand. If the robber dies before he returned the money, for R. Yose the Galilean the money becomes part of the robber’s estate since the dead “do not need atonement.” R. Aqiba holds that the money does not become part of the estate since “wrongly acquired property has to be returned in any case,” and the heirs have to turn the money over to the priests. <i>Sifry</i> notes that R. Aqiba agreed with R. Yose the Galilean before he went to Zephyrium but there changed his opinion. (The Tosephta attributes R. Yose the Galilean’s argument to R. Aqiba).</i>.

Jehudah requires the money to be transferred to the offerers of the sacrifice, the Sages that the sacrifice be transferred to the recipients of the money.”<br>Both watches acted incorrectly by not checking whether the money had been delivered before the sacrifice. If each watch received their part during their week then clearly the situation is that of the Mishnah where a new offering is needed if the first one is not available to the second watch. But if the second watch received the money at the same time the first received the sacrifice, then R. Jehudah and the Sages disagree about who has to give up his part.</i> Rebbi said, following Rebbi Jehudah’s words if the men from Yehoiarib offered the reparation offering there was no atonement; but the money should be transferred from the men of Yedaiah to the men of Yehoiarib; the men from Yehoiarib then shall offer the reparation offering for atonement.” This implies that one removes the money given to men of a watch not during their week. He who said that they disagree about one week, if he gave the money to Yehoiarib on Yedaiah’s watch and the reparation offering to Yedaiah on Yehoiarib’s watch<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">The sacrifice one week before the delivery of the money.</i>, means that he did not fulfill his obligation, etc. This implies that one does not remove a sacrifice which men of a watch received during their week. But if the watch of the men of Yehoiarib dragged their feet, then the <i>baraita</i> implies that they dragged their feet after the men of Yehoiarib received the reparation offering after days<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The watch cannot keep the animal for 24 weeks until their turn comes again.</i>, and there is no atonement. But one has to transfer the money from the men of Yedaiah to the men of Yehoiarib, the men of Yedaiah<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">In E: “Yehoiarib”. This clearly is a corruption. But the text common to both mss. is also incorrect. Since the hypothesis was that the money had been given to Yehoiarib, it is clear that one has to read: “One has to transfer the money from the men of <i>Yehoiarib</i> to the men of <i>Yedaiah</i>.”</i> shall offer the reparation offering, and there will be atonement. This implies that if men of a watch received a sacrifice during their week but were lazy and did not offer it, one removes it from their hand.

Halakhah 7

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He who says to another: I robbed you, or I took a loan from you, you deposited with me, but I do not known whether I returned it to you or did not return it, is liable to pay. But if he said to him: I do not know whether I robbed you, or I took a loan from you, or you deposited with me or did not deposit, he is not liable to pay.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “He who says to another: I robbed you,” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, if he wants to clear himself before Heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Without a definitive claim from the other party, there is no case for the courts. “Liable” and “not liable” in this Mishnah refer to moral, not legal, obligations. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 118a" href="/Bava_Kamma.118a">Babli 118a</a>.</i>. I robbed you, or I took a loan from you, you deposited with me; did I return it to you?

Sabbatai Cohen (<i>Šakh, Ḥošen Mišpaṭ</i> §95 Note 67) reads “<i>You</i> robbed me, etc. I did return it to you, but the other party says, I do not know.”</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah wanted to say, he is required to make good as a matter of law. Rebbi Yose wanted to say, still it is to become clear before Heaven.
