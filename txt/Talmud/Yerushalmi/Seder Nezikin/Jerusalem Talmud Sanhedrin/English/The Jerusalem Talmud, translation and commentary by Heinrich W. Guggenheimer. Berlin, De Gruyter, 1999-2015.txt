<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Money matters<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Not only litigation involving loans, inheritances, gifts, or real estate, but also distribution of public funds (cf.

Therefore, the rabbinic interpretation of the paragraph is that the husband presents witnesses to the fact that his wife committed adultery while preliminarily married to him. A preliminarily married woman is married in respect to criminal but not civil law (cf. Introduction to Tractate <i>Qiddušin</i>).<br>Another aspect of criminal law in this case is the law of perjury, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:18-19" href="/Deuteronomy.19.18-19"><i>Deut.</i> 19:18–19</a>. Since the husband’s witnesses intended to have the woman stoned, if they are shown to be perjured they themselves are stoned. Therefore, the case may be heard only in a court competent to impose death sentences.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Money matters are judged by three [judges],” etc. From where comes this? <i>These shall be the laws of procedure to you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 35:29" href="/Numbers.35.29"><i>Num.</i> 35:29</a>. The chapter covers the rules of levitic cities, laws of property, and of the homicide, criminal law.</i> I would say that both civil cases and criminal cases are subject to the rules of verification and examination<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.4.1.1">Mishnah 4:1</a>. <i>Examination</i> refers to cross-examination relating to questions which answer to “who”, “when”, and “where”. <i>Interrogation</i> refers to answers to “how”. The distinction between the two is in regard to rules about discrepancies in testimony between different witnesses, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 5:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.5.1.1">Mishnah 5:1</a>. The verse makes it clear that the rules also apply to lawsuits about subjects not covered by the detailed list in the Mishnah.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 3b" href="/Sanhedrin.3b">Babli 3b</a>.</i> From where that civil cases are heard by three [judges]? <i>The owner shall go to the judge</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:7" href="/Exodus.22.7"><i>Ex</i>. 22:7</a>.</i> he added here one judge. <i>Before the judge</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex</i>. 22:8</a>.</i> these are two. <i>Whom the judges will find guilty,</i> these are three<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since the paragraph mentions <i>judge</i> three times.</i>, the words of Rebbi Joshia. Rebbi Jonathan said, the first mention introduces the subject; one does not infer anything from introductions<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is a generally accepted principle (Babli <i>loc. cit</i>.). The expression which introduces a subject always is necessary and cannot be considered additional or extraneous to the subject at hand.</i>. But <i>before the judge,</i> there is one. <i>Whom the judges will find guilty,</i> there are two. No court may be even-numbered,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The duty of the court is to decide matters based on incomplete information. The possibility of a deadlock would defeat the purpose for which the court was convened. Therefore, no court may be even-numbered. If any of the judges did abstain from voting, the case would have to be tried anew with another judge substituting for the abstaining judge.</i> so one adds another one; this makes three.
Rebbi said, the verse speaks about two. You say about two, or maybe it is only about one? What He said, it is not written “whom the judge will find guilty” but <i>whom the judges will find guilty</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The plural in this sentence alone implies that at least two judges are involved.</i> No court may be even-numbered, so one adds another one; this makes three.
Rebbi Abbahu asked. According to Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Who in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Sanhedrin 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Sanhedrin.1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a> requires five judges to hear civil cases.</i>, should not civil suits be heard by five; should sentence not be passed by 23<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi probably also will agree that common practice was to hear cases by a panel of three judges. If one already deviates from traditional practice, should not <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 35:29" href="/Numbers.35.29"><i>Num.</i> 35:29</a> be interpreted as requiring identical procedural law for both civil and criminal cases?</i>? It was found stated by (Rebbi)<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Probably one should read דבי instead of  (רבי) ר׳ and translate “the House of Hizqiah,” referring to one of the twin sons of the Elder Rebbi Hiyya, known as the last person who formulated <i>baraitot.</i> The fourth generation <i>Rebbi</i> Hizqiah would be much too late. The <i>baraita</i> is found in both <i>Mekhiltot</i> (dR. Ismael, ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 323, dR. Simeon ben Iohai ed. Epstein-Melamed p. 214.)</i> Ḥizqiah: Since the Torah said, kill by a vote of the majority<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Majority rule for judicial sentences is introduced in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:2" href="/Exodus.23.2"><i>Ex.</i> 23:2</a>: “to bend after the many.” The same verse forbids a guilty verdict by a simple majority: “Do not follow the majority in bad things.” Since the plural used for “many” implies at least two, it follows that a guilty verdict by a majority of one is an acquittal, while by a majority of two it is a guilty verdict.</i>, kill by the testimony of witnesses. Since witnesses must be two<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since unanimity is not required, the court would have to be composed of at least 4, hence 5, members. The majority accepts this interpretation of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:2" href="/Exodus.23.2"><i>Ex.</i> 23:2</a> for criminal cases only.</i>, a majority also must be two<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since unanimity is not required, the court would have to be composed of at least 4, hence 5, members.

No court can be even-numbered; one adds another one. This makes five.
Do not robberies and injuries fall under the same rules<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The same question is asked in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 2b" href="/Sanhedrin.2b">Babli, 2b</a>. In contrast to the Babli, here it is understood that torts do not necessarily follow the same rules as disputes over money, and it is not obvious that a panel of three judges would be sufficient for these.</i>? It was found that Rebbi Simeon ben Ioḥai stated: <i>These are the procedures which you shall put before them.</i> It serves to explain to you the plain sense of the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:1" href="/Exodus.21.1"><i>Ex</i>. 21:1</a>. As in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21-23" href="/Exodus.21-23"><i>Ex</i>. 21–23</a>, pure money matters are treated first, then torts. The order of the Mishnah follows the order of topics in these chapters.</i>. This follows Rebbi Yose bar Ḥalaphta.
Rebbi Yose bar Ḥalaphta, when two people came before him for judgment and told him, “on condition that you judge us by the law of the Torah,” told them, “the law of the Torah I do not know<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">He knew the theoretical law of the Torah but not necessarily the application to the case before him, since that would have presumed perfect and complete information. But the judge, by biblical decree, is dependent on what is told him in court. The information given to him by necessity is incomplete.</i>, but He Who knows thoughts should collect from those people<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Who either lie in court or withhold information.</i>. You have to accept what I shall tell you.”
When a person came to Rebbi Aqiba to have a suit decided before him, he told him: “You should know before Whom you are standing, before Him Who commanded and the world came into existence, as it is said: <i>The two people who are quarrelling shall stand before the Eternal,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 19:17" href="/Deuteronomy.19.17"><i>Deut.</i> 19:17</a>.

It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The correct version of this <i>baraita</i> is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 7:2:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.7.2.2-5">7:2</a>; the first part is also quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 15a" href="/Shabbat.15a">Babli, <i>Šabbat</i> 15a</a>.

Rebbi Simeon ben Ioḥai said, praised be the Merciful<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For preventing me to have to act as a judge.</i>, for I am not intelligent enough to judge<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">From his time on, rabbinic jurisdiction in Palestine was limited to courts of arbitration which are not representatives of God and therefore under less pressure to render absolutely correct judgment.</i>.

Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: if they told him, we accept you as if you were three on condition that you judge us by Torah law. He erred and judged them on his discretion.

Rebbi Abba and Rebbi Benjamin bar Jephet had a lawsuit before Rebbi Isaac; the judgment was for Rebbi Benjamin. Rebbi Abba wanted to complain<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">After the fact, he wanted to invalidate the judgment because R.

Rebbi Abbahu was sitting as sole judge in the inclining<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">A synagogue built on an incline in his hometown of Caesarea Philippi on the slopes of the Golan Heights.</i> synagogue of Caesarea.

Rebbi Joḥanan went with a lawsuit before the Elder Rebbi Ḥiyya. He took a student to sit with him.

A person brought a suit before Rav Huna<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Who started out poor as an agricultural worker and only became rich when middle aged. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 105a" href="/Ketubot.105a">Babli <i>Ketubot</i> 105a</a>.</i>, He told him, bring me a person who climbs the date palm instead of me.
Rav Huna was a cowherd when he knew testimony for a person, who told him, come and testify for me. He answered him, give me my wages. It was stated thus: “One pays the judge for his time and the witness for his testimony.
A person made a Cohen impure<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">He made it impossible for him to eat heave, which must be eaten in purity.

When does one usually intercalate? The year preceding a Sabbatical.” Rebbi Zeˋira said in the name of Rebbi Abbahu, that is before Rebbi permitted to import produce from outside the Land into the Land. But since Rebbi permitted to import produce from outside the Land into the Land, there is no difference between a Sabbatical and the remaining years of the Sabbatical cycle.

Some Tannaïm state: “One does not intercalate because of impurity.” Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Nedarim</i>: R. Jehudah.

Rebbi Simeon ben Jehudah said in the name of Rebbi Simeon: Hezekiah forced the community to celebrate the Second Passover.”
Some Tannaïm state: One intercalates because of impurity. Some Tannaïm state: One does not intercalate. He who says, one does not intercalate, from the following: <i>for they ate the Passover contrary to what is written.</i> How does the one who says one does not intercalate, explain <i>contrary to what is written</i>? They intercalated in Nisan but one intercalates only in Adar. This follows what Rebbi Simon bar Zavdi said: they found the skull of Ornan the Yebusite under the altar.

Six things did Hezekiah do; with three they agreed, with three they did not agree. He dragged his father’s bones on a bier of ropes, he smashed the bronze snake, and he hid the table of medicines; they agreed. He closed the upper Giḥon spring, and he cut down the Temple doors, and he intercalated Nisan in Nisan; they disagreed.
One does not intercalate before New Year’s Day; if they did intercalate it would be invalid. But for an urgent need one may intercalate immediately after New Year’s Day. Nevertheless, only Adar is intercalated. <sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following paragraphs also are found in <i>Ševi</i>ˋ<i>it</i> 10:2 (Notes 41–55) and <i>Roš Haššanah</i> 3:1 (58c l. 51).</i> Rebbi says, Nisan was never lengthened. But did we not state: “If the New Moon appeared in time”? If it would appear; it did not appear. Rav said, Tishre was never lengthened. But did we not state: “If the month was long”? If it would be, it never was.
“When they sanctified the year at Usha, on the first day Rebbi Ismael, the son of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa, led and recited following the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri.

Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, this we did follow at Jabneh.” But does this not mean that they sanctified it on the first and the second day?

But was it not stated: the first day, the second day?
If they sanctified it before its time or after its lengthening, should I assume it was lengthened? The verse says, <i>them, them;</i> not <i>these are My holidays</i>?

“One intercalates a year only in Judea, but if it was intercalated in Galilee it is validly intercalated. Ḥanina from Ono testified that, if it cannot be intercalated in Judea, one intercalates in Galilee.” One does not intercalate a year outside the Land; if it was intercalated, it is not validly intercalated.

One does not intercalate outside the Land; if it was intercalated it is not intercalated if it was possible to intercalate in the Land of Israel; but if one cannot intercalate in the Land of Israel, one intercalates it outside the Land.
Jeremiah intercalated outside the Land. Ezechiel intercalated outside the Land. Baruch ben Neriah intercalated outside the Land. Ḥanania the nephew of Rebbi Joshua intercalated outside the Land. Rebbi sent him three letters through Rebbi Isaac and Rebbi Nathan. In one he wrote, to His holiness Ḥanania. And in one he wrote, the kid goats you left behind became rams. And in one he wrote, if you do not accept, go to the thistle desert, do the slaughtering and let Onias sprinkle. After the first [letter], he honored them. After the second, he honored them. After the third, he wanted to disgrace them. They said to him, you cannot do that since you already did honor us. Rebbi Isaac rose and read in the Torah: These are the holidays of Ḥanania the nephew of Rebbi Joshua. They said to him, <i>the holidays of the Eternal.</i> He told them, that is with us. Rebbi Nathan rose and concluded: For from Babylonia will Torah go forth and the Eternal’s word from Nahar-Peqod. They said to him, <i>for from Zion will Torah go forth and the Eternal’s word from Jerusalem.</i> He told them, that is with us. He went to complain about them to Rebbi Jehudah ben Bathyra at Nisibis. He said to him, follow them, follow them. He said to him, I do not know whom I left there. Who would tell me that they are knowledgeable in computations as I am? If they did not know the computations, they should listen to him. Since they are knowledgeable in computations as he is, he has to listen to them. He got up and rode on a horse. Where he reached, he reached. Where he did not reach, they continued to follow the corrupt [calendar].
It is written: <i>to the outstanding Elders in the diaspora.</i> The Holy One, praise to Him, said: The Elders of the diaspora are very dear to me. But more beloved by Me is a small group in the Land of Israel than a great Synhedrion outside the Land. It is written: <i>The craftsmen and the smiths one thousand,</i> and you say so? Rebbi Berekhiah in the name of Rebbi Ḥelbo and the rabbis. Rebbi Berekhiah said, one thousand craftsmen and one thousand smiths. But the rabbis say, together one thousand.

Rebbi Hoshaia, when he received witnesses at Kallirhoë, used to say to them: you should know the importance of the testimony that comes from your mouths; how much rent money depends on your mouths. Rebbi Abuna said, if it is so, it is even a matter of criminal law. If somebody sleeps with a girl three years and one day old, he is stoned. The court decides to lengthen, if he sleeps with her he is not stoned. Rebbi Abun said, <i>I am calling to Almighty God, to the God Who decides with me.</i> If a girl is three years and one day old, if the court decides to lengthen her hymen does (not) repair itself, otherwise it does [not] repair itself<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">The text here obviously is wrong, but is correct in the parallel texts.

No court has an even number of members; one adds one; that makes five. What is the reason of Rebbi Jehudah? “Your elders, your judges,” two. No court has an even number of members; one adds another one; that makes three. Rebbi said, the words of Rebbi Jehudah are reasonable for the breaking of the neck, for he does not refer to “they shall go out.” The words of Rebbi Simeon are reasonable for the leaning of the hands, for he does not refer to “they shall lean.” If you would say that the words of Rebbi Jehudah are reasonable for the calf whose neck is broken, if he refers to “they shall lean”, he also should refer to “they shall go out.” It turns out that you have to say “they shall go out” two, “your Elders” two, “and your judges” two. No court has an even number of members; one adds one more; that makes seven. How does Rebbi Simeon explain “your Elders and your judges”? Your Elders who are your judges.

It is stated: The eulogizer and all who participate in a eulogy interrupt for the recitation of <i>Shemaˋ</i> but do not interrupt for prayer. It happened that our teachers interrupted for the recitation of <i>Shemaˋ</i> and prayer. Did we not state: “If they are able to start and finish”?

Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said: He who enters the synagogue and finds them standing and praying; if he knows that he could start and finish before the reader starts, so that he may answer “Amen”, he may pray, otherwise he should not pray.

Rebbi Abba bar Zemina was working as a tailor for somebody in Rome. He brought him carcass meat and told him to eat. He said to him, I will not eat. He said to him, eat! Otherwise I shall kill you.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Both civil suits and criminal suits require cross-examination and investigation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cross-examination is the interrogation of witnesses which changes from trial to trial. Investigation is the determination of answers to the obligatory questions enumerated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 5:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.5.1.1">Mishnah 5:1</a>.</i>, as it is said: <i>One set of rules shall be for you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opposite of rigidity.

Civil suits are tried before three judges, criminal suits before 23.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Both civil suits,” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, to protect Israel’s money they said, “tell why you know that this person owes the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">While the Mishnah requires the same kind of cross-examinations and determinations in civil as in criminal cases, R. Johanan holds that by rabbinic <i>fiat</i>, witnesses in civil cases are not to be subjected to cross-examinations that stray from the main topic. While it is necessary in criminal trials to disqualify any witness whose testimony is not 100% consistent (since God has promised to punish every evildoer who escapes human justice,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:7" href="/Exodus.23.7"><i>Ex</i>. 23:7</a>), excessively rigid standards in civil cases would prevent most owners of capital from lending it, therefore leading to the ruin of the poor. It is in the public interest that claims be swiftly and easily adjudicated. The question quoted (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 3:8:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.3.8.1">Mishnah 3:9</a>) is the paradigm for any questions to be asked.</i>” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba asked before Rebbi Yasa<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">One has to read יסא for יוסי.

If you see that the verdict will be the truth, investigate it<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In criminal cases, there is an obligation on the judges to ascertain the truth as well as possible. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 32a" href="/Sanhedrin.32a">Babli, 32a</a>, the duty to careful investigation is emphasized in all cases where the judges suspect foul play by one of the parties; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 4:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.4.1.2">Note 10</a>.</i>; otherwise, act in equity.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In civil cases, the judges have to ascertain that the judgment be equitable.</i>

When he saw them essentially identical, he determined the common element.
How does one start for acquittal? One says, is it possible that this one be a murderer<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If the judges in their discussions say this, after the evidence was heard, nothing bad can be said. R. Yose reads the question as one directed towards eye witnesses to a murder. An intimation by the judges that they do not believe the witnesses may lead them to lie to exonerate the murderer; this would make the judges accomplices of the murderer after the fact.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, if this is so, if one of the witnesses said, I have something to say in his defense, and his colleague comes to support him, is that support? If you say so, would you not put guilt on the judges, to lead witnesses to lie?
Rebbi Joḥanan said, anybody who cannot argue for the crawling animal to make it pure a hundred times cannot start arguing for acquittal<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 17a" href="/Sanhedrin.17a">Babli, 17a</a>, Rav states that anybody who cannot argue for the purity of crawling animals is not a candidate for membership in the Synhedrion. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:29-38" href="/Leviticus.11.29-38"><i>Lev.</i> 11:29–38</a> describes the impurity of eight particular crawling animals (mostly reptiles).

(For some reason, the commentator to the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 91a" href="/Sanhedrin.91a">Babli 91a</a>, probably Rashi’s son-in-law Jehuda ben Nathan, defines עַכְבָּר as <i>écureuil</i>, “squirrel”.) All other crawling animals, including snakes (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:42" href="/Leviticus.11.42"><i>Lev</i>. 11:42</a>), are forbidden as food but their carcasses are not impure.</i>. How does one argue about a crawling animal? Rebbi Joḥanan said, since a snake which kills<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It kills both humans and domestic animals, thereby causing the severe impurities of corpses and animal carcasses. For logical consistency, the agent of impurity should be impure; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 13b" href="/Eruvin.13b">Babli <i>Eruvin</i> 13b</a>.</i> is pure, a rat which does not kill logically should be pure. Since a rat which does not kill is impure, a snake which kills logically should be impure. Rebbi Phineas objected: Is there not the scorpion which kills and is pure? It was found that a Tanna said, snake and scorpion both follow the same rules.
<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 13b" href="/Eruvin.13b">Babli <i>Eruvin</i> 13b</a>, Rebbi <i>Johanan</i> said, Rebbi <i>Meïr</i> had a student by the name of Symmachos who could give 49 reasons for everything pure and 49 reasons for everything impure.

It is clear that the second “Rebbi” needs to be followed by a name.<br>The same Babli also quotes a <i>baraita</i> that at Jabneh there was a self-confident (واشق ותיק) student who could give 150 reasons for the purity of crawling animals.

When the Levites went before the army against the Moabites and Edomites, they sang: <i>give praise to the Eternal, for His Grace is forever</i>, intentionally changing the traditional text (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 118:1" href="/Psalms.118.1"><i>Ps</i>. 118:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 136:1" href="/Psalms.136.1">136:1</a>), <i>give praise to the Eternal</i> for He is good, <i>for His Grace is forever</i>.</i>, to teach that even the downfall of the evildoers is no joy before the Omnipresent.

Therefore, the Mishnaiot dealing with procedures in criminal trials are attempts of reconstruction of Hasmonean or even earlier procedures.</i>.

Rebbi Isaac asked about this: If they caught an armed robber in Tiberias and said, this is the murderer, this is the murdered; why does this need seven investigations<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Is the situation not obvious?</i>?

“Do you recognize him?” Who was he, a Gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Then it would be a case for the king’s court, not the Sanhedrin.</i> or an Israel? Let us hear from what Rebbi Joḥanan said: If he was slain between Tiberias and Sepphoris, it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he was an Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In order to remove the case to a police court, the defendant would have to prove that the slain person was a Gentile.

In the Babli, this is an Amoraic argument. The verse is read as: <i>by the mouth of two witnesses shall the dead kill himself</i>, i. e., in the presence of two witnesses he accepts to be killed.</i>. Does he die when dead? But to tell him by which kind of death he will be executed. It was stated: Rebbi Jehudah ben Rebbi Illai said, <i>and if a man intentionally kill his neighbor knowingly</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:14" href="/Exodus.21.14"><i>Ex</i>. 21:14</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 41a" href="/Sanhedrin.41a">Babli 41a</a>.

If his death should have been a severe one<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 7:1, Note 1.</i> but they warned him about an easy one. He could say that had he known that his death was to be severe, he would not have committed that crime. If his death should have been an easy one but they warned him about a severe one; in the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah ben Rebbi Illai they have to inform him by which kind of death he will be executed<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">R.

By contrast, in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 80b" href="/Sanhedrin.80b">Babli, 80b</a>, it is stated as commonly accepted that a warning about a painful death implies the same of an easy one.</i>.

Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda asked<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">His question is about the degree of specificity required in the warning delivered to a person ready to commit a crime punishable by death. Is it sufficient to deliver a general warning as described in the preceding paragraph (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 5:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.5.1.8">Note 27</a>) or does one have to specify the exact paragraph of the law being violated? In the case of the Sabbath, is it enough to warn a person not to do any work or does he have to be warned about which of the 39 prohibited types of work he is going to perform? The biblical evidence about the gatherer (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 15:32-36" href="/Numbers.15.32-36"><i>Num</i>. 15:32–36</a>) shows that the Tosephta was correct in requiring only a general warning.</i>: What was the gatherer’s guilt? Because of tearing off or because of reaping<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In the list of the forbidden categories of work (Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 7:2–4) only reaping is mentioned, which means cutting off the produce from its root. All forms of harvesting are forbidden as derivatives of reaping. The question remains whether a warning about tearing off from the ground would also cover reaping; a warning about reaping certainly covers all forms of harvesting.</i>? Let us hear from the following: <i>The Children of Israel were in the desert when they found</i> … This teaches that he was tearing wood off the ground<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifry Num</i>. 113.</i>.
Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda asked: How was the gatherer put to death<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Jehudah, he could not be put to death if the specific way of execution was not known even though the fact that violating the Sabbath was known to be a capital crime.</i>? By stoning. Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Emor, Section 14 5" href="/Sifra,_Emor,_Section_14.5"><i>Sifra Emor Parashah</i> 14(5</a>).</i>: “They knew that the gatherer should be executed but they did not know how he should be put to death.” It was found that Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: <i>Take the blasphemer outside the camp</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 24:14" href="/Leviticus.24.14"><i>Lev</i>. 24:14</a>. This proves that from the pentateuchal stories nothing can be inferred for the rules of procedure required at later times. While it was known that a Sabbath infraction was punishable by death (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 5:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.5.1.8">Note 28</a>), nothing was known about the penalty for blasphemy. Therefore, the first time these crimes occurred after the epiphany on Sinai, the law was only being formed; it was not yet consolidated (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 78b" href="/Sanhedrin.78b">Babli 78b</a>).</i>. How was he put to death? By stoning.
“What did he worship?” <i>Peor</i> or Mercury<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 7:9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.7.9.1">Mishnah 7:12</a>, the worship of <i>Baˋal Peˋor</i> was by defecating in front of his statue; the worship of <i>Mercurius</i>, the Greek <i>Hermes</i>, was by throwing an additional stone on the heap surrounding the <i>Hermes</i>, the pillar representing the divinity. Both forms of worship would be an insult if performed for any other idol and, therefore, not punishable.</i>? “And how did he worship?” In its proper worship or the worship of Heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Any imitation of Temple worship for an idol is a capital crime. Any other sort of worship is punishable only if ordinarily it was performed for that idol.</i>? Let us hear from the following: It happened that two [witnesses] came and said, we saw that this one was worshipping idols, but we do not know whether it was <i>Peor</i> or Mercury<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly, this is inadmissible testimony.</i>. One judges him for both and for the one in which he was found innocent one lets him go<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Since the accused must be found innocent of one of two mutually exclusive allegations, one may accept the witnesses by basing a trial on their testimony even if a not-guilty verdict is a foregone conclusion.</i>.

What is the difference between investigations and cross-examinations? In investigations, if one said “I do not know”, their testimony is worthless<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">As testimony which cannot be shown to be perjured.</i>. In cross-examinations, if one said “I do not know”, or even two say “we do not know,” their testimony remains valid<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The credibility of the witnesses may be impaired.

He plucked them with their stalks. How did he eat them? With their pits<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to olives.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Parallel texts to this and the following paragraphs are in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 15:5:3-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.15.5.3-4"><i>Yebamot</i> 15:5 (Notes 115–134</a>) and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 3:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.3.7.2">Nazir 3:7 (Notes 110–112</a>).</i> There, we have stated: “If two groups of witnesses were testifying against a person, one group say that he vowed <i>nazir</i> twice, the others say that he vowed <i>nazir</i> five times. The House of Shammai say, the testimony is split and there is no <i>nezirut</i> there. But the House of Hillel say, five contains two; he should be a <i>nazir</i> twice.” Rav said, they differ in the overall testimony. But in detail, everybody agrees that the testimony is split. Rebbi Joḥanan said, they differ in counting. But in an overall testimony, everybody agrees that five contains two. What is overall and what is counting? Overall, this one says two, the other one says five. Counting, this one says one, two, the other one says three, four.
Rav said, if testimony was contradictory in its essence, the testimony is not void. Rebbi Joḥanan said, if testimony is contradictory in itself, the testimony is void. In the opinion of everybody, if testimony was contradictory in aspects that belong after the fact, the testimony is not void. The strength of Rebbi Joḥanan is consistent with what Rebbi Abba bar<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Read with the parallel sources: R. Abba, R. Hiyya.</i> Ḥiyya said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, if it was agreed that he counted but one [witness] said, he counted from a wallet, and the other said, he counted from a bundle, that contradicts the essence of the testimony, and Rav will agree that the testimony be void. Where do they disagree? If there were two groups of witnesses, one says he counted from a wallet and the other says he counted from a bundle. That contradicts the essence of the testimony: the testimony is void, but according to Rav, the testimony is not void. One said, he counted into his bosom, but the other said, he counted into his money-belt: everybody agrees that this contradicts the essence of the testimony but the testimony is not void. If one [witness] said, he killed him with a sword, the other [witness] said, he killed him with a mace, that contradicts the essence of the testimony; Rav will agree that the testimony be void. Where do they disagree? If there were two groups of witnesses, one says he killed him with a sword and the other says, he killed him with a mace. That contradicts the essence of the testimony, the testimony is void, but according to Rav, the testimony is not void. One says, he turned to the North and one says, he ran away to the South, everybody agrees that the testimony was contradictory in aspects that belong after the fact, and the testimony is not void. The strength of Rav comes from what we have stated there: “Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon say, since both agree that he is not alive they can be remarried.” He did not hear that Rebbi Eleazar said, Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon concede in the case of witnesses. What is the difference between witnesses and the co-wife? They do not consider the co-wife’s words compared to those of her companion. Rebbi Joḥanan said, if Rebbi Eleazar said this, he said it because he had heard it from me. The Mishnah disagrees with Rav: “Both in investigations and cross-examinations, if they contradict one another their testimony is worthless.” What does Rav do with this? Rebbi Mana said, Rav will explain it as referring to single witness against single witness. Rebbi Abun said, even if you say groups and groups. There is a difference in criminal cases, as it is written: <i>Justice, justice you shall pursue</i>.

[Only extremely vicious souls are punished in eternity, cf. Chapter 10. For all other evildoers, the punishment in hell is for 12 months or until the flesh has disappeared from the bones, whichever comes sooner. For this reason, a mourner may not recite the prayer for the dead (customary since the last millennium) for more than 11 months; if he did recite it in the 12th month he would declare his parent an evildoer, in itself a sin.]</i>.

But he holds that because they do not divide, they are for making inferences. In Rebbi Joḥanan’s opinion, they are not for making inferences.

In Rebbi Eleazar’s opinion a positive commandment allows inferences for a prohibition but no prohibition allows inferences for a positive commandment. In Rebbi Joḥanan’s opinion it is obvious that one may dig cisterns, ditches, and caves during it. In Rebbi Eleazar’s opinion, may one dig cisterns, ditches, and caves during it?

Therefore, if <i>there you shall offer, and there you shall make</i> were not written, no positive commandment would allow inferences for a prohibition and no prohibition would allow inferences for a positive commandment.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The deviant and rebellious son,” etc. Rebbi Zeˋira, Rebbi Abbahu, Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish.

The son born to an underage father can never become <i>deviant and rebellious</i> since he is not the son of a <i>man</i> as required by the verse.</i>. But the Torah said, a son, not a father.

What is the reason of the House of Shammai? “Bring me my husband and I shall drink.” What is the reason of the House of Hillel? Since there is no husband to let her drink, the Torah returns her to a state of doubt, which induces another doubt, which remains a doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph has nothing to do with the current subject but belongs to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 4:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.4.2.2"><i>Sotah</i> 4:3</a>. It was omitted there together with the preceding four paragraphs.<br>If a husband suspects his wife of adultery and warns her in the presence of two adult witnesses not to be with her suspected paramour, then if there is circumstantial evidence of adultery but no proof which would hold up in court, the wife is forbidden to her husband until she undergoes the ordeal by drinking the magic water in the Temple court (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 11:5-31" href="/Numbers.11.5-31"><i>Num</i>. 11:5–31</a>). If the ordeal confirms her adultery, she is divorced as adulteress without any money.The ordeal must take place in the presence of the husband. If the husband dies before the ordeal can take place, the woman cannot drink. The House of Shammai rules that she is a widow, entitled to all benefits due to a widow, since the death of her husband barred her from clearing her name without her fault. The House of Hillel hold that as suspected adulteress she cannot go to court to collect money from the heirs to the estate since only valid claims can be enforced in court; it is not the heirs’ doing that she cannot prove her case (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 4:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.4.1.3"><i>Soṭah</i> 4:1 Notes 13–16</a>).</i>.

It has no connection with the theme in <i>Sanhedrin</i>, only a tenuous one with the previously quoted text from <i>Sotah</i>. The text here is secondary as shown by a few omissions.</i> There, we stated: “If she had compromised her <i>ketubah</i>, she shall not be able to collect without an oath.” It was stated “compromised”, not that she reduced [her <i>ketubah</i>]. How? If her <i>ketubah</i> was 200 but she claims a mina, she is paid without an oath. What is the difference between one who did compromise and one who claims less? Rebbi Ḥanina said, if she compromises there was a transaction between them; if she claims less there was no transaction between them.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked: Since we stated there: “If one witness testified that [the <i>ketubah</i>] was paid, she shall not be able to collect without an oath”; should it be similar that if one witness testifies that [the <i>ketubah</i>] was reduced, she shall not be able to collect the reduced amount without an oath? Rebbi Yose said, at the moment when one witness testified that it was paid, he does not contradict two [witnesses]; but when he testifies that it was reduced he would contradict two [witnesses.]
<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 9:8:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.9.8.3"><i>Ketubot</i> 9:9, Notes 200–204</a>.</i> It was stated: “If she collects in his absence, she shall not be able to collect without an oath.” Can one collect from a person in his absence? Rebbi Jeremiah said, explain it about a contract for which interest is due. Would the court collect interest? Explain that it was guaranteed for a Gentile.
It was stated: If an heir’s father held a partially paid promissory note, the son collects without swearing. In this the son’s power is greater than the father’s since the father can collect only by swearing. Rebbi Eleazar said, nevertheless he has to execute an heir’s oath, “that our father did not charge us, that our father did not tell us, that we did not find a document among our father’s documents stating that this note was paid.” Therefore, if there was a document, the note was paid. Rebbi Hoshaia asked, does the <i>baraita</i> follow the House of Shammai? For the House of Shammai say, “she collects her <i>ketubah</i> and does not drink.” Rebbi Yose said, there the reason of the House of Shammai is: bring my husband and I shall drink! But here, it would be in order that even his father would not have to swear. They instituted a rule that he has to swear. They instituted this for him, but not for his son. When he died, you put his son on the biblical rule.
If a father became obligated to swear in court and died, his son cannot collect. If it were otherwise, what could we say? Can a man let his son inherit an obligation to swear? Rebbi <sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ketubot</i>: Abun.</i> Ba said, it was said as follows: if a man compromised his document in court, his son cannot collect. <sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This is also quoted in <i>Ševuot</i> 7:6 (38a l. 25).</i> Rav Ḥisda asked: Because he walked two steps, does he lose? If he compromised it outside the court, he collects. Because he compromised it in court, he cannot collect?

Halakhah 7

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The deviant and rebellious son is judged because of his end; the Torah said, it is better that he should die innocent rather than guilty, for death of the evildoers is an enjoyment for them and enjoyment for the world, but concerning the just it is bad for them and bad for the world. Wine and sleep of the evildoers is an enjoyment for them and enjoyment for the world, but concerning the just it is bad for them and bad for the world. Scattering of the evildoers is an enjoyment for them and enjoyment for the world, but concerning the just it is bad for them and bad for the world. Coming together of the evildoers is bad for them and bad for the world, but concerning the just it is an enjoyment for them and enjoyment for the world.

The text here does not always follow the same order as given there. The Notes here are restricted to indicate where the text of <i>Yebamot</i> (Y) was preferred for translation. The corruptions in the <i>Sanhedrin</i> text make it clear that the Y text is original.</i>:
“One may marry [relatives of] a rape victim or a seduced woman.” So is the Mishnah: One may marry after<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The reading of Y אחר clearly is the correct one, not אחד “one,” as written here.</i> a rape or after a seduction. If he raped a woman, her mother is permitted. If he seduced a woman, he daughter is permitted.
“He who rapes or seduces [a relative of] a married woman is [criminally] liable.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, one stated this for marriage. If he married a woman and then raped her mother, he is [criminally] liable. If he married a woman and then seduced her daughter, he is [criminally] liable.
Rebbi Eleazar said, Symmachos and Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said the same thing, since we stated there: “If he slaughtered her, her daughter’s daughter, and afterwards her daughter, he absorbs forty [lashes]. Symmachos said in Rebbi Meïr’s name, he absorbs eighty.” There, we have stated: “Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri said, he who copulates with his mother-in-law may be liable because of his mother-in-law, his mother-in-law’s mother, and his father-in-law’s mother. They said to him, all three fall under the same law.” Rebbi Jehudah bar Pazi in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Symmachos agrees with Rebbi Joḥanan. It was found stated: it still is in dispute. What is Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri’s reason? Since a woman and her daughter and a woman and her daughter’s daughter fall under two separate prohibitions, also a woman and (her daughter) [her son’s daughter]<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Text of Y. The text of <i>Sanhedrin</i> (in parentheses) simply is a copy of the preceding sentence.</i> and her daughter’s daughter fall under two separate prohibitions. What is the reason of the rabbis? Since a woman and her daughter and a woman and her daughter’s daughter fall under one and the same prohibition, also a woman and her son’s daughter and her daughter’s daughter fall the under same prohibition.
It is written, <i>the genitals of a woman and her daughter you shall not uncover</i>, and it is written, <i>if a man take a woman and her mother, it is taboo</i>. Everywhere is written <i>lying with</i>, but here is written <i>taking</i>, to teach you that he cannot be [criminally] liable for the second woman unless she be taken by him. Or maybe he is [criminally] liable only by marriage? We already said that there is no valid incestuous marriage. But is it not written: <i>Nobody may marry his father’s wife, and he should not uncover his father’s garment’s corner</i>? This comes to tell that she was permitted to him before his father married her. But is it not written: <i>If a man take his brother’s wife</i>? This comes to tell you that she was permitted to him before his brother married her. This is understood by levirate. But is it not written: <i>You should not take a woman in addition to her sister</i>? This comes to tell you that she was permitted to him before he married her sister. This is understood after her sister’s death. But is it not written: <i>A man who would take his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, it is ḥesed</i>? That you should not say that Cain married his sister, Abel married his sister, <i>it is charitable</i>, I was charitable with the first generations so the world could be inhabited; <i>I said, the world was built on ḥesed</i>. But is it not written: <i>Widow, divorcee, and desecrated, these he shall not take</i>? This comes to tell you that if he became betrothed to her, the betrothal is valid.

It is written, <i>the genitals of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter you shall not uncover</i>. Where do we hold? If from marriage, it already had been said. So it cannot refer to marriage but must refer to rape. So far about his daughter’s daughter; from where his daughter? Rav said, if he is forewarned about his daughter’s daughter, so much more for his daughter! If for his daughter’s daughter he is subject to punishment (by extirpation)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Missing in Y, probably spurious.</i>, so much more for his daughter!
<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Missing in Y. Rav’s argument is rejected in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 76a" href="/Sanhedrin.76a">Babli 76a</a> since it violates a fundamental principle of criminal law that no act is punishable which is not listed as punishable in the written law.

But the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 76a" href="/Sanhedrin.76a">Babli 76a</a> rejects the argument given here since the verse states that the Cohen’s daughter has to be burned because <i>she desecrates her father</i>; this excludes an incestuous relationship, in which the father desecrates his daughter.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The changes from or additions to the text in Y are underlined. It is clear that the <i>Yebamot</i> text is the correct one, where in the references to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 20:14" href="/Leviticus.20.14"><i>Lev</i>. 20:14</a> “upwards” and “downwards” have to be interchanged and in the last sentence “mother” replaces “daughter”.</i> Rav Huna understood all of these [rules] from this verse: <i>The genitals of a woman and her daughter you should nor uncover</i>. And it is written, <i>if a man take a woman and her daughter, it is taboo</i>. Taboo-taboo for an equal cut. Since there are three generations downwards, so there are three generations upwards. Since there is a prohibition downwards, there is a prohibition upwards. Since downwards one requires marriage, so upwards one requires marriage. Since downwards they are burned, so upwards they are burned. Since downwards He gave the male’s daughter the same status as the female’s daughter, so upwards we give the male’s daughter the same status as the female’s daughter.
And following Rebbi Meïr? Since Rebbi Meïr said, a <i>gezerah šawah</i> is at the place it comes from, from where is the third generation downwards forbidden? (And following the rabbis, who say, a <i>gezerah šawah</i> is at the place it comes from, from where is the third generation downwards forbidden?)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Missing in Y, probably spurious.</i> And following the rabbis, who say, a <i>gezerah šawah</i> is said about them, from where is the third generation upwards punished by burning? Both for Rebbi Meïr and the rabbis, from where that the third generation downwards is forbidden? (Rebbi Yose said,)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Missing in Y, probably spurious.</i> since it is written <i>taboo-taboo</i>, it is as if all were there.
<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is quite out of place here; in <i>Yebamot</i> it follows the paragraph after the next. All sexual offenses against a daughter are covered by <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:29" href="/Leviticus.19.29"><i>Lev</i>. 19:29</a>; punishment only has to be specified in different cases. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 76a" href="/Sanhedrin.76a">Babli 76a</a>.</i> Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, one may even understand this from the warning: <i>Do not desecrate your daughter to force her into prostitution</i>.
Rebbi Ḥaggai asked before Rebbi Yose: Why do we not say, “your daughter you should not uncover, your daughter’s daughter you should not uncover”? He said, if it were written “the genitals of a woman and her daughter’s daughter you shall not uncover,” we would have said “your daughter you should not uncover, your daughter’s daughter you should not uncover”.
If there are two prohibitions and one liability to extirpation, the prohibitions split the extirpation. What is the reason? <i>On human flesh it may not be rubbed and in its proportions you should not make [a compound] like it</i>, etc.. And it is written: <i>A man who would compound like it, etc</i>. This implies that for two prohibitions and one liability to extirpation, the prohibitions split the extirpation.
They asked before Rebbi Abbahu: If [a man] copulated with a woman, she had a daughter, and after that he came and copulated with the latter. Is he [criminally] liable about her because of a woman and her daughter, her daughter’s daughter, and her son’s daughter? He said to them, <i>they are relatives, it is taboo</i>, all because of taboo.
What is the reason of Rebbi Jehudah? <i>A man may not take his father’s wife, and he should not uncover his father’s wing;</i> that is his rape victim. How do the rabbis explain “his father’s wing”? There, they say and they do not know the origin of the tradition, that refers to a wing which is in need of his father. Would he not anyhow be [criminally] liable for her because of “his father’s wife”? Rebbi Hila said, because of forewarning; if he was warned because of his father’s wife he will be whipped, and because of his father’s wing he will be whipped. Rebbi Jehudah agrees about whipping. Rebbi Jehudah agrees about sacrifice. Rebbi Jehudah agrees about all other men<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Probably for האנשים one should read האנסים “the rapists.” A man can have relations with a woman raped or seduced by any close relative except his father, and even marry her. In Y the reading is הספיקות “the doubts” (see there, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 9:6:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.9.6.3">Note 61</a>.)</i> that he is free. Rebbi Jehudah agrees that if he marries her preliminarily that the preliminary marriage is legally valid.
<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In this paragraph, the indications of who is the speaker of each sentence are given in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 11:1:13" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.11.1.13"><i>Yebamot</i> 11:1, Notes 62–65</a>.</i> Rebbi Ḥaggai asked before Rebbi Yose: Is the child a bastard following Rebbi Jehudah? He said to him, <i>No one with a damaged testicle or with cut-off penis may marry into the Eternal’s congregation</i> interrupts the argument. It interrupted the argument in the matter of the father’s wife. The father’s wife was part of the set of all incest prohibitions; it was selected from this set to teach about bastardy for all incest prohibitions. Similarly, let the rape victim be selected to teach a prohibition concerning all rape victims. The father’s wife was part of the set of all incest prohibitions; it was selected from this set to teach about bastardy for all incest prohibitions. Can you say here that the rape victim was in the set, that it could teach a prohibition concerning all rape victims? Why cannot the father’s wife be selected to teach about the rape victim in her case? He said to him, if she is his father’s wife, she is not his rape victim; if she is the father’s rape victim, she is not his wife.

Could you think that this one walks in the market and the other one is executed because of him? But even if he dies according to the first estimation, he cannot be prosecuted. What is the rabbi’s reason? <i>If he does not die but is bedridden</i>. Would we not know that even if he does not die that he will be bedridden? But if they did not estimate that he would die. If they did not estimate that he would die, that is what is written: <i>If he gets up and walks outside on his cane, the attacker is exonerated</i>. Therefore, if he does not get up, [the attacker] is [criminally] liable. But if they estimated that he would die? If they estimated that he would die, that is what is written: <i>But he has to pay for his disability and the medical costs</i>.

The colleagues asked before Rebbi Samuel ben Naḥman: <i>He</i> was a priest of idol worship and lived so long? He said to them, because <i>he</i> was grudging to his idol. How was <i>he</i> grudging to his idol? If a man came to sacrifice an ox, a sheep, or a goat to the idol and told him: Make it favorably inclined towards me, <i>he</i> would say, what use does it have for you? It never eats, nor drinks, nor does good or evil. He said to <i>him</i>, what should we do? <i>He</i> said to him, go, make, and bring me a wooden vessel full of fine flour and put on it ten eggs, then <i>I</i> shall make it favorably inclined towards you. After <i>he</i> left, he would eat it. One day, a son of pashas came and <i>he</i> said that to him. He said to <i>him</i>, if it is of no use, what are <i>you</i> doing here? <i>He</i> answered him, because of my livelihood.

Therefore, it is impossible to punish the perjured witnesses of a Cohen’s daughter by exactly the death they intended to bring her to.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One who prophesies in the name of foreign worship,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is thoroughly corrupt; the meaning can be understood approximately by reference to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Sanhedrin 14:4" href="/Tosefta_Sanhedrin.14.4">Tosephta 14:13</a>: “He who prophesies to uproot one of the words of the Torah is punishable. Rebbi Simeon says, if he prophesies to uproot one of the words of the Torah but affirms others he cannot be prosecuted; but about foreign worship, even if he endorses it today but reneges tomorrow he is punishable.”<br>With <i>Qorban</i> <i>Haˋedah</i> it seems that the quote from the Ten Commandments (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 20:16" href="/Exodus.20.16"><i>Ex</i>. 20:16</a>) was induced by the parallel text at the beginning of the next Halakhah and should be replaced by <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:22" href="/Deuteronomy.18.22"><i>Deut</i>. 18:22</a>. The argument would go as follows: In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:20-22" href="/Deuteronomy.18.20-22"><i>Deut</i>. 18:20–22</a>, the court is commanded to punish the false prophet by a death sentence. The manner of execution is not specified; this implies that it must be by strangling. But in 13:2–12 the punishment of strange worship (idolatry) is stoning.<br>A person can be punished as a false prophet only if first he had established his credentials as a prophet by a sign or a miracle (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 13:2" href="/Deuteronomy.13.2"><i>Deut</i>. 13:2</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 18:22" href="/Deuteronomy.18.22">18:22</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 11:5:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.11.5.9">Note 106</a>). Then if the prophet argues for idolatry, even if he does not abolish any commandment of the Torah, he has to be punished (even if he propagates foreign worship in the name of the Eternal; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 89b" href="/Sanhedrin.89b">Babli 89b</a>). If he tells others not to obey some of the precepts of the Torah, for the Sages he is punishable, but not for R. Simeon. The prophet can be prosecuted only if he induces others to neglect Torah precepts, not if he himself seemingly violates them by Divine Command, as Elijah did on Mount Carmel, sacrificing on an altar which was authorized only for him.<br><i>Qorban Haˋedah</i> gives a reconstruction of the paragraph which is not impossible but not supported by any parallel evidence.<br>In the word פיונטייה the ending יֵהּ is the possessive suffix “his”. For the remaining פיונטי the best available conjecture is Kohut’s, Latin <i>punitio, -onis</i> “punishment” [or <i>poenaria</i> (<i>actiones</i>), punishable (actions) (E. G.)].</i> Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, everything was included in <i>do not testify against your neighbor as a false witness</i>. It came to judge whether by sign, or by miracle, whether about foreign worship or any other commandment. But about foreign worship, whether he intended to uproot the entire body or did not intend to uproot the entire body, by the words of Rebbi Simeon one does not prosecute him, but by the words of the Sages one stones him. For any other commandment by the words of the Sages one stones him, by the words of Rebbi Simeon he should understand his <i>pywnṭ</i>.
