Jerusalem Talmud Horayot



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If the Court<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The High Court.</i> ruled to violate one of the commandments spelled out in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A commandment clearly spelled out, like the prohibition of eating blood, where the biblical text does not imply an authorization of the rabbinical authorities to define the parameters of the obligation.</i> and a single person went and acted inadvertently<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">When the Court realized its error and changed its ruling, the person acting in good faith on their prior ruling is now faced with the fact that his act violated a biblical commandment, against his intention.</i> following their pronouncement, whether they acted and he acted simultaneously with them, or they acted and he followed their example, or they did not act but he did, he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For a purification sacrifice (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:27-35" href="/Leviticus.4.27-35"><i>Lev.</i> 4:27–35</a>) or, in the absence of a Temple, repentance and an expiatory action.</i> since he depended on the Court. If the Court ruled but one of them knew that they erred, or a student worthy of ordination<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He knows how to answer when asked any question of religious law.</i> went and acted following their pronouncement, whether they acted and he acted simultaneously with them, or they acted and he followed their example, or they did not act but he did, he is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For a purification sacrifice (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:27-35" href="/Leviticus.4.27-35"><i>Lev.</i> 4:27–35</a>) or, in the absence of a Temple, repentance and an expiatory action.</i> since he did not depend on the Court. This is the principle: The person depending on himself is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This rule, which declares that no instruction of the High Court supersedes one’s own certain knowledge, does not contradict the law of the rebellious Elder (<i>Sanhedrin</i> Chapter 8) since by definition the rebellious Elder came to ask the High Court; in the matter he came to ask, his knowledge is not independent of the Court.</i>, but one depending on the Court is not liable.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The text is that of the Leiden ms., the readings are those of the Yerushalmi text in the Bomberg Babli of 1520.</i>“If the Court ruled.” etc. <i>A person who would transgress; one would transgress; acting he would transgress;</i> these are restrictions<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The quotes are correct in the Yerushalmi text of the Babli <i>editio princeps</i>, but the first of the quotes in the Leiden ms. is a misquote, referring to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:2" href="/Leviticus.4.2"><i>Lev.</i>4:2</a> instead of 4:27. The basic text is in <i>Sifra Wayyiqra Parašah</i> 7(1), referred to in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Horayot 2b" href="/Horayot.2b">Babli 2b</a>, discussed in detail <i>Šabbat</i>93a.<br>Chapter 4 in <i>Lev.</i> treats the purification sacrifices for unintentional sin first by the High Priest (vv. 1–12), then the High Court (13–21), then a chief, identified in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.1">Mishnah 3:3</a> as a king (22–26), and finally by a commoner (27–35). V. 27 reads: <i>If one</i> <i>person of the populace transgresses inadvertently, by acting on one prohibitions of the Eternal, and feels guilt.</i> It is noted that the sentence seems to be unnecessarily wordy. Why does it not say simply, “if somebody inadvertently transgresses a prohibition of the Eternal”? The additional words must have a meaning; they describe restrictions. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 93a" href="/Shabbat.93a">Babli <i>Šabbat</i>93a</a> one derives from the insistence that <i>one</i> person commit the sin that a violation of a commandment cannot be prosecuted if committed by two persons acting in common, so that no single person commits a punishable act but the combined result is a clear violation,. Such a violation cannot be atoned for by a purification sacrifice. It also is clear that only <i>acts</i> are punishable.<br>In the context here the additional terms are interpreted to mean that only a person acting on his own is required to offer a purification sacrifice; this excludes one who is told by a religious authority that his act is permitted.</i>: the person depending on himself is liable, but one dependent on the Court is not liable.

In the opinion of Rebbi Ismael, who does not refer this verse to those obligated for purification sacrifices and certain reparation sacrifices for whom the Day of Atonement had passed, it is understandable<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph has no direct connection with the theme of the Mishnah, but is added here to elucidate <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:27" href="/Leviticus.4.27"><i>Lev.</i> 4:27</a>. Since our halakhic Midrashim are all from the school of R. Aqiba, we have to accept the occasional indications of the Yerushalmi on the interpretations of the school of R. Ismael. For him, the verses 4:27–28 detail the conditions on which a private person is permitted and obligated to bring a purification offering.</i>. But what is the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba, who refers this verse to those obligated for purification sacrifices and certain reparation sacrifices for whom the Day of Atonement had passed, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Keritot 6:4" href="/Mishnah_Keritot.6.4">Mishnah <i>Keritut</i> 6:4</a>; <i>Sifra Wayyiqra 2 Paršetah</i> 3(1), 6(1), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 16:1-18:30" href="/Leviticus.16.1-18.30"><i>Ahare Mot Parašah</i>4(8</a>).<br>Reparation sacrifices are required (1) for sins against a fellow man after restitution (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:20-26" href="/Leviticus.5.20-26"><i>Lev.</i> 5:20–26</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 5:5-10" href="/Numbers.5.5-10"><i>Num.</i> 5:5–10</a>), (2) misappropriation of <i>sancta</i>(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:14-16" href="/Leviticus.5.14-16"><i>Lev.</i>5:14–16</a>), (3) to regain sanctified status after skin disease (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14" href="/Leviticus.14"><i>Lev.</i> 14</a>). A <i>suspended</i> reparation sacrifice is due if a person suspects that he may have committed an inadvertent sin, without having proof either way. Since the sin is forgiven on the Day of Atonement (with due repentance), such a sacrifice cannot be offered after that day since the scapegoat carries away <i>all</i> iniquities (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 16:21" href="/Leviticus.16.21"><i>Lev.</i> 16:21</a>).</i>: From where that those obligated for purification sacrifices and certain reparation sacrifices for whom the Day of Atonement had passed, are obligated to bring them after the Day of Atonement, but those obligated for suspended reparation offerings are no longer liable?

Jehudah). His problem with the prior explanation is that it does not fit the setting of the Mishnah. Since we are referring to sacrifices, the inadvertent sinner, while he is immune to prosecution, is obligated to bring a purification sacrifice; the intentional sinner, who can be punished, is barred from bringing a sacrifice. Therefore, if one compares the intentional to the unintentional sinner, the opposite of the argument of R. Hila should be formulated.

If somebody acted in parallel with the ruling of the court but following his own interpretation of the biblical law, he is not liable for a purification sacrifice since in fact he is barred from offering one, and since he happened to act in parallel with the Court’s ruling neither is he prosecutable. Both interpretations of פטור are possible here. There is no reason to change the text which is confirmed by the two Yerushalmi texts and the Tosephta.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, even any single individual who acted on his own brings a female sheep or goat<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Since acting on a faulty interpretation is qualified as acting in error, which for an individual requires the offering of a female sheep or goat (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 1:1:8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.1.1.8">Note 51</a>).</i>.

Rebbi Joḥanan explains the Mishnah by instruction from the Court. If the Court ruled to eliminate the entire body, since the Court has to bring a bull a private person does not have to bring a female sheep or goat. If they ruled to confirm part and to eliminate part, since the Court does not bring a bull a private person has to bring a female sheep or goat<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the text is confirmed by B, it cannot be accepted since <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.1.3.1">Mishnah 3</a> explicitly states the opposite (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 1:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.1.1.6">Note 32</a>), and R. Johanan does not disagree with an anonymous Mishnah. Therefore, one has to switch the place of the statements “bring” and “do not bring”. He disagrees with Samuel in that he does not require that a majority of the people act upon the instructions of the Court. If a single person consciously commits a sin by acting upon their instruction, the individual is barred from bringing a sheep and the Court is required to bring a bull.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> "If the Court of one of the tribes ruled," etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">The Halakhah does not refer to Mishnah 8 but to Mishnaiot 6-7, to explain why R.

Rebbi Mana said, it is written: <i>For the crown of his God’s ointment is on him, I am the Eternal;</i> if one could compare it, just as I am in My Greatness, so Aaron is in his greatness.

Rebbi Ḥanina the scribe, Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: if an Anointed Priest sinned, one whips him in a court of three [judges]. If you would say in a court of 23, his elevation would be his degradation. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, if a patriarch sinned, one whips him in a court of three [judges]. Does one return him? Rebbi Ḥaggai said, better if one did return him, he would kill them. Rebbi Jehudah the Prince heard this and became angry. He sent Goths to catch Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. He fled to Magdala, some say to Kefar Ḥiţţim. Rebbi Joḥanan went to the assembly hall; Rebbi Jehudah the Prince also went to the assembly hall. He said to him, why is the master not telling us words of instruction? He started clapping with one hand. He asked, does one clap with one? He answered him, no, but without ben Laqish there is nothing. He said, no. He told him, I shall free him. He said to him, in Magdala. He told him, I and you will go out to meet him. Rebbi Joḥanan sent to Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, prepare for yourself some words of instruction since the Patriarch will go out to meet you. He went out to meet them and said, your example is similar to that of your Creator. For when the Merciful went to liberate Israel from Egypt, He sent neither messenger nor angel but He went Himself, as is written: <i>I shall pass through the Land of Egypt in that night, not only</i> He but all His Court.

It is forbidden to transport goods from one place to another on the Sabbath. “Transporting” means taking up the goods, moving them from one domain to another, and unloading. If any of the three actions be missing, no prosecutable sin was committed. In addition, for each kind of goods the Mishnah specifies minimal amounts. If less than the amount specified was transported while the person was oblivious of the Sabbath, no purification offering is required. On the other hand, if any number of transports were executed within one period of oblivion, only one sacrifice is needed. R.

It was stated: The Anointed Priest brings a bull, the one clothed in multiple garb does not bring a bull. This disagrees with Rebbi Meïr. What is Rebbi Meïr’s reason? <i>The Anointed</i>. Why does the verse say <i>priest</i>? To exclude the one clothed in multiple garb. What is the rabbis’ reason? <i>The anointed</i>. I could think that this is the king. Why does the verse say, <i>priest</i>? To include the one clothed in multiple garb. Here you say, to exclude the one clothed in multiple garb. But there you say, to include the one clothed in multiple garb. Rebbi Hila said, each inference refers to its meaning.
