Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:4" href="/Leviticus.5.4"><i>Lev</i>. 5:4</a> requires a reparation sacrifice for inadvertent breach of a commitment made by oath, “what was pronounced, negatively or positively.” The standard example of a positive oath is somebody swearing that he will eat certain foods. The corresponding negative is an oath that he will refrain from eating certain foods. The exact expression used, לְהָרַ֣ע ׀ א֣וֹ לְהֵיטִ֗יב, by its <i>hiph`il</i> form points to the future. A natural complement are backward looking oaths, if a person swears that he ate or did not eat certain foods in the past (Mishnah 3:1). These four cases are equal in sanctions for willful or inadvertent breach.</i>. There are two kinds of awareness of impurity which are four kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:2-3" href="/Leviticus.5.2-3"><i>Lev</i>. 5:2–3</a> requires a reparation sacrifice for a person who became impure, forgot it, and then either ate <i>sancta</i> in his impurity or entered the Sanctuary. The two added cases are that he knew about being impure but forgot that the food was holy or that the place was a Sanctuary.</i>. There are two kinds of export on the Sabbath which are four kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to transport anything on the Sabbath from a private domain to the public domain (Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1). “Transport” includes lifting up, moving, and setting down. The two cases where one is liable (for a sacrifice if the sin was unintentional, punishment if the transgression was intentional, and is prosecutable, or extirpation by Divine decree if the crime was intentional but is not prosecutable) are “export” by a person standing inside the private domain, lifting something up inside the domain and putting it down on the outside (e. g., through a window) even without moving his feet, or “import”, somebody lifting an object from the outside to the inside and depositing it there. The two cases where one is not liable refer to a person inside who lifts an object, hands it to a person outside (so that the object never is at rest) and the second person puts it down. Since no one person completed a criminal act, no one can be held liable even though the combined action clearly is forbidden.</i>. There are two kinds of appearances of skin disease which are four kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:2" href="/Leviticus.13.2"><i>Lev</i>. 13:2</a> defines impure skin disease as שְׂאֵ֤ת אֽוֹ־סַפַּ֨חַת֙ א֣וֹ בַהֶ֔רֶת “as elevated spot, or <i>sapaḥat</i>, or a white spot.” This is read as “an elevated spot (which makes the surrounding skin look elevated over the whitish spot) and a really white spot and their appendages”, deriving <i>sapaḥat</i> from the root ספח, “to append, adjoin.” This extends the definition of impure skin disease from two relatively well defined cases to two additional weaker symptoms.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is a slightly garbled copy of the first paragraph in Tractate <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1, of which there exists a Genizah parallel (L. Ginzberg, <i>Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah</i>, New York 1909, p. 62). The text in <i>Šabbat</i> is original since in both versions, “here” refers to <i>Šabbat</i> while “there” refers to <i>Ševuot</i>, and in addition, the statement of R. Ba logically has to precede that of R. Yose as in the <i>Šabbat</i> text. Probably the scribe of the <i>Ševuot</i> text available to the Leiden ms.’s scribe had omitted the statement of R. Ba and added it in the text when he noticed the omission. S. Liebermann, in his Commentary to the Yerushalmi <i>Šabbat</i> (<i>Hayerushalmi Kipshuto</i>, New York 1995, Jerusalem 1935) holds that the source is <i>Ševuot</i>. This is difficult to accept; the text is from <i>Šabbat</i> but the problem is the discrepancy in meaning of the same expression “two which are four” used in very different meanings in our Mishnah.<br>The problem starts with the rather complicated language of Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1: “There are two cases which are four for exporting and two cases which are four for importing.” The Mishnah then goes on to explain that if a rich person, the owner, stands at the window of a house (which is a private domain) and a poor person stands in the street (the public domain), if then the rich person delivers an object to the poor outside, or the poor reaches inside and takes the object, the person acting is liable to prosecution but the other is not liable. (In fact, the passive participant never did do anything; the expression “not liable to prosecution” is inappropriate.) But if the rich person lifted the object, kept it moving all the time, and handed it to the poor who put it down, nobody is liable since nobody completed a forbidden act. The same naturally applies if the poor takes up a package and keeps it moving until the the owner of the house takes it and puts it down. In this case, the qualification as “not liable” is appropriate since both participants violated a Sabbath prohibition.<br>The question now arises whether the formulation “two which are four” always implies that the status of the two additional cases is different from the two original ones since in our Mishnah the same expression is used for oaths and Sabbath violations.</i> Two which are four for liability and two which are four for no liability, or four for liability and four for no liability<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">S. Liebermann (Note 5) proposes to delete “four which are not liable” as induced by the preceding statement about “two and two” even though the text is common to all three versions at our disposal and it is difficult to assume that the redundant text was taught in the Galilean Academy. For the rules of the Sabbath, the case is simple and there is no redundancy. In the formulation of Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 there are four cases of liability, rich or poor taking out or rich or poor bringing in. There are also four cases where there is no liability, depending on who takes up the object first and who takes over, and what the direction of the move is. The question now is raised whether a similar case can be made for the first clause in Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1.</i>? Let us hear from the following: “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The statement of R. Abba later in this paragraph should be inserted here as noted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2">Note 5</a>. While “here” in <i>Šabbat</i> the Mishnah itself explains that there are two cases of liability and two of no liability, the situation in <i>Ševuot</i> is different; all four cases trigger the obligation of a sacrifice for inadvertent infraction and punishment for intentional infraction in the presence of witnesses.</i> Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah says so, “there are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” not because of liability<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Yose disagrees with R. Abba. Since everybody agrees that there are four cases which trigger a liability for oaths, the fact that the statement about Sabbath is formulated in the same Mishnah and in parallel form implies the same meaning in both clauses. Since Note 7 shows that Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 enumerates four cases of liability, there is no obstacle to reading the Sabbath clause in parallel to the oath clause. It is shown later in the paragraph that there are explicit verses only to forbid export; the parallel prohibitions of import are rabbinic interpretations.</i>? And similarly, “there are two kinds of export on the Sabbath which are four kinds,” because there is liability<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Yose disagrees with R. Abba. Since everybody agrees that there are four cases which trigger a liability for oaths, the fact that the statement about Sabbath is formulated in the same Mishnah and in parallel form implies the same meaning in both clauses. Since Note 7 shows that Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 enumerates four cases of liability, there is no obstacle to reading the Sabbath clause in parallel to the oath clause. It is shown later in the paragraph that there are explicit verses only to forbid export; the parallel prohibitions of import are rabbinic interpretations.</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The statement of R. Abba later in this paragraph should be inserted here as noted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2">Note 5</a>. While “here” in <i>Šabbat</i> the Mishnah itself explains that there are two cases of liability and two of no liability, the situation in <i>Ševuot</i> is different; all four cases trigger the obligation of a sacrifice for inadvertent infraction and punishment for intentional infraction in the presence of witnesses.</i> Rebbi Abba said, there all are about liability, but here we come to state both liability and no liability. This implies four of liability and four of no liability. But did we not state, the doors of the Temple hall were two which are four<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>baraita</i> refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Middot 4:1" href="/Mishnah_Middot.4.1">Mishnah <i>Middot</i> 4:1</a> which explains that the entrance gate to the Temple hall was built in the manner of a city gate, a thick wall closed by an outer double door opening to the outside and an inner two-winged door opening to the inside. The expression “two doors which are four” is simply the description of the structure of the building.</i>? Can you say, liability and no liability<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is inappropriate here.</i>? Should we state twelve cases of no liability<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 counts four actions for which one is liable (complete actions, export and import for the rich person, export and import for the poor.) Then it counts four cases for which one is not liable, but since for any incomplete action one is not liable one could consider the possibility that the poor man reaches into the house, lifts the object which the rich then takes up and deposits on the outside. A similar convoluted action is possible for import; two actions for two actors each result in four non-liabilities.</i>? We come to state cases of no liability which correspond to cases of no liability<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Only those cases are counted where a direct action, resulting in liability if executed by one person, imply no liability if done by two. The convoluted cases of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2">Note 11</a> are not noted since they do not correspond to a case that could involve only one actor.</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Šabbat</i>: bar Abba. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 2b-3a" href="/Shabbat.2b-3a">Babli, <i>Šabbat</i> 2b/3a</a>, the argument is by Babylonian Amoraim.</i> said, what is this “no liability” which we stated here? Permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The expression “no liability” is used in Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:1 in two completely different senses. As noted earlier (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.2">Note 5</a>) if the complete action is performed by one person, the other one is passive and does not infringe on any law; at all times everything he does is permitted. But if the action is completed by two persons, both sinned. While they are not liable for a sacrifice or punishment, they require repentance and Heaven’s forgiveness.</i>! Rebbi Yose said, the poor man and the rich man are one but the Sages counted them as two. Exporting or importing are two but the Sages counted them as one<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since both the rich man and the poor are described as executing the same actions, there is no intrinsic reason why they should be considered separately. It only is to emphasize the importance of the rules of transporting on the Sabbath. But, as will be shown in the sequel, not to bring out is a direct biblical command while not bringing into a private domain from the public one is an inference; the rules of importing must be transferred from those of exporting.<br>In <i>Šabbat</i>, the Genizah text and the first hand of the Leiden ms. read “Exporting or importing are one but the Sages counted them as two” but as S. Liebermann (Note 5) has noted, the reading here is supported by early Medieval quotes.</i>. Exporting on the Sabbath does not include importing; if one exports from a domain this does not include importing<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since there are no verses spelling out the prohibition of carrying from the public domain to a private one.</i>. If one who exports from one domain to the other, does this not include the one who imports<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Importing into one domain is exporting from another. There seems to be no reason to make a distinction between domains (even though there is a big difference since in a private domain one may carry without restriction but in the public domain only for a distance of less than 4 cubits.)</i>? In addition, from what Rebbi Yasa said in the name if Rebbi Joḥanan: Somebody who imports half the size of a dried fig and exports half the size of a dried fig is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">While any transport from one domain to another on the Sabbath is sinful, it creates a liability only if the object is of a minimal size (<i>Šabbat</i> Chapters 7–8). For solid food, the minimum is fixed at the volume of a dried fig. The two actions mentioned will combine if there was continuous awareness of the Sabbath prohibitions.</i>. And from where that exporting is called work? Rebbi Samuel in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: “Moses ordered, they made a public proclamation in the camp,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 36:6" href="/Exodus.36.6"><i>Ex</i>. 36:6</a>. The verse speaks of donations for the construction of the Tabernacle. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 96b" href="/Shabbat.96b">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 96b</a>) finds a tenuous connection with the Sabbath by a <i>gezerah šawah</i>, concurrent use of words.</i>” etc. The people refrained from taking objects out from their houses to give them to the collectors, who also did not take out anything from them to import into the office. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa understood it from the following: “do not bring out any load from your houses on the Sabbath day, and perform no work.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 17:22" href="/Jeremiah.17.22"><i>Jer</i>. 17:22</a>. While prophetic books are not sources of law, they are authentic evidence for the understanding of the Torah by the teachers of past generations. It is proved that in the understanding of Jeremiah (whose student Barukh ben Neriah is credited with bringing the study of Torah to Babylonia) moving objects from a private to the public domain is a violation of biblical law. This supports the interpretation of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 36:6" href="/Exodus.36.6"><i>Ex</i>. 36:6</a>.</i>”
Rebbi Mana said it without attribution<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He did not ascribe the following remark to R. Joḥanan or any other earlier Amora.</i>; Rebbi Abin in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: We did state two principles which do not compare. “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds”; one has to bring four sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 3:1, explicit in <i>Sifra Ḥovah</i> (<i>Wayyiqra</i> 2) <i>Parašah</i> 9(8). For the four cases enumerated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.1.1.1">Note 1</a>, R. Aqiba requires four separate sacrifices. R. Ismael infers from the forward-looking formulation of the verse that only future-directed oaths can trigger liability for a sacrifice. According to him, for separate oaths in the same period of oblivion at most two sacrifices may be due.</i>. “There are two kinds of appearances of skin disease which are four kinds”; one has to bring two sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The reference to skin disease also is in a difficult Genizah text (G, L. Ginzberg, <i>Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah</i>, New York 1909, p. 264 ff.) but it cannot be correct. The purification ceremony of the healed sufferer from skin disease is independent of the particular diagnosis by which he had been declared impure and the number of sacrifices due solely depends on his financial ability. The sequel shows that one has to read “there are two kinds of awareness of impurity which are four kinds,” the second clause in the Mishnah.<br>The difference between RR. Aqiba and Ismael is explained in <i>Sifra Ḥovah</i> (<i>Wayyiqra</i> 2) <i>Pereq</i> 12(7), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 14b" href="/Shevuot.14b">Babli 14b</a>. Both verses <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:2" href="/Leviticus.5.2"><i>Lev</i>. 5:2</a>,3 describe situations in which a person might become impure; they both end with the remark “it was hidden from him but then he knew and was found guilty,” i. e., he forgot about the impurity, entered the Sanctuary, and then became aware of his transgression. R. Aqiba holds that since impurity is mentioned twice but the Sanctuary only by inference, no sacrifice is due for causing impurity of the Sanctuary, only for entering it in impurity. R. Ismael holds that the repetition of the clause implies the obligation of a sacrifice both for impurity of the person and of the Sanctuary. R. Aqiba will hold that separate sacrifices might be due for impurity originating outside the person (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:2" href="/Leviticus.5.2">v. 2</a>) and that created in humans (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:3" href="/Leviticus.5.3">v. 3</a>). R. Ismael will hold that separate sacrifices are due for a human entering the Sanctuary in impurity and for the impurity thereby caused to the Sanctuary. The problem is that the Mishnah is anonymous, representing R. Meїr’s Mishnah, which is R. Aqiba’s tradition.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Abin<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">R. Abin mentioned at the start of the paragraph is R. Abin the son, head of the Academy of Tiberias at the time of R. Mana in Sepphoris. The reading “R. Eleazar in the name of R. Abin” (In G: “in the name of R. Abun”, at a second occurrence “R. Eliezer ben R. Abun”) is impossible since R. Abin (Abun) the father lived a generation and a half after R. Eleazar. As already recognized by R. David Fraenckel (<i>Qorban Ha`edah ad loc</i>.) one must read “R. Eleazar bar Abinna”, a third generation Galilean Amora.</i> explained it otherwise: “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds” was said by Rebbi Aqiba; “there are two kinds of appearances of skin disease which are four kinds” by Rebbi Ismael<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Tanna of the Mishnah is not inconsistent in his use of parallel expressions but the two parallel sentences represent two different tannaןtic positions.</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai asked before Rebbi Yose: why do I need to follow Rebbi Ismael? Does it not come even following Rebbi Aqiba? Knowing and forgetting about impurity of the Sanctuary is the same as knowing and forgetting about impurity of <i>sancta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since Mishnah 2:1 explains that even R. Aqiba can hold that “there are two kinds of awareness of impurity which are four kinds” only if he distinguishes between awareness of impurity and awareness of the Sanctuary, there seems to be a possibility following him to require a sacrifice for infringing on the purity of the Sanctuary when there was awareness of impurity but oblivion of the Sanctuary.</i>. He told him, does not Rebbi Ismael have forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary, and we want to follow Rebbi Aqiba<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Only R. Ismael requires a sacrifice both for forgetting impurity of <i>sancta</i> and forgetting the Sanctuary (Mishnah 2:6). R. Ḥaggai’s inference is incorrect; R. Aqiba will not require a sacrifice in his case.</i>? Sometimes there is forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Even following R. Ismael.</i>. How is this? If one became impure, realized it, then forgot about impurity, entered the Sanctuary, and left; then he became aware. Here is forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">There is no guilt attached to being impure. Guilt by impurity is incurred only if either the impure person enters the Sanctuary or eats from <i>sancta</i>. In the case in question there was only one forgetting; there is only one sacrifice required.<br>The sentence is missing in G.</i>. Sometimes there are many forgettings of impurity and many forgettings of the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one [sacrifice]. How [is this]<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Text of G היךְ עבידה.</i>? If one became impure and realized it, then forgot and while being oblivious of impurity entered the Sanctuary and left; then he became aware<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">There is only one oblivion and only one sacrifice.<br>The sentence is missing in G.</i>. He said, there is no sacrifice due for this impurity. Again he became impure and realized it, then forgot and while being oblivious of impurity entered the Sanctuary and left even several times; in the end he became aware. Here are many forgettings of impurity and forgettings of the Sanctuary but he is liable for only one [sacrifice]<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">At the first occasion, he was aware of the Sanctuary but he thought that for his kind of secondary impurity the Sanctuary was not forbidden. Then he entered several times while forgetting about the Sanctuary. Finally he realized his error concerning both impurity and Sanctuary. R. Ismael will agree that only one sacrifice is possible.</i>.
New paragraph. “There are two kinds of appearances of skin disease which are four kinds.” <sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta Nega`im 1:1, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 6a" href="/Shevuot.6a">Babli <i>Ševuot</i> 6a</a>.</i>“Rebbi Yose said, Joshua the son of Rebbi Aqiba asked Rebbi Aqiba.

He answered him, if not so, what should they have said? He said to him, they could have said ‘starting with eggshell and stronger it is impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">While white spots on one’s skin in general are harmless (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:38-39" href="/Leviticus.13.38-39"><i>Lev</i>. 13:38–39</a>), if they contain discolored hair they potentially are sources of impurity. This is characterized in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:2" href="/Leviticus.13.2"><i>Lev</i>. 13:2</a> as “<i>s´et</i>, adjoint, or shiny spot” which is read as “<i>s´et</i>, shiny spot, or one of their adjoints”. It is indicated that the Cohen has to determine the nature of the impurity but no details are given, possibly to reserve diagnosis to priests. The details therefore are left to tradition. In Mishnah <i>Nega`im</i> 1:1, “shiny spot” is defined by R. Meїr as color of fresh snow, <i>s´et</i> as color of eggshell (or the color of the membrane enclosing a hard boiled egg.) These colors are characterized as appearing as depressions on normal skin (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:3" href="/Leviticus.13.3"><i>Lev</i>. 13:3</a>). There are secondary forms for which the spots do not appear as if depressed (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 13:4" href="/Leviticus.13.4"><i>Lev</i>. 13:4</a>), these are described as the color of whitewash used in the Temple and that of white wool. The Sages disagreeing with R. Meїr declare eggshell as a secondary color. Since in the Tosephta eggshell is treated as secondary color, R. Meїr cannot represent the teachings of R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Intentional impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Those that cannot be taken care of otherwise; for example, if a person intentionally ate impure <i>sancta</i> but was not duly warned beforehand. Then he cannot bring a sacrifice which is reserved for unintentional sins. He cannot be punished in court since he was not warned and therefore criminal intent cannot be established. The contamination of the Sanctuary and its <i>sancta</i> is removed by the Day of Atonement; whether the person’s guilt is removed without due repentance is a topic for the Halakhah.</i> of the Sanctuary and its <i>sancta</i> is atoned by the he-goat whose blood is brought inside and the Day of Atonement.

Therefore it has to repair all infractions which cannot be repaired otherwise, i. e., intentional infractions that cannot be prosecuted (for lack of eye witnesses or prior warnings). Since severe unintentional infractions (those if intentional would be punished by Divine extirpation or judicial execution) require a sacrifice, the public offering does not absolve the sinner from his obligation; it only suspends the damaging influence on the Sanctuary. The statement is incomplete since infractions for which the penalty is not spelled out in the Pentateuch (“simple infractions”) cannot be atoned for by a sacrifice and, if committed against the Sanctity of the Sanctuary or is <i>sancta</i>, must be atoned for by the public offering.</i>.

About this one it says, <i>for on</i><i>that day</i>, <i>He shall pardon you</i>. If one intentionally transgressed [sins punishable by] extirpations or death penalties, repentance and the Day of Atonement atone half, and sufferings atone half. About this one it says, <i>I shall visit their crime with the rod</i>, <i>and their iniquities with plagues</i>. But by whom the Name of Heaven was desecrated, there is no power in repentance to suspend judgment, nor in the Day of Atonement to pardon, nor in sufferings to scour; but repentance and the Day of Atonement suspend, and death scours with sufferings<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 3:22" href="/Jeremiah.3.22"><i>Jer</i>. 3:22</a>.</i>.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are the words of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah, Rebbi Ismael, and Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say that the scapegoat pardons. How does it pardon? Rebbi Ze`ira said, by and by. Rebbi Ḥanania<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">This name is used throughout in G and <i>Yoma</i>.</i> said, at the end. What is between them? If somebody died in-between. In the opinion of Rebbi Ze`ira, he already was pardoned. In the opinion of Rebbi Ḥanina, he was not pardoned. Rebbi Ze`ira said, a <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ḥanina: There is strength in the he-goat which is not in the Day of Atonement, and in the Day of Atonement which is not in the he-goat: The Day of Atonement pardons without a he-goat, but the he-goat does not atone without the Day of Atonement. The he-goat pardons immediately but the Day of Atonement only at nightfall. Rebbi Huna said, the question was raised before Rebbi Jeremiah and he said, explain it if they intended to bring another he-goat but they did not bring it. Rebbi Yose said, but does the Holy One, praise to Him, not see into the future? Then He should pardon immediately.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The kinds of awareness of impurity are two<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Either centered on <i>sancta</i> or the Sanctuary, as detailed in the Mishnah. All violations of the Sanctuary and <i>sancta</i> in a state of oblivion require a sacrifice depending on the wealth of the perpetrator (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 2:2-13" href="/Leviticus.2.2-13"><i>Lev</i>. 2:2–13</a>).</i> which are four. If one became impure, realized it, then the impurity was forgotten but he was aware of <i>sancta</i>; or <i>sancta</i> were forgotten by him but he remembered impurity; or he forgot both, ate <i>sanctum</i> and realized it after he had eaten: he is obligated for a variable sacrifice.<br>If one became impure, realized it, the impurity was forgotten but he was aware of the Sanctuary; or the Sanctuary was forgotten by him but he remembered impurity; or he forgot both, entered the Sanctuary and realized it after he had left: he is obligated for a variable sacrifice.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The kinds of awareness of impurity,” etc. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: It is obvious about the last awareness, until he knows that he is liable to bring a sacrifice for it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:3" href="/Leviticus.5.3"><i>Lev</i>. 5:3</a> requires a sacrifice if after forgetting about impurity <i>he knew and felt guilty</i>. Since as a general rule no obligatory sacrifice can be offered voluntarily, the verse implies that a variable value sacrifice for violations involving impurity is possible if the offerer can prove that he is liable for the sacrifice.</i>. Is the same true for the first awareness<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There can be no forgetting if there was no prior knowledge. Must this prior knowledge be one of certainty or can it be one of possibility?</i>? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 19a" href="/Shevuot.19a">Babli 19a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Tahorot 6:5" href="/Tosefta_Tahorot.6.5">Tosephta <i>Ṭahorot</i> 6:7</a> (the full text later, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 2:1:10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.2.1.10">Note 41</a>).</i>: Two paths, one impure and one pure. He walked on one of them<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It was known that one of the paths passed over a spot where a corpse was buried. The spot is no longer recognizable and people do no longer remember which of the paths it was. Anybody walking on one of the paths is possible impure by forming a “tent” over a corpse.</i>, entered the Sanctuary, left, sprinkled repeatedly, immersed himself<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He observed the ritual of removing the impurity of the dead (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19" href="/Numbers.19"><i>Num</i>. 19</a>) by being sprinkled with water containing ashes of the Red Heifer on the 3rd and 7th days and then immersing himself in a <i>miqweh</i>.</i>, walked on the second one, and entered the Sanctuary; he is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since he walked both paths, he certainly polluted the Sanctuary by entering while impure. Even though he cannot determine which time he entered while impure, he can be sure that he did it exactly once; this is enough to trigger the obligation of a sacrifice.</i> and he knows that he is liable to bring a sacrifice for it. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, this is Rebbi Ismael’s<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 2:6.</i> who said that he is liable for forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, we thought that one could say that Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said this if he was certain that he was impure, he had forgotten the impurity and entered the Sanctuary. But not if it was in doubt whether he was impure or pure, he was oblivious of the Sanctuary and entered the Sanctuary. Since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, this is Rebbi Ismael’s who said that he is liable for forgetting impurity and forgetting the Sanctuary: this implies even if it was in doubt whether he was impure or pure<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that R. Simeon ben Laqish holds that for R. Aqiba, who admits a variable sacrifice only for cases where impurity was known, forgotten, and remembered, no sacrifice was possible in this case since the impurity was never known. It only is known that the two possibilities both were realized and there is no third alternative.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is everybody’s opinion since a doubt of awareness is awareness<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since we accept the principle of the excluded middle (i.e., a statement is either true or false) a proof that the person could not have been pure both times is proof that he was impure (at least) once. For awareness of impurity no awareness of the exact time of impurity is needed. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 19b" href="/Shevuot.19b">Babli (19b</a>) points out that this argument is needed only for variable reparation sacrifices since for purification sacrifices no prior knowledge is required.</i>. Since at a time when he does not know whether he was impure or pure you say it is certain knowledge, if he knows for certain that he is impure but does not know whether he is liable for a sacrifice then certainly this should be awareness<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It is irrelevant to him if he does not know when the obligation of a sacrifice started since the competent Temple authority can determine that his obligatory sacrifice is legitimate.</i>.
In Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish’s opinion, if one became impure but it was for him in doubt, would this be for him like forgetting, which makes him liable<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He became impure without noticing it. Then a thought arose in his mind that he might have become impure. He forgot about it, committed an offense against the laws of purity, and finally discovered that he actually had been impure to start with. Does this qualify for the sequence awareness - forgetting - awareness required for a variable sacrifice?</i>? Each of them keeps to his opinion, as they disagreed:
<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:10" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.10"><i>Horaiot</i> 3:2, Notes 40–45</a>, and part of a longer disquisition (Notes 36–45). The quote here starts in the middle and, therefore, is not very intelligible. But in <i>Horaiot</i> the text is complete and completely intelligible.</i> One ate five times the volume of an olive; he separately realized a doubt about each one. Afterwards it became known to him as a certainty. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, the knowledge about his doubt determines his kind of sacrifices. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the knowledge about his doubt does not determine his kind of sacrifices. Rebbi Yose bar Abun in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac: Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish agrees that for the Anointed Priest the knowledge about his doubt does not determine his kind of purification sacrifice. What is the reason? <i>Like purification offering</i>, <i>like reparation offering</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:7" href="/Leviticus.7.7"><i>Lev</i>. 7:7</a>.</i>. The knowledge about his doubt determines the transgression for one who brings a suspended reparation offering. The knowledge about his doubt does not determine the transgression for one who does not bring a suspended reparation offering.
The argument of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish seems to be inverted. There he says, the knowledge about his doubt determines his kind of transgression. But here he says, the knowledge about his doubt does not determine his kind of transgression. There, his reparation offering determines it. Here what do you have?
The argument of Rebbi Joḥanan seems to be inverted. There, he said, if part of the sin was atoned, all of the sin was atoned. And here he says so? Rebbi Joḥanan said this only for the last realization which does not require any sacrifice.
Rebbi Joḥanan said: In any case of doubt in the public domain, the doubt has to be resolved as pure, but one does not allow to act<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Tahorot 4:11" href="/Mishnah_Tahorot.4.11">Mishnah <i>Ṭahorot</i>4:11</a> (and made explicit there in Chapters 5–6) that any doubt which arises in the public domain whether something there is impure can be disregarded. Rebbi Joḥanan’s new statement is that even though this is accepted practice, one does not teach this and if a person comes to ask about it, one does not say that the thing is pure.</i>. But did we not state<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Parah</i>11:2. While in general the rules of purity for the water in which ashes of the Red Cow are to be dissolved to purify from the impurity of the dead are very strict, if for heave something is declared pure, such as a doubt of impurity arising in the public domain, it also must be declared pure for the sprinkling water. But if judgment is suspended, i. e., if the heave may not be eaten by a Cohen for perhaps it is impure (when its consumption would be a deadly sin), but it cannot be burned for perhaps it is pure and then the destruction of <i>sancta</i> would be sinful, the water is considered impure and must be poured out on the ground to avoid further pollution.<br>The expression חַטָּאת biblically refers to the Red Cow (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19:2" href="/Numbers.19.2"><i>Num.</i>19:2</a>), not to the water which is called מֵי נִדָּה “throwing water”.(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19:20-21" href="/Numbers.19.20-21"><i>Num</i>. 19:20–21</a>).</i>: “Any case of doubt which was declared pure for heave is pure for sprinkling water, and in any case where it remains unresolved for heave the sprinkling water is poured out.” There is nothing unresolved for the sprinkling water; either it is genuinely pure or genuinely impure. Rebbi Ze`ira said, the Mishnah deals with a situation not caused by a sacrifice; what Rebbi Joḥanan said refers to a situation caused by a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah in <i>Parah</i> instructs the carrier of purifying water to disregard any doubt arising in the public domain, the instruction of R. Joḥanan that one does not allow anybody to act on this rule cannot be maintained. The answer is that R. Joḥanan stated his rule only for <i>sancta</i> of the Sanctuary; for all <i>sancta</i> not connected with the Sanctuary it is a publicly stated rule that a doubt in the public domain has to be disregarded.</i>. Everybody agrees that if the person transgresses and acted, it is pure<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Only if somebody acted as if it was pure and after the fact comes to ask a rabbinic authority, one has to declare the matter as pure even in the Sanctuary. “Everybody” includes R. Aqiba who in certain cases declares such a doubt as causing impurity (<i>Ṭahorot</i>5:1).</i>. The arguments of Rebbi Joḥanan are inverted. There<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Later in this paragraph, when he declares that a <i>nazir</i>, who is forbidden to become impure by the impurity of the dead, must treat a certain case of doubt of impurity as a case of certain impurity.</i>, he says, if he transgresses and acted, it is impure. But here he said, if he transgresses and acted, it is pure. There in a private domain, here in the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And everybody agrees that in a private domain any doubt of impurity has to be treated as certainty of impurity.</i>. But you could even say, there and here in the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Following R. Ze`ira.</i>. The arguments of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish are inverted, the arguments of Rebbi Joḥanan are inverted, since they disagreed: A <i>nazir</i> became impure by a grave in the abyss<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A corpse, visibly the victim of an accident not seen by witnesses and found buried in straw or pebbles or other loose material.

Eliezer and R. Joshua disagree in the case that a person knows that he has inadvertently committed a sin which if intentional is either one subject to Divine extirpation or a capital crime, but he does not know which law he broke. Examples are a person who inadvertently ate a piece of meat which either was forbidden fat or disqualified sacrificial meat, or a man who slept with a woman but he does not know whether it was his wife during her menses or his sister. R. Eliezer declares him liable for a fixed value purification sacrifice since in any case he committed a deadly sin; R. Joshua declares him not liable (and therefore prevented from sacrificing) as long as he cannot specify which prohibition he broke. It is implied that in the case of a variable value reparation sacrifice for violation of the purity of the Sanctuary the opinions are switched; R. Eliezer requires knowledge of the kind of impurity (e. g., “a crawling animal”) whereas R. Joshua only requires awareness of impurity. Ḥizqiah would trace R. Aqiba’s opinion to his teacher R. Joshua.</i>. There he says, even if he did not know. But here he says, not unless he knew. <sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The arguments quoted for R. Eliezer belong to R.

Rebbi Ḥinena said, here “by what” is not written. The argument of Rebbi Joshua seems inverted. <sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">This is R. Eliezer’s argument. As formulated in the Mishnah, he reads <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:2" href="/Leviticus.5.2"><i>Lev</i>. 5:2</a> as requiring awareness of the nature of his impurity (or, taking vv. 2,3 together, at least certain knowledge of the kind of impurity, whether simple or severe.) But in v. 4:23 and certainly v. 27, the purification sacrifice of a commoner, where it is only required that <i>he sinned inadvertently</i>, can be read as authorization for a sacrifice if only the fact was known that a sin was committed.</i> There he says, <i>while he was impure</i>, not unless he knew by what he became liable. Here, <i>by which he sinned,</i> in any case. How does Rebbi Eliezer uphold <i>by what</i>? This excludes the one who is occupied<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Accepting that R. Eliezer refers to 4:27, the peculiar language of 4:23 still has to be explained. He excludes a person who was intent on doing something permitted when it happened that he broke a prohibition, e. g., that he was intent of sleeping with his wife when she was permitted to him and in the dark of night his sister substituted for her. She sinned but he did not.</i>.

Chapter 3



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are two kinds of oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 1:1. This Chapter treats “blurted oaths” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:4" href="/Leviticus.5.4"><i>Lev</i>. 5:4</a>) where a person makes an oath that he shall do or not do certain things, which do not involve others. A breach of such an oath triggers a liability for a variable sacrifice (or if made before witnesses, punishment by flogging.) The liability for a variable sacrifice is subject to the usual conditions for such a sacrifice, prior knowledge, oblivion, and remembrance.</i> which are four kinds: An oath that I shall eat, or that I shall not eat; that I ate, or that I did not eat. An oath that I shall not eat, when he ate the most minute amount, he is liable, the words of Rebbi Aqiba. They said to Rebbi Aqiba, where do we find that one who eats the most minute amount should be liable, that this one be liable<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In all other matters, only food in the volume of an average olive triggers obligations.</i>? He told them, where do we find that a person talks and has to bring a sacrifice; but this one talks and has to bring a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In general, only actions, not words, trigger obligations; but an oath is simply words (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:10:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.10.3">Note 166</a>). In commercial transactions an obligation is enforceable only when it was confirmed by an action, such as a signature or a handshake. But there are other possible exceptions, such as blasphemy and apostasy (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.1.4">Note 21</a>).</i>!
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” etc. One understands “that I shall eat, or that I shall not eat.” “That I ate, or that I did not eat”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">We do not talk here about judicial oaths which by necessity are about past events, but “blurted oaths”. How can a statement about past events ever lead to a variable sacrifice? For a future directed oath it is possible that he had the honest intention of keeping what he swore to but later he forgot. But for the past we must assume that he knows what he did.</i>? Where do we stand? If it is known that he ate and he swore that he did not eat, it is a false oath<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Under the right conditions he can be punished for it, but there can be no atoning sacrifice.</i>. But if he was of the opinion that he ate and swore that he did not eat? Rebbi Abba, Rav Jehudah in the name of Rav: If he is inadvertent for its sacrifice or intentional for its sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A sacrifice is possible only for an inadvertent sin. In this context, “inadvertent” may mean that the perpetrator was not aware that his act was criminal or sinful, or that he was not aware that the act if inadvertent requires a sacrifice.</i>. But “I was of the opinion that this is not an oath” is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A statement qualifies as an oath only if it is pronounced as such, not as a simple statement.</i>. But it must be that he was intentional in the deed but in error about the sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A sacrifice is possible only for an inadvertent sin. In this context, “inadvertent” may mean that the perpetrator was not aware that his act was criminal or sinful, or that he was not aware that the act if inadvertent requires a sacrifice.</i>. Did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumot</i>7:1 Notes 5,6; <i>Šabbat</i>11:5 (13b), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 3:1:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.3.1.7"><i>Ketubot</i>3:1 Note 30</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Bava Kamma 7:4:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Kamma.7.4.2"><i>Bava Qamma</i>7:2 Note 29</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 69a" href="/Shabbat.69a">Babli <i>Šabbat</i>69a</a>.</i>: Intentional about fat and in error about the sacrifice, one warns him, he is flogged and has to bring a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrifices are possible only for inadvertent deadly sins. If a person knew that eating fat was forbidden but did not know that it was a deadly sin, he simultaneously committed an intentional sin and an unintentional deadly sin. If he had been duly warned by two witnesses not to break the law, he can be flogged for the intentional sin and has to bring a sacrifice for the unintentional deadly sin even though there cannot be two penalties for one crime (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 7:1:4-14" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.7.1.4-14"><i>Terumot</i>7:1 Notes 19–70</a>).</i>. This is impossible, as Rebbi La said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: So did Rebbi Ismael<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Who is R. Aqiba’s opponent. All of Mishnah 1 is R. Aqiba’s teaching. R. Ismael opposes adding backward looking oaths as blurted oaths.</i> answer Rebbi Aqiba: Do we find a situation where one is liable if intentional because of a false oath and in oblivion because of blurting<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A future directed oath, where it cannot be verified instantly whether it will be kept or violated, is an actionless crime and cannot be prosecuted (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.1.1">Note 3</a>). The preconditions of a sacrifice for a blurted oath negate the possibility of judicial penalties.</i>? Should not Rebbi Aqiba retort, we find a situation where one is liable if intentional because of a false oath and he brings a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If R. Aqiba did accept R. Joḥanan’s argument, it would be possible for a person to be flogged for violating the prohibition of perjury (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 19:12" href="/Leviticus.19.12"><i>Lev</i>. 19:12</a>) and still be liable for a sacrifice. This would make R. Ismael’s objection irrelevant.</i>? But we deal here with the case that he was sure that he ate, and he swore, and it turned out that he had not eaten. Not about him who said that this is not an oath? There<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">If he denies that he intended or pronounced an oath, there is no oath and the entire discussion is irrelevant.</i>, if he says this is not an oath; but here if he knows that this is an oath but he errs because of something else<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">He made the oath in good faith but his mind was distracted by other things. It is an inadvertent sin which qualifies for a sacrifice.</i>.
Where do we hold? If about one who said, an oath that I shall eat according to Torah standards<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The standard minimal amounts of food which in biblical rules either are needed for the validity of an act or may lead to prosecution of a criminal act. This is the volume of an average olive. R. Aqiba must agree that if somebody insists that his food intake be measured by biblical standards, the minimum is an olive-sized piece. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 21b" href="/Shevuot.21b">Babli disagrees (21b</a>) and holds that R. Aqiba agrees with R. Simeon that there is no lower limit for prosecutable offenses (<i>Pesaḥim</i>3:1 29d l. 61).</i>, even Rebbi Aqiba will agree. And if about one who says, an oath that I shall not taste, even the rabbis will agree<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Tasting by definition involves minute amounts (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 22a" href="/Shevuot.22a">Babli 22a</a>).</i>. But we hold, about minute amounts. Are minute amounts eating? Explain it following Rebbi Aqiba who said that a minute amount is eating. What is the difference between them<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Between R. Aqiba and his opponents in the second part of the Mishnah.</i>? “An oath that I shall eat this loaf,” and he ate it except a minute amount. In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba he is liable, in the opinion of the rabbis he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Let ε denote the volume of an olive. If somebody swore that he would (or would not) eat a certain amount <i>m</i>, for R. Aqiba he fulfilled (or violated) his oath if he ate exactly amount <i>m</i>. But for the rabbis he fulfilled (or violated) his oath if he ate more than <i>m</i>-ε but less than <i>m</i>+ε. This is the basis of the subsequent examples. If he had sworn to eat exactly one loaf, for R. Aqiba he violated his oath by eating a minute quantity less than a whole loaf but for the rabbis he swore truly.</i>. “That I shall not eat this loaf,” and he ate it except a minute amount. In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba he is not liable, in the opinion of the rabbis he is liable. Also for blurted oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This expression is difficult to understand and may be a copyist’s error since the preceding two examples are prime examples of blurted oaths. Maybe one should read “vows”, since the example uses the language of vows denying usufruct.</i> it is so: “An oath that my wife may not have any usufruct from me if I shall eat this loaf,” and he ate it except a minute amount. In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba his wife is forbidden [to have usufruct], in the opinion of the rabbis his wife is permitted. “That I shall not eat this loaf,” and he ate it except a minute amount. In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba his wife is permitted [to have usufruct], in the opinion of the rabbis his wife is forbidden. Also with property it is the same. “An oath that my properties be forbidden to me if I shall eat this loaf,” and he ate it except a minute amount. In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba they are forbidden, in the opinion of the rabbis his properties are permitted. “That I shall not eat this loaf,” and he ate it except a minute amount. In the opinion of Rebbi Aqiba his properties are permitted, in the opinion of the rabbis they are forbidden.
Does not the blasphemer have to bring a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This is a matter of contention. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Keritot 1:1" href="/Mishnah_Keritot.1.1">Mishnah <i>Keritut</i>1:1</a>, the anonymous Tanna, supposed to represent the school of R.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> An oath that I shall not eat, when he ate and drank<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since the general acceptation of “eating” is “ingesting nourishment”, this is the meaning of the word if used in an oath unless the wording of the oath clearly indicates that a more narrow meaning is intended, such as “ingesting solid food”.</i> he is liable only for one. An oath that I shall not eat or drink, when he ate and drank he is liable for two.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “An oath that I shall not eat; when he ate,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The entire Halakhah does not refer to Mishnah 2 but to the last part of Mishnah 1 where it is stated that an oath to refrain from eating includes a prohibition of drinking but separate oaths for solid and fluid food mean just that. The text is a slightly inaccurate copy of a text in <i>Ma`aser ŠœŠeni</i>2:1, Notes 8–23 and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 8:3:2-15" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.8.3.2-15"><i>Yoma</i>8:3</a> (45a); a parallel discussion is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 22b-23a" href="/Shevuot.22b-23a">Babli, 22b–23a</a>. The essence of the argument is that if one mentions eating, the accompanying drink is included, but speaking of drinking no solid food is intended.</i> Drinking is subsumed under eating but eating is not subsumed under drinking. Rebbi Jonah understood all this from: <i>Therefore, I told the Children of Israel, none of you shall eat blood</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 17:12" href="/Leviticus.17.12"><i>Lev</i>. 17:12</a>.</i>. Where do we hold? If about congealed blood, was it not stated that congealed blood is neither food nor drink? <sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This text does not belong here; it was copied again from Halakhah 1, text between Notes 17,18.</i>(But we hold, about minute amounts. Are minute amounts eating? Explain it following Rebbi Aqiba who said that a minute amount is eating.) And was it not stated: If one liquefied the blood and swallowed it, or froze fat and ate it, if there is the volume of an olive he is liable. What does Rebbi Jonah do with this? It is not food to become impure in the impurity of food, or fluid to become impure in the impurity of fluids. Rebbi Jonah changed and explained the Mishnah: <i>You shall spend the money for anything you desire</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:26" href="/Deuteronomy.14.26"><i>Deut</i>. 14:26</a>. The argument is about the part of the verse which is not quoted, that the money of Second Tithe may be spent for all kinds of edibles, cattle and sheep, wine and liquor.</i>. Where do we hold? If about one who gives the taste of wine into a cooked dish, is that not spoiling the taste? But we hold with everything and the Merciful called it “eating.” The rabbis of Caesarea said, explain if about <i>gomraya</i> and <i>orzaraya</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma`aser Šeni</i>2:1, Note 16. For the second word the preferred reading seems to be that of the other two sources, אורזנייה, which may denote cedar resin (J. Levy) or a derivative of אוֹרֶז “rice”. The readings for the first word, גמרייה, גמזוזיניה, גומננייא show that the scribe did not know what to do with it; it may be a derivative of “gum” (<i>gummi, κόμμι</i>) (E. G.) used in the preparation of liquors.</i>, since anything that is auxiliary to food is like food.
Rebbi Yose understood all this from the following: “An oath that I shall not eat; when he ate and drank he is liable only for one.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 1.</i>” The colleagues said before Rebbi Yose, but it is said following this, “an oath that I shall not eat nor drink, when he ate and drank”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 1.</i> should he be liable only for one? Rebbi Yose told them, if somebody said, an oath that I shall not eat this loaf, and he continued, an oath that I shall not eat this other loaf, when he ate both of them would he not be guilty on two counts?
Rebbi Ḥanina<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel sources correctly: Ḥananiah.</i> in the name of Rebbi Phineas understood all this from the following: “An oath that I shall not eat; when he ate inedible food and drank undrinkable fluids, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 5.</i>” Therefore if he ate edible food and drank drinkable fluid he is liable.
Rebbi Abba<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel sources correctly: Abba Mari.</i> understood all this from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 8:1:1-13" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.8.1.1-13">Mishnah <i>Yoma</i>8:1</a>.</i>: “If he ate and drank in one forgetting he is liable only once.”
Rebbi Ḥinena understood all this from the following: <i>I did not eat from it in my mourning,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 26:14" href="/Deuteronomy.26.14"><i>Deut.</i> 26:14</a></i> but I drank?
So far if he said, that I shall not eat, but he drank. If he said, that I shall not drink, but he ate? Drinking is subsumed under eating but eating is not subsumed under drinking.

Joḥanan holds that if an oath is valid since it contains matters not involving Torah prohibitions it is valid in general since an oath is either valid or invalid. R. Simeon ben Laqish (and in the Mishnah, R. Simeon ben Ioḥai) hold that oaths can be partially invalid; the parts infringing on Torah precepts are always void (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 33b" href="/Shevuot.33b">Babli 33b</a>).</i>.

Rebbi Simeon told them, do you not agree that one who eats an ant is liable? They told him, because it is a creature.

Rebbi Ze`ira said, Rebbi Simeon follows his own opinion. It was stated in the name of Rebbi Simeon: <i>You shall deprive yourselves</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 16:29" href="/Leviticus.16.29"><i>Lev</i>. 16:29</a>.</i>, of what is permitted to you, not of what is forbidden to you<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Eating non-kosher food violates a simple prohibition; breaking the fast on the Day of Atonement is a severe sin subjecting the unrepentant sinner to extirpation. R. Simeon declares eating non-kosher food on the Day of Atonement as violation of a simple prohibition (which if committed inadvertently does not make the perpetrator liable for a sacrifice). If the stringent prohibition of the Day of Atonement does not include forbidden food then an oath which never can lead to extirpation cannot include forbidden food either.</i>.
Rebbi Abba bar Mamal asked: According to Rebbi Joḥanan, who said that comprehensive oaths fall on prohibitions, should we not state “an oath that I shall not eat; when he ate”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Keritot 3:4" href="/Mishnah_Keritot.3.4">Mishnah <i>Keritut</i>3:4</a>, that a person may become liable for 5 sacrifices for eating one olive-size bite: an impure person who on the Day of Atonement ate sacrificial fat which was a leftover from a prior day. Eating fat is always forbidden; eating sacrificial fat is illegitimate use of <i>sacra,</i> classified as larceny (requiring restitution and a reparation sacrifice); eating any <i>sacra</i> while impure is punishable by extirpation. The mention of the Day of Atonement shows that the Mishnah is formulated for the Rabbis, not R. Simeon. The question then is, if the statement of R. Joḥanan be true that an oath containing a general prohibition also refers to things biblically prohibited, the Tanna, who obviously is looking for an example showing the maximum of criminal acts that can be committed by one action, should have added that the person who ate the fat had previously made an oath that he would not eat at all, for a total of 6 sacrifices. That no oath is mentioned in the Mishnah seems to prove that R. Joḥanan’s position is rejected by the Mishnah; it cannot be accepted in practice.</i>? Rebbi Ze`ira said, in the whole lifetime of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal we did not find an answer; after he had died, we found an answer. Where do we stand? If one said, an oath that I shall not eat meat, including Passover<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Since oaths have to be interpreted according to common usage, not lawyers’ jargon, an oath “that I shall not eat” will be interpreted as oath not to eat permitted food; the question of R. Abba bar Mamal does not apply. But an oath to become vegetarian is a valid oath and in Temple times would prevent the person from fulfilling the commandment of eating of the Passover sacrifice. Since in contrast to vows oaths cannot be dissolved by a rabbi, this is a case where a general oath supersedes a biblical commandment.</i>; that I shall not eat during these ten days<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Ten days of Penitence, from New Year’s day to and including the Day of Atonement. In this case breaking the fast is a double sin since it also means breaking the oath. The entire argument is for the Rabbis, so it includes eating non-kosher food.</i>, including the Day of Atonement, then the oath falls on prohibitions. Rebbi Yose said, one may infer from here if in front of him were olive-sized pieces of slaughtered [meat] and one of carcass meat and he said, [an oath] that I shall eat these ten olive-sized pieces, since he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This follows R. Simeon. If there can be no punishment for breaking the oath relative to the carcass meat then there cannot be one for eating the other 9 since the oath was for 10, not for 9 pieces.</i> for the carcass meat, he neither is liable for the remainder.
Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked: Why did he not say, “an oath that I shall eat of the slaughter of X”? Is there not fat? If he slaughters deer. Is there not the hip sinew? About fowl. Is there not blood<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Following R. Joḥanan it is difficult to find any oath involving meat that should be valid at all, since he requires an oath which forbids permitted foods; as a consequence it will also apply to prohibitions. But if somebody forbids himself anything which a person X will slaughter, the oath includes the fat of the slaughtered domestic animal forbidden by biblical standards. Since an original oath forbidding biblically forbidden things is void, the entire oath is voided. Similarly for wild animals, whose fat is permitted (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:23" href="/Leviticus.7.23"><i>Lev</i>. 7:23</a>), the hip sinew still is forbidden (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 32:33" href="/Genesis.32.33"><i>Gen</i>. 32:33</a>), and the blood of a fowl is forbidden like the blood of four-legged animals (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:27" href="/Leviticus.7.27"><i>Lev</i>. 7:27</a>).</i>?
Rebbi Ḥinena asked: Why did he not say, “an oath if I would eat of X” without detail<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The difficulty encountered in the preceding paragraph can easily be circumvented if the oath is made on a piece of meat which does not contain any forbidden fat and is drained of its blood. Then the only problem is the problem that for R. Simeon the number of required sacrifices is not a measure of the number of prohibitions which were violated; the Tanna might want to formulate his statement to take care of R. Simeon’s opinions also. But since the Mishnah requires a separate sacrifice for eating forbidden fat on the Day of Atonement, it certainly cannot be formulated for R. Simeon, who denies that the prohibitions of that day refer to forbidden food.</i>? Because of Rebbi Simeon. But if following Rebbi Simeon, how could we state the Day of Atonement, since Rebbi Simeon stated, <i>you shall deprive yourselves</i>, of what is (forbidden)<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear that the words in parentheses have to be switched, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:4:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.4.2">Note 52</a>.</i> to you, not of what is (permitted)<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear that the words in parentheses have to be switched, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:4:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.4.2">Note 52</a>.</i> to you. Only one has a fixed rate sacrifice, the other a variable one<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The Tanna of <i>Keritut</i> counts only the maximum of fixed-rate sacrifices; he could agree that with an oath a liability for a variable rate sacrifice could be added.

They objected, is there not impurity of the Sanctuary and its <i>sancta</i> which need a variable rate [sacrifice] and did the Tanna not state it<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The previous explanation is incorrect. The Tanna of <i>Keritut</i> mentioned a sacrifice for eating <i>sancta</i> in impurity; this requires a variable value sacrifice.</i>? We come to state only things carrying a liability to extirpation; there is no extirpation for oaths.
They objected, there is no extirpation for larceny and it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The previous explanation is incorrect. The Tanna of <i>Keritut</i> mentioned a sacrifice for illegally appropriating Temple property for private use. There is no extirpation mentioned for this, only restitution with a fine and a reparation sacrifice (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:14-16" href="/Leviticus.5.14-16"><i>Lev</i>. 5:14–16</a>). Only fixed-rate purification offerings are restricted to atoning for unintentional sins carrying a penalty of at least extirpation, not reparation sacrifices. This finally yields the correct answer.</i>! We come to state only things which cannot become permitted after being forbidden. Oaths may become permitted after being forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since oaths may be made for a certain time only.</i>.

Since the anonymous Tanna placed the case on the Day of Atonement, and any work forbidden on the Sabbath is forbidden on the Day of Atonement, R. Meїr could simply have added carrying also on the day of Atonement. Since he has to place that Day on a Sabbath, it follows that any and all infringements of the sanctity of the Day of Atonement trigger the same liability of a sacrifice. There never can be more than one for a given Day. The conclusion of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Keritot 14a" href="/Keritot.14a">Babli, <i>Keritut</i>14a</a>, is formulated more narrowly: Transporting from domain to domain is not a separate desecration of the Day of Atonement.</i>, for if anybody violated all of them in one forgetting he is liable only for one [sacrifice] for all of them. But if anybody violated each of them separately, would he not be liable for each single one?
In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan, if one said, “an oath that I shall not eat unleavened bread”, he is forbidden to eat unleavened bread in the night of Passover. “That I shall not eat unleavened bread in the night of Passover,” he is flogged and eats unleavened bread<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">While leavened bread is forbidden for seven days on Passover, there is a positive commandment to eat unleavened bread only on the first night (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:18" href="/Exodus.12.18"><i>Ex</i>. 12:18</a>; cf. H. Guggenheimer, <i>The Scholar’s Haggadah</i>, pp. 328–329.) An oath not to fulfill this commandment is void; the oath is void and incurs the penalty of void oaths. But an oath never to eat unleavened bread is valid and prevents its maker from fulfilling his duty without breaking the oath.</i>. “That I shall not sit in the shadow”, he is forbidden to sit in the shadow of a booth<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">On the festival of Tabernacles, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:42" href="/Leviticus.23.42"><i>Lev.</i>23:42</a>.

Could one not add forgetting the object to forgetting the oath so that he should be liable?

How does Rebbi Ismael explain the verse? <sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:4" href="/Leviticus.5.4"><i>Lev</i>. 5:4</a>.

But it is so: <i>To cause evil or cause good</i>, a detail. <i>Anything which a person will blurt out,</i> a general statement. A detail followed by a general statement, everything is included; this adds matters directed towards the past. But it is so: <i>Or a person, if he would swear blurting out with his lips</i>, a general statement. <i>To cause evil or cause good</i>, a detail. <i>Anything which a person will blurt out,</i> a general statement. A general statement followed by a detail followed by a general statement, you only argue in the pattern of the detail<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">In the version of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sifra, Braita d'Rabbi Yishmael 1" href="/Sifra,_Braita_d'Rabbi_Yishmael.1"><i>Sifra</i>(<i>Introduction</i>1</a>), in the list of the thirteen hermeneutical principles of R. Ismael one finds (5) a general statement followed by a detail, (6) a detail followed by a general statement, (7) a general statement followed by a detail followed by a general statement you only argue following the pattern of the detail, (8) a general statement dependent on the detail, (9) a detail dependent on the general statement. Rules 8 and 9 mean that if the general statement can only be understood by the detail or vice versa, rules 5 and 6 do not apply. It then is explained in §7 that if a general statement is followed by a detail, only the detail is intended. §8: If a detail is followed by a general statement, the general statement adds to the detail. Examples are <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 1:2" href="/Leviticus.1.2"><i>Lev</i>. 1:2</a>: <i>From animals, from cattle, or from small cattle</i>. This implies that sacrifices are restricted to cattle, sheep, or goats. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:9" href="/Exodus.22.9"><i>Ex</i>. 22:9</a>: <i>A donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal</i>. The rules of caretakers apply to any animal. Then it becomes a problem how to treat a verse which contains general statement, detail, general statement, whether to apply rule 5 (eliminating the final general statement by rule 9), or rule 6 (eliminating the first general statement by rule 8), or rule 7. In the preceding derivation, the arguments have been suppressed that rules 8 and 9 do not apply and, therefore, only rule 7 is relevant. The standard example for an application of rule 7 is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:26" href="/Deuteronomy.14.26"><i>Deut</i>. 14:26</a>, about permitted uses of Second Tithe money at the place of the Sanctuary: <i>You may spend the money for anything you desire</i>(general), <i>for cattle, or small cattle, or wine, or liquor</i>(detail)<i>, or anything you wish</i>(general). The common denominator of the items in the detail describes animal or vegetable food; Second Tithe money can be used for any food derived from animals (generated from semen) or plants (growing from seeds).<br>Since the first part of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:4" href="/Leviticus.5.4"><i>Lev</i>. 5:4</a> fits Rule 7, it is clear that the rule applies not only to oaths intended to cause good or evil but to a larger set of oaths which, however, have to conform to the idea underlying “causing good or bad things”. Obviously one of the ideas is that events caused are later in time than the cause. This is R. Ismael’s interpretation of the verse. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 26a" href="/Shevuot.26a">Babli 26a</a>.</i>.

Joḥanan holds that if an oath is valid since it contains matters not involving Torah prohibitions it is valid in general since an oath is either valid or invalid. R.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “An oath that I shall not eat this loaf,” etc. “An oath that I shall eat this loaf today,” the day passed and then he ate it. Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish both say, he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Criminal liability.</i>; not for the same reason. The reason of Rebbi Joḥanan, because he cannot be duly warned<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">No criminal prosecution is possible without evidence that the criminal was duly warned not to commit the crime (cf. <i>Introduction to Tractate Sanhedrin,</i> on Chapter Five). The warning must be delivered shortly before the criminal act, so the accused cannot claim to have forgotten. In this case criminality would be inaction; this is not subject to warning.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 3b" href="/Shevuot.3b">Babli, 3b</a>, brings the same example and connects this with the dispute between R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish whether a warning can be delivered even if it is conditional because there is no certainty that the contemplated action will be criminal (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 11:7:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.11.7.6"><i>Yebamot</i>11:7 Note 171</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 8:1:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.8.1.6"><i>Nazir</i>8:1 Note 48</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 5:4:2-12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.5.4.2-12"><i>Pesaḥim</i>5:4</a> fol. 32c; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 3b" href="/Shevuot.3b">Babli 3b</a>). Since R. Joḥanan holds that a conditional warning is acceptable, the Babli is forced to switch the attributions in this case. As a consequence it follows that for the Yerushalmi here, in R. Joḥanan’s opinion this would not be a conditional warning but one which it is impossible to deliver. (In his Notes to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Shevuot 3b:2:2" href="/Tosafot_on_Shevuot.3b.2.2">Tosaphot <i>s. v.</i> אבל</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 4a" href="/Shevuot.4a">Babli 4a</a>, R. Akiba Eiger essentially notes that the Babli’s argument cannot be read into the Yerushalmi.)</i>. The reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, because it is a prohibition without action<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.1.1">Note 3</a>.</i>. What is the difference between them? He burned it or threw it into the sea. If you say, because he cannot be duly warned<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the witnesses are present at the moment when the loaf is thrown into the sea he cannot be warned since what he does is not breaking the oath but making its fulfillment impossible; there is no biblical paragraph prohibiting this action.</i>, he is not liable. If you say, because it is a prohibition without action, there is an action.
Rebbi Phineas asked, if he was asthenic<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Greek ἀσθενής. He is unable to eat an entire loaf during the day and he knows it.

Rebbi Yose asked, “an oath, an oath, an oath, that I shall not eat,” and he ate. What is the rule? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Bun said, let us hear from the following: “'An oath that I shall not eat this loaf, an oath that I shall not eat it, an oath that I shall not eat it;' he is liable once.” Because he mentioned <i>this</i>.

Something which would be forbidden for vows and is permitted for oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">It is not really permitted for oaths since the second oath is vain, but the second never has the status of a valid oath.</i>. Not on this was it said but on the following: “Whether matters of himself<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">All the rules of liability for a variable value sacrifice spelled out in the preceding Mishnaiot are valid for all kinds of oaths irrespective of their content or meaning.</i>, or matters of others,” as Rebbi Abba said in the name of Samuel: ‘An oath that X gave a mina to Y.’ If it turns out that he had not given, since it is not in his hand for the future it is not in his hand for the past<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">He never could swear that X will give Y since it is not in his power to force X to give. This is all about liability for a variable sacrifice, not monetary liabilities. Since witnesses do not swear, this is not a case of perjury.</i>. It was found stated on both cases: This is more stringent for the past than for the future: If he says “I shall not eat, I shall not eat,” he is liable only once. “I did not eat, I did not eat,” he is liable for each single time<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">In the first case, the first oath creates a prohibition; no oath can be made concerning an existing prohibition.

“An oath that I shall eat this loaf; an oath that I shall not eat it.” The first one is a blurted oath, the second a vain oath<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Since by the first oath he became obligated to eat the loaf by biblical rules, the second oath has a similar status as an oath to violate a biblical commandment.</i>.

The only active oath is the first and this one has to be kept.</i>.
“An oath that I shall not eat this loaf; an oath that I shall eat it.” The first one is a blurted oath, the second a vain oath. How does one deal with him? One tells him not to eat; it is better to break a vain oath than to break a vain and a blurted one.
“An oath that I shall eat this loaf today; an oath that I shall not eat it today.” Then he ate it. Rebbi Joḥanan said, he kept the first oath and invalidated the second<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Joḥanan, the valid first oath prohibits the making of the second which automatically becomes a vain oath subject to the statutory punishment for vain oaths but irrelevant as oath. R. Simeon ben Laqish notes that the first oath contains a promise, not a prohibition. Therefore, there is no rule which prohibits making the second oath. Making the second oath is sinful because it invalidates the first but from the point of view of the law of oaths it is possible. Since he becomes liable for punishment for breaking the first oath, the second is active and should be kept. By eating the loaf, the person commits a second sin.<br>The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 28b" href="/Shevuot.28b">Babli, 28b</a>, has a completely different taking on this problem and refers it to the problem whether a criminal warning is possible if it is not clear that a criminal act was intended (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.7.2">Note 104</a>).</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, he invalidated the first one and did not keep the second.

Then while nothing can be done to mitigate the sin of breaking the first oath, the second oath can be changed from a vain oath to a new, valid oath referring to something different, not connected with the first.</i>.
“An oath that I shall eat this loaf today; an oath that I shall eat it today.” Then he ate it. Rebbi Joḥanan said, he kept both of them. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, he kept the first one and one tells him to keep the second with another loaf<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">This is a situation similar to the preceding one. For R. Joḥanan, the second oath is vain, subject to punishment as such, but kept by keeping the first. For R.

“An oath that I shall not eat this loaf today; an oath that I shall not eat it today.” Then he ate it. In Rebbi Joḥanan’s opinion he is twice liable<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Once for breaking the oath, and once for uttering a vain oath.</i>.

Fathers shall not be killed on the testimony of sons, and sons shall not be killed on testimony of fathers. From here that witnesses shall not be relatives of the accused.
From where that witnesses may not be relatives of one another? Think of it, if they be found perjured, would each of them not be killed by the other’s testimony? From where that witnesses may not be relatives of the judges? Think of it, if one of them be found perjured, he could not be killed unless the other also was found perjured. If you say so, would he not be killed by the other’s sentencing?
From where that judges may not be relatives of one another? The Torah said, kill on the testimony of witnesses, kill on the sentence of judges. Since witnesses may not be relatives of one another, neither may judges be relatives of one another.
So far only fathers and sons; from where the other relatives? Rebbi Ze`ira says, <i>and sons</i> includes the remaining relatives.
So far according to Rebbi Aqiba.
From where following Rebbi Ismael? Rebbi Ismael stated: <i>The congregation shall judge between the beater</i>, etc<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 35:24" href="/Numbers.35.24"><i>Num.</i>35:24</a>; <i>between the slayer and the avenger of the blood</i>.</i>. The congregation be neither relatives of the murderer nor relatives of the murdered. Rebbi Yose said, otherwise you would say that the court is engaged in vendetta. This implies that the judges may not be related to the accused. And from where that the witnesses may not be related to the accused? The Torah said, kill on the testimony of witnesses, kill on the sentence of those who vote<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I. e., the judges; the expression is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:2" href="/Exodus.23.2"><i>Ex</i>. 23:2</a>.</i>.

From where that witnesses may not be relatives of the judges? Think of it, if one of them be found perjured, he could not be killed unless the other also was found perjured. If you say so, would he not be killed by his sentence?
“To qualified but not to disqualified ones.” For it is said, <i>if he does not tell</i>, <i>he has to bear his punishment</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21a</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:1" href="/Leviticus.5.1"><i>Lev</i>. 5:1</a></i>. If he told, the other would have to pay money. This excludes one where the other would not have to pay money even if he told.
“Before the court.” To exclude a single witness. If they told him that they would accept his word as if there were two witnesses, from where? The verse says, <i>if he was a witness</i>, <i>had seen or known;</i> <i>if he does not tell he shall bear his punishment</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21a</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:1" href="/Leviticus.5.1"><i>Lev</i>. 5:1</a></i>. One who is qualified to testify according to biblical standards; this excludes a single witness who is not qualified to testify.
“Outside of court.” <i>If he does not tell</i>, <i>he has to bear his punishment</i>. If he told, one would have to pay money. This excludes outside of court where the other would not have to pay money even if he told.
From where two witnesses? <i>And he is a witness</i>, this makes two. Following Rebbi Ismael, who said, any place where the Torah mentions a witness without further determination it implies two witnesses; unless the verse informs you that a single witness is meant. It was found stated in the name of Rebbi Ismael: “Two witnesses.” Can a single witness be found guilty of a blurted oath? Since it is possible to say that one person could team up with him, then he would be subject to the oath of testimony, you could find him liable for an oath of testimony. How could you find him guilty of a blurted oath?
Should a relative be found guilty of a blurted oath? Does it follow what Rebbi Abba said in the name of Samuel<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:9:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.9.2">Chapter 3:6, Note 75</a>. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 49b" href="/Shevuot.49b">Babli 49b</a>.</i>: “An oath that X gave to Y,” and it turns out that X had not given; since there is nothing in the future there is nothing in the past. Or the following: “Where is my ox?” He responded, “I do not know what you are referring to.” Rebbi declares him not liable for a keeper’s oath but liable because of a blurted oath. Rebbi Joḥanan said, since it is a religious duty to appease him, he is not liable because of a blurted oath. In the rabbis’ opinion, is there no religious duty to appease him? One appeases with truthful statements, not with lies.

If one [witness] testified that he ate from the property the first, second, and third years and another testified that he ate it the fourth and fifth years, is that worth anything? Does not every single year need two witnesses? And here, every single sign needs two witnesses.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> What is an oath about testimony? One said to witnesses, come and testify for me. “An oath that we do not know testimony for you;” or they said to him, we do not know any testimony for you, “I am asking you to take an oath upon this;” if they said “Amen”, they are liable<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:1" href="/Leviticus.5.1"><i>Lev</i>. 5:1</a> requires a variable value sacrifice by a person who <i>heard an imprecation when he had knowledge</i> and refuses to testify. This is read to mean that a person is approached by a party in a civil suit and asked to testify in their behalf. If then either he swears an oath that he will testify in court (“by his own word”) or the party asks him to swear that he will appear (“by the word of others”) while he answers “Amen” but does not utter an oath by himself, he becomes liable for the sacrifice if he reneges on his commitment.</i>. If he asked them five times outside of court to take an oath; when they came to court and admitted it they are not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since refusal of testimony outside of court is irrelevant (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.4.1.1">Note 6</a>).</i>. If they deny, they are liable for each single one. If he asked them five times in court to take an oath and the refused, they are liable only once. Rebbi Simeon said, what is the reason? Because they cannot come back and admit<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since the courts operate on the principle that a witness can testify only once, i. e., he cannot change his testimony, after a first refusal in court the witness would not be permitted to change his statement.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “What is an oath about testimony,” etc. <i>A person</i>, <i>a person</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A comparison of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:1" href="/Leviticus.5.1"><i>Lev</i>. 5:1</a> about oaths concerning testimony and 5:21 about the person accused of larceny who swears falsely in purgation by oath; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 3:10:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.3.10.2">Chapter 3:12, Note 165</a>. The parallel use of identical terms is an <i>equal cut</i> which allows transfer of rules from one occurrence to the other.</i>. Since there it is from his own words, also here from his own words. Since here it is from others’ words, also there it is from others’ words<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In v. 5:1 the potential witness <i>hears the sound of an imprecation</i>; others formulate the oath to which he is asked to assent. In 5:21 he himself formulates the oath <i>to deny a deposit</i>, <i>or a loan</i>, <i>or robbery</i>. The <i>equal cut</i> allows one to transfer one situation to the other; oaths about testimony may be formulated by the potential witness himself; oaths of a person accused of larceny may be formulated by the aggrieved party.</i>. Rebbi Meїr explains the equal cut which was said here: Since there it is said about his own words, so also here about his own words. Also the rabbis explain the equal cut which was said here. Since others’ words said there are in court, also others’ words said here are in court<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph refers to the disagreement between R. Meїr and the rabbis in Mishnah 1.<br>The formulation here presupposes that one knows what was explained elsewhere about interpretation of equal cuts [<i>Yebamot</i>11:1 Notes 30,34 (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 9:1:2-16" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.9.1.2-16"><i>Sanhedrin</i>9:1</a>); Chapter 5:2]. R. Meїr holds that the laws to be transferred are what can be read off the corresponding verses; the rabbis transfer laws only in the context of the verses on both sides.<br>Verse 5:21 reads, <i>to deny a deposit</i> … <i>and he swears to a lie</i>; it is understood that this creates guilt whether or not it was before a court. But testimony is before a court; therefore v. 5:1 only speaks of guilt incurred in a court trial. R. Meїr holds that an oath formulated by another person following the situation of v. 1 transferred to v. 21 cannot create liability for a sacrifice outside of court, but an oath pronounced by himself (v. 21) always creates such a liability. The rabbis hold that while we accept that the equal cut shows that oaths formulated by himself are covered by v. 1, the context of that verse forces the conclusion that one refers to court proceedings only.</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked: Is a relative liable for an oath about testimony formulated by himself? Can we hear it from the following: since they inferred formulation by himself for an oath about testimony only from oaths about deposits, and since there relatives are liable, so they also are here<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This question makes sense only according to R. Meїr who disregards context. Relatives are barred as witnesses and judges; they are not barred as claimants. If somebody embezzled the property of a relative, that relative can go to court. Therefore, oaths about deposits can be sworn to relatives. Would R. Meїr agree that oaths about testimony, even though they cannot be enforced in court, create liabilities for sacrifices?</i>? Rebbi Yose said, can relatives here be inferred from relatives there<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Even R. Meїr will agree that an equal cut allows one to transfer only rules that make sense in the new context. Since oaths about testimony are void among relatives, they may create liabilities for “vain” oaths but no liability for variable sacrifices.</i>?
Rebbi Yudan the Cappadocian asked: He made him swear five times by his own formulation before the court: would he not be liable for each instance separately? Rebbi Yose said, is this not the Mishnah: “Rebbi Simeon said, what is the reason? Because they cannot come back and admit<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since the courts operate on the principle that a witness can testify only once, i. e., he cannot change his testimony, after a first refusal in court the witness would not be permitted to change his statement.

In the language of the Babli, כֵּיוָן שֶׁהִגִּיד אֵינוֹ חוֹזֵר וּמַגִּיד “after he told, he does not return to tell”.</i>?” But here, since they can come back and admit, they are liable for each single instance<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is his own oath, it is not testimony and not under the rule that nobody can testify twice in the same case.</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked: If he made him swear five times in his own words and let him swear five times by the mouth of others, what<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Again this is a question following R. Meїr. It is clear that the demand that they answer to an oath formulated by the person who wants to force testimony must be made in court. Therefore, one has to assume that the first five oaths were made outside of court. Then they are not subject to the rule that there can be only one testimony. The next question is about the status of an oath of denial of knowledge before the other even had asked for their testimony.</i>? Since Rebbi Meїr considered “in his own words” as if in court, would they determine the sacrifice on the first occasion, even without request? It should come like the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shevuot 2:5" href="/Tosefta_Shevuot.2.5">Tosephta 2:11</a> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 31b" href="/Shevuot.31b">Babli 31b</a>). The <i>baraita</i> is formulated independently from the Babylonian Tosephta.</i> “Why do you go after us? An oath that we do not know any testimony relevant for you. Should they be liable?

Since there can be no sacrifice for an oath about deposits relating to real estate, one might argue that there can be no sacrifice for an oath about testimony involving real estate, asserted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shevuot 4:1" href="/Tosefta_Shevuot.4.1">Tosephta 4:1</a>.</i>? From his own mouth would he be liable for fines<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">These fines are biblically imposed for misdeeds.

Is that the variable value sacrifice for a false oath regarding testimony or a fixed value sacrifice required for a false testimony about deposits?</i>?
Rebbi Abba, Rav Jehudah in the name of Rav: in error, a sacrifice; intentional, a sacrifice. But if he said, I was of the opinion that this oath does not exist, he is free<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This now refers to Mishnah 2. The only case in which one is not liable is if he was of the opinion that swearing to evade appearing as a witness was not forbidden. Then his action is without criminal intent.</i>. Ḥizqiah stated: At any place where the Torah mentions <i>sin</i> without attribute you include intentional equally with unintentional unless Scripture inform you that it is unintentional<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In all cases of purification sacrifices mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4" href="/Leviticus.4"><i>Lev</i>. 4</a> it is emphasized that these apply only to atone for חֵטְא בִשְׁגָגָה “sins in error.” In most cases of reparation sacrifices described in Chapter 5, there is no mention of error.

So is the Mishnah: “If one disavowed but one confessed, the one who disavowed is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The question is why does the Mishnah speak of “one” and not “first” or “second”?

No imprecations are mentioned in connection with oaths about deposits.

Therefore, the reason can only be that they might forget their testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">There are several reasons why testimony by witnesses alone may be impossible; this might encourage false oaths.</i>.

If anything happens to the ox except cases of gross negligence, the trustee does not have to pay. The moment he uses the ox for his own purposes, he becomes liable for damages. Since he swears falsely that it was lost, he swears falsely for monetary gain and becomes liable. (Had he claimed that the ox was stolen, he would have had to pay the thief’s fine in addition to paying for the ox.) If he confesses in order to clear his conscience, he becomes eligible for atonement of his sin which is effected by paying an additional fifth (from above, i. e., a quarter from below) and a sacrifice in the value of 2 <i>šeqalim</i>.</i>.” The Mishnah [applies] if he does not know that there are witnesses. He comes to tell you, even if he knows that there are witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The formulation of the Mishnah shows clearly that there were witnesses available when he swore falsely. Nevertheless, he has to bring a sacrifice if he confesses. Why do R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish have to formulate a statement which clearly is implied by a Mishnah? The answer is that the Mishnah may be interpreted that the trustee swore falsely in the belief that there were no witnesses; he swore for monetary gain. The Amoraic statement adds that even had the trustee known of the existence of witnesses, only they were not present at the moment of his oath, it still is an oath for monetary gain since the witnesses might forget their testimony in the meantime. The formulation “he”, not “they”, in the last sentence may support the reading of the Babli which only mentions R. Joḥanan.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah says so: “If there were two groups of witnesses, if the first group reneged and after this the second, both are liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 4:4.</i>” One understands that the first group becomes liable<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This text is very difficult and all commentators and editors follow the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 32b-33a" href="/Shevuot.32b-33a">Babli (32b/33a</a>) and switch the places of “first” and “second”, for the reasons explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 4:3:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.4.3.4">Halakhah 4:4, Note 54</a>. But this seems to be excluded by the text of G, which becomes the more credible as its scribe clearly did not understand the text since he misread מצוּיִין “being apt to” as מצֻוִּים “being commanded”.<br>Therefore one is forced to explain that the first group clearly violates their oath of testimony by reneging on it. The question is why the second group is not freed from their obligation by the first since strictly speaking only two witnesses are needed by biblical standards; any additional witnesses appear superfluous. The answer is that additional witnesses never are superfluous since any witness may forget, if not the whole incident so some detail which might invalidate his testimony in cross examination. One knows that the testimony of a group of witnesses is valid only <i>after</i> it was accepted in court.</i>. Why the second? Not because they might forget their testimony? <sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Added from G; cf. the preceding Note.</i>[Here also, because they (are commanded) to forget their testimony.]
<i>He denied it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:22" href="/Leviticus.5.22"><i>Lev</i>. 5:22</a>.</i>, not him<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Sifra Ḥova (Wayyiqra 2) Pereq</i> 22(6) more in detail: “About it but not about its finder.” This Tanna and both Talmudim reject the understanding of the verse as given in the Targumim, that the person swearing had found the lost property and now denies it. This would be covered by “robbery” listed in v. 21. Rather it is that the person searching for his lost property, such as his donkey mares, asks a person whether he knows either of the property or of the person who might have taken it. If he under oath falsely denies any knowledge, according to this Tanna be becomes liable for a sacrifice only if he wrongly denies knowledge about the property, not about the person who might have appropriated it.<br>The big question then becomes, why should the person asked for testimony be liable for anything since by necessity he is a single person and the testimony of a single person cannot force a judgment. As Ravad explains in his Commentary to <i>Sifra</i>, this argument would be unconditionally valid only for oaths about testimony, not for oaths about causing monetary loss. His scenario is, e. g., that the lost animal was standing on another person’s property. The original owner took it but now the person from whom it was taken claims ownership and wants it back. The second person agrees that he found the animal but he disputes the fact that it is the animal which had belonged to the first. In this situation, testimony of one witness about ownership of the animal is sufficient for a judgment in favor of the first person since it is not a judgment to transfer property but to confirm an existing status. On the other hand, testimony that the second person took possession of some lost property but which failed to identify the property is worthless and its denial cannot trigger any liability by the potential witness.</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Ḥova (Wayyiqra 2) Pereq</i> 22(6), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 105b" href="/Bava_Kamma.105b">Babli <i>Bava qamma</i> 105b</a>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “What is an oath about a deposit,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This Halakhah is a reworking of Halakhah 4:3 with in most cases correctly switching “here” (5:21) and “there” (5:1) and “oath of testimony” and “oath of deposit”. The explanation of <i>equal cut</i> is taken from <i>Yebamot</i> 11:1 (Notes 30,34) as indicated in the Notes to 4:3. The text of G ends at the start of this Halakhah.</i><i>A person</i>, <i>a person</i>. Since here it is from his own words, also there from his own words. Since there it is from others’ words, also here it is from others’ words. Rebbi Meїr explains the equal cut at the place it comes from: Since here it is said about his own words, so also here<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously this should read “there.”</i> about his own words. Also the rabbis explain the equal cut which was said about it. Since others’ words said there are in court, also others’ words said here are in court.
<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is a new question, with the arguments about oaths of testimony and deposits switched. In structure and argument it is completely parallel to 4:3, Notes 34,35.</i> Rebbi Jeremiah asked: Is a relative not liable for an oath about deposits formulated by others? Can we hear it from the following: since they inferred formulation by others for an oath about deposits only from oaths about testimony, and since there relatives are not liable, so they neither are here? Rebbi Yose said, relatives here can be inferred from non-relatives there.
Rebbi Yudan the Cappadocian asked: He made him swear five times by the formulation of others out of the court: would he not be liable only once<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If this refers to oaths about deposits, this would be the Mishnah and there would be no room for any question.

Rebbi Yose said, is this not the Mishnah: “Rebbi Simeon said, what is the reason? Because they can come back and admit?” But here, since they cannot come back and admit, they are liable only once.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked: If he made him swear five times, since Rebbi Meїr considered “by his own words” as in court, would this determine the sacrifice on the first occasion, even without request<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This is a bad adaptation of the text in 4:3. Following R. Meїr, since assent to an oath formulated by others is inferred from oaths about testimony, if applied to money matters does this need a claim by the other party?

An oath that we do not know any testimony relevant for you. He pays the value plus a fifth and brings a reparation sacrifice for two tetradrachmas, in distinction from an oath about testimony.”
Would he be “not liable” from others’ mouth for real estate?

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If five people were claiming from him and said to him, give us the deposit which you are holding for us. “An oath that I am not holding anything of yours’ ”; he is liable only once. “An oath that I am not holding anything of you, and of you, and of you;” he is liable for each one separately. Rebbi Eliezer says, on condition that he repeat “an oath” at the end. Rebbi Simeon says, not unless he repeat “an oath” for each single one<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In the Halakhah and in all parallel sources the name is not “R. Eliezer” but “R. Eleazar”. The latter name is correct as contemporary of R. Simeon; cf. R. Rabbinovicz, <i>Diqduqe Soferim Ševuot</i>, p. 78, Note ז.<br>The majority [following R. Meїr in <i>Sifra Ḥova (Wayyiqra 2) Pereq</i> 17(1)] holds that an oath addressed to a group of people is a single oath, but one addressed to separate individuals counts as multiple oaths according to the number of persons mentioned in the oath. R. Eleazer holds that this is true only if the person swearing indicates that he intends the one sentence to be considered a separate oath for each individual addressed, by repeating at the end that “this is an oath.” Without such a final statement the mention of “oath” refers only to the first subject addressed in the oath. R. Simeon holds that a statement formulated as one oath is one oath; there is liability for multiple sacrifices only if it was clearly said that separate oaths were made for each claimant.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If five people were claiming from him,” etc. I could think that also for an oath about a deposit He did not make one assenting to an oath like making an oath? Rebbi Eleazar said, this is not so. But also for an oath about a deposit we are treating one assenting to an oath like one formulating an oath<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The text as it stands is unintelligible. The first “also” contradicts what was stated in Halakhah 4:5 that the rules of oaths about testimony and deposits are derived from one another. An oath about testimony by its nature is imposed by another party; there it was established that the reluctant witness also is liable if he himself formulates the oath that he will appear as a witness and then reneges. Therefore, this “also” has to be deleted.<br>The oath about a deposit by its nature is offered by the person denying that he is holding anything. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 34b" href="/Shevuot.34b">Babli (34b</a>) and <i>Sifra Ḥova (Wayyiqra 2) Pereq</i>11(3) state that in this case an oath imposed by another person does not trigger the liability for a sacrifice. The Yerushalmi considers this possibility and rejects it.</i>.
Rebbi Joḥanan said: The words of Rebbi Eleazar, only if he mentioned “oath” at the start and at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Then multiple sacrifices are due for multiple lies.</i>. The words of the Sages, if he mentioned “oath” at the start but not at the end. Or if he mentioned it at the end but not at the start in the opinion of the rabbis he brings a sacrifice for each single one, in Rebbi Eleazar’s opinion he brings one sacrifice for everything<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In both cases, a single mention of “oath” at the end is equivalent in force to a single mention of “oath” at the start.</i>. If he mentions “oath” at the start but did not mention it at the end, does the oath fall on the middle ones<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This is a question only for R. Eleazar. Does R. Eleazar only require one sacrifice because he considers everything together as one statement, or does he restrict the oath to the denial of the claim of the first person mentioned? If the denial of the claim of the first person was correct, but some denials to other persons were false, in the first case the trustee would have to bring a sacrifice but not in the second.</i>? Come and see: If he had mentioned it at the start and the end, did he mention it for the middle ones? But you are saying that it is valid; so here it is valid<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the difference between R. Eleazar and R. Simeon is that the latter requires a separate mention of “oath” for each single denial while R. Eleazar requires only two irrespective of the number of denials in between, it is obvious that the first eventuality mentioned in the preceding Note is the correct interpretation.</i>.
Rebbi Yudan from Cappadocia asked: What about “an oath that neither wheat, nor barley, nor spelt I am holding for you<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The wording is that of Mishnah 5. However, there one has to translate “wheat, or barley, or spelt” and the oath is true only if he holds neither kind. But here the oath is true if he does not hold at least one of them.

It only would be problematic if it were about the past. “An oath that I did not eat; I did not eat, an oath.” In the rabbis’ opinion he brings two sacrifices (for each one).

Rebbi Ḥaggai asked: “10 oaths that I am not holding;” what?
Rebbi Yose asked: “An oath, an oath that I am not holding for you,” what? Rebbi Yose said, let us hear from the following: “ ‘An oath that I shall not eat this loaf; an oath that I shall not eat it’.

It was established earlier (4:4, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 5:2:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.5.2.4">Note 40</a>) that an oath can create liability for a reparation sacrifice only if the action of the defendant led to a claimant’s monetary loss.</i>.

The answer is that different biblical verses are the basis. Since a Hebrew slave girl is a minor sold by her father for a maximum of 6 years, or until she reaches the age of 12, or until she is married by the person who buys her or one of his sons. In order to get the maximum for his money, the man buying her might use her as a servant up to the last day of her servitude and then marry her on that day. Since if the original price is divided by the sum of all days of her servitude and only pennies pay for the service of one day, only pennies are left on the last day but nevertheless the marriage is legal. Therefore only pennies are needed for a legal marriage ceremony.</i> The claim, the House of Shammai say, an <i>obolos</i>, but the House of Hillel say, two <i>oboloi</i>. The argument of the House of Shammai seems inverted. There, they say, “silver” is a <i>denar</i>, but here, they say that “silver” is an <i>obolos</i>. The argument of the House of Hillel seems inverted. There, they say that “money” is a <i>peruṭah</i> but here, they say that “money” is two <i>oboloi</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: The House of Shammai learn from the initial sale of a Hebrew girl.

Since the end of her diminution is a <i>peruṭah,</i> so her preliminary marriage is by a <i>peruṭah.</i> What is the reason of the House of Shammai? As it is said, <i>she leaves gratis, without silver</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 21:10" href="/Exodus.21.10"><i>Ex</i>. 21:10</a>.</i>. Would we not know that it is without money? Why does the verse say, <i>without silver</i>? From there, that she is sold for more than silver. And what is more than silver? A <i>denar</i>. But maybe “silver” is a <i>peruṭah</i>, more than silver two <i>peruṭot</i>. The smallest silver coin is an <i>obolos</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">“Silver” denotes the smallest silver coin struck in Hasmonean times, the <i>obolos</i>, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> of a <i>denar</i>. The silver half- <i>oboloi</i> minted in Yehud in Persian times had long disappeared when the Mishnaic system of currency was formulated.</i>. So why is it not an <i>obolos</i>? Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Judah bar Pazi: For if she wants to diminish, she diminishes every year by an <i>obolos</i> and leaves. Could she not diminish by a <i>peruṭah</i>? Rebbi Abun said, think of it. If she wanted to compute the diminution at the start of the sixth year, there would be a <i>peruṭah</i> left. But the start of the diminution must be an <i>obolos</i>, the end of the diminution a <i>peruṭah</i>. If there is only one <i>peruṭah</i> left, can she not pay the diminished amount and leave? Just as the last diminished amount is a <i>peruṭah</i>, so her preliminary marriage should be a <i>peruṭah</i>! What is the reason of the House of Hillel? Since her last diminished amount is a <i>peruṭah</i>, you know that her preliminary marriage is by a <i>peruṭah</i>. Think of it, if there is only one <i>peruṭah</i>’s worth left, can she not pay the diminished amount and leave? Just as the last diminished amount is a <i>peruṭah</i>, so her preliminary marriage is by a <i>peruṭah</i>.
The argument of the House of Hillel seems inverted. <i>If a person give to his</i> <i>neighbor,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:6" href="/Exodus.22.6"><i>Ex.</i>22:6</a>.</i> etc. If to teach that the court will not act on less than a <i>peruṭah</i>’s worth, is it not already written, <i>to incur liability for it</i>? To exclude anything not worth a <i>peruṭah</i>. From here, that it should be more than silver. And what is more than silver? Two <i>oboloi</i>. But maybe “silver” is a <i>peruṭah</i>, more than silver two <i>peruṭot</i>. The smallest silver coin is an <i>obolos</i>. So why is it not an <i>obolos</i>? <i>Or vessels</i>; since vessels are two, also “money” is two. How do the House of Shammai interpret <i>or vessels</i>? Following what Rebbi Nathan stated, <i>or vessels</i>, including clay vessels<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:20" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.20"><i>Qiddušin</i>1:1 Note 96</a> for the arguments which show that this reading is impossible.</i>. Samuel said, if he claimed from him two needles and he admitted to one, he is liable. Rebbi Ḥinena said, only if they are worth two <i>peruṭot</i>, that the claim should be about a <i>peruṭah</i>’s worth and the confession about a <i>peruṭah</i>’s worth<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Shevuot 39b:10:1" href="/Tosafot_on_Shevuot.39b.10.1"><i>Tosaphot</i>39b, <i>s.v</i>. מה</a>.</i>. This follows the House of Shammai who do not learn money’s worth from “vessels”. But following the House of Hillel who learn money’s worth from “vessels”, since vessels are two, also “money” is two. Similarly, since “money” means two <i>oboloi,</i> also “vessels” means two <i>oboloi</i>’s worth.
Rebbi Abba, Rav Jehudah in the name of Samuel: In any case where two [witnesses] make him liable to pay money, a single witness sets him up for an oath<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 40a" href="/Shevuot.40a">Babli, 40a</a>, this is a tannaitic statement commented upon by Samuel.</i>.

But do not two [witnesses] make him liable for a fine? There is a difference since one does not swear about a fine. But do not two [witnesses] make him liable for a <i>peruṭah</i>? Is it so? Have we not stated: “A judicial oath is about a claim of two silver coins and the acknowledgment of one <i>peruṭah</i>.” Our Mishnah, when he swears by his own formulation.

“And the acknowledgment of one <i>peruṭah.</i>” Rebbi Joḥanan said, if somebody claims that another had stolen<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is about <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:8" href="/Exodus.22.8"><i>Ex</i>. 22:8</a>, the basis of the Mishnah.

Elohim</i> means “the powerful;” it can be applied both to God and to judges. From this double meaning it is inferred that judges impose an oath before God on the accused if the latter has acknowledged <i>for this is it,</i> i. e., a partial admission. On the other hand, double restitution is the fine for the thief. Therefore R. Joḥanan is justified in his conclusion that since v.6 declares the entire paragraph to be about deposits, the entire sentence deals with the case of A accusing B of theft of the deposit.</i>? If he claims money from him. If he claims money from him, is that <i>double he shall pay to his neighbor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The colleagues agree that a fine can be imposed only for theft, but they hold that the clause <i>for this is it</i> does not apply to deposits but to repayment of loans and debts (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 5:24" href="/Leviticus.5.24"><i>Lev</i>. 5:24</a>).

Rebbi Ze`ira said, he is not liable unless the denial be of two silver coins not counting the acknowledgment of one <i>peruṭah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the Mishnah, after partial admission of any claim, the amount in dispute must be at least two <i>oboloi</i>.

“ ‘You are holding a <i>mina</i> for me’, ‘I am not holding anything for you’, he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since the claim is rejected in its entirety, it must be proven by documents or witnesses; the oath cannot be imposed by biblical standards.</i>.” Even “you are holding a lot for me,” “I am not holding anything for you”, he is not liable?

If the defendant admits to owing a <i>peruṭah</i> and the claim is at least 2 <i>oboloi</i>, there is liability. The lower bound is not a function of the size of the claim.</i>.

In the absence of witnesses or documents, if the defendant presents an argument which is less favorable to him than another argument which he could have advanced, the court is forced to give him the benefit of doubt and free him from the oath.

Rebbi Abbahu said about that of Rebbi Immi: Why did we state, “Rabban Gamliel declares him liable”? It comes to inform you of the power of Rabban Gamliel, how far he declares liable. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Not only if he claimed wheat and he admitted barley to him, but if he claimed two kinds and he admitted one of them, the words of the Sages are that he is not liable. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, it is only if he claimed two kinds and he admitted one of them, but if he sued for wheat and he admitted barley according to everybody he is liable. Following Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: A person went to court before Rav: When he claimed from another wheat, barley, and spelt. Rav told him, wait until he charged you with anything he has to charge, and in the end you will swear one oath about everything. Rebbi Abbahu said, so argued Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish against Rebbi Joḥanan: In your opinion, since you say that if he claimed two kinds and he admitted one of them, according to the Sages he is not liable, did we not state “if he claimed vessels and real estate; if he admitted the vessels and denied the real estate, the real estate and denied the vessels”? For vessels about vessels he is liable, not so much more for vessels and real estate? He answered him, to transfer an oath to him by the following Mishnah, “since guaranteed property obligates non-guaranteed property to be sworn about.” This does not even disagree with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. But did we not state: “Somebody who sued for amphoras of oil and he admitted to vessels”? How do we hold? If he sued him for vessels and oil, and he admitted one of them, everybody agrees that this refers to the claim. But if he sued him for vessels and he did (not)<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This has to be deleted.</i> admit oil, everybody agrees that what he admitted did not refer to the claim. Rebbi Ze`ira and Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Samuel: If he sued for vessels full of oil, one said vessels but not oil, the other said oil but not vessels.

So is the Mishnah: If he denied part of the real estate he is liable, part of the vessels he is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">It is obvious that the mentions of “real estate” and “vessels” have to be switched since one does not swear about claims to real estate.

However, since here the acquisition is qualified as robbery the claimant can bring a new action for robbery whereas in the Babli Rav Huna in the name of Rav qualifies this as acquisition and denies any obligation on the part of the defendant.</i>. A Mishnah disagrees with Rav Huna: <sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 8:4.</i>“ ‘Where is my ox?’ He told him, it was lost. ‘I am putting an oath on you,’ and he said Amen.

The only problem is whether the obligation to swear a rabbinic oath is cause for the opposing party to add biblical oaths without presenting sufficient proof for that obligation.</i>? Let us hear from the following: One rolls over a biblical oath on a biblical oath, an instituted oath on an instituted oath, a biblical oath on an instituted oath.

Participants in pigeon contests, that is one who bets on pigeons. Whether one bets on pigeons or bets on any domesticated animal, wild animal, or bird, he is not accepted unless he break his tools of the catch and repent in complete repentance.
Dealers in sabbatical produce, that is the sabbatical trader. “Who is a sabbatical trader? One who sits idle all the years of a sabbatical cycle. In the sabbatical year he becomes active and trades in sabbatical produce. One does not accept him before another sabbatical year starts and he can be checked out that he repented in complete repentance.” Rebbi Yose stated, two sabbatical periods. <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since the entire paragraph is about the obligations of the paid trustee in case the deposit was lost.

Rebbi Abbahu said, shepherds of small animals.
Rav Huna said: Who is the Tanna of “participants in pigeon contests”? Rebbi Eliezer, as we have stated there: “Participants in pigeon contests are disqualified from testimony.” Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose: Is that statement in <i>Sanhedrin</i> Rebbi Eliezer’s? He told him, it is everybody’s opinion. So said Rebbi Yose: We knew that he was disqualified for testimony in money matters. What does he come to testify about? For as he is disqualified in money matters, so he is disqualified to testify in criminal trials. The witnesses for the New Moon are held to the standards of criminal trials, as we have stated: “Any testimony for which a woman is not qualified, they are not qualified for.” Who stated this? The rabbis! Do the rabbis follow Rebbi Eliezer? They agree with him and disagree with him. Rebbi Huna in the name of Rebbi Jonah said: It follows Rebbi Eliezer in everything. It turns out that this disagreement parallels another disagreement, as it was stated: A perjured witness is disqualified for any and all testimony required by the Torah, the words of Rebbi Meїr. Rebbi Yose said, when has this been said? When he was found perjured in criminal matters. But if he was found perjured in money matters, he is disqualified only from that particular testimony.

The <i>ketubah</i>(the marriage contract intended to provide financial support for the woman if the marriage is dissolved by divorce or the husband’s death) is compromised if not the full amount is due since the wife has signed a receipt for partial payment. The testimony of a single witness can be contradicted by an oath of the opposing party by biblical rule. If the <i>ketubah</i> has to be paid by the heirs from the estate, the estate is diminished; one requires the widow to swear that the entire amount is due her. The same holds if the rights of a mortgage holder whose claim is posterior to the lien created by the <i>ketubah</i> are diminished by the payment, or if a divorcee claims payment from the property of her absentee former husband.</i> If she had compromised her <i>ketubah</i>, she shall not be able to collect without an oath. If one witness testifies that [the <i>ketubah</i>] was paid, she shall not be able to collect without an oath. From encumbered property, or from orphans’ property, she shall not be able to collect without an oath. If she collects in his absence, she shall not be able to collect without an oath.<br>Similarly, the orphans can collect only by an oath; “an oath that our father did not instruct us<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">On his death bed.</i>, our father did not tell us<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Before this time.</i>, and we found nothing in our father’s documents<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">No receipt was found.</i> that this note of indebtedness was paid.” Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa testified<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">All statements of testimony in the Mishnah are practice.

Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, if there are witnesses that the father said on his death bed that this note of indebtedness was not paid, he collects without oath.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbui Ze`ira said, this came down in the manner of biblical oaths. And a woman’s <i>ketubah</i> is not from the start in her hand for collection, but only for collection from now on and in the future. Since she claims a document about 200 paid and she says, it is only one <i>mina</i>, she collects without oath<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph refers to Mishnah 8 and is a reworking of one in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 9:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.9.7.2"><i>Ketubot</i> 9:7, Note 166</a>, in a number of details opposing the opinions given there.<br>As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 7:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.7.7.1">Note 87</a>, the oath of a woman who wants to collect her <i>ketubah</i> when a single witness asserts that it already was paid is biblical. R. Ze`ira notes that the oaths required in the other cases are formulated on the model of that oath.<br>The rules for collecting a <i>ketubah</i> are not identical with the rules for enforcing an IOU since it may be assumed that a woman does not marry in order to be divorced or become widowed; if she is widowed she may prefer not to claim the <i>ketubah</i> but to be permanently supported by the heirs. This means that the woman acquires the <i>ketubah</i> not with the intent of presenting it for collection. The <i>ketubah</i> becomes an enforceable claim only by the owner presenting it for collection.<br>In <i>Ketubot</i>, it is stated that if the <i>ketubah</i> is presented with an attached receipt, and the woman claims that the receipt is only for half of the amount and the other half is still due her, this is a compromised <i>ketubah</i> and she may collect only by swearing to the validity of her claim. But here she presents a <i>ketubah</i> for the standard 200 <i>denars</i> but declares that she only claims 100 <i>denars</i> (a <i>mina</i>); therefore she collects without an oath. This is not a compromised but a diminished <i>ketubah</i> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shevuot 7:7:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevuot.7.7.3">Note 94</a>).</i>.

The Mishnah there continues: “If somebody intends to take the deposit, the House of Shammai hold him liable, but the House of Hillel say, he is liable only from the moment he takes it.” Since in the public domain acquisition is effected only by lifting the object, not by dragging it, liability for cattle rustling in the public domain exists only for the House of Shammai.</i>?

The paid keeper or the renter must pay for stolen items (22:11); in general, a claim that the item was stolen by such a keeper is an agreement that he has to pay; even if the claim is false there is no reason for double restitution. But if the keeper claims that the item was abducted by force, he may swear to this fact to free himself from paying (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:9" href="/Exodus.22.9">v. 22:9</a>). An argument is missing here, which is supplied in the Babli, <i>Bava meṣi`a</i>57b, <i>viz.</i>, that in an orderly commonwealth an armed robber will hide his weapons in public and only show them to his intended victim.

Rebbi Yose said, if it were so one should state “the paid keeper and the renter;” but we have stated: We do not find that the paid keeper and the renter pay double restitution of duress.

Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina asked, what was said, to take?

If he lifted it and took a <i>quartarius</i>, and then it broke, he pays for all.” It is assumed that the amphora did not break because of any action of the keeper’s; then the unpaid keeper does not have to pay for the loss. But if he lifted the amphora with the intent of stealing from it, it becomes his property and he is liable for the entire value of amphora and contents. The question now is whether “took” means that he actually removed anything from the amphora’s contents or whether just moving the amphora with the intent of taking triggers full liability. Since in a sale of movables it is not the payment which transfers property rights and liabilities from seller to buyer but the buyer’s moving the item, it is not unreasonable to read “took” as “intent to take” since action of moving is decisive.</i>?

Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: “Guarding” is mentioned for the unpaid keeper and “guarding” is mentioned for the paid keeper, but “guarding” mentioned for the unpaid keeper is not similar to “guarding” mentioned for the recipient of a fee. “Guarding” mentioned for the unpaid keeper; if he guarded it sufficiently he is not liable.

Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia: “Grabbing” is mentioned for the unpaid keeper and “grabbing” is mentioned for the paid keeper, but “grabbing” mentioned for the unpaid keeper is not comparable to “grabbing” mentioned for the paid keeper. “Grabbing” mentioned for the unpaid keeper does not make him liable unless he move it<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">As made clear in Mishnah <i>Bava meṣi`a</i>3:13.</i>. “Grabbing” mentioned for the paid keeper, he is liable from the moment he puts his staff and his bag on it<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since the paragraph about the paid keeper (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:9-11" href="/Exodus.22.9-11"><i>Ex</i>. 22:9–11</a>) refers to animals, the example given refers to animals.

Therefore his confession is operative<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">For the rabbis the main claim of the father of an underage rape victim is for the diminution of his daughter’s chances on the marriage market; this is a claim for damages, not a fine, and in this respect “the admission of the debtor is worth 100 witnesses.”</i> and he is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">In this entire paragraph, “liable” has to be replaced by “not liable” and vice versa.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He said to the borrower, “where is my ox?” He told him, “it died,” but it broke, or was abducted, or stolen, or lost<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">These are the cases enumerated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:6" href="/Exodus.22.6"><i>Ex</i>. 22:6</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:9" href="/Exodus.22.9">9</a>, where the unpaid keeper swears but does not have to pay. Breakage refers to vessels, not to animals; it is included since it appears in the verse.</i>. “It broke,” but it died, or was abducted, or stolen, or lost. “ ”It was abducted,” but it died, or broke, or was stolen, or lost. “It was stolen,” but it died, or broke, or was abducted, or lost. “It was lost,” but it died, or broke, or was abducted, or stolen. “I want you to swear;” he answered “Amen”. He is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Since the borrower pays for any of the reasons mentioned, by his oath he does not deprive the owner of any money. Therefore no sacrifice is due.</i>.<br>“Where is my ox?” He told him, “I do not know.” “What are you telling?” But if had died, or broke, or was abducted, or stolen, or lost. “I want you to swear;” he answered “Amen”.

This is the principle: Anybody who swears to his benefit is liable, to his detriment is not liable.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> It was stated: If it was neither to his benefit nor to his detriment, he is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">There is a <i>baraita</i> which disagrees with the Mishnah and holds that a false oath is a false oath even if the false formulation does no harm to the other party.</i>. Rebbi said, a <i>baraita</i> says so: “If he said to the borrower, the unpaid trustee, the recipient of a fee, or the renter, ‘where is my ox?’ This one said, ‘it died.’<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta 6:7 starts in this way; but the <i>baraita</i> must have the person who swore falsely not to the detriment of the depositor as liable to the penalties of a false oath.</i>” May he tell him, “come and swear to me that you never thought of rustling it”<sup class="footnote-marker">128,</sup><i class="footnote">Could the depositor ask that the paid trustee or renter, or even the borrower, who paid for the lost or stolen object, nevertheless swear that they do not hold the object in their possession? The first argument is against, for the oath will not change the monetary situation. The second argument is in favor; there is a value to one’s own possession which cannot be expressed in monetary terms. The answer is not given, nor is the question raised in the Babli.
