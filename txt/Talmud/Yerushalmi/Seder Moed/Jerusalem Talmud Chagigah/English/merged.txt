Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> All are obligated to appear<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To fulfill the biblical commandment to “be seen” before God on the occasion of the three festivals of pilgrimage which are called either <i>steps</i> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:17" href="/Exodus.23.17"><i>Ex</i>. 23:17</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 16:16" href="/Deuteronomy.16.16"><i>Deut</i>. 16:16</a>) or <i>walking occasions</i> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:14" href="/Exodus.23.14"><i>Ex</i>. 23:14</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:23" href="/Exodus.34.23">34:23</a>). The cases exempted from this biblical duty are defined in the Halakhah.</i> except the deaf-mute, the insane, and the child, and the sexless, and the hermaphrodite, women, and unemancipated slaves, the lame, and the blind, and the sick, and the child, and anybody who cannot ascend on his feet. Who is a child? Any who cannot ride on his father’s shoulder from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, the words of the House of Shammai. But the House of Hillel say, any who cannot hold on to his father’s hand and climb from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, as it is said, <i>three walking occasions</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:14" href="/Exodus.23.14"><i>Ex</i>. 23:14</a>.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “All are obligated to appear,” etc. The Mishnah is about the sacrifice of appearance<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">While it is an obligation to appear in the Temple on one of the holidays of pilgrimage, it is sinful to enter there without bringing a personal sacrifice during the holiday (as specified in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>), <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:20" href="/Exodus.34.20"><i>Ex</i>. 34:20</a>.</i>, but the child is obligated in the personal appearance<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The obligation of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:20" href="/Exodus.34.20"><i>Ex</i>. 34:20</a> cannot apply to children, who are not subject to monetary obligations. They also cannot be obligated in any other way, but their parents are obligated to instruct them to do the right things. Quoted by <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rashi on Chagigah 2a" href="/Rashi_on_Chagigah.2a">Rashi <i>ad</i>2a</a>.</i>. From the following, <i>assemble the people, men, women, and toddlers</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 31:12" href="/Deuteronomy.31.12"><i>Deut</i>. 31:12</a>.</i>.

Nathan A</i> Chap. 18.</i> As it was stated: It happened that Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa and Rebbi Eleazar Ḥasma were walking from Jabneh to Lydda when they were visiting Rebbi Joshua in Beqi`in<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">An unidentified place. It cannot be the place of the same name in Galilee.</i>. He asked them, what was new today in the House of Study? They said to him, we all are your students and drink from your waters. He said to them, even so, it is impossible that there not be a new idea every day in the House of Study. Who stayed there over the Sabbath? They said to him, Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah. And what was his text? <i>Assemble the people, men, women, and toddlers</i>. He started by saying, since men come to learn and women to listen, why do the toddlers come? It must be to give a reward to those who bring them. He said to them, a generation is not orphaned which counts Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah among them.
It follows that Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah disagrees with Ben Azzai, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 3:4:1-13" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.3.4.1-13">Mishnah <i>Soṭah</i>3:4</a>.

Rebbi Jonah said, this means that the principles of Rebbi are no principles, since we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:2.</i>: “A <i>ḥereš</i> who speaks and does not hear should not give heave” and we thought that one who speaks but does not hear is <i>ḥereš,</i> one who hears but does not speak is [not]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">To be deleted as shown by the parallel texts.</i> <i>ḥereš</i>.

We also have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:2.</i>: “A <i>ḥereš</i> mentioned anywhere by the Sages is a deaf-mute.” This supports Rebbi Jonah, for Rebbi Jonah said that the principles of Rebbi are no principles<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since the use of <i>ḥereš</i> as a technical term is inconsistent in the Mishnah.</i>.
Rebbi Joḥanan asked, what about a person deaf in one ear<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Is he required to appear in the Temple at Tabernacles in the Sabbatical year? <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chagigah 3a" href="/Chagigah.3a">Babli <i>Ḥagigah</i>3a</a>.</i>? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the disagreement between the Rabbis and Rebbi Yose. As it was stated, <i>and for Aaron’s sons make coats</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 28:40" href="/Exodus.28.40"><i>Ex</i>. 28:40</a>.</i>. The Rabbis said, two coats for each one<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since “coats” is a plural and an otherwise undetermined plural always means 2. Cf. H. Guggenheimer, <i>Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition</i>, in: Confrontations with Judaism, ed. Ph. Longworth; London 1967.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, even one coat for each one. What is the Rabbis’ reason? <i>And for Aaron’s sons make coats</i>. What is Rebbi Yose’s reason? For a hundred sons of Aaron make coats<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The plural may be explained without reference to the persons involved since the coats are public property.</i>. And here, <i>read this Torah in front of all of Israel into their ears</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 31:11" href="/Deuteronomy.31.11"><i>Deut</i>. 31:11</a>.</i>.

“The insane.” Rebbi Eleazar said, <i>you were shown to know</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 4:35" href="/Deuteronomy.4.35"><i>Deut</i>. 4:35</a>.</i>.
“The child.” Rebbi Jeremiah and Rebbi Ayvo bar Naggari were sitting. They said, we have stated: Who is a child? Any who cannot ride on his father’s shoulder.” And can a child hear and can a child speak<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">While a child can hear and speak, it usually will not understand (meant here by “hear”) and it cannot teach (understood by “speak”).</i>? They turned around and said, <i>all your males</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:17" href="/Exodus.23.17"><i>Ex</i>. 23:17</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 16:16" href="/Deuteronomy.16.16"><i>Deut</i>. 16:16</a>, description of who is required to appear in the Temple on a festival of pilgrimage. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chagigah 4a" href="/Chagigah.4a">Babli 4a</a>; <i>Mekhilta dR.

The cases exempted from this biblical duty are defined in the Halakhah.</i>, to exclude (the child) [the deaf-mute. Or should we say, <i>so they should hear and learn</i>, to exclude the child?]<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s addition, unnecessary.</i> Rebbi Yose said, since one verse excludes and one verse includes, I am including the child who will be able to come in the future, and excluding the deaf-mute who will not be able to come in the future. Samuel bar Abba asked before Rebbi Ze`ira: May a deaf-mute child be liable<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chagigah 6a" href="/Chagigah.6a">Babli, 6a</a>, this question refers to a deaf-mute child whom the experts give a chance of recovering hearing and/or speech.</i>? He said to him, come and see; the permanent dweller (in Heaven) [on earth]<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The corrector’s change introduces the Babli’s idiom; it should be deleted. The expression means that one was seeking proof in extraneous sources when the answer is readily available intrinsically.</i> and the traveller in the highest Heaven? Since an adult deaf-mute is not liable, a child deaf-mute not <i>a fortiori</i>? Rebbi Jeremiah said, it would have been logical that a child who is no deaf-mute should be not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In this discussion, it should be pointed out that the child is never liable, and cannot be liable before becoming an adult. The question is whether the parent is liable to bring the child to the Temple.</i>. It is the decision of the verse, <i>all your males</i>, to include the child. I would say, but a (child) [adult]<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s change, misunderstanding the text, to be deleted. The scribe’s text also implies that there should be no distinction made between the minor and the adult deaf-mute.</i> deaf-mute should be liable, not to split the practice of <i>males</i>. Therefore what Rebbi Yose said is necessary: since one verse excludes and one verse includes, I am including the child who will be able to come in the future, and excluding the deaf-mute who will not be able to come in the future.
“The sexless.” Everybody agrees that a sexless who was torn open and turned out to be a male<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">By an accident or an operation his skin was torn and it turned out that he had penis and testicles. Then he is a male and liable for all obligations of a male. Since a male is required to appear in the Temple on a holiday, but not before, now that he knows that he is a male he is liable like everybody else.</i> on the first day of a holiday is liable. Where do they disagree? On the remaining days. Ḥizqiah said, <i>he shall be seen, he shall be seen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:17" href="/Exodus.23.17"><i>Ex.</i>23:17</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 34:23" href="/Exodus.34.23">34:23</a>. In both places only Passover is mentioned as going on for 7 days; Pentecost and Tabernacles appear as single holidays. Since the obligation to appear is repeated, it follows that the seven day holiday has to be treated like a one-day holiday. A person not obligated on the one day cannot become obligated later.</i>, he who is liable on the first {day} is liable on the second; he who is not liable on the first {day} is not liable on the second. Rebbi Joḥanan said, all seven {days} are make-up for the first. Rebbi Ila said, Rebbi Joḥanan inferred this from the Second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. As Rebbi Joḥanan said there<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Chagigah 2a" href="/Chagigah.2a">Babli 2a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chagigah 9a" href="/Chagigah.9a">9a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 93a" href="/Pesachim.93a"><i>Pesaḥim</i>93a</a>. Since the Second <i>Pesaḥ</i> is biblical institution for people not liable to bring the first of the 14th of Nisan, it proves that make-up days are also for people not liable for appearance on the first day of a holiday.</i>, the Second <i>Pesaḥ</i> is make-up for the first, so he says here, all seven {days} are make-up for the first. Rebbi Hoshaia said, all seven {days} are obligatory<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">They are independent possibilities for fulfilling the obligation of appearance, including the six days following the one-day holiday of Pentecost.</i>. What results between them? A proselyte who converted on one of the other days. In Ḥizqiah’s opinion he is not liable; in Rebbi Joḥanan’s and Rebbi Hoshaia’s opinions he is liable. Is it the same for the impure one<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A person impure on the first day, to become pure on a later day.</i>? In Ḥizqiah’s opinion is he not liable; in Rebbi Joḥanan’s and Rebbi Hoshaia’s opinions is he liable? Rebbi Yose said, there he is suitable<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore he certainly is not liable for Ḥisqia and R. Joḥanan; the question remains open for R. Hoshaia.</i>; the tearing caused it.

Let us hear from the following: Joḥanan ben Dahavai said in the name of Rebbi Jehudah, neither does the blind one<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Who is excluded from the duty of pilgrimage. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Chagigah (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Chagigah_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chagigah 2a" href="/Chagigah.2a">Babli 2a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 4b" href="/Sanhedrin.4b"><i>Sanhedrin</i>4b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Arakhin 2b" href="/Arakhin.2b"><i>Arakhin</i> 2b</a>.</i>. Nobody says “neither” unless he agrees with the preceding statement<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">That the hermaphrodite is excluded.</i>. The argument of Rebbi Jehudah seems inverted. There he says except, but here he says including. Rebbi Jehudah and the rabbis explain the same verse<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 17:14" href="/Genesis.17.14"><i>Gen</i>. 17:14</a>, establishing the duty of circumcision. The verse emphasizing <i>male</i> is not needed to exclude female circumcision since the limb to be circumcised always is referred to as <i>flesh</i>, and therefore designates the only boneless limb, the penis, which characterizes males.</i>. The rabbis explain <i>uncircumcised</i>. Why does the verse say, <i>an uncircumcised male</i>? Only if he be totally male<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">While the hermaphrodite can be circumcised, having a penis, and has to be circumcised since his maleness may be the dominant trait, he cannot be classified as male.</i>.

This excludes the slave who has another master. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, from where that anybody who keeps the commandment of appearance is like one who greets the Divine Presence?

They sat occupied with words of the Torah, from the Torah to Prophets, from Prophets to Hagiographs. Fire descended from Heaven and surrounded them. Abuya told them, my teachers! Why do you come to burn down my house? They told him, Heaven forbid! But we were sitting reviewing the words of the Torah, from the Torah to Prophets, from Prophets to Hagiographs, and the words were joyful as at their giving on Sinai. And was the main giving on Sinai not in fire? <i>And the Mountain burns in the fire up to the heart of Heaven</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 4:11" href="/Deuteronomy.4.11"><i>Deut</i>. 4:11</a>.</i>. My father Abuya told them, my teachers! If that is the power of Torah, if this son of mine survives I dedicate him to Torah. Because his intent was not for Heaven, it did not succeed with this man.

And like golden and glass vessels when they are broken he can make them vessels as before, also the student of the Sages who forgot his learning can learn it anew. He said to him, this is enough, Meïr, up to here is the Sabbath domain. He asked him, how do you know? He told him, from the horse’s hooves which I continuously counted for 2’000 cubits. He said to him, all that wisdom is in you and you do not repent? He told him, I cannot. He asked him, why? He told him, once I was passing by the Holiest of Holies riding on a horse on the Day of Atonement which fell on a Sabbath and I heard an unembodied voice coming from the Holiest of Holies, saying, <i>return, erring children</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 3:14" href="/Jeremiah.3.14"><i>Jer</i>. 3:14</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 3:22" href="/Jeremiah.3.22">22</a>.</i>, except for Elisha ben Abuya who knew My power and rebelled against Me. And all that came to him because he was sitting memorizing in the valley of Genezareth and saw a man climbing to the top of a date palm taking the mother with the chicks and descending safely. The next day he saw another man climbing to the top of a date palm, taking the chicks and sending away the mother. When climbing down he was bitten by a snake, and he died.

But some are saying, because he saw the tongue of Rebbi Jehudah the baker in the mouth of a dog, oozing blood. He said, is this the Torah and this is its reward? This is the tongue which was delivering the words of the Torah correctly; this is the tongue which occupied itself with Torah all its days; [is this the Torah and this is its reward?] It appears that there is no reward and no resurrection of the dead. But some are saying, when his mother was pregnant with him she passed by pagan temples and smelled of this kind. And this smell was bubbling in her body like the poison of a viper. Later Elisha fell sick. They came and informed Rebbi Meïr, your teacher is sick. He went to visit him and found him sick. He asked him, are you not repenting? He asked, and if one repents, is one accepted? He told him, is it not written, <i>man shall repent up to extinction</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 90:3" href="/Psalms.90.3"><i>Ps</i>. 90:3</a>.</i>, one receives up to the extinction of the breath. At that moment Elisha cried, passed away, and died. Rebbi Meïr was happy internally and said, it seems that my teacher passed away repentant. After they buried him, fire descended from Heaven and burned his grave. They came and informed Rebbi Meïr, your teacher’s grave is on fire. He went to visit it and found it burning. What did he do? He took his kaftan and spread it over it. He said, <i>stay for the night</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Ruth 3:13" href="/Ruth.3.13"><i>Ruth</i> 3:13</a>.</i>, etc. Stay for this world which compares to the night, <i>and it will be in the morning</i>, this is the Future World which is all morning, <i>if the Good One will redeem</i>, this is the Holy One, praise to Him, who is Good, as it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 145:9" href="/Psalms.145.9"><i>Ps</i>. 145:9</a>.</i>, <i>the Eternal is good to all, and His mercies are on all His creatures.

It points out to them its back point and says, <i>the Eternal is His Name</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex</i>. 15:32.</i>, “Master” is His Name. Another explanation. Why by Bet? Because it is an expression of blessing, but not by Alef, which is an expression of accursed. The Holy One, praise to Him, said, I shall only build My world with Bet, so that the creatures should not say, how could the world remain standing if it was created in an expression of accursed. Therefore I shall create it with Bet, and expression of blessing, so it shall have a chance to endure.

By tradition, the owner has to push down on the animal with all his force. Doing this on a holiday is at least rabbinically forbidden as illegitimate use of an animal. Now it is explained in <i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 10 that most, but not all, rabbinic restrictions on Sabbath and holidays were disregarded in the Temple.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The House of Shammai are saying, one brings well-being offerings and does not lean on them, but no elevation offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Since most of well-being offerings is consumed and the preparation of food is permitted on a holiday, there is no question that these may be brought on a holiday. As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.2.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>, the House of Shammai follow a long tradition which holds that biblically required but rabbinically prohibited leaning on the sacrificial animal may not be done in the Temple on a full holiday. Since nothing of elevation offerings is human food, on a full holiday they prohibit bringing private elevation offerings, even those biblically required as appearance offering.</i>. But the House of Hillel are saying one brings well-being and elevation offerings and leans on them<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Both the appearance offering as elevation offering and the holiday well-being offerings are biblically required on the holiday, which means the full holiday, as exemplified by Pentecost which is only one day. Therefore the House of Hillel admit both kinds of offerings on the full holiday and disregard the rabbinic prohibition of leaning on since most rabbinic prohibitions are disregarded in the Temple.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">This Halakhah is <i>Yom Tov</i> 2:4, explained there in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:1:10-14" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.2.1.10-14">Notes 56–84</a>.</i> The House of Shammai say, irregular leaning-on was permitted. But the House of Hillel say, irregular leaning-on was not permitted. What is irregular leaning-on? From the day before. Rebbi Ze`ira said, everybody agrees that he did not fulfill his obligation regarding the reparation offering of a sufferer from skin disease if he leaned on the day before; he fulfilled his obligation with voluntary well-being offerings for which he leaned on the day before. Where do they disagree? The festival well-being offerings. The House of Shammai treat them like voluntary well-being offerings; the House of Hillel treat them like the reparation offering of a sufferer from skin disease. Rebbi Yasa said, that what you are saying, he did not fulfill his obligation regarding the reparation offering of a sufferer from skin disease if he leaned on the day before, {only} on time. If its time has passed it becomes like holiday well-being offerings.
“The House of Hillel said to the House of Shammai: Since at a time when I forbid to the private person I am permitting it for Heaven, when it is permitted for the private person is it not logical that it be permitted for Heaven? The House of Shammai said to them, vows and voluntary gifts are proof, since they are permitted to the private person but forbidden to Heaven. The House of Hillel said to them, no. If you are speaking about vows and voluntary gifts which have no fixed time, what does this imply for the festival offering which has a fixed time? The House of Shammai answered them, the festival offering has no fixed time since if he did not offer it on the first day, he may offer it on the second day, if he did not offer it on the second day, he may offer it on the third day. The House of Hillel told them, the festival offering has a fixed time, for if he did not offer it on the holiday of pilgrimage he may not offer it after the holiday. The House of Shammai said to them, is it not already said: <i>only what can be eaten by any person this alone may be made for you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:16" href="/Exodus.12.16"><i>Ex</i>. 12:16</a>.</i>? The House of Hillel answered them, is that a proof? <i>For you</i> it may not be made, [but] it is made for Heaven. Abba Shaul says it was based on another reason: Since when your stove is closed down, your Master’s stove is open, when your stove is open it only is logical that your Master’s stove should be open. Another explanation: It is not in order that your table should be full but the table of your (Master) [Creator] be empty.”
Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish was passing by the school when he heard them reciting the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Chronicles 29:21" href="/I_Chronicles.29.21"><i>1Chr</i>. 29:21</a>.</i>, <i>they sacrificed animal sacrifices and brought elevation sacrifices the next day</i>. He said, he who interrupts follows the House of Shammai; he who reads it as one sentence follows the House of Hillel. One understands elevation sacrifices the next day; but well-being sacrifices the next day? Are not well-being sacrifices brought following the House of Shammai? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, David died on Pentecost; all of Israel were deep mourners and they brought the next day.
“It happened that Hillel the Elder brought his elevation offering to the Temple courtyard and leaned on it. The students of the House of Shammai ganged up on him. He started to wag its tail, said to them, look, it is a female and I brought it as well-being sacrifice, and kept them talking about other matters until they left. After some time the House of Shammai became strong and they wanted to fix practice following their words. There was there Bava ben Buta from the students of the House of Shammai who realized that practice followed the House of Hillel. Once he entered the Temple courtyard and found it desolate. He said, the house of those who make our God’s House desolate shall be desolate. What did he do? He sent and brought 3’000 young lambs from Qedar sheep, checked them for defects, and displayed them on the Temple Mount. He said to them, listen to me my brothers, the House of Israel. Anybody who wants to bring an elevation sacrifice may bring it and lean on it, to bring a well-being sacrifice may bring it and lean on it. At that moment, practice was fixed following the House of Hillel; and nobody said anything.” Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar said, this cup for breakfast has to be full<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 4:32" href="/Deuteronomy.4.32"><i>Deut</i>. 4:32</a>.</i>; the worm in the wood comes from itself; any coal which does not cause a burn at the start will not cause one. “Again it happened that a student of Hillel brought his elevation offering to the Temple courtyard and leaned on it. A student of Shammai saw him and said to him, what is this leaning-on? He said to him, what about being silent? He silenced him by a reprimand and he left.”

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If Pentecost falls on a Friday, the House of Shammai are saying that its slaughter-day is after the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Since the House of Shammai do not permit the elevation offerings to be brought on Friday, which is the holiday, nor on the Sabbath when they are biblically prohibited, they must declare Sunday as a minor holiday similar to the intermediate days of Passover and Tabernacles.</i>, but the House of Hillel are saying that it has no slaughter-day.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Since the holiday is only one day, every pilgrim is asked to bring all his offerings on the holiday itself.</i> They agree that if it falls on the Sabbath that its slaughter-day is after the Sabbath; the High Priest does not wear his garments, and one is permitted eulogies and fasting, in order not to support the words of those who are saying that Pentecost is on Sunday<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">In this case (which is excluded in the computed calendar), no private slaughter is possible on the holiday itself. It may not be done in advance of the holiday (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:4:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.4.2-3">Halakhah 1:4</a>, after <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:2:7" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.2.2.7">Note 131</a>). Therefore the first day available for the pilgrimage offerings is Sunday. While in the biblical text Pentecost is a purely agricultural holiday, the start of the wheat harvest, both in Pharisaic as in standard Sadducee (as given in the Book of Jubilees) interpretation it is the anniversary of the theophany on Sinai and therefore the anniversary of the creation of the organized Synagogue. Only the otherwise unremarkable sect of the Boethusians insist on counting the fifty days starting from a Sunday, therefore having Pentecost on a Sunday but its calendar date variable and not available as the anniversary of anything. Since by the time of the formulation of the Mishnah Boethusians long had disappeared, one may consider these rules as intended against Christian practice which manages to combine the Boethusian variable date with the interpretation as anniversary of the founding of the Chuch. The High Priest is prevented from serving on that day, to avoid that the day be considered festive in any way. Similarly, even though the day is an extension of the holiday, one is invited to treat it as a regular weekday on which eulogies and fasts are permitted.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If Pentecost falls on a Friday, the House of Shammai are saying that its slaughter-day is after the Sabbath, but the House of Hillel are saying that it has no slaughter-day.” But its day is its slaughter-day.

The House of Shammai would have had to object to the rule formulated by the House of Hillel if they still had existed at a time when Christianity had become an factor.</i>[.] It is an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One washes hands<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The impurity of hands is rabbinic.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Is hand-washing required for profane food<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">This is a discussion of impurity imparted by unwashed hands. The basic observation is that an impure person or object which touches anything susceptible to impurity imparts impurity of one degree lower. (However, the majority opinion is that fluids do not touch but merge, and therefore transmit impurity of the same degree as the acting material.) There are three stages of biblical impurity, “grandfather of impurity”, a corpse or a house in which there is a corpse, “original impurity”, anything touched by a corpse or (with a few exceptions) found in a house containing a corpse, and any other impurity described in the Torah, and “impurity in the first degree”, biblically imparted by contact with original impurity or rabbinically by contact with any impure fluid. The other stages are rabbinical; persons or food impure in stage <i>n</i> by touch impart impurity of stage <i>n</i>+1. The technical term is “impure” for anything able to impart impurity and “disqualified” for matters unusable because of impurity but not imparting impurity to others. Profane food may be impure in stage 1, it becomes disqualified (cannot be dedicated for any sacred use) in stage 2. Heave and Second Tithe (<i>sacra</i> not connected with the Temple) are impure in stages 1,2 and disqualified in stage 3. Temple <i>sacra</i> are impure in stages 1,2,3 and disqualified in stage 4.</i>? But it must follow Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar, since Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says, hand-washing is required for profane food.

There, it follows the rabbis; what is their reason here? Since you tell him that his hands are impure in the second degree, he will separate from heave. But did they not decide about them because of fluids; then they should be impure in the first degree<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Since unwashed hands touching any fluid make the fluid rabbinically impure in the first degree, it would be reasonable to consider unwashed hands as impure in the first degree.</i>?

The intermediate stage, no longer impure but not yet pure, is called <i>Tevul Yom</i>, “immersed during daytime”. Since the verse prohibits him to consume sacred food it is inferred that he also may not handle it. Since he is no longer impure, his touch cannot make impure. It is inferred that his touch disqualifies.</i>, impure hands, which are from their words, not so much more? Another explanation: Did they not decide about hands only that he should separate from heave? Since you tell him that his hands are impure in the second degree, he will separate from heave.

Halakhah 8

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How does one proclaim the purity of the courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">One alerts the Cohanim and Levites that following the Sages, all utensils which were used during the holiday must be purified by immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> after the holiday.</i>? One immerses all vessels in the Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">After the end of the holiday. The Mishnah in the Babli makes it clear that the purification is because of the impurity of the vulgar which only was suspended, not eliminated during the holiday. Since the Mishnah in the printed Yerushalmi is not from the ms. on which the text of the Halakhah is based, one cannot infer too much from differences in the text of the Mishnah. However, since the Halakhah strictly follows the text of the Mishnah here and its first paragraph makes it clear that the reason for the purification is that one suspects that in the throng of holiday traffic a vessel might have become impure by biblical standards it is clear that the Yerushalmi does not accept the argument of the Babli. This supports the thesis that the picture of relations between Pharisees and non-Pharisees given in the Babli cannot be accepted as historical fact; cf. Introduction to Tractate Demay.</i>. There were seconds and thirds, that in case the first ones became impure one would bring the seconds in their place. All vessels in the Temple need immersion except the golden altar and the copper altar since they are like soil<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore not susceptible to impurity.</i>, the words of Rebbi Eliezer, but the Sages are saying, because they are plated<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore one never touches the altar itself but only the cover which cannot transmit impurity to the altar.</i>.

However, if the immersion is for biblical impurity, the vessel returns to a status of purity only after the following sundown. Then the question arises, how was the Temple service performed for the remainder of the day of immersion if there were no pure vessels available? The answer is given in the Mishnah, that there were reserve vessels available which had not been used during the holiday.</i>. Then should we not suspect all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">The answer given in the preceding Note seems to be invalid since one refers to pre-existing biblical impurity. Then the second and third vessels should also be immersed and not only after a holiday but every day of the year. While the second objection may answered that daily immersion clearly is impractical, the first objection remains unanswered.</i>? Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, I am saying that there was one of the Cohanim who left to speak with a woman about her nest and a drop of spittle fell on his clothing from her mouth and made him impure<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">A woman after childbirth or after an extended period of menstrual impurity regains her right to participate in <i>sacra</i> only by a sacrifice of a couple of birds, a “nest”.

Rebbi Shiloh from Kefar-Tamarta in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The reason of Rebbi Eliezer: <i>And you shall cover it with pure gold</i><sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 30:3" href="/Exodus.30.3"><i>Ex</i>. 30:3</a>.</i>, etc. The Torah called it real estate<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Torah mentions its roof and its walls, it is described as a house.</i>. So far the golden altar. From where the altar of the elevation sacrifices? It is a logical argument. Since the golden altar which is one cubit square is called real estate, the altar of elevation sacrifices which is five cubits square not so much more? Some want to say, <i>square, square</i><sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 30:3" href="/Exodus.30.3"><i>Ex.</i>30:3</a> (the golden altar), 27:1 (the brass altar).</i>. Since here it is real estate, also there it is real estate. Rebbi Hila said, the reason of the rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">These rabbis are not mentioned in the Mishnah. The argument is that the Sages mentioned in the Mishnah could use R. Eliezer’s argument in the inverse direction to establish their rule.</i>, <i>the altar is of wood, three cubits its height</i><sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Ezekiel 41:22" href="/Ezekiel.41.22"><i>Ez</i>. 41:22</a>. The altar there is called “table”, a movable implement.</i>, etc. The Torah called it movable<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">In the Torah both altars are movable, to be carried travelling in the desert.</i>. So far the altar of the elevation sacrifices. From where the golden altar? It is a logical argument. Since the the altar of the elevation sacrifices which is five cubit square is called soil, the golden altar which is one cubit square not so much more? Some want to say, <i>square, square</i>. Since here it is movable, also there it is movable. “But the Sages say, because they are covered.” But is it not cover which stands because of it<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">If the cover could not stand alone it cannot be separated from the implement it covers which is a rectangular box of wood, enclosing a volume and therefore susceptible of impurity.</i>? Did not Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish say in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia: Its thickness was that of a Gordian denar<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">The only honest gold denar minted during the military anarchy (in the 240’s by Gordianus III.) The implication is that the gold cover could stand by itself; the objection cannot be sustained.</i> Rebbi La said, for its purpose it does not stand because of it<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">The previous argument can be reinforced; the gold is the essential carrier of the altar and the wood is ancillary.</i>. This parallels what Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, <i>you shall make an altar for incense smoke</i><sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 30:1" href="/Exodus.30.1"><i>Ex</i>. 30:1</a>.</i> is not written here but <i>burning incense</i>; the altar was burning the incense<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">No fire was used on the golden top of the altar (which if used would have melted the top in no time). The golden top transformed the incense into smoke.</i>. But is it not like a table<sup class="footnote-marker">224a</sup><i class="footnote">Latin <i>tabula</i>.</i> made to be moved and deposited? Does not Rebbi Immi say in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: why is the table impure<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">In all this arguments, “pure” means “not susceptible to impurity” and “impure” “able to become impure”.</i>? Not because one was removing it and showing it to the pilgrims<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">The table was not fixed; it cannot be considered a fixed part of the building. In addition, the rim around the table makes it a container which is “impure”. But once a permanent Temple was built, the altars are fixed and should be “pure” as fixtures of the building.</i>? But this one remains in its place. It also served as a vessel in the Sanctuary. Then it should be pure, why is it impure<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">In all this arguments, “pure” means “not susceptible to impurity” and “impure” “able to become impure”.</i>? Rebbi Mana said, as what we have stated there,<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 24:9" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.24.9">Mishnah <i>Kelim</i>24:9</a>.</i> “there are three baskets<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">A basket for manure may become impure by body fluids, a box for straw only becomes impure by the impurity of the dead, a cover for camels is pure.</i>”. Rebbi Ze`ira said, because one uses it for its bales; so also here one uses it for its bales<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah classifies the baskets by their use, also here the altar has to be classified by the “impure” incense.</i>.
