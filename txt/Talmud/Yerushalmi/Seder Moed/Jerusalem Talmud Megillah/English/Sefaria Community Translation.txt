If they read the Megillah in the first Adar and the year was made a leap year, they read [the Megillah] in the second Adar.  There is no difference between the first Adar and the second Adar but reading the Megillah and gifts to the poor.

R. Shmuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Yohanan: 85 elders, among them several prophets, were worrying about this. They said, "It is written (Leviticus 27:34), 'These are the commandments that God commanded Moshe' - these are the commandments that we were commanded from the mouth of Moshe, and thus did Moshe say to us, 'No other prophet will introduce something to you from now [on].'" They did not move from there - they gave and took on the matter - until the Holy One, blessed be He, enlightened their eyes, and they found it to be written in the Torah and the Prophets and the Writings: That is that which is written (Exodus 17:14), "And the Lord said to Moshe, 'Write this as a memorial in the book' - 'this' is Torah, as you would say (Deuteronomy 4:44), 'This is the Torah that Moshe placed in front of the Children of Israel'; 'memorial' is the Prophets[, as there  one finds] (Malachi 3:16), 'and he wrote a book of memorial in front of Him for those that fear the Lord, etc.'; 'in the book' is the Writings[, as there  one finds] (Esther 9:32), 'And the word of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.'"
Rav and Rabbi Chaninah and Rabbi Yochanan and Bar Kapara and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, "This Megillah (The Book of Esther) was given to Moshe from Sinai, however there is no [chronological sequence] in the Torah." Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish [disagreed about the following matter]: Rabbi Yochanan said, "The Prophets and the Writings will be nullified in the future but the Five Books of the Torah will not be nullified in the future. What is the reason? [Because it is written,] 'a great voice that did not cease' (Deuteronomy 5:19)." Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, "Also the Megillah of Esther and the Laws (<i>halakhot</i>) will not be nullified in the future; it states here, 'a great voice that did not cease' and it states later (Esther 9:28), 'and their memory did not cease'; the Laws, [as it is written,] 'His ways (<i>halikhot</i>) are forever'  (Habakuk 3:6)."
Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, "The Holy One, blessed be He, foresaw that Haman, the wicked, would weigh silver [as a bribe against] Israel. He said, 'It is better that the silver of My children should precede the silver of this wicked one.' Therefore we precede [before Purim] and read Parshat Shekalim (literally the section [in the Torah] of weighing [silver])."
Rabbi Abahu [said] in the name of Rabbi Elazar, "[It is written,] 'in each and every year' - there is a comparison of a year that is intercalated to a year that is not intercalated: just like [in] a year that is intercalated, Adar is next to Nissan, so too in a year that is intercalated, [the month of] Adar is [observed] next to [the month of] Nissan." Rabbi Helbo said, "[It is] in order to make a redemption next to a redemption."
Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Chama bar Chaninah, "That year was an intercalated year. What is the reason? [Because it is written,] 'from day to day, from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar' (Esther 3:7)." Is the first Adar an addition [or] is the second Adar an addition? What is [the difference] between them? The two lambs [sacrificed on Shavouot (since they must be no more than a year old)]: if it was born on the fifteenth of Adar in a year that was not intercalated and that is [followed by] a year that is intercalated, if you say the first Adar is an addition, it is an extended year; if you say the second Adar is an addition, he only has until the fifteenth of the first Adar. Rabbi Eyebi bar Nagri said, "A teaching says like this, [that] the first Adar is an addition.

It is written (Genesis 11:1), "And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech." R. Leazar and R. Yochanan, one of them said the they spoke seventy languages. Another said they spoke the language of the singular one of the world, the holy language. [...]

And on the Day of Convocation, "Seven Weeks" (Deuteronomy 16:9) A Tanna taught, "In the Third Month" (Exodus 19:1). And on the New Year, "In the Seventh Month." (Leviticus 23:23) A Tanna taught "And The Lord Remembered Sarah" (Genesis 21:1). And on the Day of Atonement, "After the Death".  (Leviticus 16:1) On the first day of the Holiday, read the Chapter of Times in Leviticus (Leviticus 23). And on the other days of the Holiday, read the Sacrifices of the Holiday. (Numbers 29)  Ribbi Jacob Son of Ahi said in the name of Ribbi Yesa “This is to teach you that the world does not stand, except through the sacrifices.” 
It was taught over there (Fathers 1:2) “Simon the Righteous was of the remnants of the Great Assembly. He had said ‘On three things the world stands: 1) On Torah, 2) on Worship, 3) and on Distribution of Piety.’” And the three are mentioned in a single verse (Isaiah 51:15) “And I have put My words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.’” And I have put My words in thy mouth: This is the Study of Torah. And have covered thee in the shadow of My hand: This is Distribution of Piety, to teach you that whosoever engages in Torah and in Distribution of Piety merits to sit in the Shade of the Holy One, Blessed be He. Similarly, it says (Psalms 36:8) “How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.”  That I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth:  These are the Sacrifices. And say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.’: Ribbi Hinina son of Papa said, “We have reviewed all of Scripture, and we have not found that the People of Israel is called Zion except in this place, “and say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.” It was taught over there (Fathers 1:17) “R Simeon son of Gamaliel said on three things the world stands: 1) On Justice, 2) On Truth, 3) On Peace. And all three are one idea, “The making of justice is the making of truth is the making of peace.” Ribbi Mana said “And all three are in one verse (Zechariah 8:16) [These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbour] “Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates”.

Halakhah 1

The one who reads the Megillah stands or sits. If one read it or two read it, one has fulfilled [one's obligation]. In a place that it is customary to bless, one should bless; that it is not to bless, one should not bless. On Monday and on Thursday and on Shabbat at Mincha [the afternoon service], we read 3 [sections from the Torah]. We do not subtract from them and we do not add to them. And we do not conclude in the Prophets [i.e. a haftarah]. The one who opens [i.e. begins] and the one who seals [i.e. finishes] in the Torah blesses before it and after it.
