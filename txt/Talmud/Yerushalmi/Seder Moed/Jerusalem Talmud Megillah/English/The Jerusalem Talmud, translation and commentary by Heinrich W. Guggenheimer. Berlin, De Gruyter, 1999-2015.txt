Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Esther scroll read on Purim.</i> is read on the Eleventh, the Twelfth, the Thirteenth, the Fourteenth, the Fifteenth<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Of Adar; in an intercalary year the Adar preceding Nisan.</i>, no less and no more. Places walled<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Greek χάραξ “palisade”.</i> from the days of Joshua bin Nun<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reason is explained in the third paragraph of the Halakhah.</i> read on the Fifteenth. Hamlets<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Who either have no organized prayer service since they count less than ten adult males or they have nobody competent to read the scroll.</i> and large villages read on the Fourteenth, except that hamlets precede to the market day<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Monday or Thursday preceding Purim. On these days one reads the scroll in the local synagogue for the benefit of the peasants who come to town to sell their produce on the market. If the 14<sup>th</sup>, Purim, is on Sunday, one reads for the peasants on the 11<sup>th</sup>. If it falls on Wednesday or Sabbath, one reads on the 12<sup>th</sup>; on Tuesday or Friday one reads on the 13<sup>th</sup>. (In the computed calendar, the 14<sup>th</sup> never falls on Monday, Wednesday, or Sabbath; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 1:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.1.2.2">Note 89</a>.)</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The scroll is read,” etc. Rebbi Ila, Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: <i>To confirm these Purim days in their times</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:31" href="/Esther.9.31"><i>Esth</i>. 9:31</a>.</i>. Why does the verse say, <i>in their times</i>? Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Jonah says, to give them other times<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He would allow other days than those enumerated in the Mishnah if circumstances demand it.</i>. Rebbi Yose says, times which the Sages fixed for them. And those are these: the Eleventh, the Twelfth, the Thirteenth, the Fourteenth, the Fifteenth<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since the days enumerated in the Mishnah are supposed to have been decreed by the Great Assembly, they could be modified only by an assembly of greater authority. It is unlikely that such an assembly ever could be convened. Differently in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 2a" href="/Megillah.2a">Babli, 2a</a>.</i>. Or maybe only the Sixteenth and the Seventeenth? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: <i>and it shall not pass by</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:27" href="/Esther.9.27"><i>Esth</i>. 9:27</a>.</i>, one shall not impregnate<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The language is taken from calendar computation where “intercalation” is called “impregnation”. Here it means “changing the usual calendar data.”</i>. Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Samuel: <i>and it shall not pass by</i>, and one shall not let it pass<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Reading the root עבר not as rabbinic Hebrew “to be pregnant” but as biblical Hebrew “to pass by”. One may not celebrate Purim later than the last date mentioned in the Scroll, the 15<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> of Adar.</i>. Maybe it is only the Ninth and the Tenth? Samuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: It is not written “days” but <i>like the days</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:22" href="/Esther.9.22"><i>Esth</i>. 9:22</a>.</i>, pair days with days, the Eleventh and Twelfth corresponding to Fourteenth and Fifteenth. Or the Twelfth and Thirteenth corresponding to Fourteenth and Fifteenth? Rebbi Ḥelbo said, the Thirteenth was a day of war<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:1" href="/Esther.9.1"><i>Esth</i>. 9:1</a>.</i>. It proves for itself that it was not a day of comfort. Then one should not read on this day. One reads before and after, on the day one should not read<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Excluding the 13th would be technically impossible. Cf. Meïri <i>Megillah</i>, <i>ed. M. Herschler</i>, pp. 14/15.</i>? Or only the Ninth and the Tenth? <i>Like the days</i>, days close to the days. But if days close to the days, {maybe} only Sixteenth and Seventeenth? You cannot, for Rebbi Abbahu said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: <i>and it shall not pass by</i>, one shall not impregnate<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The language is taken from calendar computation where “intercalation” is called “impregnation”. Here it means “changing the usual calendar data.”</i>. [Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Samuel: <i>and it shall not pass by</i>, and one shall not let it pass.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s addition from the earlier text, totally out of place since one speaks of predating, not postdating.</i>]
It was stated in the name of Rebbi Nathan: The entire month is qualified for reading the scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For example a person going on a trip who probably will not have a scroll available to him on the days enumerated in the Mishnah can discharge his obligation by reading the scroll before his departure.</i>. What is the reason? <i>The month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:22" href="/Esther.9.22"><i>Esth</i>. 9:22</a>.</i>. Rebbi Ḥelbo said, but only up to the Fifteenth. As Rebbi Abbahu said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: <i>and it shall not pass by</i>, one shall not impregnate<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The language is taken from calendar computation where “intercalation” is called “impregnation”. Here it means “changing the usual calendar data.”</i>. Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Samuel: and it shall not pass by, and one shall not let it pass. That is what you are saying to read the scroll. But making a dinner<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The obligatory dinner to celebrate Purim.</i> one makes only on the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth; and one distributes [to the poor]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A separate obligation to give to the poor, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:22" href="/Esther.9.22"><i>Esth</i>. 9:22</a>.</i> only on the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth. The eyes of the poor are only directed to the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 4b" href="/Megillah.4b">Babli 4b</a>.</i>. Then these should be for reading and those for the dinner? Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rebbi Ḥuna in the name of Rav: <i>These days are remembered and executed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:28" href="/Esther.9.28"><i>Esth</i>. 9:28</a>.</i>. <i>Remembered</i> by reading. <i>And executed</i> by dinner. This implies that the Scroll is given to be analyzed<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">While in principle a text posterior to the Pentateuch cannot prescribe any new obligation, only testify to the practice of earlier generations in the interpretation of the law, an exception is made for the Esther scroll, whose prescriptions are considered divine and in which the story is repeated in Chapter 9 for legal interpretation only. Since Sadducees did not recognize Esther as a canonical book, this elevation of the scroll to Pentateuchal status must be considered an anti-Sadducee demonstration.</i> Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Eleazar: It is said here<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:30" href="/Esther.9.30"><i>Esth</i>. 9:30</a>.</i>, <i>words of peace and truth</i>. And it is said there,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 23:23" href="/Proverbs.23.23"><i>Prov</i>. 23:23</a>.</i> <i>truth buy but do not sell</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It is permitted to pay for instruction in the Torah but forbidden to take money for teaching others. “Truth” in <i>Proverbs</i> always refers to the Torah.</i>. It is like the truth of the Torah. This one needs ruling, that one needs ruling<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Torah verses, as well as a Torah scroll, may only be written on lines, if parchment or leather impressed into the material with a metal ruler, if on paper the latter must be lined. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 16b" href="/Megillah.16b">Babli 16b</a>.)</i>. This one is given to be analyzed, that one is given to be analyzed. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac: The scroll which Samuel handed to David<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">With the plan for the building of the Temple.</i> is given to be analyzed. What is the reason? <sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">This disqualifies all Aramaic translations, even Targum Onkelos canonized in Babylonia.</i><i>Everything in writing</i>, that is the Masora. <i>For the hand of the Eternal</i>, that is the Holy Spirit. <i>To me for understanding</i>, from here that it is given to be analyzed. Rebbi Jeremiah asked, and why do we not say, <i>the plan of everything was in spirit with him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Chronicles 28:12" href="/I_Chronicles.28.12"><i>1Chr</i>. 28:12</a>.</i>? Rebbi Mana said, what is בָר֨וּחַ֙? by the wind of his mouth<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">רוח may be interpreted as Divine inspiration only if indicated as such in the verse.</i>.
“Places walled from the days of Joshua bin Nun read on the Fifteenth.” Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: They honored the Land of Israel which was desolate in those days and attached it to the days of Joshua bin Nun. Then should not everybody read on the Fifteenth? Rebbi Abbahu analyzed “dwelling, dwelling”. Since “dwelling” mentioned there refers to the days of Joshua bin Nun, so also “dwelling” mentioned here refers to the days of Joshua bin Nun<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The basis for this argument and the next one is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:19" href="/Esther.9.19"><i>Esth</i>. 9:19</a>: <i>Therefore the dispersed Jews who dwell in open towns celebrate the Fourteenth of the Month of Adar</i>. While this does not prove that the inhabitants of walled cities read on the Fifteenth, it makes clear that those in open towns do not read on the Fifteenth. The only question is whether the town has to be open at the time of reading or had to be open at the time of the conquest. Now “dwelling” is mentioned in the verse, and it is mentioned as a duty to dwell in the Land after the conquest in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 12:10" href="/Deuteronomy.12.10"><i>Deut</i>. 12:10</a>.</i>. Then should not everybody read on the Fourteenth? Rebbi Jehudah bar Pazy analyzed “open, openness.” It is said here “openness” and it said there<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 3:5" href="/Deuteronomy.3.5"><i>Deut</i>. 3:5</a>.</i> <i>except for very many open towns</i>. Since “open” mentioned there refers to the days of Joshua bin Nun, so also “openness” mentioned here refers to the days of Joshua bin Nun<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This argument to exclude dwellers in towns that are not open from reading on the 14<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> is quoted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 2b" href="/Megillah.2b">Babli 2b</a>.</i>. It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Megillah (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Megillah_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>.</i>: “Rebbi Joshua ben Qorḥa says, from the days of Ahasuerus. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah said to him, what has the reference to Susa the Fortress to do here? If you are inferring from Susa the Fortress then one should read in Susa the Fortress, but not read at any other place<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Not even in the city of Susa which in the Scroll is clearly distinguished from the government complex, the Fortress.</i>.” It seems that there are three Tannaim. The first Tanna intends to say, from the days of Joshua bin Nun. Another Tanna intends to say, from the days of Ahasuerus. Another Tanna intends to say, “town” in any case<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In any town not walled at the time of reading one reads on the 14<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup>.</i>. It turns out that you may say that Rebbi Joshua ben Qorha and Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Jehudah say the same<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It is not proven that R. Yose ben R. Jehudah disagrees with R. Joshua ben Qorha in practice since he does not proffer an alternative.</i>, only that each one of them infers from a separate argument; and it was stated so<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Megillah (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Megillah_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>.</i>: “what is close to a walled place and what is seen with it has the same standing as it<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">As Amoraic statement <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 2b" href="/Megillah.2b">Babli 2b</a>. These places read on the 15<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup>.</i>.” Rebbi Ayvo bar Naggari in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: For example like Ḥamata. Since he only said “like”, therefore Ḥamata itself was walled in the days of Joshua bin Nun. From the following<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 19:35" href="/Joshua.19.35"><i>Jos</i>. 19:35</a>, in the description of the territory of Naftali.

Were there two Genesareths<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Jordan plain of Gad ended at the Southern end of the Sea of Galilee whereas Genezareth is close to its Northern end.</i>? Or were there only two autonomous districts<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Greek ʼαυτονομία.</i>, like Bet Yeraḥ and Zinbarai, which are towers on Lake Kinneret, where the fortification was abandoned and taken over by Gentiles. Come and see, there one does not read, outside one reads<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is unreasonable, one may only read in the suburbs on the 15<sup>th</sup> if there is organized communal reading in the city on the 15<sup>th</sup>.</i>?
Ḥizqiah read it<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Esther scroll in Tiberias. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 5b" href="/Megillah.5b">Babli 5b</a>.</i> on the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth, since he was apprehensive about what Rebbi Simeon ben Yohay had stated, <i>a person who would sell a dwelling-house in a walled city</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25:29" href="/Leviticus.25.29"><i>Lev</i>. 25:29</a>.</i>, that excludes Tiberias whose wall is the lake<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">While Herodian Tiberias had a wall on the land side since there was none on the lake side it was of little military value. The question is whether such military value is required for the definition of “walled city” both for the laws of the Jubilee and for reading the Scroll.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan read it in the Kifra synagogue and said, this is the main ancient Tiberias<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that this synagogue (at other places called Kufra) was outside the wall. In his opinion this was the original Raqqat which was encroached upon by Herod building Tiberias.</i>; he was not apprehensive about what Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥay had stated.

Simeon ben Yoḥay may be correct for the laws of the Jubilee, his argument is irrelevant for reading the Scroll.</i>”
<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta`aniot</i> 4:8, Notes 340–342.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan said, from Gibbethon to Antipatris there were 60’000 villages. The smallest among them was Bet Shemesh, about which it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Samuel 6:19" href="/I_Samuel.6.19"><i>1S</i>. 6:19</a>.</i>, <i>He smote of the men of Bet Shemesh, for they looked at the Ark of</i><i>the Eternal</i>, etc. These were in one direction. If you execute this with reeds it will not carry it. Rebbi Ḥanina said, the Land of Israel folded its fist.
All the towns which Joshua enumerated are at least one hundred. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, he enumerated those walled. Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina said, he enumerated those close to the border. The verse supports Rebbi Yose bar Ḥanina: <i>their border was Meḥelef</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 19:33" href="/Joshua.19.33"><i>Jos</i>. 19:33</a>.

If the root of בצעננים is בצעה “swamp”, the translation would have to be “swamp near Qedesh Naftali.” <i>Damin</i> seems to be the village of <i>Dameh</i> near Tiberias. <i>Hanneqeb</i> seems to be Arabic נקב “hole, breach”, a good description for the mountain pass controlling the road from Tiberias to the Mediterranean. <i>Kefar Yama</i> may be the place Yamnia mentioned by Josephus (<i>Bell</i>.

Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Jehudah ben Levi, Rebbi Joshua ben Levi in the name of Rebbi: Lod and <i>Ge-Haḥarašim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned first in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 11:35" href="/Nehemiah.11.35"><i>Neh</i>. 11:35</a> as settlements in the region of Benjamin. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 4a" href="/Megillah.4a">Babli 4a</a>.</i> were walled from the times of Joshua bin Nun. Why did he not say, “and Ono”?

He therefore disagrees with Rebbi’s statement.</i>.
Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rebbi Ḥuna in the name of the Great Rebbi Ḥiyya. Everybody may fulfill his obligation on the Fourteenth, which is the time of its reading<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shekalim 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shekalim.1.1.4"><i>Šeqalim</i> 1:1, Note 24</a>; also quoted twice in the sequel. He asserts that even though villagers may read early and inhabitants of walled cities have to read on the Fifteenth, reading on the Fourteenth satisfies the basic requirement. Those who are reading on both days, as mentioned later, because the tradition about the existence of a walled settlement in the days of Joshua bin Nun is not reliable, do not recite a benediction on the second day.</i>. It only comes to teach you that the obligations apply to the Second Adar<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <i>Šeqalim</i>, if the Scroll was read on the 15<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> of Adar and then an intercalary month was declared, the reading has to be repeated but even in a walled town may be read on the 14<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup>.</i>. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Aḥa were sitting together. Rebbi Yose said to Rebbi Aḥa, it is only reasonable for the past; but for the future<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">If the scroll was read by error on the 14th it does not have to be repeated since the basic obligation was fulfilled, but a place which by tradition is obligated to read on the 15<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> cannot be permitted in the future to read on the 14<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup>.</i>? And did we not state, at a place where one is used to read it on two days, one reads it on two days? He said to him, I also am of this opinion. Rebbi Mana said, this is correct. If somebody read it on the Fourteenth and read it again on the Fifteenth, would one not listen to him? If you are saying so<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">That a place reading and celebrating on the 15<sup>th</sup> may be permitted to change to the 14<sup>th</sup>.</i>, with your hand you uproot the time of walled places.
Naḥman the son of Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman: <i>Joy and enjoyment</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The entire statement is an explanation of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Esther 9:10" href="/Esther.9.10"><i>Esth</i>. 9:10</a>, but the expression “joy and enjoyment” is from 8:17 instead of the correct “joy” (as in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 5b" href="/Megillah.5b">Babli, 5b</a>.)</i>, this implies that eulogies are forbidden. <i>And festive dinner</i>, this implies that fasting is forbidden. <i>And holiday</i>, this implies that work is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The Babli notes that it is not clear from the statement whether this refers to both days of Purim or only to the day celebrated in the community.</i>. Rebbi Ḥelbo said, many times I sat before Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman but did not hear these things from him. He said to him, did you hear all the traditions which my father had?

In his opinion, any permanent wooden construction is forbidden in the Temple precinct. R. Eliezer ben Jacob reads the verse as forbidding any wooden structure in the Temple precinct (<i>Sifry Deut</i>. 145); therefore he must hold that the reading was outside on the Mount. This raises the question whether R. Mattaniah quotes the verse in support of R. Isaac ben R. Ḥiyya or in opposition since for R. Eliezer ben Jacob only R. Abba ben R. Ḥiyya’s reason would be valid (Maimonides <i>Ḥagigah</i> 3:7).</i>.
The Mishnah is Rebbi Meïr’s, since Rebbi Meïr said, “not to eulogize” one is forbidden to fast, “not to fast” one is permitted to eulogize. “Not to” unspecified is as “not to fast.” Rebbi Jonah said, “these are the days not to fast on them, and partially not to eulogize on them.” Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, why does it say “on them” twice? To teach that the night is permitted but the day forbidden. As it was stated, “therefore a person who takes it on himself has to forbid himself in prayer.” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, that he must mention it on the preceding evening. This comes following what Rebbi Ze`ira said in the name of Rav Ḥuna: Similar to Friday night and Sabbath day.
The Mishnah either follows Rebbi Yose on the eleventh or Rebbi Meïr on the twelfth. But it is difficult for Rebbi Meïr. Was it not stated, “on the twelfth of it is Tirion Day?” But Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Tirion Day was disestablished; the day when Julianus and Pappos were killed. “On the thirteenth of it is Nikanor Day.” What is Nikanor Day? “A commander of the Greek government was passing by on his way to Alexandria when he saw Jerusalem, and insulted, blasphemed, and vituperated and said, <i>when I shall return in peace I shall destroy this tower</i> One of the Hasmoneans went out against him, killed his soldiers until he came to his car When he came to his car he hacked off his hand and cut off his head, stuck them on a piece of wood and wrote under it, the mouth which spoke in guilt and the hand stretched out in haughtiness, and hang it on a pole outside Jerusalem.” In Rebbi Meïr’s opinion it is understandable, it comes to forbid the previous day. What does it come to forbid for Rebbi Yose? To forbid the day before he does not need since itself it forbidden because of the fourteenth. It comes to inform you that eulogies are forbidden. And also for Rebbi Meïr it is not difficult; was it not stated, “on the twelfth of it is Tirion Day?” But Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Tirion Day was disestablished; the day when Julianus and Pappos were killed. “On the fourteenth and the fifteenth is Purim, not to eulogize. On the sixteenth they started to build the wall of Jerusalem, not to eulogize.” In Rebbi Meïr’s opinion it is understandable, it comes to forbid the previous day. What does it come to forbid for Rebbi Yose? To forbid the day before he does not need since itself is forbidden because of the fifteenth. It comes to inform you that eulogies are forbidden.
“On the seventeenth of it Gentiles attacked the remainder of the Sopherim at the city of Khalkis and Bet-Zabdin and there was relief.” In Rebbi Meïr’s opinion it is understandable, it comes to forbid the {day} itself. What does it come to forbid for Rebbi Yose? Rebbi Yose said, all these matters neither support nor contradict either Rebbi Meïr or Rebbi Yose; they only come to report the days on which miracles were done for Israel. You have to understand that this is so since we have stated: “On the New Moon of Nisan the Daily Offering was settled, one may not eulogize.” Without this is it not already forbidden to him because of the New Moon? “But on Sabbath and holidays one fasts before and after them. What do you understand to be lenient with these and restrictive with those? For these are words of the Torah, and words of the Torah do not need reinforcement. But those are words of the Sopherim, and words of the Sopherim need reinforcement.” That is what you were saying, as long as <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was not abolished. But since <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was abolished, all these were abolished. Rebbi Ḥanina and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi both said, <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was abolished. Rebbi Abba and Rebbi Simon both said, <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was abolished. Rebbi Jonathan said, <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was abolished. Rebbi Joḥanan said, yesterday I was repeating, “it happened that in Lydda they decided on a fast-day on Ḥanukkah. They said about Rebbi Eliezer that he got a haircut, and about Rebbi Joshua that he took a {thermal} bath. Rebbi Joshua said to them, go and fast because you fasted.” And you are saying, <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was abolished? Rebbi Abba said, even if you are saying that <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was abolished, Ḥanukkah and Purim were not abolished.
The actions of the rabbis imply that <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> was abolished. Rebbi Jonathan fasted every New Year’s Day’s eve. Rebbi Abun fasted every Sabbath eve. Rebbi Ze`ira fasted 300 fasts, and some say 900, and disregarded <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa commanded the schoolteachers, if a woman comes to ask you, tell her that one may fast any time except Sabbaths, holidays, New Moons, intermediate days of holidays, Ḥanukkah and Purim.
Simeon bar Abba said, there came a case before Rebbi Joḥanan and he instructed following Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Eleazar was sorry about this; he said, does one disregard the anonymous {Mishnah} and follow an isolated opinion? He found that Rebbi Ḥiyya stated this in the name of Rebbi Meïr. When he understood that Rebbi Ḥiyya stated this in the name of Rebbi Meïr, he said, the old man understands his chapters well. Rebbi Mana asked before Rebbi Yudan: Did not Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, every place where Rebbi taught a disagreement and afterwards taught it anonymously, practice follows the anonymous statement. He said to him, and if not Rebbi, maybe somebody else. How is this? If it is found that Rebbi taught a disagreement and afterwards taught it anonymously, then practice follows the anonymous statement. In a case where Rebbi did not teach a disagreement but others taught it in disagreement and Rebbi taught it anonymously, certainly practice has to follow the anonymous text. There come Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Simeon bar Abba in the name of Rebbi Eleazar, every place where Rebbi taught a disagreement and afterwards taught it anonymously, practice follows the anonymous statement. Why does he instruct here following the isolated opinion? Rebbi Samuel bar Ina in the name of Rebbi Aḥa: That is, if no disagreement is stated together with the anonymous opinion. But if a disagreement is stated together with the anonymous opinion, practice does not follow the anonymous opinion.

Rebbi Levi in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. The Holy One, praiuse to Him, saw that the evil Haman in the future would weigh his money against Israel.

You only have the following<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yom Ṭov</i> 3:8.</i>: “One does not sharpen the knife but he cleanses it on another.” Rav Ḥisday said, this is Rebbi Jehudah’s, for Rebbi Jehudah in the name of Samuel said, it is everybody’s opinion, to remove the fat on it.]

This is by Rebbi Neḥoniah ben Haqanah since Rebbi Neḥoniah ben Haqanah says, the Day of Atonement follows the rules of Sabbath for payment. But Rebbi Simeon ben Menassiah says those subject to extirpation equal those subject to capital punishment. What is between them? Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Abuna said, a menstruating adolescent girl is between them<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">If a single girl close to adulthood is raped, the rapist is subject to a fine and he has to marry her (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 22:28-29" href="/Deuteronomy.22.28-29"><i>Deut</i>. 22:28–29</a>).

In the opinion of Rebbi Neḥoniah ben Haqanah, just as the Sabbath does not become permitted after its prohibition started; so the Day of Atonement does not become permitted after its prohibition started. However, these may become permitted after their prohibition started, he has to pay.

Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose: When do we need this? Not for Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish?

Rebbi Abba bar Mamal said, a <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan: <sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Mesora`</i> Introduction 6–8.</i>“<i>From the sufferer from skin disease</i><sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:3" href="/Leviticus.14.3"><i>Lev</i>. 14:3</a>.

So do not wonder if one on whom it spread while in quarantine and the signs of what made him impure are on him does not need birds. The verse says, <i>from the sufferer of skin disease</i> to include one on whom it spread on his entire person that he needs birds.” If you would say that one becoming pure in quarantine does not need birds, should he not have objected that it would have been better to argue spreading against spreadings and not staying stable against spreadings<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">This is the proof that the <i>Sifra</i> supports the opinion of R.

Rebbi Ḥananiah the colleague of the rabbis: the <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan since the Tanna answers his colleague, no.

Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, the closing statement<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">The second sentence of the Mishnah.</i> supports Rebbi Eleazar.

One could argue that for simple acting in error, he should bring a commoner’s sacrifice (or, since a male animal is mentioned, the goat characterized earlier as sacrifice for inadvertent idolatry).

Rebbi Joḥanan said, if he transgressed and offered his tenth of an <i>ephah</i> it is valid<sup class="footnote-marker">424</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the statement in the Mishnah that the only difference between acting and emeritus High Priests are the High Priest’s bull on the Day of Atonement and the daily flour offering of a tenth of an <i>ephah</i>.

<sup class="footnote-marker">425</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the parallel in <i>Yoma</i> 1:1.</i>“One arranges for another Cohen as his replacement, maybe a disqualification of his will happen.<sup class="footnote-marker">426</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 1:1:1-27" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.1.1.1-27">Mishnah <i>Yoma</i>1:1</a>. Since the entire service of the Day of Atonement is valid only if conducted by the High Priest, a replacement must be available in case the High Priest becomes impure or otherwise incapacitated. The High Priest undergoes a week of preparation for the service, to train for a very crowded program. The question then arises whether the designated backup also has to undergo the same training, possibly at the same place.</i>” How? Does one leave them alone together? Rebbi Ḥaggai said, by Moses!

If one was incapacitated and the other officiated.

Since the service of the Day of Atonement is valid only if performed by the High Priest, the substitute becomes a temporary High Priest. He cannot act as a High Priest if the actual High Priest’s temporary disability is removed and he is permanently barred from acting as a common priest.

If he has one anyhow, he is disqualified for the entire day even if he immediately purifies himself in a <i>miqweh</i> since the disqualification by temporary impurity is not removed by the removal of the impurity until the following sundown (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 22:7" href="/Leviticus.22.7"><i>Lev</i>. 22:7</a>; cf. <i>Ma`aser Šeni</i> 3:2, Notes 21–22.)</i>; Ben Illem entered and officiated in his stead. He asked the king when he went out: “The bull and the goat which are brought today, from whose property are they offered? From mine or from the High Priest’s?” The king understood what he was asking and answered him, “Ben Illem, is it not enough for you that you served once before Him Who spoke and the world was created? It is enough for you.” Ben Illem understood that he was removed from the High Priesthood.

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked: What was bought with tithe money and became impure, following Rebbi Jehudah, since it is not subject to being redeemed and eaten at any dwelling place, one may not fulfill one’s obligation with it. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked: <i>Ḥallah</i> from dough made from Second Tithe in Jerusalem, since it is not subject to being redeemed and eaten at any dwelling place, one may not fulfill one’s obligation with it.

Rebbi Abun bar Cahana said, explain it if his purification offering was presented in Shiloh but his elevation and well-being offerings in Nob or Gibeon. Rebbi Ḥananiah, Rebbi Ezrah asked before Rebbi Mana: Did not the teacher say in the name of Rebbi Yose: Holiday well-being offerings brought at an elevated place are qualified but they are not counted against an obligation of the owner? But it must be for Rebbi Jehudah, as Rebbi Jehudah said, purification and Passover offerings of individuals at a principal elevated place, but no purification and Passover offerings of individuals at a private altar.

Abba bar Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda sat together and said, the same rule applies to blowing the Shofar<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">When one is required to hear 9 sounds in prescribed order.</i>.

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya investigated: The recitation of Shema` with its benedictions, the recitation of Shema` without its benedictions, its benedictions without it<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This again refers to reading the <i>Shema`</i> which is preceded and followed by prescribed benedictions.

Rebbi Isaac bar Abba from Mehasia and Rebbi Ḥananel were sitting before Rav. One said, <i>Yehudim</i>. And the other one said, <i>Yehudiim</i>, and neither of them changed his opinion. Rebbi Joḥanan was reading always “Yehudim<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Irrespective of how it was written.</i>”.

But all who did it after dawn are qualified.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Everybody is qualified to read the Scroll except the deaf-and-dumb, the insane, and the underage.” <sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph appears also in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 2:4:3-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.2.4.3-4"><i>Berakhot</i> 2:4 (Notes 160–166</a>,<b>ב</b>) and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 1:1:18-20" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.1.1.18-20"><i>Terumot</i> 1:2 (Notes 90–93</a>,ת). The Mishnah in <i>Berakhot</i> states that in reading the <i>Shema`</i> one must hear what one says. The majority holds that this is a desideratum but not an absolute necessity. R. Yose the Tanna disagrees and therefore a person who is deaf but able to speak still cannot read the <i>Shema`</i>. Heave is the part of the harvest which is given to the Cohen as sanctum to be eaten in purity. The dedication must be a conscious act; therefore in Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:1 the deaf-and-dumb person is excluded from those who may dedicate heave.</i> Rav Mattanah said: That formulation is Rebbi Yose’s. Rebbi Yose said: We could be of the opinion that the rabbis and Rebbi Yose disagree only about <i>Shema`</i> since there it is written: <i>hear</i>!, but not about any other obligations. Since Rav Mattanah said “that formulation is Rebbi Yose’s”, it is the same for all obligations. What is the reason of Rebbi Yose? <i>Bend your ear to His commandments</i><sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 15:26" href="/Exodus.15.26"><i>Ex</i>. 15:26</a>.</i>, your ears should hear what your mouth says. Rav Ḥisda said: The deaf and dumb person is not mentioned, it is a formula<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">In all legal matters depending on a conscious act, “insane, deaf-and-dumb, and underage” are excluded. The formula should have been modified here but, since the Mishnah was transmitted orally and could not be written down, was not modified, to ease memorization.</i>. Rebbi Yose said: It is reasonable to think that Rav Ḥisda concedes that the statement from <i>Terumot</i> is from Rebbi Yose. Rabbi Ḥanania came in the name of Rav Ḥisda, this one is by Rebbi Yose. Rebbi Yose bar Rebbi Abun said: It must be said that that one is Rebbi Yose’s since we have stated the first five cases<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:1: Five categories of people cannot consecrate heave and if they did it anyhow, their actions are null and void: the deaf-and-dumb, the insane, minors, one who is not the owner, and a non-Jew.” The sixth Mishnah then reads: Five categories of people should not consecrate heave (since a priori it requires the recitation of a benediction) but if they did it anyhow their actions are valid: the speechless, the drunk, the naked, the blind, those impure by emission of semen.” In between it is explained that חֵרֵשׁ means a deaf-and-dumb person who is not legally capable of acting but that the deaf who can talk belongs to the same category as the second group of five.</i> and did not include it, because their heave is no heave. Then we have stated the five later ones and did not include it. So in the end you must say, that one is by Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, Mishnah <i>Terumot</i> 1:2, explaining that the deaf person who is able to speak can give heave, has to be formulated separately and could not be included in <i>Terumot</i> 1:6 since the first and sixths Mishnayot are Rebbi Yose’s who will object to the inclusion of the deaf person in the second group but not to that of the speechless.</i>.
“Rebbi Jehudah qualifies the underage.” “Rebbi Jehudah said, I was a minor and read it in front of Rebbi Tarphon at Lydda. They said to him, you were a minor and there is no testimony from minors. Rebbi said, it happened and I read it in the presence of Rebbi Jehudah at Usha. They said to him, that is no proof since he is the one who permits it.” From then on the public used to read it in the synagogue<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">If one reads הָרַבִּים then it means that one chooses to make a synagogal act out of reading the Esther scroll (replacing the earlier private ceremonies), since then the Scroll would be read by the communal חָזָן who certainly is an adult.

A stronger implication, agreed to by all tannaitic authorities, is a “parallel expression”. The technical term is <i>equal cut</i>. The formal definition of the school of R. Ismael is that if one has a tradition that two equal or synonymous expressions are written in the Torah for purposes of comparison and if these two words are not used for any other inference, then all laws connected with one word apply to the other and vice-versa. The derivation here does not fulfill these conditions; hence, it is labelled to follow the rules of R. Aqiba who is not known to require too much formality in case the verse is used to give a biblical base to an old tradition.</i>. Just as the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction before, so the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction before. And just as the Name that is mentioned concerning food implies a benediction after, so the Name that is mentioned concerning Torah implies a benediction after. That follows Rebbi Aqiba. How following Rebbi Ismael<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The rules of R.

Joḥanan only and points out that the application here is not justified since it is self-contradictory. The Yerushalmi seems to be of the opinion that in the formulation given here, with “not more stringent” instead of “less stringent”, the argument is logically admissible.</i>. If food that needs no explicit benediction before, needs a benediction afterwards, regarding Torah which needs a benediction before, it is only logical that it should need a benediction afterwards. That works for Torah; what about food? If Torah which needs no benediction afterwards, needs a benediction before, regarding food which needs a benediction afterwards, it is only logical that it should need a benediction before.

The switch from third to first person is awkward in any case. In the Babli (in particular, in the Sephardic incunabula print) it is spelled out: Do not read וּבֵרַךְ <i>He will bless</i> but וּבָרֵךְ “and praise”. The Bible Concordance of G. Lisowsky (Stuttgart 1958) takes the verse, as it stands, to mean <i>You shall serve the Eternal, your God, and praise for your bread and your water, then I will remove sickness from your midst</i>. One may recite a benediction on one’s bread and one’s water only before it is consumed; afterwards one may speak only of nourishment and sustenance.</i>. Rebbi said, if he has to give praise when he ate and is satiated, so much more at a time when he is hungry for food. That is for food, what about Torah? If food, which sustains only temporary life, needs a benediction before and after, Torah, which sustains eternal life, so much more<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli and the Mekhilta this is an argument of Rebbi Ismael.</i>.
Rebbi Ze`ira asked: These three that are called<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The minimum number of people called to read the Torah in public. Since the preceding arguments tied benedictions over Torah reading to Grace, one has to ask in which way they are comparable. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 21b" href="/Megillah.21b">Babli 21b</a> there is a baraita: “(In reading the Torah) he who starts recites the benediction before and he who finishes recites the benediction after.” On that, the Gemara notes: But today, all recite benedictions before and after. Tthe baraita seems to represent early Babylonian practice; we do not know of any direct Yerushalmi source that let people read the Torah without benediction. Rebbi Ze`ira, the Galilean head of academy who had come from Babylonia, is the right person to ask for the reasons and the correct practice. Since his questions remain without answers, both practices might be acceptable.</i>, how are you treating them? As three who ate together or as three who ate each one for himself? If you treat them as three who ate together then the first one recites the benediction before, the last one recites the benediction after, and the middle one does not recite any benediction at all. If you treat them as three who ate each one for himself then even the middle one recites benedictions before and after. Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, they did learn the benedictions for the Torah from Grace only in public<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">R. Samuel ben Eudaimon seems to object to reciting a benediction after Torah study. Also, since Torah study is a permanent obligation (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Joshua 1:8" href="/Joshua.1.8"><i>Jos</i>. 1:8</a>) one benediction in the morning is enough to cover all Torah study during the day and evening; one does not have to recite a new benediction for study after an interruption.</i>. If in public, then in private one should not recite any benediction! Rebbi Abba Mari, the brother of Rebbi Yose, said: They made it equal to other commandments of the Torah. Just as other commandments of the Torah need benedictions, this also needs a benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Most commandments need only a benediction before, not after their execution. Thus, the benediction for the Torah in private study follows the general rule of benedictions over commandments. The quote for benediction for the Torah before the reading, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 32:3" href="/Deuteronomy.32.3"><i>Deut</i>. 32:3</a>, is clearly addressed to the public and, therefore, not applicable to private study.</i>.

He said to them, how long are you making the Torah out of bald spots<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">He required that every one reading in the Torah pronounce the benedictions before and after.

The text of Maimonides is פּוֹרֵשׂ “to spread out”; he interprets “spreading out the <i>Shema`</i>” as the regular synagogue service leading to the public recitation of the <i>Shema`</i> and the following <i>Amidah</i>.

The answer is that for purely religious obligation a person is an adult as soon as he grows two pubic hairs, but for public standing it also is required that he be 13 years and one day. If he grows 2 pubic hairs while only 12 years old, he might be able to spread out the <i>Shema`</i> but he cannot stand before the Ark.</i>.
