Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Seven days before the Day of Atonement one isolates the High Priest from his house<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning his wife, as explained later in the Mishnah. To prevent him from becoming impure should the wife become impure by menstruation.</i> to the Parhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the Halakhah the name also appears as פלהדרין with change of liquids. Possibly derived from πάρεδρος, ὁ, “adjunct”; cf. Note 113.</i> lodge and one prepares another Cohen because he might become disqualified<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since the entire Temple service of the Day of Atonement has to be performed by the High Priest himself, there must be somebody trained to act as High Priest in case the officiating one becomes somehow impure and unable to continue.</i>. Rebbi Jehudah says, one also prepares for him another wife, since maybe his wife would die, for it is said, <i>he shall atone for himself and his house</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:6.</i><i>,</i> his house means his wife. The Sages said to him, in this case the procedure never ends<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since the substitute wife also could die, one would need an unlimited supply of wives, but the High Priest is biblically restricted to one wife. Disqualification can be foreseen, death cannot be foreseen.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Seven days before the Day of Atonement,” etc. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan understood if<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That the separation of the High Priest from his wife for seven days has some biblical justification. A much shorter version covering both interpretations given here is in <i>Sifra Ṣaw, Mekhilta de Milluim</i> 37; differently Babli 2a.</i> from the following: <i>As he did on that day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 8:34, referring to the dedication of the Tabernacle, where Aaron and his sons spent seven full days, day and night, at the Tabernacle, far from their families.</i><i>,</i> these are the seven days of initiation. <i>Did the Eternal command</i> for future generations<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Chapter starts with God’s commandment to inaugurate the Tabernacle, the mention here of God’s commandment is redundant and may be interpreted as a new commandment for future generations.</i>. <i>To make,</i> this is the goat of the Day of Atonement<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The verb עשׂה is used in <i>Lev.</i> 16:15 for the blood of the goat sacrificed on the Day of Atonement. The same verb also is used in 9:7 with reference to the goat sacrificed on the eighth day of dedication which happened to be the first of the first month.</i>. Or maybe it is the goat of a New Moon? Rebbi Abba said, <i>to atone for you,</i> an atonement which is like the other. Since the one<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The dedication ceremony, where Aaron had to bring an atoning sacrifice separate from that for his sons and the people, the other is the Day of Atonement where the same is true.</i> is atonement of Aaron himself and his sons themselves, the other also must be atonement of Aaron himself and his sons themselves
Rebbi Jonah in the name of Bar Qappara understood it from the following. <i>As he did on that day,</i> these are the seven days of initiation. <i>Did the Eternal command,</i> this is burning of the Cow<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The priest in charge of burning the Red Cow to produce the ashes which cleanse from the impurity of the dead also had to be separated for seven days (Mishnah <i>Parah</i> 3:1).</i>. It is said here, <i>did the Eternal command,</i> and it is said there<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Num.</i> 19:2.</i>, <i>this is the low of the Torah which the Eternal commanded, saying.” To make,</i> this is the goat of the Day of Atonement<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The dedication ceremony, where Aaron had to bring an atoning sacrifice separate from that for his sons and the people, the other is the Day of Atonement where the same is true.</i>. Or maybe it is the goat of a New Moon? As Rebbi Abba said, <i>to atone for you,</i> an atonement which is like the other. Since the one is atonement valid only through the High Priest, the other also<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The ceremonies of the Day of Atonement detailed in <i>Lev.</i> 16 refer exclusively to actions by the High Priest. Babli 3b.</i> is atonement through the High Priest.
What is the difference between the Cohen who burns the Cow and the High Priest on the Day of Atonement? The separation of the first is for purity and his brothers the priests refrain from touching him. The separation of the other is for holiness and his brothers the priests touch him. In the opinion of Rebbi Joḥanan, who infers<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the preceding text, one has to read “does not infer” since in the explanation attributed to R. Joḥanan, burning of the Cow is not mentioned. (In the Babli 2a, an argument close to that of Bar Qappara here is attributed to R. Joḥanan, but this should be irrelevant for the study of the Yerushalmi.)</i> from that verse, [it is exceptional for the Cow, it is an embellishment for the Cow<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The separation of the priest who will burn the Cow is purely rabbinical; Tosephta <i>Parah</i> 3:1.</i>, one understands it. In the opinion of Bar Qappara who does not infer<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Here one has to read: “who infers.”</i> it from this verse], why does one touch here but not touch there? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, that his brothers the priests should not make him impure. [But will he not be impure because of his sprinkling<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is to be presumed that the Cohen selected to burn the Cow was pure, water with ashes from prior Cows will make him impure <i>(Sifry Num.</i> 129). But this impurity is minor, it can be removed by immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> and the following sundown. It is obvious that no sprinkling can be done on the day of the burning.<br>In fact, a Pharisee Cohen burning the Cow is made impure and has to cleanse himself in a <i>miqweh</i> on the day of the ceremony because of a quarrel with Sadducees, Mishnah <i>Parah</i> 3:7.</i>?] Rebbi Abun said, even Bar Qappara holds that it is exceptional for the Cow, it is an embellishment for the Cow<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody agrees that the rules for the Cohen burning the Cow are purely rabbinical, not accepted by Sadducees, and bar Qappara’s mention of the burning of the Cow is a far-fetched simile, not an authoritative interpretation of the verse.</i>.
Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked before Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 3b.</i>: But since the he-goat of initiation obstructs, does the he-goat of the Day of Atonement also obstruct<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In the ceremonies for the eighth day of initiation, the commandment to Aaron to take a bull and a he-goat (<i>Lev.</i> 9:2) is one unit; there could be no bull without a he-goat. But in Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i> 4:2 it is stated that for all holiday sacrifices bulls and he-goats are independent of one another. If the rules of the Day of Atonement are derived from the rules of the initiation rites, the Mishnah would have to state an exception for the Day of Atonement.</i>? And he accepted it from him<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The rules of the Day of Atonement cannot be derived from the rules of the initiation rites.</i>. [On that Rebbi Mana said, I am wondering how could Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish ask before Rebbi Joḥanan and he accepted it from him?] Should he not have objected to him that we do not find that anything obstructing can be inferred from anything not obstructing, nor can anything not obstructing be inferred from anything obstructing? “He breaks the neck”, “to burn in smoke”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In the rules of the elevation offering of a bird <i>(Lev.</i> 1:15), in the same verse it is required that the Cohen break the neck of the bird and burn it in smoke on the altar.</i>. Since (breaking the neck)<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This must read: “burning in smoke”.</i> is done on top of the altar, so (breaking the neck) [burning in smoke]<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The text in parentheses was first written by the scribe, the text in brackets is the correction. The original text in parentheses is the correct one. <i>Sifra Wayyiqra</i> I <i>Parshata</i> 7(4).</i> is done on the top of the altar. Breaking the neck obstructs, burning in smoke does not obstruct<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">If the sacrifice would become impure and disqualified after the breaking of the neck but before the burning, the offerer has fulfilled his vow and it is not necessary to bring a second sacrifice.</i>. “Permanently,” [“permanently].” “Permanently” is mentioned for the pan-baked breads<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore one part of R. Mana’s objection has been shown to be invalid.<br>The daily offering of the High Priest <i>(Lev.</i> 6:12–16), a tenth of an <i>epha</i> of fine flour baked into “breads” (v. 14) without a specified number. “Permanent” is stated in v. 13.</i> and “permanently” is mentioned for the shew-bread<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The shew-bread is specified as 12 loaves, <i>Lev.</i> 24:5. The arrangement is called “permanent” in v. 24:8.</i>.] The shew-breads are obstructive, the pan-baked breads are not obstructive. Since [“permanently” mentioned for the pan-baked breads refers to twelve,] so “permanently” mentioned [for the shew-bread refers to twelve<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">It is obvious that here also one has to switch the places of “shew-bread” and “panbaked breads”. The number of breads of the High Priest is fixed as 12 in Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i> 6:5, but a deviation from this number invalidates only shew-bread, not the High Priest’s offering.</i>. “Taking”, “taking”. “Taking” mentioned in Egypt<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex.</i> 12:22, the commandment to take “a bundle of hyssop”.</i>, “taking” is mentioned for <i>lulav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 23;40, the commandment to take 4 kinds of plants; it is not mentioned that they must be tied as a bundle.</i><i>.</i> [Since “taking” mentioned in Egypt implies a bundle<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In the Babli <i>Sukkah</i> 11b, and <i>Sifra Emor Pereq</i> 16(1), this is rejected as R. Jehudah’s minority opinion.</i>, so also “taking” mentioned for <i>lulav</i> implies a bundle<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Both of R. Mana’s objections were disregarded by Tannaim; R. Simeon ben Laqish is justified.</i>.] For the <i>lulav</i> it obstructs, in Egypt it did not obstruct. Therefore we found things obstructing can be inferred from anything not obstructing, and things not obstructing can be inferred from anything obstructing<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 4a.</i>.
Since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish has this objection, from where does Rebbi Simeon derive it<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The rule that the High Priest is separated from his family for seven days before the Day of Atonement.</i>? Following that of Rebbi Ismael:<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 4a.</i> <i>With this Aaron shall come into the Sanctuary</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:3.</i><i>,</i> what was said in the matter<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Of Aaron’s induction into the High Priesthood.</i>. One separates him all of seven days, he serves all of seven days, and one initiates him all of seven days. Also in this case one separates him all of seven days, he serves all of seven days, and one initiates him all of seven days. Is that spelled out in the matter? But since the death of Aaron’s sons is mentioned in the matter<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:1.</i> and they died during the initiation, it is as if the matter was mentioned. Does not in the end Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish understand it from the same verse<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">He still has to explain the same verse used by R. Joḥanan and Bar Qappara, which he himself proved to be inadequate.</i>? But he is like a person who hears a statement and questions it. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, the reason of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish is: <i>the glory of the Eternal was dwelling on Mount Sinai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex.</i> 24:16.</i><i>.</i> Just as Moses did not enter the Holiest of Holies before he was sanctified in the cloud all of seven days, so Aaron did not enter the Holiest of Holies before he was inducted by the anointing oil all of seven days<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It is not a biblical requirement but popular usage supported by an aggadic argument.</i>.
In Rebbi Joḥanan’s opinion, why is the death of Aaron’s sons mentioned in the matter when they died during initiation? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, Aaron’s sons died on the First of Nisan; why does He mention their death at the Day of Atonement<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:1.</i>? To teach you that just as the Day of Atonement atones for Israel, so the death of the Just atones for Israel. Rebbi Ba bar Binah said, why did the verse append the death of Miriam to the Chapter of the Cow<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The rules of the Red Cow and purification from the impurity of the dead are given in <i>Num.</i> 19; the death of Miriam is noted in v. 20:1.</i>? To teach you that just as the ashes of the Cow atone for Israel, so the death of the Just atones for Israel. Rebbi Yudan bar Shalom said, why did the verse append the death of Aaron to the breaking of the Tablets<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The breaking of the Tablets and the story of the Golden Calf are quoted in <i>Deut.</i>9:7–29; Aaron’s death is mentioned in 10:6 in a verse which requires further explanation, given in the next paragraph without reference to the Day of Atonement. <i>Lev. rabba</i> 20, end.</i>? To teach you that the death of the Just is as hard for the Holy One, praise to Him, as the breaking of the Tablets.
<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For this Aggada and more aggadic parts in this Tractate there exists a Medieval copy in the <i>Qonteros Aḥaron</i> of <i>Yalqut Shimˋony</i> reproduced by L. Ginsberg in his <i>Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah,</i> pp. 311–313, referred to by Q. A short parallel is in the Babli, <i>Roš Haššanah</i> 3a; parallels are in <i>Mekhilta dR. Ismael Bešallaḥ, Masekhta de Wayassa</i> 1; <i>Tanḥuma Ḥuqqat</i> 18. The entire paragraph is discussed by Rashi in his Commentary to <i>Num.</i> 26:13.</i> It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deut.</i> 10:6. According to <i>Num.,</i> he did not die at Mosera and never was buried. In the text, the word [אל] has been added from the masoretic text and Q.</i>: <i>and the Children of Israel travelled from the wells of Bene Yaaqon to Mosera; there Aaron died.</i> Did Aaron die at Mosera? Did he not die on Mount Hor? This is what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Num.</i> 33:38.</i>, <i>Aaron the Priest ascended</i><i>Mount Hor by the order of the Eternal and died there.</i> But when Aaron died, the clouds of glory<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Who had covered the Israelites’ camp from the moment of the Exodus.</i> disappeared and the Canaanites wanted to attack them. This is what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Num.</i>21:1.</i>, <i>the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who was dwelling in the Negev, heard that Israel came in the way of Atarim, and made war against Israel.</i> What means <i>“in the way of Atarim”?</i> That the great scout had died who had scouted the way for them. They came and attacked them. Then Israel wanted to return to Egypt and returned eight travel stations<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As enumerated in <i>Num.</i> 33.</i>. The tribe of Levi ran after them and killed from them eight families<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In Q: “16 families”.</i>. Also they killed from them four families, <sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">A redundant verse in <i>1Chr.</i> 26:23. (See Rashi, quoted in Note 44).</i><i>for the Amramite, the Yisharite, the Ḥevronite, the Uzzielite.</i> When did they recover? In the days of David. This is what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ps.</i> 72:6.</i>, <i>in his days the just may bloom, immense peace, without moon-periods.</i> They said, what caused us all this bloodshed? They said, because we did not show compassion for this perfect person<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">To organize due eulogies. In this context, גְּמִילוּת חֶסֶד means services to the living or the dead by a person himself, which cannot be bought by money.</i>. They sat down, organized his eulogies, and showed compassion for this Just; then the Omnipresent credited them as if he had died there, was buried there, and they showed compassion for the perfect person.
Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, the tenth of an <i>ephah</i> and breeches obstruct<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The presentation of twelve breads which is the daily offering of the High Priest (Note 26) and the initiation of offering of a common priest <i>(Lev.</i> 6:13) as well as the breeches which are part of the priests’ holy garments <i>(Ex.</i> 28:42–43), even though they are mentioned neither in the instructions for the initiation rites given to Moses <i>(Ex.</i> 28) nor in the record of the execution of these instructions <i>(Lev.</i> 8), are necessary and the omission of the offering or failure to wear the breeches would have invalidated the entire proceedings. Babli 5b.</i>. What is the reason? Both are “making”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">It is held that every commandment using the verb עשה requires strict adherence to the rules given by this verb. The verb is used for the initiation of a priest in <i>Lev.</i>6:14, for the high priest in <i>Lev.</i> 6:15, and Moses is ordered to “make breeches” for the priests in <i>Ex.</i> 28:42.</i>. Rebbi Ḥanina said, <i>and do with Aaron and his sons so</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex.</i> 29:35. The verse continues, <i>all that I commanded you.</i></i><i>,</i> all which is written in the Chapter obstructs. This comes following what Rebbi Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: <i>this is the word</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 8:5, the declaration of Moses to the people explaining the initiation rites.</i><i>, and this is the word</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex.</i> 29:1, the instruction for future initiation rites.</i><i>,</i> even reading the Chapter obstructs. Rebbi Joḥanan said, anything obstructing for future generations obstructs here, [and anything not obstructing for future generations does not obstruct here.] What do you have? The leaning of hands<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The leaning of hands of Aaron and his sons on the heads of the sacrificial animals <i>(Ex.</i> 29:10,15,19) which for the initiation rites is an essential act but in the rules of sacrifices <i>(Lev.</i> 1–5) is prescribed only for private offerings, and in no case would the failure to follow the requirement disqualify the sacrifice.</i> and the remainders of the blood<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The remainder of the blood collected by the Cohen after the required sprinkling of blood on the altar walls has to be poured into the base of the altar. But this act is not required for validity of the sacrifice; if the blood becomes impure after the sprinkling, the blood has to be otherwise disposed of but the sacrifice is unquestionably valid. These cases represent the points of difference between R. Ḥanina and R. Joḥanan. Babli 4b (bottom), switching attributions.</i> which are not obstructing in future generations are obstructing here. Rebbi Ḥanina said, the diadem and Aaron’s mitre precede the sons’ belts<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In dressing of the priests in initiation.</i>. Jehudah the great says, <i>you shall gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex.</i> 29:9, the commandment to Moses.</i><i>.</i> Rebbi Idi said, what you are saying is as a meritorious deed. But as a commandment, <i>Moses brought near Aaron and his sons and washed them in water,</i> and after that, <i>he put the vest on him,</i> and after that, <i>Moses brought Aaron and his sons near and clothed them with shirts</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 8:6,7,13, description of the execution.</i><i>.</i>
Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The only talmudic Sage known of this name is the Tanna, son of R. Yose ben Ḥalaphta. But since he <i>said,</i> not <i>stated,</i> and R. Tanḥum objected that his assertion already was a tannaitic statement, he must be an otherwise unknown Amora.<br>Since Aaron entered the High Priesthood only on the eighth day, Moses must have acted as High Priest during the first seven. Babli <i>Avodah zarah</i> 34a as tannaitic statement.</i> said, it is clear to us that Moses officiated in the High Priesthood in a white robe. Rebbi Tanḥum bar Yudan said, it was stated: <sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Šemini Milluim</i> 14.</i>“All seven days of initiation did Moses officiate in the High Priesthood but the Divine Presence was not drawn through him. When Aaron dressed in the priestly garments and officiated, the Divine Presence was drawn through him.” What is the reason? <i>For today the Eternal will appear to you.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 9:4.</i>
Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina asked, how was the tenth of an <i>epha</i> brought? Was it brought half or [brought] whole<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Since the offering of the High Priest had to be brought half in the morning and half in the evening, but in the morning of the eighth day Aaron was not yet High Priest, the question is whether only the afternoon offering was made or the morning offering later in the morning.</i>? Since it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 9:23.</i>, <i>Moses and Aaron came to the Tent of Meeting,</i> this teaches that he only came with him to teach him the work of incense. [This implies that] half it was brought. If you are saying that it was brought whole, one should have stated, about he work of incense and the tenth of an epha. Rebbi Tanḥum bar Yudan said, are we not concerned with service inside? He already had taught him about service outside<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The breads of the High Priest are burned on the outside altar; no service in the Tent is involved and the prior argument does not prove anything.</i>.
What were the initiation sacrifices? Private sacrifice or public sacrifice? Since it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 8:18.</i>, <i>Aaron and his sons leaned with their hands on the he-goat’s head,</i> it follows that it was private sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Since public sacrifices never need leaning on the sacrificial animal.</i>. But it was stated, public sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Ṣaw Mekhilta deMilluim</i> 13.</i>. Rebbi Idi said, the community volunteered and handed them over to them. From where was initiation deduced<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is written <i>(Lev.</i> 8:35) that Aaron and his sons have to sit at the gate of the Tabernacle “seven days, day and night” All sacrifices which are eaten “one day and one night” may be eaten during the day of the sacrifice and the following night.</i>? From sacrifices or from Creation? If you are saying from sacrifices, the night follows the day. If you are saying from Creation, the day follows the night. If you are saying from sacrifices, the last night has no day<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Since on the eighth day they were permitted to leave the Sanctuary after the completion of services.</i>. If you are saying from Creation, the first day has no night.
<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">One discusses what it means that Aaron and his sons had to sit at the gate of the Tent of Meeting “seven days, day and night”.</i> There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i> 11:7, describing the order in which the shew-bread was removed from the table in the Tent of Meeting on the Sabbath and new bread deposited when the verse prescribes that the shew-bread always be on the table.</i>: “These take away and those put down. And the hand of one is close to the hand of the other, for it is said<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ex.</i> 25:30.</i>, <i>before Me always.”</i> The Mishnah is Rebbi Meïr’s<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is anonymous.</i>. But according to Rebbi Joḥanan does Rebbi Meïr agree that if they removed the old set in the morning and arranged the new set in the evening this is also “always”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">So even according to R. Meïr the arrangement that the twelve shew-breads were exchanged in a ceremony involving 24 priests so that the table should not be empty for one moment is recommended but not absolutely necessary.</i>. “Rebbi Yose says, also these may remove and those put down; for this also is ‘always’.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i> 11:7, describing the order in which the shew-bread was removed from the table in the Tent of Meeting on the Sabbath and new bread deposited when the verse prescribes that the shew-bread always be on the table.</i>” Rebbi Joḥanan said, Rebbi Yose inferred this from the sitting of Aaron and his sons<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is understood that if there is no Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons could not sit at its gate and, as explained in the following paragraph, the Tent was every day (or also every night) disassembled and reerected, the requirement that they sit there “seven days, day and night” could only mean that every day and every night they were sitting there for some time.</i>. As you are saying, at the sitting of Aaron and his sons it was necessary that the day deliver to the night and the night deliver to the day<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">They actually had to be present there only at dusk and dawn.</i>, so here it was necessary that the day deliver to the night and the night deliver to the day. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Yose said, it was sufficient that the day deliver to the night<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">His statement refers to the shew-breads. He reads “always” to mean that there shall be no day on which the table be empty. Since the breads were kept there from Sabbath to Sabbath, he only requires that the new breads be delivered before dusk at the end of the Sabbath.</i>. What does Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Joseph say about the sitting of Aaron and his sons?, Since if there, where it is written “always”, you are saying that it was sufficient that the day deliver to the night, here<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">At the initiation of the priests.</i> where it is not written “always” not so much more? You have to say that in Rebbi Joḥanan’s opinion there were seven erections and six dismantlings<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is shown in the next paragraph that every morning the Tent had to be re-erected, and Aaron and his sons were to be present in the sacred precinct day and night, the Tent was erected on day 1, and on days 2–7 was disassembled and re-erected every morning after dawn.</i>.

Ben Bathyra explained<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">One returns to the discussion of Mishnah 1, explaining why the High Priest has to live in the Temple precinct for seven days prior to the Day of Atonement.

If this Ben Bathyra is the early Tanna (and not the later R. Jehudah ben Bathyra to whom the statement is attributed in the Babli), his argument might be an anti-Sadducee statement, since Sadducees and Pharisees accused one another of sleeping with menstruating women by following their sectarian interpretation of the biblical law; cf. <i>Niddah</i> 4:1 Note 3 (SJ 34).</i>? Following what was stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševuˋot</i> 2:5, Notes 80,81.</i>: “If he was having sex with a pure one and she said to him, I became impure, if he separates immediately he is liable, for his separation is as pleasurable to him as his entry<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">If the wife becomes impure during intercourse, if then he stops moving immediately and separates after the erection has disappeared, he touched an impure woman, has to immerse himself in a <i>miqweh,</i> and becomes totally pure at the next sundown.

Ben Bathyra’s argument presupposes that the High Priest is an ignoramus.</i>.” You have to say that he who transmits the statement of Rebbi Joḥanan needs that of Ben Bathyra, and he who transmits the statement of Rebbi Joḥanan  needs that of Ben Bathyra. If Rebbi Joḥanan  had said but not Ben Bathyra, we would have said that he may have sex but sleep in the Palhedrin lodge; therefore one needs that of Ben Bathyra. If Ben Bathyra had said but not Rebbi Joḥanan , we would have said, let him not have sex but he may sleep in his house; therefore one needs that of Rebbi Joḥanan , and one needs that of Ben Bathyra.
“All lodges which were in the Temple were not liable for <i>mezuzah</i> except for the Palhedrin lodge which was the abode of the High Priest for seven days every year.

Since the service of the Day of Atonement is valid only if performed by the High Priest, the substitute becomes a temporary High Priest. He cannot act as a High Priest if the actual High Priest’s temporary disability is removed, and he is permanently barred from acting as a common priest.

Rebbi Joḥanan  said, if he transgressed and officiated, his officiating is valid. Whose officiating? Let us hear from the following: It happened to Ben Illem from Sepphoris that the High Priest experienced an emission of semen on the Day of Atonement; Ben Illem entered and officiated in his stead.

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi follows his opinion, as Rebbi said, <i>fo</i> r <i>Aaron and his sons,</i> half for Aaron and half for his sons.

Therefore if the High Priest was standing inside the gate, the Mishnah here agrees with the Mishnah there that the first immersion of the High Priest on the Day of Atonement is not connected with the special rules of that day.

They say to him, Sir High Priest, we are the agents of the Court, and you are our agent and the Court’s agent.

And why does one adjure him?

<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 19b, Tosephta 1:8.</i> It happened that one person started the incense outside and brought it inside.

He answered him, even though you were interpreting all our days, we acted only following the will of the Sages. I am wondering whether this man will have many days in the world.

It was not three days before they put him in the grave.”<br>Biblical impurity is only original impurity and derivative impurity in the first degree. Rabbinic impurity has derivative impurity in the second degree for unwashed hands, third degree impurity for heave, and fourth degree for sacrifices. Therefore, the intrinsically pure Ben Zakkai (who before the destruction of the Temple was not Rabban), by putting his second degree impure hands on the priest defiled the latter for <i>sacra</i> and forced him to immerse himself in a <i>miqweh.</i> Our sources seem to describe the Sadducee position correctly; cf.

A priest who poured out the water in contempt of the rite was killed by the <i>etrogim</i>(<i>citrus medica)</i> which the people threw at him.</i>, and on the Day of Atonement. Rebbi Simon does not say so, but either the Cow and Tabernacles was one and Atonement one, or Cow and Atonement was one and Tabernacles one. He who said, after a short time he died, he did all three.

Chapter 2



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Originally, anybody who wanted to remove the ashes<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The ritual removal of some ashes from the altar by a priest in special attire <i>(Lev.</i>6:3), followed by the less formal removal of the remainder of the ashes, <i>Lev.</i> 6:4.</i> from the altar could remove them.

There were four lotteries, and this was the first of them.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Originally, anybody who wanted to remove the ashes from the altar,” etc. Rebbi Mana asked, why did they not establish a lottery for the removal of ashes? Come and see, slaughter is valid by a non-Cohen, but you are saying that there is a lottery<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 2:2.</i>. Removal of ashes is forbidden to a non-Cohen, and you are saying, there is no lottery? Rebbi Mana turned around and said, slaughter is valid only during daytime, but the removal of ashes is valid during the entire night. If you are saying that there is a lottery, he will not get up early for the doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If the chances are slim that he will be able to serve, no Cohen will show up for the night duty.

A non-Cohen who removed<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The formal removal of ashes from the altar.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan said, he is liable. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, he is not liable. What is Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish’s reason? <i>Service of bringing</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Num.</i> 18:7.</i><i>.</i> This excludes what is a removal. What is Rebbi Joḥanan ’s reason? <i>Anything concerning the altar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Num.</i> 18:7.</i><i>.</i> Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rav: The four kinds of service for which a Cohen would be liable if done outside<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Outside a divinely approved place of worship; after the building of the Temple, outside of the Temple district. Worship outside the Temple is sinful only if it imitates Temple ceremonies. Babli 24a.</i>, the non-Cohen is liable for inside. What are these? Burning incense, and pouring blood, and making libations of water and wine. This follows Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. Levi said, even removal of the ashes;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 24a.</i> this follows Rebbi Joḥanan. If he<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The non-Cohen.</i> stirred the coals, the disagreement of Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish. If he<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The non-Cohen.</i> removed the remainder of the ashes, the disagreement of Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, following him who said, <i>others</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 6:4. <i>Sifra Ṣaw Pereq</i> 2(6).</i>, of lesser value than these. But for him<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Sifra,</i> R. Eleazar (the Tanna.)</i> who said <i>others,</i> to include people with bodily defects, there is no difference between a Cohen with a bodily defect and a non-Cohen. Everybody agreed that the non-Cohen who arranged the woods<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The logs of firewood on the altar.</i> is liable. Rebbi Zeˋira said, but only for the two logs on which the verse insists that they are Cohen’s service: <i>Aaron’s the priest’s</i> <i>sons shall put fire on the altar and arrange woods</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 1:7. Since a simple plural always means 2 (Note 138); this establishes a formal requirement that two new logs be brought to the altar at the start of the morning service; <i>Lev.</i> 6:5. Babli 24b.</i><i>.</i>
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra Ṣaw Pereq</i> 2(7).; Babli 24b,45a.</i> “Rebbi Jehudah said, from where that kindling fire wood<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi’s explanation.</i> may only be done by a qualified Cohen and with a vessel of service<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The firewood had to be transported in a dedicated vessel.</i>? The verse says, <i>Aaron’s the priest’s sons shall put fire on the altar.</i> Rebbi Simeon said, could anybody think that a non-Cohen might approach the top of the altar? Then why is it said, <i>Aaron’s the priest’s sons shall put fire on the altar?</i> This teaches that kindling the fire may only be done on top of the altar” They objected, is it not written <i>“and the fire on the altar shall burn there, it shall not go out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 6:5.</i><i>,</i> from here that kindling the fire may only be done on top of the altar, the words of Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 45a.</i>”? The argument of Rebbi Jehudah is inverted. There it needs a qualified Cohen, but here it does not need a qualified Cohen. Rebbi Tanḥum bar Yudan said, what do you understand from here? Could we say on top of the altar and a non-Cohen<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since it already was stated that no non-Cohen could be present at the altar, a mention of “Cohen” was superfluous in the second case.</i>?
If he removed and the wind blew it away<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Does one have to lift a second time?</i>, the disagreement between Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Ḥanina, since Rebbi Ḥanina said, if a fistful<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A flour offering after dedication is most holy, all use is forbidden as larceny of <i>sancta.</i> The priest has to take a fistful of the flour mixed with oil, bring it to the top of the altar in a dedicated vessel, and empty the vessel into the fire.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, if<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning; <i>only if.</i> Babli <i>Menaḥot</i>26b.</i> the fire engulfed most of it. What means “most of it”? Most of the fistful, or had it been said about most of each separate lump? There came Rebbi Ḥizqiah, Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya, in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It had been said about most of each separate lump.
If he lifted half of it, the disagreement between Rebbi Joḥanan and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, since Rebbi Joḥanan said, if the fistful had been sanctified in a vessel, he did his duty if he burned even a sesame grain’s size of it. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menaḥot</i>3:4, Babli <i>Menaḥot</i>26a.</i> does not say so, only if he burned his fistful in two parts it is qualified. Rebbi Ḥama bar Uqba in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: A fistful is not less than the volume of two olives, no burning is less than the volume of (a fistful) [an olive]<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menaḥot</i>26b. The corrector’s change is suspect as adaptation to the Babli.</i>. Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar asked, then a Cohen whose hand could not hold the volume of two olives would be disqualified from the service<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since this disability does not appear in a list of defects which disqualify a Cohen, practice cannot follow R. Joshua ben Levi.</i>?
If he removed with his left hand, the disagreement between Rebbi Joḥanan and Jehudah ben Rebbi, since Rebbi Joḥanan said, if a fistful<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Of the flour offering.</i> had been sanctified in a dedicated vessel and he burned it whether out of his hand or out of a vessel, whether by his right hand or by the left. Jehudah ben Rebbi said, either like a purification offering from the hand, or like a reparation offering from a vessel, but only with the right hand<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Lev.</i> 6:10 it is stated that the flour offering is “most holy, like purification offering and like reparation offering.” For purification offerings it is stated (<i>Lev.</i>4:25, 30, 34) that the Cohen has to apply the blood of the sacrifice <i>with his finger</i> to the corners of the altar. This requirement is missing for the reparation sacrifice (<i>Lev.</i>7:1–7.)</i>. They objected: Was it not stated, if he received with his right hand and then put it into his left hand, he must return it to the right hand<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Zevaḥim</i> 3:1, <i>Zevaḥim</i> 32a, speaking of the blood received in a vessel and brought to the altar to be poured at the wall.</i>? If from the left hand he returns it for the altar, not so much more to the cup? Rebbi La said, if somebody stated this, Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon stated it. As it was stated, it<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The fistful taken from a flour offering.</i> does not need sanctification in a cup. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Simeon follows the argument of his father Rebbi Simeon, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i>3:4.</i>, “not in a dedicated vessel it is disqualified, but Rebbi Simeon qualifies it.” How is it? The rabbis who require a dedicated vessel need the right hand<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menaḥot</i>26b.</i>; Rebbi Simeon [who] does not require a dedicated vessel does not need the right hand. Rebbi Mana said, I am wondering how the rabbis could compare the removal of ashes to burning, but it can be compared only to the lifting of the fistful, since both are by lifting<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since everybody agrees that at all places where the verse requires that the action be done by a Cohen he must use his right hand; therefore the lifting of the fistful must be with the Cohen’s right hand.</i>.

There is no lifting unless he left a remainder<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise the verse would have said, “he takes away”.</i>. <i>Which ate.</i> there is no eating less than the volume of an olive. If all of it<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The ashes on the altar.</i> was the volume of an olive? You may not take part of it since there would not be the volume of an olive; you may not take all of it since there would not be a remainder. <i>And he lifts … what the fire ate.</i> I could think wood, the verse says, the elevation sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads: <i>He shall lift the ashes from where the fire ate the elevation sacrifice on the altar.</i></i>. If elevation sacrifice, I could think limbs of an elevation sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Parts of the daily sacrifice which still are recognizable as such.</i>; the verse says, <i>what the fire ate.</i> How is this? He scoops up from what has been consumed in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Where it is most likely from the sacrifice, not the fire wood. <i>Sifra Ṣaw Pereq</i> 2(4).</i> and descends. It is an obligation to bring wood before fire, as it is said<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 1:7.</i>, <i>they shall arrange on the</i><i>fire,</i> He mentioned wood before fire. If one arranged before he removed, he throws down and removes, disassembles and removes<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since it has been stated that the removal of ashes is first in the service of a new day, and arranging new logs precedes the morning daily sacrifice, any arrangement preceding the removal of ashes is simply addition to the preceding day’s service and may be undone for the new day. <i>Sifra Wayyiqra</i> I <i>Pereq</i> 5(11).</i>.
Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Hilfai asked: What is the status of a fistful given on the setting of the night<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">It is a biblical commandment that all leftovers from the service of a certain day have to be burned on the altar during the following night. Therefore the question has to be, what is the status of the next morning’s flour offering which was brought to the altar at dawn before the required new wood was formally brought to the altar after the removal of the previous day’s ashes.</i>? Rebbi Jeremiah said, Hilfai asked: What is the status of the public parts on the setting of the night<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The same question as before, only referring to the parts of the sacrificial animals brought before the ritual setting of new logs in the morning.

Its topic is the interpretation of prescriptive biblical verses in the absence of numerical data. The theory expounded here is what the author has called the axiom of definiteness: Biblical language in legal contexts is definite (H. Guggenheimer, <i>Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition,</i> in: Confrontations with Judaism, Ph. Longworth ed., London 1966., pp. 171–196, in particular pp. 174–175.) In the situation considered here it is noted that the set of numbers &gt;1 has a smallest element, 2, but no largest one. Therefore an indefinite plural used in a biblical law must mean 2, otherwise the meaning would not be definite. This is applied to the laws of <i>zava,</i> a woman impure by non-menstrual blood flow for <i>many days.</i> By the principle of definiteness this means that days are 2, the number of <i>many days</i> is the smallest number &gt;2, or 3.</i> Rebbi Aqiba said, anywhere you could understand many or you could understand few, if you took the many you took nothing, if you took few you took<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Babli <i>Megillah</i> 17a, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5a.</i>.

I could think that <i>days</i> are many. If they are many, why is it said, <i>many?</i> Therefore the verse only spoke of few days. How much are they? It means two; <i>many</i> are three. I could think that <i>many (days)</i> means ten. It says <i>days</i> and it says <i>many.</i> Since the minimum of <i>days</i> are two, so for <i>many,</i> the minimum of many are three. I could think that two and three make five. But is it said, <i>days [and many]?</i> It only is said, <i>many days.</i> How is this? These <i>many</i> should be more than two. How many are they?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Why did they need this?

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Nobody enters the courtyard to serve, even if he was pure, unless he immerses himself. Five immersions and ten sanctifications did the High Priest immerse himself and sanctify on that day, and all of them in the Sanctuary in the Parwa house<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">A subterranean cave inside the walls enclosing the sacred domain. The Babli declares “Parwa” to be the name of a magus or sorcerer.</i>, except this one alone<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah states that nobody can enter the sacred domain for service unless he immersed himself in water outside the sacred domain, it is obvious that before serving the High Priest also must immerse himself in a <i>miqweh</i> on the Temple Mount but outside the sacred domain</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> So is the Mishnah: No person did enter the courtyard or for service<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Nobody, Cohen or lay person, could enter the sacred domain without ablution. But the Cohen who entered not for service could not start to serve until he underwent a second immersion.</i>, [even if he was pure,] unless he immerses himself. Not only for service but also not for service.
They asked Ben Zoma, where does this immersion come from<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Which does not seem to be biblical.</i>? He said to them, since when he enters the holy from the holy he needs immersion<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As stated later in the Mishnah, if the High Priest changes from his 8 garments used for service outside to white garments used inside the Sanctuary he both immerses himself and sanctifies hands and legs.</i>, from profane to holy so much more?

Rebbi Shammai said, it is the following. Since from holy to holy where he is not subject to extirpation<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">If he is pure when entering the Sanctuary but becomes impure inside, if he leaves immediately he is not subject to extirpation (Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 2:4.)</i> he needs immersion, from profane to holy where he is subject to extirpation<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">If he enters the sacred domain while impure, he is subject to extirpation.</i> not so much more that he should need immersion? And even from holy to holy he should be subject to extirpation, following what we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 2:4.</i>: “If he prostrated himself,or tarried that he could have prostrated himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">While impure, he is subject to extirpation.</i>” What is the duration of prostration? Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ševuot</i> 2:4, he gives a much shorter time frame. The criterion given here, the time necessary to recite half or all of the verse, is the one given by the Babli <i>Ševuot</i>16b in the name of other Galilean authorities.</i>, [as long as] <sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>2Chr.</i> 7:3.</i><i>they bowed down with their faces on the floor and prostrated themselves.</i> Rebbi Abbahu adds, <i>thanking the Eternal for He is good,</i> Rebbi Mana adds, <i>His grace is forever.</i>
It was stated: <sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 30a.</i> Rebbi Jehudah says, they instituted this immersion only as immersion of discipline, for sometimes when a person goes to wash he remembers an old emission of semen which he had and turns back<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In itself this immersion is useless. If a person actually is impure, he is forbidden to partake of <i>sancta</i> and to enter the sacred domain. Immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> will remove the impurity but the disability regarding <i>sancta</i> and the sacred domain is removed only by the following sundown (<i>Lev.</i> 22:7). Therefore immersion in the morning is only for pure persons; for R. Jehudah it is instituted so people should not inadvertently enter the sacred domain while still not qualified for it.</i>. There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Berakhot</i> 3:6. The Mishnah is truncated; the full text explains the plural form of the verb: “The person with gonorrhea who had an emission of semen, as well as a menstruating woman who lost semen, and the woman who started menstruating while having intercourse, need immersion, but Rebbi Jehudah declares them not liable.”<br>An emission of semen pollutes, but it is a minor impurity which is removed by immersion in water and, for <i>sancta,</i> the following sundown. But gonorrhea and menstruation cause severe impurity for which immersion is possible only after seven days (<i>Lev.</i> 15:13,19). An immersion because of emission, before the time where immersion for the severe impurity is possible, is totally ineffective.<br>A different version of the following discussion is in <i>Berakhot</i> 3:6, Notes 260–264.</i>: “the woman who started menstruating while having intercourse, needs immersion, but Rebbi Jehudah declares them not liable.” Why does Rebbi Jehudah disagree? Is it about immersion of discipline or because even if he immerses himself what would be its use? What is the difference? If he<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The male sufferer from gonorrhea, mentioned in the Mishnah. He had an emission before he started suffering from gonorrhea. He was obligated for an immersion before he became severely impure.</i> had an emission. If you say that Rebbi Jehudah disagrees about immersion of discipline, it is a word of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 15:16.</i>. If you say, even if he immerses himself, what would be its use? It is useful that he immerse himself, as it was stated, Rebbi Jehudah says, they instituted this immersion only as immersion of discipline, for sometimes when a person goes to wash he remembers an old emission of semen which he had and turns back. This implies that Rebbi Jehudah did not disagree about immersion of discipline but because even if he immerses himself, what would be its use?

If the he-goat for outside was slaughtered, the main ceremony is concluded <i>Lev</i>. 16:24; the remaining he-goats cannot be sacrifices and their slaughter outside the sacred domain is no offense.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, Rav Ḥisda wants to compare it to <i>Pesaḥ</i> but it is not comparable.

If drawing is obstructive, neither of the two he-goats is a sacrifice before the drawing, and slaughter outside cannot be sinful. But if it is not obstructive, each one of the he-goats is a potential dedicated sacrifice and outside slaughter is sinful.</i>.

Rebbi Samuel the brother of Rebbi Berekhiah said, either one of them, after he drew lots is liable for the Eternal’s and is not liable for Azazel’s<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Since the latter he-goat is not a sacrifice.</i>. Rebbi Abba said, only if he gave the bull’s gift<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">As described in Mishnah 3, the blood of the bull has to be brought inside.

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Zeˋira: If he slaughtered the bull before he drew lots, is he liable<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In the biblical narrative (<i>Lev.</i> 16), first the he-goat has to be selected by drawing lots (v. 8), then the bull has to be slaughtered (v. 11), then first incense (v. 12) and afterwards the bull’s blood (v. 14) have to be brought into the Sanctuary, then the he-goat has to be slaughtered and its blood brought into the sanctuary (v. 15). If the order was reversed and the he-goat selected close to the time of its slaughter, is the ceremony invalid and therefore the slaughter a violation of the prohibition of work on the day of Atonement, and a deadly sin?</i>? He said to him, let us hear from the following: The bull is obstructive of the he-goat, the he-goat is obstructive of the bull<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Slaughter of the bull is invalid unless the he-goat was selected; slaughter of the he-goat is invalid unless the bull was slaughtered first (and its blood brought inside, Babli 61a).</i>. This implies that if he slaughtered the bull before he drew lots, he is liable. If you would say that he is not liable, one should state, the he-goat is not obstructive of the bull. Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, that is to say, the he-goat does not obstruct the bull in giving between the beams, but for giving on the curtain the he-goat is obstructive of the bull. How is this? He may not give of the bull’s blood on the curtain before he gave of the he-goat’s blood between the beams<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The blood has to be sprinkled first inside the Holiest of Holies at the place of the Ark in the First Temple, between the beams used to carry the Ark.

If there was a doubt whether the blood was spilled before he burned the incense or after he burned the incense, you cannot bring another bull and enter with its blood since I am saying that the blood was spilled before he burned the incense and the collection of coals was invalid, and he has to start again collecting coals. You cannot do this since I am saying that the blood was spilled after he burned the incense and the collection of coals was valid, and he is liable because of unnecessary entry.

The verse says, <i>he shall treat its blood as he treated the bull’s blood.</i> Since the bull’s blood is downwards seven times, also the he-goat’s blood is downwards seven times.

While the verse does not detail for what it is atoning, it is concluded in <i>Sifra Wayyiqra I Pereq</i> 4(8) that it is for the transgressions which do not qualify for a purification offering, infraction of positive commandments and of minor prohibitions.

Therefore the distinction made by R. Simeon is not consistent with our rules.</i>? This disagrees with what Rebbi Eleazar said: There are those of them of which they said, one has no usufruct but one does not commit larceny, therefore it one sold them it does not transfer sanctity to the money, and there are those of them of which they said, one has no usufruct but one does not commit larceny, therefore if one sold them it transfers sanctity to the money.

While it is a general principle that a sacrifice which became invalidated never can be reinstated, R.

In Mishnah <i>Temurah</i> 3:3, the majority rules that the replacement of a valid reparation offering and any of its offspring shall be put out to graze until they develop a defect which makes them unfit as sacrifices, then be sold, and the proceeds given to the Temple to be used for additional sacrifices, But R.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> He<sup class="footnote-marker">97*</sup><i class="footnote">The High Priest.</i> comes to the bull and the he-goat to be burned, cut them open and removed the inner parts<sup class="footnote-marker">98*</sup><i class="footnote">Greek μηρία, τά, “thigh bones”, the parts of a sacrifice which have to be burned on the altar.</i>, put then into a basin and burned them on the altar.

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, Rebbi Eleazar asked: If of bulls and he-goats to be burned a limb left which completes a majority<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Babli <i>Zevaḥim</i> 104b. Since it was stated in Mishnah 7 that the carcasses become a source of severe impurity once they are brought outside the enclosure of the Temple courtyards, the question is the determination of the exact point in time when this happens. As stated in the next sentence, it is agreed that a majority of the carcass must have left. The question remains whether the majority is counted atom by atom, which would be impossible to determine exactly, or limb by limb. Since the only practical solution is to count limb by limb, must the limb which completes the majority be totally outside or possibly only partially.</i>? His question implies that the matter depends on a majority. The following is obvious: If most of it left and after this a limb left which completes a majority. [This must be: It left limb by limb and after this a limb left which completes a majority<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding sentence in fact makes no sense.</i>..]<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Addition of the corrector, in good Yerushalmi language.

Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, Rebbi Eleazar asked: If bulls and he-goats to be burned were taken out and brought back<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was established in the previous paragraph that the carcasses are the cause of severe impurity by biblical decree once the majority of the limbs was removed from the Temple precinct, the question necessarily refers to single limbs which do not constitute a majority of the carcass. The question is different in the Babli, <i>Zevaḥim</i>105a.</i>? It is obvious for us that in returning they do not make garments impure<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">A limb even partially taken out of the sacred precinct becomes disqualified. Even if a person other than the carrier who touches a limb while it is taken back may become impure in his person, the impurity does not extend to his clothing since the biblical conditions for this are not satisfied.</i>. What our problem is, do they make garments impure from the moment they started to be brought out<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">As will be seen, the question is about people other than the carriers of the carcass or its limbs. If the carcass was partially taken out but then returned, and a third party touched the body, do his garments become impure?</i>? Rebbi Abba objected, did we not state<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Zevaḥim</i> 12:6.</i>: “They were carrying them on yokes. If the front carriers left the walls of the Temple courtyard while the back carriers did not yet leave, the front carriers make garments impure while the back carriers do not make garments impure until they also leave. After they left, these and those make garments impure.” Rebbi Yudan, Rebbi Mattaniah’s father, said, there is a difference, for it is written, <i>then he shall take out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 4:12, about the purification sacrifice of the anointed priest.</i><i>,</i> until he completely leave the domain from which it is taken out<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">The carriers become impure the moment they are completely outside the wall of the Temple courtyard, but the carcass becomes a source of severe impurity for any who touch it only after it was completely taken out of the sacred domain. The carriers become impure even if they never come in contact with the carcass. The wooden bars on which the carcass is carried do not transmit impurity by touch; the impurity of the carriers is induced by the motion of the carcass, not by contact.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Babli <i>Zevaḥim</i> 104a.</i> Rebbi Jeremiah said, Rebbi Eleazar asked: If bulls and he-goats to be burned became impure, may they still become disqualified for being taken out<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">If the carcasses become impure inside the sacred precinct they automatically are disqualified. Once disqualified they cannot become more disqualified by being taken out. Either with the classical commentaries one has to delete the words “became impure” and (with the Babli) ask whether bulls and he-goats to be burned, for which being taken outside is a biblical commandment at a later stage, can become disqualified by being taken out in a earlier stage, or one restricts the question to the sacrifices of the Day of Atonement which as public sacrifices may be offered in impurity if most of Israel are impure.</i>? What is his problem? Following Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish; but following Rebbi Joḥanan it is obvious for him. For they disagreed: <sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i> 7:3.</i>“If somebody slaughters a thanksgiving sacrifice inside while its bread<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">A thanksgiving offering has to be brought <i>on</i> loaves of leavened bread (<i>Lev.</i>7:13). This is interpreted to mean that the loaves have to be nearby. The question is the definition of “nearby”.</i> is outside the walls, the bread was not sanctified.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, outside the walls of Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Since the thanksgiving sacrifice as a family celebration may be consumed anywhere within the walls of Jerusalem (which takes the place of the camp of the Israelites in the desert), one only requires that the bread be at a place where it may be consumed.</i>; Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, outside the walls of the Temple court.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">He requires that the bread be inside the sacred precinct since the presentation of the sacrifice is possible only there.</i> Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish is consequent in his opinion since Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, meat of well-being offerings which was taken out and then returned, if the blood is poured for it already it is disqualified because of removal<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Well-being sacrifices in general may be eaten in the entire city of Jerusalem (Mishnah <i>Zevaḥim</i> 5:7). Nevertheless, meat taken out of the sacred precinct into the city before its time (i. e., before pouring the blood on the altar walls) disqualifies the entire sacrifice. The same argument can be applied to the case under discussion.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, he questions even according to Rebbi Joḥanan. While Jerusalem is not an enclosure for most holy sacrifices, it is an enclosure for simple sacrifice. Outside the walls of Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Where the bulls and he-goats to be burned have to be brought.</i> it is an enclosure neither for most holy sacrifices nor for simple sacrifices. Rebbi Mana said, it is not an enclosure for them<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joḥanan qualifies the thanksgiving offering if all parts are in the place of their final destination at all times. If this argument is applied to bulls and he-goats to be burned, the walls of Jerusalem become irrelevant.</i>.
Rebbi Eleazar asked, do bulls and he-goats to be burned cause impurity of garments<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">One has to delete this and replace it with “of foodstuffs”. Garments become impure only from sources of severe impurity, but foodstuffs become impure even from impurity which is not transmissible to human bodies or garments. Since the question is asked whether the carcasses cause impurity even before they are taken out, there cannot be any question of severe impurity at this point in time. Babli <i>Zevaḥim</i> 105a.</i> without preparation<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Foodstuffs in general can become impure only after “preparation” by contact with water; cf. <i>Terumot</i> 1:1 Note 7. Since the basis of this rule is <i>Lev.</i> 11:38 referring to grain which cannot become severely impure, it is concluded that severe impurity makes foodstuffs impure even without preparation.</i> and without impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">The carcasses of bulls and he-goats to be burned, as well as the carcass of the Red Cow, cause severe impurity to the people occupied with it but they themselves are pure; Mishnah <i>Parah</i> 8:3, Babli <i>Zebaḥim</i>105a..</i> since at the end they become sources of severe impurity? Samuel from Cappadocia objected, then they should make their parts<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">The inner parts (of the bulls of the Anointed Priest and the Congregation) which have to be burned on the altar; cf. Chapter 5 Note 155.</i> impure. So only after they were taken away. And even if you are saying before they were taken away, parallel to the following: purifying water does not make anything impure to make itself impure in return<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">The person who purifies another by sprinkling him with water containing ashes of the Red Cow becomes impure (<i>Num.</i>19:21) but the water itself remains pure in his hands, while in general an impure person makes water which he touches impure in the first degree.</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah objected, does not a carcass of a pure bird make food impure without preparation, without impurity, since at the end it becomes a source of severe impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Tahorot</i> 1:1; <i>Sifra Aḥare Pereq</i> 11(5–6). It is inferred that <i>Lev</i>. 17:15 must refer to meat that only is forbidden because it is carcass meat, and that the verse cannot refer to four-legged animals since they are impure from the start, and it cannot refer to non-kosher animals or birds since for them the reference to tom meat would be irrelevant. The only meat which causes impurity only if taken into the mouth to be eaten is that of pure birds not correctly slaughtered. Babli <i>Zevaḥim</i> 105a, <i>Ḥulin</i>121a.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, the carcass of a pure bird has no enclosure<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to be eaten anywhere, whereas <i>sancta</i> may be treated only in the sacred precinct.</i>; these have an enclosure. Rebbi Mana said, the carcass of a pure bird has an enclosure; the human is its enclosure<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Only the human mouth causes impurity from carcass meat of pure birds.</i>. If it were not so, if he brought a dog, clothed it, and fed it the carcass of a pure bird, would it not make the garments impure in its palate<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">But since a living animal cannot become impure, textiles worn by a dog eating the carcass of a pure bird remain pure.</i>? Rebbi Eleazar the Southerner said, the enclosure of the carcass of a pure bird is everywhere; the enclosure of those is outside of Jerusalem<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pesaḥim</i> 5, Note 67. Pouring the blood on the altar is qualified as “eating by the altar.” Cf. Babli <i>Zevaḥim</i> 104b.</i>.
Rebbi Eleazar said, bulls and he-goats to be burned which he slaughtered with the intent to pour the blood the next day, he made <i>piggul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pesaḥim</i> 5, Note 67.

Rebbi Shammai asked, if the parts were lost, may one pour the blood for the meat? He had not heard what Rebbi Eleazar had said, since he neither intended as food for humans nor as food for the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">While for other sacrifices one may pour the blood to permit the meat to be eaten by the owners (for family sacrifices), or by the Cohanim (for purification and reparation sacrifices), or by the altar (for elevation sacrifices), in the case of bulls and he-goats to be burned there is nothing to be permitted and therefore the blood may not be poured.</i>. Rebbi Zakkai stated:A non-Cohen who burned makes garments impure<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">While the carcasses must be carried out by Cohanim since non-Cohanim cannot enter the inner courtyard where the ceremonies take place, there is nothing in the verses (<i>Lev.</i> 4:12,21; 16:28) to indicate that the burning outside the camp needs Cohanim.</i>. One only has to ask, is it qualified during nighttime<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from the verses quoted that the carcasses have to be taken out of the camp (Jerusalem) on the day of the sacrifice; but there are no indications that the burning has to be finished on the same day.</i>? It is an argument <i>de minore ad majus</i>. Since burning of the parts which is not qualified for a non-Cohen may be done in the night, for these<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Bulls and he-goats to be burned.</i> which are qualified for a non-Cohen it is logical that it should be qualified during nighttime.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are the words of Rebbi Eliezer and Rebbi Aqiba. But the words of the Sages, all of them were brought with the daily morning offering<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since the same <i>musaf</i> offering is prescribed in <i>Num.</i> 29 for New Year’s day, the Day of Atonement, and the Eighth Day of the Fall Festival, they are offered more frequently than the special offerings of the day of Atonement detailed in <i>Lev.</i> 16. Since the House of Hillel strictly follow the rule that the more frequent has precedence (cf. <i>Berakhot</i> 8:1), all of the more common sacrifices must be processed first. Cf. Tosephta 2:19.</i>. Rebbi Ḥuna in the name of Rav Joseph: Rebbi Eliezer follows the House of Shammai. Just as the House of Shammai say, frequent and holy, holy has precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nazir</i> 7:1 Note 54; Babli <i>Zevaḥim</i> 69a.</i>, so Rebbi Eliezer says, frequent and holy, holy has precedence. How is this? The service of the Day is holier and the day’s <i>musaf</i> sacrifices are more frequent; the service of the Day has precedence over the day’s <i>musaf</i> sacrifices.
The bull, the ram, and the seven unblemished sheep were brought with the daily morning offering; the remainder were brought with the daily afternoon offering<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This is the rule of R. Aqiba.</i>. Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, the reason of this Tanna is to join purification sacrifice to purification sacrifice and elevation sacrifice to elevation sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the he-goat as purification sacrifice is prescribed for all holidays and therefore is most frequent, as noted later in <i>Num.</i> 29:11 it is required that this sacrifice follow that of the he-goat whose blood was brought into the Temple, and be followed by the elevation sacrifice which is the evening daily offering. Therefore it makes sense to require the elevation offerings required by <i>Lev.</i> 16:3,24 to be brought after the atonement service and before the daily evening service.</i>. But some want to say, the bull, the ram, the people’s ram, and the seven unblemished sheep were brought with the daily morning offering; the remainder were brought with the daily afternoon offering. This Tanna distributes the services. What is the reason? <i>He leaves and brings his</i><i>elevation sacrifice and the people’s elevation sacrifice</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:24.</i>. As mentioned in the matter. What is mentioned in the matter? His ram and the people’s ram<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">16:3,5.</i>. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya said, what is the reason for the he-goat? <i>Of the blood of the atoning purification sacrifice</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This is misquoting <i>Ex.</i> 30:10 when it should be <i>Num.</i> 29:11 : <i>A he-goat as purification offering in addition to the atoning purification offering.</i> Babli 70b.</i>. The atoning purification sacrifice already preceded.
<i>Aaron comes to the tent of Meeting</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:23.</i>. From where does he come? From reading the Chapter. Where does he go to?

It is written: <i>He leaves and brings his elevation sacrifice and the people ’s elevation</i> sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:24.</i><i>,</i> and you are saying so? Did not Rebbi Joḥanan say, everybody agrees that the removal of cup and pan follows after the daily evening offering<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The last action of the High Priest is mentioned in v. 24, the offering of the remaining sacrifices of the day, which includes the daily evening offering. How can one understand R. Joḥanan’s statement since v. 23, which has to be interpreted as referring to removal of cup and pan, precedes v. 24?</i>? Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, the entire Chapter is written in order except for this verse<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 70b, as Tannaitic statement.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, even this is written in order. <i>Aaron comes to the tent of Meeting.</i> From where does he come? From the first sanctification which he encounters. Where does he go to? To the last sanctification<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The verse only states that the High Priest has no pause in the day’s service, from the first immersion to the last washing of hands and feet.</i>. Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose: Why do we not say, except the last sanctification<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Lev.</i> 16:23 mentions undressing the white garments but does not mention washing of any kind, whereas in vv. 4,24 it is stated that dressing requires immersion in water, would it not be logical to require washing only for dressing,. not undressing. Then R. Yose’s interpretation becomes impossible.</i>? He answered him, there is a difference since it is written <i>he comes, (he leaves)</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Since the other two quotes are from <i>Lev.</i> 16:23., this quote from v. 24 has to be deleted.</i>,<i>he takes off the linen garments.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3:7, Note 98.</i> Why does the verse say, <i>which he wore</i>? Could we ever think that he could undress what he was not wearing? Then why is it written, <i>which he wore</i>? It brackets undressing and dressing. Since dressing requires sanctification of hands and legs, also undressing requires sanctification of hands and legs. Rebbi Eleazar said, there is another service for which he officiates in white garments. What is it? It is removal of cup and pan<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For this he has to enter the Holiest of Holies, which only is permitted in white garments.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan says, everybody agrees that the removal of cup and pan follows after the daily evening offering<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Since in vv. 21–22 Aaron is still wearing the white garments which he put on in the morning, and in v. 24 is wearing his golden garments, there would be no reason in V. 23 to have him dress in white garments a second time. Therefore the second wearing has to be after the completion of the daily service in golden garments. The interpretation of R. Yose ben Ḥanina is the only possible one; it is compatible with the explanation which R. Yose gave to R. Mana.</i>.
Why in white clothing? Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, like the service up high so is the service down below. As up high, <i>a man in their midst clothed in linen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ez.</i> 9:2.</i>, so down below <i>a holy linen shirt he shall wear</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 16:4.</i>.

Why are they called “Urim”? Because they were enlightening Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Babli 73b.</i>. And “Tummin”? Because they were straightening out the way before them. As long as Israel were straight, they were showing them the correct way; as we find that they lied to them in Geva Benjamin. Rebbi Jehudah said, may God forbid, they did not lie to them in Geva Benjamin.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Why? <sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This is a partial copy, in places completed by the corrector for the Venice edition and indicated by brackets, of a text in <i>Maˋaser Šeni</i> 2:1 (Notes 7–35), also partially reproduced in <i>Ševuot</i> 3:2 (Notes 26–36). It is clear that the original is in <i>Maˋuser Šeni</i> since the last paragraph has no connection with the rules of the Day of Atonement.</i> Drinking is subsumed under eating but eating is not subsumed under drinking. From where that drinking is subsumed under eating? Rebbi Jonah understood if from the following: <i>Therefore, I told the Children of Israel, none of you shall eat blood</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lev.</i> 17:12.</i><i>.</i> Where do we hold? If about congealed blood, was it not stated that congealed blood is neither food nor drink? But we hold, as it is. And the Torah called it eating. And was it not stated: If one liquefied fat and drank it, or congealed blood and ate it, [if there is the volume of an olive] he is liable. What does Rebbi Jonah do with this? It is not food to become impure in the impurity of food, or fluid to become impure in the impurity of fluids. Rebbi Jonah changed and understood if from the following:: <i>You shall spend the money for anything you desire</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deut.</i> 14:26.</i><i>.</i> Where do we hold? If about one who gives the taste of wine into a cooked dish, is that not spoiling the taste of the wine? [But we hold as it is and the Torah called it “eating.”] The rabbis of Caesarea said, explain if about <i>orzaraya</i> and <i>gomnany</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maˋaser Šeni</i> 2:1, Note 16. The first word may denote cedar resin (J. Levy) or a derivative of אוֹרֶז “rice”. The readings for the second word, גמרייה, גמזוזיניה, גומננייא show that the scribe did not know what to do with it; it may be a derivative of “gum” <i>(gummi,</i> <i>κόμμι)</i> (E. G.) used in the preparation of liquors.</i><i>,</i> since anything that is ancillary to food is like food.
Rebbi Yose understood all this from the following: “An oath that I shall not eat; when he ate and drank he is liable only once.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 3:1.</i>” The colleagues said before Rebbi Yose, but it is said following this, “an oath that I shall not eat nor drink, when he ate and drank he is liable for two”! Rebbi Yose told them, if somebody had two loaves in front of him said, an oath that I shall not eat this loaf<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Here a piece of text is missing, found in the other two sources: “and then he said, an oath that I shall not eat that one.”</i>, when he ate [both of them] together would he not be guilty on two counts?
Rebbi Ḥanania in the name of Rebbi Phineas understood it from the following: “An oath that I shall not eat; when he ate inedible food and drank undrinkable fluids, he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 3: 5.</i>” Because he ate inedible food and drank undrinkable fluids. Therefore if [he ate edible food,]<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s addition, added in error.</i> drank drinkable fluids he is liable. Did he not say, an oath that I shall not eat? That is understandable following our Mishnah, where we are saying, “an oath that I shall not eat.” But for Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously since Rebbi is the editor of the Mishnah, he cannot contradict his own text. With the text in <i>Ševuot</i> one has to read: “those rabbis who say, an oath that I shall not eat and I shall not drink.” These rabbis are quoted in the Babli, <i>Ševuot</i> 23a.</i> who said, an oath that I shall not eat and shall not drink?
Rebbi Ḥinena understood it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah 3.</i>: [“If he ate and drank in one forgetting he is liable only once.”
Rebbi Abba Mari understood it from the following:] <i>I did not eat from it in my mourning,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deut.</i> 26:14.</i> but I drank?
It is understandable for him who said, “{I swear} an oath that I shall not eat”, and he drank. Drinking is subsumed under eating. But for him who said, “an oath that I shall not drink”, and he ate? Is eating subsumed under drinking? Eating is not subsumed under drinking<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding arguments show that drinking is subsumed under eating.

Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish asked, what could He have said instead of <i>will not be deprived?</i> “Shall not eat”? All eating in the Torah is by the volume of an olive, but here by the volume of a date<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was established earlier that of the six kinds of deprivation required on the Day of Atonement only not fasting is biblically punishable, the question arises why instead of the generic expression “be deprived” the verse does not directly prescribe “do not eat.” The answer is that in the latter case already eating the volume of an olive would be punishable.</i>. Rav Hoshaia said, “watch yourself, lest, not be deprived,” would be three warnings<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">This now addresses the problem from where could one infer that all prohibitions of the Day of Atonement also apply to the preceding night. He suggests that since there are several expressions biblically used to indicate prohibitions, there could have been different expressions used for the warnings which would have been interpreted as applying to different times.</i>. Rebbi Ḥuna said, watch yourself regarding the saying which I said to you, <i>watch yourself in matters of skin disease to be very careful and act</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Deut.</i> 24:8. This is a side remark noting that הִשָּׁמֵר is used only in reference to rules spelled out on other occasions. In this particular case it is noted that the rules of the impurity of skin disease (<i>Lev.</i> 13–14) do not include prohibitions; the prohibition implied by <i>Deut.</i> 24:8 is interpreted (cf. Pseudo-Jonathan <i>ad loc.</i>) to mean that it is forbidden to eliminate the impurity of skin disease by surgically eliminating the diseased tissue.</i><i>,</i> etc. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: Punishment could [not]<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Necessary addition by the corrector.</i> have been said about work since it is unnecessary.

Therefore punishment was spelled out for work only to imply a warning preceding it<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The argument of Rav Hoshaia is essentially correct but has to be realized differently. Since the warning spelled out for work on the Day of Atonement is shown to be unnecessary, it has to be applied as if it were written twice; supplying the desired additional warning to be read as referring to the preceding night.</i>. Since the punishment indicated for work is preceded by a warning, also the punishment indicated for deprivation is preceded by a warning. Rebbi Zeˋira said, this implies that one may infer about an “equal cut” even if it is free only on one side<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">He reads the argument of R. Ḥiyya not as a conclusion <i>de minore ad majus</i> but as “equal cut” meaning that the expression בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה appearing in <i>Lev.</i> 23:29,30 implies that the rules indicated in both verses are the same. In general one requires that an expression used for “equal cut” not be used for any other inference; but here the entire v. 29 is needed both for warning and punishment (Note 84). There remains the problem that since now it is shown that בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה does not mean “during daylight only”, the expression is not used for any other deduction and therefore the “equal cut” is between two identical expressions not otherwise needed and therefore valid according to everybody, even R. Ismael. One has to say that since the day is defined in <i>Lev.</i> 23:32 as from evening to evening, בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה means that while one has to start fasting and refraining from work somewhat earlier and finish sometime after nightfall the next day, the biblical penalties do not apply to these additional periods and therefore one mention of “on this very day” is needed for this legal implication.<br>Noted as opinion in dispute, Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 64a, <i>Niddah</i> 22b.</i>.

It was stated: Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, it is said <i>on this very day</i> about work and it is said <i>on this very day</i> about deprivation.

<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">This must refer either to infractions for which the penalty is not spelled out (Note 158) or to cases where guilt cannot be ascertained. The standard example is that of a person who ate one of two pieces of meat, one of which was kosher, the other one severely forbidden either as forbidden fat or as sacrificial meat which became impure (Rashi). If it is not possible to ascertain which of the two he ate, then a suspended reparation sacrifice is due; but the obligation to bring a suspended reparation sacrifice is cancelled by the Day of Atonement, as determined in the next paragraph (and <i>Ševuot</i> Halakhah 1:2, Note 69, <i>Horaiot</i> 1:1 Note 18).</i> Rebbi says, the Day of Atonement atones for all sins against the Torah except for him who tears away the yoke, or who breaks the Covenant, or who finds aspects in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">This was explained in <i>Peah</i> 1:1 Notes 199–213; cf. also <i>Sanhedrin</i> 10:1, Note 8.

Rebbi Zevida said that Rebbi Yasa asked: Does Rebbi think that the Day of Atonement atones without repentance? Rebbi Ashian, Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi agrees that the Day of Atonement only atones with repentance; therefore death cleanses without repentance<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">This is a non-sequitur, but it fits well with the text in <i>Ševuot</i> which has to be considered as the original. The Babli supports the statement there about the Day of Atonement; it has no statement of Rebbi about the power of Death.</i>. We have stated thus: The day of death equals the day of repentance. Who stated this? Rebbi! Then what we stated, “death and the Day of Atonement atone with repentance,” does not follow Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah requires repentance also on the Day of Atonement.

<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the Halakhah, the text is not only in <i>Ševuot</i> but also in<i>Sanhedrin</i> 10:1, Notes 23–37, 14–22 (and in the Babli <i>Yoma</i> 86b). For part of the text there exists a Geniza fragment (G) edited by L.

He said to him, did you hear the four types of Atonement which Rebbi Ismael explained? He answered him, there are three in addition to repentance.

If somebody violates a positive commandment and repents, before he moves from there it will be forgiven to him. About this one it says, <i>return, naughty children.</i> If one transgresses a prohibition and immediately repents, repentance suspends judgment, and the Day of Atonement atones. About this one it says, <i>for on that day, He shall atone for you.</i> If one intentionally transgressed {sins punishable by} extirpations or death penalties, repentance and the Day of Atonement atone half, and sufferings during the other days of the year atone half. About this one it says, <i>I shall visit their crime with the rod, and their iniquities with plagues.</i> But by whom the Name of Heaven was desecrated, there is no power in repentance to suspend judgment, nor in the Day of Atonement to pardon, nor in sufferings to scour; but repentance and the Day of Atonement atone one third, sufferings atone a third, and death scours with sufferings. About this one it says, <i>the iniquity of this people shall not be atoned for until you die.</i> From this we learn that death scours.
Rebbi Joḥanan said, these are the words of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah, Rebbi Ismael, and Rebbi Aqiba. But the Sages say that the scapegoat atones. How does it atone? Rebbi Zeˋira said, in small pieces. Rebbi Ḥanania said, at the end. What is the difference between them? If somebody died in-between. In the opinion of Rebbi Zeˋira, he already was pardoned. In the opinion of Rebbi Ḥanina, he was not pardoned. Rebbi Zeˋira said, a <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ḥanina: “There is strength in the ram which is not in the Day of Atonement, and in the Day of Atonement which is not in the ram: The Day of Atonement pardons without a ram, but the ram does not atone without the Day of Atonement. There is strength in the ram since the ram atones immediately but the Day of Atonement only atones at nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta 4:16.</i>” Rebbi Ḥuna said, the question was raised before Rebbi Jeremiah and he said, explain it if they intended to bring another he-goat but they did not bring it.
