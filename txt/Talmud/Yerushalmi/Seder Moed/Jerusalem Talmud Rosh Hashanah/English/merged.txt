Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are four New Year’s Days. On the first of Nisan is New Year for kings<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The first year of a king’s reign terminates at the end of Adar, irrespective of when he gained the throne. This is important for the dating of documents by regnal years and represents the practice in Mishnaic times and the early Israelite monarchic period. Mesopotamian practice uses the first of Tishre (“beginning”) for the same purpose.</i> and for holidays<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In all biblical holiday lists the sequence is Passover-Pentecost-Tabernacles. Since the holidays always are described in terms of months, the statement is equivalent to saying that Nisan is the first month.</i>. On the first of Elul is New Year for animal tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:32-33" href="/Leviticus.27.32-33"><i>Lev.</i> 27:32–33</a>. For determining animal tithe, all calves born in the same tithing year are counted together, but not those of any other year.</i>; Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Simeon say, on the first of Tishre.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “There are four New Year’s Days,” etc. It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:2" href="/Exodus.12.2"><i>Ex.</i> 12:2</a>. The verse establishes that months are counted from the month of the spring equinox, post-exilic (Accadic) called Nisan.</i>, <i>this month shall be for you the head of the months</i>. For you it is the head of the months but it is head neither for years nor for Sabbatical periods nor for Jubilees<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 25" href="/Leviticus.25"><i>Lev.</i>25</a> that Sabbaticals and Jubilees are counted from the end of the agricultural year in the month of the fall equinox.</i> nor for planting<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">To determine the years of <i>`orlah</i>, when no fruit may be taken.</i> nor for vegetables<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To determine the year for purposes of the tithe since inferred from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 14:22" href="/Deuteronomy.14.22"><i>Deut</i>. 14:22</a>, which requires agricultural tithe being given <i>year by year</i>, that no tithe may be given from produce of one year for produce grown in another.</i>. And I could say, for you it is the head of the months but it is head neither for kings nor for holidays. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="II Chronicles 3:2" href="/II_Chronicles.3.2"><i>2Chr.</i>3:2</a>.</i>, <i>he started to build in the second month, in the second,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The text is ambiguous. The later derivations read it as a repetition: He started to build in the second month, the second month of the fourth year; in the style of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 8:5" href="/Genesis.8.5"><i>Gen</i>. 8:5</a>. If the same number is used to describe the month in the sequence of months and the month in the year, it follows that the year must start with month one.</i> <i>in the fourth year of his reign</i>. It bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan. Or is it only the second in the month? Any place where the second day in the month is intended it is explicit<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is how the unofficial Targum of <a class="refLink" data-ref="II Chronicles 3:2" href="/II_Chronicles.3.2"><i>2Chr.</i>3:2</a> reads it: He started to build on the second day of the second month of the fourth year; a reading also rejected in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 3a" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.3a">Babli 3a</a> since it always is stated as “day nin the month.”</i>. Or is it only the second in the week? We do not find this count in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 3a" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.3a">Babli 3a</a>.</i>. But is it not written, <i>it was evening and it was morning, the second day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 1:8" href="/Genesis.1.8"><i>Gen</i>. 1:8</a>.</i>? One makes no inferences from the Creation of the World<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since they are God’s days, not human days.</i>. Which one is the second of the months and which one is the second of the years<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="II Chronicles 3:2" href="/II_Chronicles.3.2"><i>2Chr.</i>3:2</a>.</i>? Rebbi Ḥanania and Rebbi Mana. One said, <i>he started to build in the second month,</i> that is the second of the months; <i>in the second</i>, that is the second in the year. But the other one, even if you switch it does not change anything. Rebbi Simeon bar Karsana in the name of Rebbi Aḥa understood it from the following: <i>This month is for you</i>, an exclusion. <i>The first it be for you</i>, [an exclusion.] An exclusion after an exclusion is to include<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A general principle in both Talmudim. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Peah 6:7:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.6.7.3"><i>Peah</i>6:9 Note 154</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 12:1:2-17" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.12.1.2-17"><i>Yebamot</i> 12:1</a> Note10, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 9:2:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.9.2.6"><i>Soṭah 9:2</i> Note 63</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.1.1.4"><i>Horaiot</i>1:1 Note 9</a> <i>q. v.</i>, <i>Megillah</i>4:4 75b l.14; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 23b" href="/Megillah.23b">Babli <i>Megillah</i>23b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 43a" href="/Yoma.43a"><i>Yoma</i>43a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Kamma 15b" href="/Bava_Kamma.15b"><i>Bava qamma</i>15b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 15a" href="/Bava_Batra.15a"><i>Bava batra</i>15a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 15a" href="/Sanhedrin.15a"><i>Sanhedrin</i>15a</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 44b" href="/Sanhedrin.44b">44b</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 66a" href="/Sanhedrin.66a">66a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Makkot 9b" href="/Makkot.9b"><i>Makkot</i>9b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shevuot 7b" href="/Shevuot.7b"><i>Ševuot</i>7b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 9b" href="/Menachot.9b"><i>Menaḥot</i>9b</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 67a" href="/Menachot.67a">67a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 132a" href="/Chullin.132a"><i>Ḥulin</i>132a</a>.</i> for kings and holidays. Could one include for years, or for Sabbatical periods, or for Jubilees, or for planting, or for vegetables? Following what Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan said: It is written, <i>he started to build in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign</i>. It bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan. Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Joseph: <i>He started to build in the second month</i>, that is the second of the months; <i>in the second</i>, that is the second in the year. And when he says, <i>in the fourth year of his reign</i>, it bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan. Samuel stated and disagreed<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that the count of years depends on the political circumstances.</i>: <i>In the third month of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 19:1" href="/Exodus.19.1"><i>Ex.</i> 19:1</a>.</i>. From here that one counts months from the exodus from Egypt. Not only months, from where years? <i>The Eternal spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the second year</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 9:1" href="/Numbers.9.1"><i>Num</i>. 9:1</a>.</i>. Not only at that time, from where later? <i>In the fortieth year of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 33:38" href="/Numbers.33.38"><i>Num</i>. 33:38</a>. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 2b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.2b">Babli 2b</a></i>. Not only temporarily, from where for later generations? <i>It was in the 480th year of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 6:1" href="/I_Kings.6.1"><i>1K.</i>6:1</a>.</i>, etc. After the Temple had been built they started to count from its building: <i>It was at the end of twenty years after Salomon built the two houses</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 9:1" href="/I_Kings.9.1"><i>1K</i>. 9:1</a>.</i>. They did not merit to count from its building, they started counting from its destruction: <i>In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, on New Year’s Day, on the tenth of the month</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Ezekiel 40:1" href="/Ezekiel.40.1"><i>Ez</i>. 40:1</a>. In a Jubilee year, New Year’s day is moved to the Day of Atonement; cf. the author’s edition of <i>Seder Olam</i>(Northvale 1998), pp. 118–119, Note 4.</i>, etc. They did not merit to count for themselves, they started counting regnal years, [as it is written,] <i>in year two of Darius</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Haggai 1:1" href="/Haggai.1.1"><i>Ḥaggai</i>1:1</a>.</i>; <i>in year three of Cyrus, king of Persia</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Daniel 10:1" href="/Daniel.10.1"><i>Dan</i>. 10:1</a>.</i>. And I am saying, <sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="II Chronicles 3:2" href="/II_Chronicles.3.2"><i>2Chr.</i>3:2</a>.</i><i>he started to build in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign</i>. It bracketed the fourth year of his reign with the second of the months. Since the second of the months is only counted from Nisan, also the second in the fourth year of his reign is only counted from Nisan.
Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Rebbi Ḥanina: Also for the kings of the peoples of the world one only counts from Nisan<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that Jewish documents, in particular biblical reports, always start regnal years in Nisan, irrespective of the official calendar of the kingdom to which it refers. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 3b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.3b">Babli 3b</a> admits this only for good kings.</i>. <i>In the sixth, in year two of Darius</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Haggai 1:15" href="/Haggai.1.15"><i>Ḥaggai</i>1:15</a>. He reports that they started to build the Second Temple on 6/24 of year 2 of Darius.</i>. <i>In the eighth, [in year] two of Darius</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Zechariah 1:1" href="/Zechariah.1.1"><i>Sach</i>. 1:1</a>. If the regnal year of Darius were counted from the start of the 7th Month, Tishre, the eighth month would have to be in year three.</i>. Should we not say, “in the eighth in year three”? Heipha said, the eighth was said first but there is no earlier and later in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since Sacharia scolds the people for not building the Temple in the eighth Month of year 2 of Darius, this must precede the date given by Haggai. Therefore the regnal year cannot be counted from Nisan, but it runs from the 1st of Tishre to the end of the following sixth month, against R. Ḥanina. That <i>Sacharia</i> is written after <i>Haggai</i> in the minor prophets has no chronological relevance. “Torah” here includes the entire Hebrew Bible (and Mishnah, Note 318) and is not restricted to the Pentateuch. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 1:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.1.2.2"><i>Megillah</i>1:2</a> (70d l.59); also <i>Sheqalim</i>6:1 (49d l. 70) and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 8:3:12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.8.3.12"><i>Sotah</i>8:3 (Note 127</a>) as minority opinion of R. Meïr. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 6b" href="/Pesachim.6b">Babli <i>Pesaḥim</i>6b</a> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bamidbar Rabbah 9:44" href="/Bamidbar_Rabbah.9.44"><i>Num. rabba</i>9(44</a>)).</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, it is written: <i>and now take notice, starting with this day, before a stone is set upon stone in the Temple of the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Haggai 2:15" href="/Haggai.2.15"><i>Haggai</i>2:15</a>. The prophecy is dated 9/2 of year 2 of Darius.</i>. How is this? In the sixth the foundation stone was laid. In the eighth<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This must read: “ninth”.</i> this verse was said. If you are saying, they already laid, Heipha is correct. If you are saying, they did not lay, Heipha did not say anything<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">If the prophet says that while they are building the Temple they already notice that God’s blessing of Judean agriculture started before they actually started building, the statement cannot be used to determine the start of regnal years.</i>. Rebbi Isaac objected: Is it not written<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 9:13" href="/Genesis.9.13"><i>Gen</i>. 9:13</a>.</i>, <i>it was in the 601-st year, in the first, on the first day of the month?</i> And it was stated on this, the year of the Flood is not counted<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This argument presupposes that Noe’s years are treated as regnal years. This is not the position of <i>Seder Olam</i>(of Babylonian redaction) which asserts that the numbers given in <i>Gen</i>. may be added, which means that overlapping parts of years have been eliminated. If the year started in Tishre, in the middle of the Flood, the statement is acceptable, but not if it started in Nisan, since the flood started only on 2/17 of that year. This problem is treated in detail by the 16th Cent. Rabbi Moses Almosnino (published in <i>Moriah</i>30, part 5–7, pp. 19–21, 2010.)</i>. Explain it following Rebbi Eliezer, as Rebbi Eliezer said, in Tishre was the world created<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore Noe’s years are not treated as regnal years; all years mentioned in the early history in <i>Gen</i>. start in Tishre. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 10b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.10b">Babli 10b</a>.</i>. But is it not written, <i>it was in the month of Nisan of year twenty</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 2:1" href="/Nehemiah.2.1"><i>Neh.</i>2:1</a>.</i>; <i>it was in the month of Kislew of year twenty</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Nehemiah 1:1" href="/Nehemiah.1.1"><i>Neh</i>. 1:1</a>. Nehemiah was informed in Kislew of year 20 of Artaxerxes of the sorry state of Jerusalem; in Nisan of the same year he asked permission to leave Susa and go to Jerusalem. The regnal year must have started in the fall.</i>? Explain it following Rebbi Eliezer, as Rebbi Eliezer said, any year of which 30 days have not elapsed is not counted as a full year. But is it not written<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 40:17" href="/Exodus.40.17"><i>Ex.</i> 40:17</a>.</i>, <i>It was in the first month of the second year, on the first of the month, when the Sanctuary was erected</i>? If you are saying that it was the third year and because 30 days had not elapsed it is not counted as a full year, is it not written<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 10:11" href="/Numbers.10.11"><i>Num</i>. 10:11</a> (misquoted). Since this verse refers to the service in the Tabernacle, it must refer to a time posterior to that quoted in the preceding verse; the statement in the name of R. Eliezer must be rejected. (In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 10b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.10b">Babli 10b</a> the statement is formulated in a way which makes it not relevant to the case discussed here.)</i>, <i>it was in the second year in the second month, on the twentieth of the month</i>? There are 50 days in the year, and it would not be counted as a whole year? That is one of Rebbi Isaac’s answers which are difficult<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And the statement of R. Eleazar in the name of R. Ḥanina has to be rejected. The entire text of R. Isaac is copied by Tosaphot 3b, s. v. מניינא.</i>.
What is the difference whether one says that one counts from Nisan or one counts from Tishre? Rebbi Jonah says, the difference is the proof power of documents<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Avodah Zarah 10a" href="/Avodah_Zarah.10a">Babli <i>Avodah zarah</i>10a</a>.</i>. If he took a loan in Iyar and wrote in it<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The standard document of indebtedness creates a mortgage lien on all of the debtor’s real estate, which is not removed if the real estate is sold later.</i>, the second year of government; he sold real estate in Marḥeshwan and wrote in it<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The sale deed.</i>, the second year of government. For him who says that one counts from Nisan, the loan preceded<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In this case the buyer bought encumbered property; he is in danger of losing his buy if the seller defaults on his loan obligation.</i>. For him who said that one counts from Tishre, the sale preceded<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The property is free of encumbrances.</i>.
How for kings? If he died in Adar and a king took office in Adar it is counted as a year for both of them. Rebbi Jonah said, only if he reached Nisan. Otherwise like the following, <i>he ruled one month in Samaria</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="II Kings 15:13" href="/II_Kings.15.13"><i>2K.</i> 15:13</a>. If he had ruled longer, it would have counted for a year.</i>. You can determine the years of the kings of Israel only through the years of the kings of Jehudah, and you can determine the years of the kings of Jehudah only through the years of the kings of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Since there were overlapping years at the start and end of each reign, and there might have been shifts between Western counting from Nisan and Eastern counting from Tishre, the correspondences given in <i>Kings</i> are necessary to establish the correct correspondences. This leaves uncertainty for the days of the united monarchy.</i>. It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 2:11" href="/I_Kings.2.11"><i>1K.</i> 2:11</a>.</i>: <i>And the time that David ruled over Israel was forty years</i>, etc. And it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="II Samuel 5:4" href="/II_Samuel.5.4"><i>2S.</i>5:4</a>. Then according to the rules given earlier, the reign should have been counted as 41 years. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 107" href="/Sanhedrin.107">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i>107a/b</a>.</i>, <i>in Hebron he ruled over Jehudah seven years and six months</i>, etc. In total they are deficient and in detail excessive. Rebbi Isaac bar Qaṣaṣata in the name of Rebbi Jonah: they were thirty-two and a half years, but to honor Jerusalem he counts them as entire. The great Jehudah says, the greater number absorbs the lesser<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">But according to our rules, the numbers should have been rounded up, not down.</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The following sentence is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 2:1:18" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.2.1.18"><i>Berakhot</i>2:1 (Notes 66–67</a>), also <i>Mo`ed qatan</i>3:7 (83d l.4). As answer to the problem of the excess 6 months it is unsatisfactory.</i> Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman said, <i>when your days will be complete</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="II Samuel 7:12" href="/II_Samuel.7.12"><i>2S.</i> 7:12</a>.</i>.

By your life, they will not be counted for you<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore the 41 years are recorded as 40.</i>.
Who stated “holidays”? Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon said, “three holidays in order starting with the holiday of unleavened bread<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Why is it necessary to state that the holidays start in Nisan? If somebody makes a vow he incurs the obligation to fulfill his vow (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 23:24" href="/Deuteronomy.23.24"><i>Deut</i>. 23:24</a>). If he fails to fulfill his vow he not only transgressed this positive commandment but also the prohibition to delay its fulfillment (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 23:22" href="/Deuteronomy.23.22"><i>Deut</i>. 23:22</a>.) The usual vow is to bring a sacrifice in the Temple; the natural time to fulfill such a vow is on a festival of sacrifice. As established in the next paragraphs the positive commandment requires that the vow be fulfilled on a holiday (according to the Babli on the first possible occasion, on the next holiday of pilgrimage); the prohibition is violated only if the vow is not fulfilled after three such holidays have passed. For R.

Ben Azzai said, since these are saying this and those are saying that, those born in Elul should be tithed by themselves. How is this? If there were born in his flock five in Av, five in Elul, and five in Tishre, they do not combine. If there were born in his flock five in Av and five in Tishre, they combine.

Rebbi Shammai in the name of Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya: Like the third, they made it following Rebbi Simeon, since Rebbi Simeon said, {an animal} before its time enters the corral to be tithed. Rebbi Mana met Rebbi Shammai; he asked him, did you say that? But did we not state, “Ben Azzai says, those born in Elul are to be tithed separately.” Not even if it was born up to the 29<sup>th</sup> of Elul? Could you say that Ben Azzai follows Rebbi Simeon? You have to say, he follows the rabbis. Just as you say following the rabbis, he leaves them for the next year and they will be tithed with the others of their year, so you have to say following ben Azzai, he leaves them for the next threshing floor and they will be tithed with those from Elul. Rebbi Huna said, this implies that the days of a firstling while he still is before its time are counted for its year. Rebbi Mana said, my father Rebbi Jonah understood this from the following: <i>Any male firstling which is</i><i>born to your cattle and small cattle dedicate to the Eternal, your God</i>.. How is this? You count its year from the moment it is born.

Chapter 2



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If they<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The High Court which decides the calendar.</i> do not know him, one sends<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The local rabbinate, to certify the witness to be as qualified rabbinic Jew.</i> another one with him to testify about him. Originally one accepted testimony about the new moon from anybody. After the sectarians<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Boethusian sect of Sadducees who were interested in seeing the 15th of Nisan celebrated on a Sabbath so that the <i>`omer</i> and Pentecost would be on a Sunday.</i> spoiled they instituted that one would accept only from known persons. Originally they were lighting beacons<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">To quickly announce from Jerusalem to Nahardea in Babylonia that the New Moon had been declared.</i>. After the Samaritans spoiled they instituted that messengers went out.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “If they do not know him,” etc. Rebbi Jonah said, so should the Mishnah be stated: Originally one accepted testimony about the new moon from everybody<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It is presumed that the quote of this sentence includes the next one about the spoiling by the sectarians.</i>. If they do not know him, one sends another one with him to testify about him. Rebbi Yose said, even as in the Mishnah it is acceptable: If they do not know him, one sends another one with him to testify about him. Why? Because originally one accepted testimony about the new moon from anybody<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It is presumed that the quote of this sentence includes the next one about the spoiling by the sectarians.</i>. May a single witness be believed<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It was stated in the previous Chapter (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah 2:8:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Rosh_Hashanah.2.8.2-4">Halakhah 9</a>, after Note 309) that the qualifications for a witness of the new moon are those of witnesses in criminal cases and as a consequence single witnesses are barred by biblical decree (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 17:6" href="/Deuteronomy.17.6"><i>Deut</i>. 17:6</a>).</i>? They gave you from your own. It should be logical that no witnesses should be needed<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since the appearance of the new moon is a natural phenomenon observable by the Court as well as by any other person.</i>. But they<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The entire set-up is rabbinic; there can be no objections from biblical standards.</i> said that witnesses were needed, and they said that a single witness may be believed.
Could one witness be believed as two<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The testimony of two witnesses is as good as the testimony of 100. If the testimony of two witnesses is contradicted by the testimony of 100, neither testimony is acceptable. But the testimony of a single witness is nothing if contradicted by two witnesses. In the case here, where one witness is accepted as two in a case purely rabbinical, does this also eliminate the biblical rule that the testimony of a single witness is nothing if contradicted by two witnesses?</i>? How is this? If there were two, one whom everybody knows and one whom nobody knows, except that his partner knows him. May his partner teem up with one from the street to testify about him<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">That he is a qualified witness.</i>? <sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The following is essentially from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:4:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.2.4.5"><i>Ketubot</i>2:4, Notes 77–83</a>. The problem is the certification of signatures to prove that a document of indebtedness is genuine and may be used for foreclosure. In that case certainly two independent witnesses are required.</i> Rebbi Ze`ira, Rav Huna in the name of Rav: he<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">One of the witnesses signed on the document.</i> and another cannot team up about the signature of the second witness. This is needed in case there were two, one whose signature everybody knows and one whom nobody knows, except that his partner knows him. May his partner be like anybody from the street to testify about him? In that case the entire testimony is confirmed by one witness. Rebbi Yudan said, this is correct. For example, two who came from a town most of whose inhabitants are Gentiles, like Hippos. One of whom everybody knows that he is Jewish and one whom nobody knows<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Whether he is Jewish or Gentile. While in general the assertion by a person that he is Jewish is believed, if this is questioned it needs two witnesses since it involves Torah prohibitions. A document signed by a Jew and a Gentile cannot be enforced in a Jewish court.<br>Here starts a new Genizah fragment (G).</i>, except that his partner knows him. May his partner be like one from the street to testify about him? If you are saying yes, the entire testimony is confirmed by one witness. Also here the entire testimony is confirmed by one witness.
There, we stated<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 3:1. This paragraph and the next are from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 3:1:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.3.1.2-3"><i>Yoma</i> 3:1, Notes 5–13</a>.</i>: “The overseer said to them, go and see whether the time of slaughter has arrived. When it arrived, the lookout says, it is radiant.” What means <i>borqi</i>? <i>Barqat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Radiant, from בָּרָק “lightning”.</i>. There<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In Babylonia; in the formulation of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yoma 28b" href="/Yoma.28b">Babli <i>Yoma</i> 28b</a> בָּרָק בַּרְקַאי.</i>, they are saying, בְּרוֹק בּוֹרְקָה, getting bright, radiant.
May one witness be believed<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Babli holds in general that a single witness can be believed in matters of prohibitions; the biblical requirement of two witnesses is binding only in criminal cases and matters that may have implications in criminal law. From the present paragraph it seems that the Yerushalmi does not accept this in general but that in cases where one witness is sufficient there is no difference between male or female witnesses.</i>? It is different here since one cannot control him; should we not worry and say, by the time somebody climbs up and goes out it will shine<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">While the time indicated must be approximately correct, since one asks only at the end of the night, and by the time somebody climbs up to check it clearly will be dawn, this does not prove that at the time of the assertion dawn was really visible. The text cannot be amended and the “not” deleted since it is confirmed by both sources.</i>? The matter can be verified. If one witness says, this male was born on a Sabbath, one circumcises him on his word<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Even though circumcising on the Sabbath a child not born on the Sabbath is a deadly sin.</i>. It is dark at the end of the Sabbath, one carries (him) on his word<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is a new item. One may believe a single witness that it is no longer Sabbath and all Sabbath prohibitions are no longer relevant. The word in parentheses has to be disregarded with G.</i>. Rebbi Immi was carrying on the result of elapsed time<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Arabic מלוה “interval of time”.

Rebbi Mattaniah was carrying on the saying of the moon shining<sup class="footnote-marker">21*</sup><i class="footnote">The translation of איביריתא is conjectural.

Rebbi Immi was circumcising on the saying of women, the sun was over Hippos<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since circumcision has to be performed during daytime, R. Immi is consistently restrictive; in this case he does not rely on astronomical computations of sunrise but on the much later observation of the sun appearing over the mountains to the East since Hippos was on a mountain over the Eastern shore of the Lake of Galilee.</i>.
May people who know those who know him desecrate the Sabbath for him<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The translation and the reading of G follows Liebermann’s correction of Ginzberg’s text (<i>Tosephta kiFshutahMo`ed</i> p. 1028). There is nobody known to the Court who knows the witness personally, but there is one known to the court who knows a reliable person who can testify that the witness is not a Boethusian. If the new moon is seen on a Sabbath, may the person known to the court go with this acquaintance to certify the witness?</i>? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Rosh Hashanah (Lieberman) 1:16" href="/Tosefta_Rosh_Hashanah_(Lieberman).1.16">Tosephta 1:16</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 22b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.22b">Babli 22b</a>.</i>: “[Rebbi]<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s addition from the Tosephta, not in G.</i> Noharai (here) &lt;ben&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The &lt;genizah text&gt;is to be accepted.</i> Shanai said, it happened that I descended to Usha<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The place where the successor to the Synhedrion was constituted in the aftermath of the Bar Kochba uprising.</i> to testify for one witness<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The witness not of seeing the new moon but the reliability of the witness for the new moon.</i>. They did not need me but I looked for a pretext to see my colleagues.”
What spoiling was there<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the sectarians mentioned first in the Mishnah.</i>? Because they<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In G correctly: the Boethusians.</i> were saying, Pentecost is after the Sabbath; one always was going out in the evening on the presumption that it would be sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">While in theory the day of the New Moon was determined only by observation, most months followed a regular pattern alternation between 29 and 30 days. Since the Sanctification of the Month as judicial act could be done only during daytime, one nevertheless could be reasonably assured on the preceding evening that the day would be one of the New Moon.</i>. Then for Nisan they should not accept<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since this was the only one of importance for the Boethusians. The majority of the people supported the Pharisees, so the other sects had no chance of seeing their adherents gaining control of the Temple.</i>, for the other months they should accept.

One because of the other. <sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Rosh Hashanah (Lieberman) 1:15" href="/Tosefta_Rosh_Hashanah_(Lieberman).1.15">Tosephta 1:15</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 22b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.22b">Babli 22b</a>.</i>“It happened that the Boethusian hired two false witnesses to testify on the new moon that it be sanctified.

They told him, the 200 denar are given to you as a gift<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is forbidden to take bribes for false testimony, the witness could not legally have acquired the money given to him as bribe; he needed a court decision to keep it.</i>, but those who sent you should come and be flogged. Why did you put yourself in this questionable situation? He said to them, I saw them trying to trip up the Sages. I said, it is better that I should go and inform the Sages.”
And what spoiling was there<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the Samaritans mentioned later in the Mishnah.</i>? These were kindling this day and those were kindling the next day; they were thinking that the Court was reconsidering and were spoiled<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since the people in Babylonia had no way of determining the origin of the signals, they kept the Day of Atonement on the 11th of Tishre according to the rabbinic calendar.</i>. Who disestablished the beacons? Rebbi disestablished the beacons<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This cannot refer to the beacons described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah 2:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Rosh_Hashanah.2.2.1">Mishnah 3</a>, since these start from Jerusalem, and Rebbi’s beacons must have started in lower Galilee, according to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Rosh Hashanah (Lieberman) 1:17" href="/Tosefta_Rosh_Hashanah_(Lieberman).1.17">Tosephta 1:17</a> on Mount Tabor. One has to conclude that the beacons were in use all during Temple times and were in some kind re-established by Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. If the interference of the Samaritans had been dated before the destruction of the Temple, it would be reasonable to infer that they started their beacon near Sartaba. In the scenario described here, the origin must have been in Samaritan communities in Galilee, of which we otherwise have no knowledge.</i>, and permitted the murderer<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">A person known to be a murderer but for whose deed there are no proofs which would hold in court, is admitted as witness.</i>, and permitted hearsay<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Testimony otherwise not admissible in court permitted for testimony about a New Moon (since anyhow this testimony can be controlled by astronomical computation.)</i>, and permitted that one was departing in the evening trusting that it would be sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If a month was not started on day 30 of the preceding month, it certainly started on day 31. Therefore the messengers for the New Moon may safely depart after the end of day 30.</i>. Rebbi Abbahu said, even though you are saying that the beacons were disestablished, they were not disestablished from the Sea of Galilee<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Where local bonfires were lit to keep the remembrance of the prior custom alive.</i>. Rebbi Ze`ira asked before Rebbi Abbahu, should those who see Safed light a beacon? He said to him, Rebbi disestablished the beacons. Why would Safed light a beacon? To communicate that they know<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As answer to the bonfires below which were visible from Safed.</i>. One does not light a beacon in the night of its regular time, but in the night of its extension<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">If beacons are lit, they are lit in the night of day 31 of the preceding month.</i>. In the night of its regular time one cannot kindle because of the holiday, but one kindles in the night of its extension<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The problem in all this is New Year’s Day which is both a holiday and a New Moon. One cannot light the beacon in the night of the 30th day because this is part of the holiday where starting a fire is forbidden (and anyhow it would show that the fixation of the new moon by observation was a pretense.) The next night is no longer a holiday and beacons can be lit without restriction.</i>. One kindles only for months settled on time<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Months which need a declaration by the court. If day 30 of a month is not declared the first of the next month then automatically day 31 will be the start of the next month.

In the night of its regular time one cannot kindle because of the holiday, in the night of its extension one cannot kindle because of the honor of the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">One could light the beacon only in the night of Sunday, which would give a wrong information in every case. Since one does not light beacons for an extended month, even if on New Year’s Day the beacons are lit a day late nothing can go wrong since the beacon itself is proof that Elul was only 29 days.</i>. For if you are saying, one kindles both for months settled on time [and for months not settled on time]<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s addition supported by G. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Rosh Hashanah (Lieberman) 1:17" href="/Tosefta_Rosh_Hashanah_(Lieberman).1.17">Tosephta 1:17</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 22b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.22b">Babli 22b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 2b" href="/Pesachim.2b"><i>Pesaḥim</i>2b</a>.</i>; if you are saying this, they will say that maybe the Court was reconsidering and would be spoiled<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Since the beacon cannot be used to distinguish between months of 29 and 30 days.</i>.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How were they lighting the beacons? One brings long logs of cedar, and reed, and oil wood, and linen tow, and ties them with rope.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How does one check the witnesses? The couple who comes first one checks first. One brings the more senior in and tells him to say, how did you see the moon?

Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, the Mishnah says this: “The president of the Court says: sanctified.” It was stated, for intercalation of the year one starts from the side. Rebbi Zebida said, but this lower house do not proceed in this way, for they did not hear what Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Marius and Rebbi Jonah, Rebbi Abba, Rebbi Ḥiyya said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: For lengthening the month one starts with the most senior person, for intercalating the year one starts from the side. When Rebbi Joḥanan was participating as the most junior person, they told him, say: “this year is sanctified in its intercalation.” He said, “this year is sanctified in intercalation.” Rebbi Jonathan said, look at the language which the smith’s son taught us.

They preferred an old man to Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish for intercalation but had to remove him by the other door. He said, this be their reward.

Another one said, in Adar the ox will die naked and try to strip off his hide under the fig tree. And we see that this year nothing of these applies. They intercalated the year on their word. Rebbi Ḥelbo said, because the Court agreed with them. Did not Rebbi Ze`ira say, but they all have to agree to the same reason? But since they all agree with one another it was that they all agreed as to the reason.
Why was Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish offended by this?

Rebbi Joshua said to him, I am agreeing with your words.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Simlai said, the reason of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri is that for any month which starts before noontime the eye is not able to see the old moon.

Also in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 32b" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.32b">Babli 32b</a>, R. Joḥanan asserts that the times were switched because of intervention of the Roman government. It is to be noted that the Babylonian way of combining early blowing with the <i>musaf</i> service prescribed by the Mishnah by blowing immediately after the Torah reading (or, as in the Yemenite ritual, immediately after sunrise) and then a second (or third) time for <i>musaf</i> is totally unknown to Yerushalmi sources.</i>. Once they blew early and the haters thought that maybe they want to go against us<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>shofar</i> historically was a trumpet to be used to give military signals.</i>, they attacked them and killed them. Since they are seeing that they read the <i>shema`</i>, and pray, and read in the Torah, and pray while blowing, they are saying, they are occupied with their secret rites.
