Jerusalem Talmud Shekalim



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> On the first of Adar one proclaims about <i>sheqalim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The yearly Temple tax of half a <i>sheqel</i>(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 30:11-16" href="/Exodus.30.11-16"><i>Ex.</i> 30:11–16</a>). The expenses of the Temple service had to be paid from the tax collected for the year starting on Nisan 1. Since the tax could be enforced in the Land of Israel, it was sufficient to remind people of their duty and set up collection points one month in advance.<br>In talmudic times, and already in the LXX, the profane <i>sheqel</i> was identified with the Greek and Roman <i>didrachma</i>, or 2 denar piece, approximately equal to the Achemaenean <i>sheqel</i> (<i>siglos</i>). However, it is clear from the talmudic sources as well as the coinage of the first war against the Romans that as sacrificial <i>sheqel</i> the old Canaanite and Israelite <i>sheqel</i> was used, approximately a Roman tetradrachma (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:3:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.3.4"><i>Qiddušin</i> 1:1, Note 122</a>.), and therefore the biblical half-<i>sheqel</i> was a full profane <i>sheqel</i>.</i> and about <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is the end of the rainy season, farmers are reminded to remove spontaneous <i>kilaim</i> growth from their fields, so they should not run the risk that their harvest be forbidden for all use.</i>, and on the fifteenth of that month one reads the Esther scroll in fortified places<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Greek χάραξ, “palisades”.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “On the first of Adar one proclaims,” etc. Why on the first of Adar? So that Israel should bring their <i>sheqalim</i> in time and it should be disbursed from the new contributions to the treasury<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The technical term for the Temple tax.</i> on time on the First of Nisan. And Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac said, [the heave of the treasury]<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s addition from the Babli. From here to the end of the paragraph there is a parallel in <i>Roš Haššanah</i>1:1 (56d line 4, <b>ר</b>).</i> as at its start, as it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 40:17" href="/Exodus.40.17"><i>Ex.</i> 40:17</a>.</i>, <i>it was in the First month of the Second year, on the first of the month, that the Sanctuary was erected.</i> It was stated hereto, on the day the Sanctuary was erected, on the same day the contribution<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Temple tax required in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 30:11-16" href="/Exodus.30.11-16"><i>Ex.</i> 30:11–16</a>.</i> was collected. Rebbi Tabi, Rebbi Yoshia in the name of Cahana. It is said here <i>months</i>, and it is said there, <i>months</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As shown later, the reference is to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 28:14" href="/Numbers.28.14"><i>Num</i>. 28:14</a>: <i>this is the monthly elevation offering on its day of the New Moon, for the months of the year</i>.

The latter verse designates the month of the spring equinox as start of the year in all matters of sacrificial ritual.</i>. Since <i>months</i> mentioned there are only counted from Nisan, so also <i>months</i> mentioned here are only counted from Nisan. Rebbi Jonah said, Rebbi Tabi left out the start and only quoted the end; this is not done since it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In the way the <i>baraita</i> was stated by R. Tabi, it is impossible to see what it refers to. One has to state the <i>baraita</i> in its entirety for it to make sense. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Rosh Hashanah 7a" href="/Rosh_Hashanah.7a">Babli <i>Roš Haššanah</i>7a</a>.</i>: <i>This is the elevation sacrifice for a month at its New Moon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 28:14" href="/Numbers.28.14"><i>Num</i>. 28:14</a>.</i>. I could think that one should collect every month, the verse says <i>at its New Moon for the months</i>; at one New Moon one collects for all months of the year. I could think on any month of his choosing, it is said here <i>months</i>, and it is said there, <i>months</i>. Since <i>months</i> mentioned there are only counted from Nisan, so also <i>months</i> mentioned here are only counted from Nisan.
What means “one lets hear”?

Rebbi Yose said, this<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the statement of R. Simon.</i> is correct. Did they not say,. one proclaims about <i>sheqalim</i>, so that Israel should bring their <i>sheqalim</i> in time? If you would say on the First Adar, there still would be sixty days {left} in the year. Did they not say, also one goes to inspect for <i>kilaim</i>, not that the plants should be recognizable? If you would say in the First Adar, they still would be small.
Rebbi Ḥisqiah asked: But then the people in Babylonia proclaim about <i>sheqalim</i> on the start of the month<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In the version of the ms., Ḥizqiah points out that the Mishnah applied to countries outside the Holy Land leads to nonsensical results. In the version printed in the Babli, his is a declarative sentence, that in Babylonia one proclaims at the start of winter (about November), so the money may be delivered to Jerusalem in time.</i>. Was it not so that Israel should bring their <i>sheqalim</i> in time and it should be disbursed from the new contributions to the treasury on time on the First of Nisan? Rebbi Ulla asked before Rebbi Mana: Did we not state<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shekalim 3:1:1-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shekalim.3.1.1-4">Mishnah 3:1</a>.</i>, “three times a year one disburses from the treasury, half a month before<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the Babli and the text of B, one reads פרס as (Latin) <i>pars</i>, “one half”, meaning half a month before the holiday indicated (Halakhah 3:1, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shekalim (Lieberman) 2:1" href="/Tosefta_Shekalim_(Lieberman).2.1">Tosephta 2:1</a>).</i> Passover, before Pentecost, before Tabernacles.” He told him, we may say, before Passover, from those near; before Pentecost, from those farther away, before Tabernacles, from those still farther away.

Any destructive action they made early in the morning. Rebbi Abba bar Aḥa said, one cannot understand the character of this people; they are asked for the {golden} calf and are giving, for the Sanctuary and are giving. Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina stated this <i>baraita</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">To answer R.

“On the fifteenth of this month one reads the Esther scroll in fortified places.” But did not Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Ḥuna, Rav in the name of the Elder Rabbi Ḥiyya, say<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup>: Everybody may fulfill his obligation on the Fourteenth, which is the time of its reading?

But in matters of documents one writes the First Adar, the Second Adar. only that for the Second Adar one writes תִינייָן.

In the anonymous opinion (ascribed in B to R. Meïr), for both months one writes Adar, but the second one is qualified by “second” (in Aramaic, the language of contracts in both Talmudim.) R.

“One marks the graves.” Were they not already marked in Adar? Explain it if there was a flood caused by rain which rinsed it off<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This also is copied from <i>Mo`ed Qaṭan</i>. The question is why one should hire people to mark graves (or in the next paragraph to check for <i>kilaim</i>) on the semi-holidays approximately on the spring and fall equinoxes (Mishnah <i>Mo`ed Qaṭan</i>1:2) when they already had been checked in late winter. The reason that one tries to have all public works done on semi-holidays is that at that time most journeymen are without work and ready to work for lower wages. One provides work for the poor and saves taxpayer’s money at the same time. Cf. Babli <i>Mo`ed Qaṭan</i>6a.</i>.
“And also one goes to inspect for <i>kilaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Graves not in a cemetery, which must be clearly marked so ritually pure pilgrims will not be contaminated accidentally and then prevented from completing their pilgrimage.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Even though they said that one does not take pledges from women, slaves, and minors, but if they gave the <i>sheqel</i> one accepts it from them.

This is the principle: Anything which can be given as a vow or a gift one does accept from them; anything which\can be given neither as a vow nor a gift one does not accept from them.

Calves born to the estate are considered property of one person and the tenth calf automatically becomes a sacrifice. If they distributed the estate but then decided to continue jointly to pursue the agricultural affairs of their father, they form a new partnership and follow the rules of partnerships. They are independent persons, each of whom has to pay his own fee, but all calves born are property of joint owners, not a single person, therefore the tenth calf or lamb (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:32" href="/Leviticus.27.32"><i>Lev.</i> 27:32</a>) is not sanctified.</i> who are liable for the agio are not liable for animal tithe; if they are liable for animal tithe they are not liable for the agio.

“One does not accept from the Non-Jew and the Samaritan.” Rebbi Abba said, explain it<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">On the face of it, the equation of Samaritans with Gentiles is unintelligible. The <i>baraita</i> shows that up to the time of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, Rebbi’s father, the Samaritans were simply Sadducee Jews, the only Sadducee sect to survive after the destruction of the Temple.

The risk that the flour might have worms or the wine be vinegar has to be carried by the seller; therefore he cannot be paid before the produce is used and found qualified. R.

Rav Ḥisda said, a <i>nazir</i>’s leftover bread shall be left to decay. Rebbi Yose said, that is correct. You cannot sacrifice it by itself since bread cannot be brought alone.

He told him, let us infer the hidden from the explicit since Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, the Four Cups which they said add up to an Italic <i>quartarius</i> of wine.
A cup mixed by how much? Rebbi Yose bar Bevin said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, let us hear from the following: “Water. a gulp; Rebbi Jehudah says, for mixing a cup. Wine. a gulp; Rebbi Jehudah says, for mixing a cup.” This implies mixed as cups are mixed. What is the measure of cups? Rebbi Abun said, τέταρτρον is a quarter.

May one drink them with interruptions? They said that he should drink to feel differently, not that he should get drunk. If he drinks them with interruptions, he will not become drunk. May one fulfill his obligation with Sabbatical wine? Rebbi Hoshaia stated, one may fulfill his obligation with Sabbatical wine. May one fulfill his obligation with spiced wine? Since Bar Qappara stated, spiced wine is like wine, which implies that one may fulfill his obligation with spiced wine. May one fulfill his obligation with mixed wine? Since Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: the Four Cups which they prescribed, one may fulfill his obligation either with unmixed or mixed, on condition that it have the taste and looks of wine. Rebbi Jeremiah said, it is meritorious to fulfill one’s obligation with red wine. What is the reason? <i>Do not see wine when it shows its red color, when put in our cup</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 23:31" href="/Proverbs.23.31"><i>Prov.</i> 23:31</a>.

Rebbi Abbahu descended to Tiberias. The students of Rebbi Joḥanan saw that his face was shiny. They said before Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Abbahu found a treasure. He came to him. He asked him, what new teaching did you hear? He said, an old Tosephta. He recited about him, <i>a man’s wisdom illuminates his face</i>.
Rebbi Ḥanan said, the <i>log</i> of the Torah is the old Sepphorean eighth of fish sauce. Rebbi Jonah said, I know it. In the House of Shammai<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Anachronistic misreading for “House of R. Yannai.”</i> they were measuring honey with it. It was stated, half of the old Tiberian eighth. Rebbi Joḥanan said, this one we used. Why did he call it the old one? Because it was in his days. Some are saying, it was small, then was enlarged. But some are saying, it was diminished more than before. What is the measure of a cup? Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Pazi, Rebbi Yose ben Bevin in the name of Samuel: Two fingers by two fingers high a finger and a half and a third of a finger. The rabbis of Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Yose bar Bevin in the name of Samuel: Rebbi Nathan follows Rebbi Simeon. Just as Rebbi Simeon says, a <i>quartarius</i>, so Rebbi Nathan says, a <i>quartarius</i>, when it jells it will have the volume of an olive.
Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: It happened that a mule of Rebbi’s household died and they declared its blood pure regarding the carcass. Rebbi Eleazar asked Rebbi Simon, how much? He did not take notice of him. He asked Rebbi Joshua ben Levi who told him, it is pure up to a <i>quartarius</i>. More than that is impure. Rebbi Eleazar felt badly that Rebbi Simon had not repeated the tradition to him. Rav Beva was sitting stating this occurrence. Rebbi Isaac bar Bisna asked him, is it pure up to a <i>quartarius</i>; more than that impure? He was unfriendly to him. Rebbi Zeriqa asked him, because he asked you, you were unfriendly to him? He answered him, because my mind was not clear, I was unfriendly to him, as Rebbi Ḥanan said, <sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 28:66" href="/Deuteronomy.28.66"><i>Deut</i>. 28:66</a>.</i><i>your life will hang far from you</i>, that is one who buys a year’s supply of wheat, <i>you will be fearful night and day</i>, that is one who buys from the Saracen, <i>and you will not believe in your survival</i>, that is one who buys from the retail store, and I am dependent on retail stores.

Nothing else is like this,” in the amount needed that its blood makes impure like its flesh. Rav Yose said, two Amoraim disagree, one says impure, and one says pure.

(against the explanation by R. Eliahu Fulda on the authority of R. David Oppenheim.) It would be unavoidable that the disburser swallow some drops of water, but this does not require any benediction for the water as food.</i>.

One takes the wages of the artisans {from the <i>sheqalim</i>} and redeems them on the artisans’ money, gives them to the artisans as their wages; then buys them back from the disbursement of the lodge to pay back the workers for the coins they earlier gave to the Temple.” A similar text seems to be intended here.</i>; brings incense and redeems it for them, and gives it<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The incense.</i> to the artisans as their wages.

Rebbi Abba bar Cohen asked before Rebbi Yose: The opinion of Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba seems inverted.

The introductory sentence is missing, but is partially present in B. The question is, why does the Mishnah prescribe that leftover incense should be redeemed and used as payment of the artisans. Since it is a biblical decree (Lev. 27:10) that unblemished animals dedicated as sacrifices cannot be redeemed, would it not be reasonable to assume that sacrificial objects sanctified in a Service vessel cannot be redeemed? If one accepts this, a second question arises. Was the incense prepared in a Service vessel and therefore is sanctified from the start, or does only the daily portion become sanctified when it is filled into a Service vessel, and the leftovers are intrinsically redeemable as Temple property?</i> As they disagreed: If it<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">The incense.</i> was compounded as profane, Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, it is disqualified; Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, it is qualified.

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Bun said, Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina’s parallels Samuel and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi’s Rebbi Joḥanan, as we have stated, “if one dedicated his property to the Temple and there were objects appropriate as public offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shekalim 4:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shekalim.4.4.1">Mishnah 6</a>.</i>.” Rebbi Joḥanan said, incense. Rebbi Hoshaia said, explain it about an artisan of the family Eutinos who took incense as his wages. And Rebbi Joshua ben Levi’s is like Samuel, as Rav Ḥuna said in the name of Samuel, they made the mortar a vessel to sanctify. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi Ḥuna said this before Rebbi Yose: something sanctified in a vessel may be redeemed. He said to him, is that not Samuel’s? Since Samuel said, one is lenient in the case of leftovers. As they disagreed: If unblemished animals were left over, Samuel says, they are redeemed unblemished. Rebbi Joḥanan said, they are redeemed as disqualified <i>sancta</i>. Leftover he-goats, in Samuel’s opinion if elevation sacrifices are redeemed, a purification sacrifice so much more. In Rebbi Joḥanan’s opinion? Rebbi Ze`ira said, they shall graze. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, one uses them to adorn the altar. This is difficult. May a purification sacrifice be brought as elevation sacrifice? Rebbi Yose said, there is a difference, for public sacrifices are determined only by slaughter. Rebbi Ḥananiah said, it is a stipulation of the Court that all leftovers should be brought as elevation sacrifices.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Two lodges were in the Temple, one the silence lodge and one the vessel lodge. The silence lodge: Silently did sin-fearing people contribute there and poor people from good families were supported from there in silence. The vessel lodge: Anybody who vowed a vessel throws it in there. Once in 30 days the treasurers open it. Any vessel which they deem is needed for the upkeep of the Temple they keep, but the remainder is sold and their proceeds belong to the lodge of upkeep of the Temple.

Rebbi Ḥinena bar Pappos used to distribute his charity in the night. Once the prince of spirits encountered him.

When he saw a son of a prominent family who had lost his property, he used to say to him: My son, since I heard that an inheritance fell to you at another place, take and you will pay back. When he had taken it, he said to him, it is a gift.
Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, in our days there were old people who used to take if somebody gave to them between New Year’s Day and the Great Fastday. After that, they were not taking. They said, there is permission for us.
Neḥemiah from Shiḥin met a Jerusalemite who said to him, acquire merit by giving me a chicken. He said to him, here is its value, go buy red meat; he bought, ate and died. He said, come and eulogize him whom Neḥemiah killed.
Naḥum from Gimzo was carrying a gift to the house of his father-in-law when he met a person afflicted with boils who asked him, acquire merit from what you have on you. He said to him, when I shall return. He returned and found him dead. He said before him, his eyes which saw you and did not give to you shall go blind, his hands which did not stretch out to give to you shall be cut off, his feet which did not run to give to you shall be broken. This happened to him. Rebbi Aqiba came to visit him and said, woe to me that I see you in this state. He answered, woe to me that I do not see you in this state. He asked, why do you curse me? He answered, why are you contemptuous of suffering?
The teacher of the great Rebbi Hoshaia’s son was blind and he used to invite him to eat with him every day. One day there were guests and he did not ask him to eat with him.

Clarification. Rebbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina and Rebbi Hoshaiah were strolling through the synagogue of Lod. Rebbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said to Rebbi Hoshaiah: How much money did my forefathers invest here!

When the ark was hidden, there were hidden with it the flask of Manna, the bottle of anointing oil, Aaron’s staff with its almonds and flowers, and the chest which the Philistines returned as a reparation sacrifice for Israel’s God. Who hid it? Josiah hid it. When he saw that it was written: <i>The Eternal will lead you and your king whom you will have put above you, to a people whom</i> neither you nor your fathers had known, he started and hid it. That is what is written: <i>He said to the Levites, who instruct all of Israel, the ones holy to the Eternal, put the Ark into the House that Salomon, son of David, King of Israel, built; you do not have to carry it on your shoulder.</i>” He said, if it is exiled with you to Babylonia, you will never return it to its place.

Since it is not stated “touches any impure person”, one has to conclude that <i>anything impure</i> refers to implements or similar things which became impure from the touch of an impure person. Therefore it is clear that by biblical standards there exist derivative impurities. Bar Qappara holds that anything which makes something else impure is called original impurity. Since the verse does not refer to the meat as impure, he will hold that it is disqualified but its touch will not make the implement touched impure. He restricts the term “impure” to matter able to transmit impurity; matter disqualified is classifioed as “derivative impurity”. R. Joḥanan will hold that the meat, two touches distant from original impurity, still is impure by biblical standards (even though it is not called so in the text.)

Then it is stated that from the categories of people excluded from the holy sites, people impure in the impurity of the dead are excluded from the Temple precinct, those suffering from gonorrhea (or anybody whose impurity is caused by his own body) is excluded from the Temple Mount, and the sufferer from skin disease is excluded from the city. R. Simeon explains that the sufferers from skin disease under no circumstance can enter the city; this is a paradigm for the statement that anything impure never may be brought into a place from which it is excluded.</i>.
