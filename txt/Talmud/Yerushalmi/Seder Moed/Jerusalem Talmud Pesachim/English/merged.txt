Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> At nightfall of the Fourteenth one checks leavened matter by candle light. A place into which no leavened matter is introduced does not need checking. And where<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Babli and Maimonides read ולמה “why” instead of ובמה “where”.</i> did they say two rows in the cellar<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The storage place for wine or oil amphoras. While this is not a place where one usually stores leavened matter it is possible that the person who is asked to bring a barrel of wine or oil for household use is eating some bread and deposits it temporarily near the entrance door. Therefore it needs checking except for a wholesaler’s cellar.</i>? A place where one introduces leavened matter. The House of Shammai are saying two rows in the front of the entire cellar<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The amphoras are arranged in a rectangular pattern. The House of Shammai requires checking of two rows in all directions accessible from the door. Since usually one starts arranging the amphoras starting at two walls meeting at an angle, the outer rows at the other two sides of the rectangular arrangement have to be checked.</i>, but the House of Hillel are saying the outermost two rows which are the uppermost<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Only the rows facing the door have to be checked. If the amphoras also are stacked on top of one another, the two top rows facing the door have to be checked.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “At nightfall of the fourteenth,” etc. It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:17-18" href="/Exodus.12.17-18"><i>Ex.</i> 12:17–18</a>.</i>: <i>You shall guard the mazzot, because on this same day I took out your multitudes from</i><i>the Land of Egypt. On the first, on the fourteenth of the month, in the evening, you shall eat mazzot,</i> etc. Where do we hold<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">What means <i>on the first</i>? Does it mean on the first month, or on the first day of the holidays?</i>? If for eating <i>mazzah,</i> is it not already written, <i>seven days you shall eat mazzot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:15" href="/Exodus.12.15"><i>Ex</i>. 12:15</a>.</i>? Or if to say that one starts on the Fourteenth, is it not written, <i>until the twenty-first of the month</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:17-18" href="/Exodus.12.17-18"><i>Ex.</i> 12:17–18</a>.</i>? But if it is not needed as a reference to the eating of <i>mazzah,</i> take it as a reference to the elimination of leavened matter<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As usual, the argument partially refers to parts of the verse which are not quoted in the text. It says in 12:15, <i>seven days you shall eat mazzot, only on the first day you shall eliminate sour dough from your houses.</i> No calendar date has been given. One could read v. 17 to state that <i>mazzot</i> have to be eaten and leavened matter eliminated on the 14<sup>th</sup>. This is impossible since the same verse states that the seventh day is the 21<sup>st</sup>. Therefore the obligation to eat <i>mazzot</i> starts in the evening preceding the 15<sup>th</sup>. Since it is accepted doctrine that the calendar day starts at nightfall of the preceding night, the reference to the 14<sup>th</sup> cannot possibly refer to eating, but must give the date of the elimination of leavened matter for which the search in the preceding night is a preparation.</i>.
Why by candlelight? Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, because a candle permits checking everywhere<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In holes and crevices which are dark in daytime (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 8a" href="/Pesachim.8a">Babli 8a</a>). The “candle” mentioned here is a small clay vessel filled with oil.</i>. Why in the night? Rebbi Yose said, because checking with a candle is exact only during night time<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As stated later, candle light is not effective during daytime.</i>. Rebbi Mana did not say so: <i>And guard this day for your generations as an eternal law</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:17-18" href="/Exodus.12.17-18"><i>Ex.</i> 12:17–18</a>.</i>, see to it that day and night be guarded<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The entire day should be dedicated to the elimination of leavened matter.</i>. Then should one not start on the Thirteenth that day and night be guarded? He also agrees with the statement of Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">One cannot say that R. Mana disagrees with R. Yose; he adds to his statement.</i>. Then should one start in the evening of the Thirteenth? If so, he could even check on the beginning of the month<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since checking two weeks in advance would be useless, so is checking a full day in advance. Since checking should be done at nighttime, the only remaining date is the evening of the 14<sup>th</sup> of Nisan (preceding the day).</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah said that Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac asked: May one check by the light of torches? What is his problem? Because their light is unsteady<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the light is unsteady, it does not serve in searching nooks and crannies.</i>. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac is consistent since Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, because a candle permits checking everywhere<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The scribe wrote בודק כל שהוא כל שהוא “checking extremely well everywhere.” The second כל שהוא was deleted by the corrector; probably incorrectly.</i>. [<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta <i>Pisha</i> 1:1</a>; corrector’s addition.</i> Even though it is not proof of the matter, it is an allusion to the matter: <i>It shall be on that day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Misquote from memory.</i><i>that I shall search Jerusalem by candles</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Zephaniah 1:12" href="/Zephaniah.1.12"><i>Zeph.</i> 1:12</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 7b-8a" href="/Pesachim.7b-8a">Babli 7b–8a</a>.</i><i>.</i> But some want to say,] one can understand it from the following: <i>A candle of the Eternal is a person’s soul, it searches all rooms of the body</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 20:27" href="/Proverbs.20.27"><i>Prov</i>. 20:27</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 7b-8a" href="/Pesachim.7b-8a">Babli 7b–8a</a>.</i><i>.</i>
Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah implies that checking during daytime is called checking, as we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.1.3.1">Mishnah 3</a>.</i>: “Rebbi Jehudah says, one checks at nightfall of the Fourteenth, and on the Fourteenth, and at the moment of elimination.” Not only Rebbi Jehudah but even the rabbis, as we have stated: “If he did not check at nightfall of the Fourteenth he shall check on the Fourteenth.”
Is it obligatory to check by candlelight<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">When checking during daytime, even following the rabbis.</i>? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 7b" href="/Pesachim.7b">Babli 7b</a>.</i> “One checks neither by sunlight, nor by moonlight, nor by starlight, but by candlelight.” One understands “neither by moonlight, nor by starlight,” but “neither by sunlight”? Is there any sun in the night? This implies, even during daytime one has to check by candlelight; not only in a house without light, but even in a house which has light, even during daytime, it is necessary to check by candlelight.
May one<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This translation of צריך follows S. Liebermann.</i> check dark passages<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Roofed public spaces.</i> purposely<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As the parallel expression in the next paragraph shows, a word “during daytime” is missing here.</i> by candlelight? The words of the rabbis imply that not as it radiates at night it radiates during the day, <sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bereishit Rabbah 31:12" href="/Bereishit_Rabbah.31.12"><i>Gen. r.</i> 31:12</a>, a much better text. As given here, the story is Babylonian and there is no reason why they should be fleeing, and why the earth under the place (under the open sky) where the twice-yearly assembly of scholars was held should have been tunnelled. In <i>Gen. rabba</i> the name is <i>Rebbi</i> Huna, the place is Tiberias, and they were hiding from soldiers.</i> as Rav Huna said, when we were fleeing to these catacombs of the great assembly they were lighting candles for us. When they were faint, we knew that it was day; when they were bright we knew that it was night. This parallels what Rebbi Aḥawa bar Ze`ira<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The son of R. Zeˋira. In <i>Gen. r.</i> “R. Phineas in the name of R. Zeˋira”. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 108b" href="/Sanhedrin.108b">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i> 108b</a> is a similar statement of R. Joḥanan.</i> said, when Noah entered the Ark he brought with him precious stones and pearls. When they were dull, he knew that it was daytime; when they were shiny he knew that it was nighttime.Why? There are animals eating at daytime and there are animals eating at nighttime. But is there not written, <i>make a skylight to the ark</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 6:16" href="/Genesis.6.16"><i>Gen.</i> 6:16</a>.</i>?

Rebbi Jeremiah asked: Do synagogues and houses of study need checking? What is his problem? Since one brings<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In general it is forbidden to bring food into a synagogue or study hall proper, but for a meal accompanying the public declaration of the new month or the additional month one brought food there, bread and vegetables (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 70b" href="/Sanhedrin.70b">Babli <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70b</a>) or grapes and bread (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 6:4:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.6.4.4">Yerushalmi <i>Berakhot</i>6:4, Note 149</a>).</i> there for intercalations<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In a responsum of R. Nissim of Kairawan (<i>Teshuvot Hegaonim Lyck,</i> #105) and the Frankfurt ms. of <i>Or zarua</i> II §453, עיבריות. Even the word spelled with א is interpreted as if written with ע, “intercalations”; J. N. Epstein, <i>Tarbiz</i> 5 (1933–34) p. 263. In the printed editions of the Yerushalmi, following a correction on the margin of the ms., “on Sabbaths” (cf. R. Nissim <i>loc. cit.,</i> p. 34).</i> and on the days of the New Moon. It should be obvious for him<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That one has to check, even if the place was not usually used for public meals.</i>, but what really is his problem? Since they are very well illuminated, may one check them purposely during daytime by candlelight<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">And not in the evening of the 14<sup>th</sup>, when people are occupied in their own houses. Since no answer is given, theˋ answer is negative.</i>?
Rebbi Yose asked: The courtyards in Jerusalem where one eats the bread of thanksgiving offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Which have an obligatory component of leavened bread, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:13" href="/Leviticus.7.13"><i>Lev.</i> 7:13</a>.</i> and the wafers of a <i>nazir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Part of the offering of the <i>nazir</i> at the fulfillment of his vow, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 6:15" href="/Numbers.6.15"><i>Num.</i> 6:15</a>. These are unleavened.</i><i>,</i> do they need checking? Are they not checked anyhow for leftovers<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since any leftovers from any well-being offering, including the thanksgiving offering, must be burned (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:17" href="/Leviticus.7.17"><i>Lev.</i>7:17</a>), every day of the year these localities are treated the way every other dwelling is treated on Passover Eve.</i>? It should be parallel to what Rebbi Zachariah the son-in-law of Rebbi Levi stated: A menstruating woman washes her hair and combs<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">She becomes pure by immersing <i>all</i> her body in water. Therefore it is imperative that not two hairs cling together; before immersion she has to make sure that this does not happen.</i>. A priestly woman does not wash her hair and comb<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The wife, unmarried daughter, or slave of a Cohen who participate with the Cohen in eating heave and other sancta. As long as the rules of purity could be kept, these women, together with the Cohen, have to immerse themselves every day close to sundown (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Berakhot 1:1" href="/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.1">Mishnah <i>Berakhot</i> 1:1, Note 3</a>). Therefore washing the hair is not necessary. Quoted <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Niddah 66b" href="/Tosafot_on_Niddah.66b">Tosaphot <i>Niddah</i> 66b</a>.</i>. A menstruating priestly woman washes her hair and combs, not to differentiate between one menstruating woman and another. So also here, not to differentiate between elimination and elimination. Rabbi Gamliel bar Inyany stated before Rebbi Mana: A menstruating woman who interrupts for seven days washes her hair and combs. A priestly woman who immerses herself every day does not wash her hair and comb<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">From the comparison of the menstruating and the priestly women one cannot infer anything since the menstruating priestly woman is excluded from the common meal of <i>sancta</i> for the period of her impurity. The statement which exempts her from washing her hair applies only to pure priestly women.</i>. He told him, it is necessary for one who watches one day for a day<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As long as the rules of purity could be observed, a woman in the household of a Cohen was obligated to reduce the period of her impurity to a minimum. The method by which any other woman could avoid showing her blood to a rabbinic authority to ascertain the status of her impurity (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 4:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.4.1.1"><i>Niddah</i> 4:1 Note 3</a>) is not available to the priestly woman. It is rabbinic doctrine that after one menstruation, the next is possible only after 11 days.(Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 4:7). If she loses blood on one of these days, she does not follow the rules of <i>niddah</i> but those of <i>zavah.</i> For the first two occurrences in one period she is impure only for 24 hours. The statement about the impure priestly woman is needed to decree that even an interruption of one day without immersion triggers the obligation of washing the hair.</i>.

Isaac Ibn Ghiat).

The statement is rejected by all authorities who quote it.</i>. Did we not state “the ditch”? Does this not mean that they did not worry about things falling down? The toddler is afraid to go there. But should one not be afraid that leavened matter rolled there? Explain it by a ditch which has a rim. “And the roof of the olive press, and the roof of the tower.” That is, if they are three hand-breadths high; but if they are not three hand-breadths high they are like ground. And if they were not used for leavened matter, but if they were used for leavened matter even if it is very high it needs checking. Rebbi Mana said, this is correct. Would we say that this papyrus scaffold which is very high should not need checking<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shabbat (Lieberman) 14:3" href="/Tosefta_Shabbat_(Lieberman).14.3">Tosephta <i>Šabbat</i> 14(15):3</a> mentions an instrument used to remove bread from the papyrus scaffold where it is stored.

A wine cellar needs checking, an oil cellar does not need checking<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 8a" href="/Pesachim.8a">Babli 8a</a>.</i>. What is the difference between wine and oil? Wine has no staying power, oil has staying power<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Wine is drawn from the amphora at least once a day; fresh oil is needed only from time to time.</i>. Storage<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Wholesale storage for commercial purposes.</i>, whether of wine or oil, does not need checking. What is a cellar? Anything used with bread in the courtyard<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Any place where bread is introduced during the year needs checking. Some Medieval authors, e.g. Meïri (ed. J. Klein, Jerusalem 1964, p. 39, Notes 468–469) read here an additional sentence: “Storage is what is not used with bread in the courtyard.”</i>. There exists a cellar which is like storage and storage which is like a cellar. A cellar in which he is ashamed to eat is like storage; storage where he is not ashamed to eat is like a cellar. <sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">This does not belong here; because of the similarity in language it is copied from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 7:6:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.7.6.4"><i>Ketubot</i> 7:7, Notes 71–72</a>.</i> There is a courtyard which is like an alley and an alley which is like a courtyard. A courtyard which is used by the public is like an alley, and an alley which is not used by the public is like a courtyard. But should one not be afraid that animal drivers introduce leavened matter into it<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This refers back to storage areas. While the producer of the wine will not introduce bread into his storage area, what can be said about the teamster who will transport the wine for sale at other places?</i>? Animal drivers usually do not introduce leavened matter into it but sweets since they help in checking the quality of the wine<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">If the teamster is transporting for his own account, he will want to check the quality of the wine he is buying; for that he eats taste enhancing candy, not taste dulling bread.</i>.
“If somebody leaves to travel by sea, before thirty days he does not have to check; within thirty [days] he has to check”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 1:4" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).1.4">Tosephta 1:4</a> (in the formulation of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 6a" href="/Pesachim.6a">Babli 6a</a>).</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 6a" href="/Pesachim.6a">Babli 6a</a> rules in everything the exact opposite of the Yerushalmi, which holds that everybody is obligated at all times to see to it that his property contains no leavened matter on Passover, wherever it be situated and wherever he spends the holiday.</i> That is to say, if he intends to return. But if he does not intend to return, even before thirty days he has to check. If there is a doubt; but if it is certain then even from New Year’s Day. Rebbi Abba said, but even if he intends to return he has to check, maybe he will change his mind and not return.
Everybody is trustworthy about elimination of leavened matter, even women, even slaves. Rebbi Jeremiah in the name of Rebbi Ze`ira: There is no “even” women. Women intrinsically are trustworthy; since they are slow they check everything very carefully. Samaritans any time when they prepare their <i>mazzah</i> with Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">If the Samaritan calendar has Passover on the same day as the rabbinic one.</i> are trustworthy about checking for leavened matter; if they do not prepare their <i>mazzah</i> with Jews they are not trustworthy about checking for leavened matter. Rebbi Yose said, this means in the houses, but they are suspect in courtyards since they explain that <i>it should not be found in your houses,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:19" href="/Exodus.12.19"><i>Ex.</i> 12:19</a>.</i> does not apply to your courtyards.
It was stated: <sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 2:3" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).2.3">Tosephta 2:3</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Gittin 10a" href="/Gittin.10a">Babli <i>Gittin</i> 10a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Kiddushin 76a" href="/Kiddushin.76a"><i>Qiddushin</i> 76a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 4a" href="/Chullin.4a"><i>Ḥulin</i> 4a</a>.</i> Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, any commandment which the Samaritans keep they are much more exact with them than Jews. Rebbi Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">This author cannot be R. Simeon ben Yoḥai, but he might be R. Simeon ben Eleazar <i>(Avodah zarah</i> 5:4, p. 447).</i> said, that means earlier when they were concentrated in their villages. But today, when they have no commandments nor remainders of commandments they are suspect and degenerate.
One asks about practices of Passover at Passover, practices of Pentecost at Pentecost, practices of Tabernacles at Tabernacles<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Megillah 4a" href="/Megillah.4a">Babli <i>Megillah</i> 4a</a>. <i>Sifry Num.</i> 66.</i>.

The statement of Rebbi Joḥanan follows the rabbis, that of the colleagues Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the reason of the rabbis, because Moses stands on the First Passover and explains to them the rules of Second Passover<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The rules of the Second Passover to be celebrated on the 14<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> of Iyar by people impure on the 14<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> of Nisan were promulgated on the 13<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> of Nisan, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 9:9-14" href="/Numbers.9.9-14"><i>Num.</i>9:9–14</a>.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One does not suspect,” etc. Rebbi Jonah said, so the Mishnah should have been stated: From town to town and from courtyard to courtyard, from place to place and from room to room. If you suspect from town to town, you will suspect from courtyard to courtyard. If you suspect from courtyard to courtyard, you will suspect from place to place. If you suspect from place to place, you will suspect from room to room. Rebbi Yose said, even following the Mishnah it is correct. “One does not suspect that a mole pulled it from room to room or from place to place; if that were the case, also from courtyard to courtyard and from town to town without end.” For if you do not suspect from room to room, not so much more you suspect from place to place? If you do not suspect from place to place, not so much more from courtyard to courtyard? If you do not suspect from courtyard to courtyard, not so much more from town to town?

Jehudah’s statement as “or”. The time of elimination is given in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 1:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.1.4.1">Mishnah 4</a>.</i>. But the Sages say, he who did not check at nightfall of the Fourteenth has to check on the Fourteenth; he who did not check on the Fourteenth has to check on the holiday.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “Rebbi Jehudah says,” etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the reason of Rebbi Jehudah, corresponding to the three times that in the Torah is written, <i>leavening shall not be seen as yours</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Twice in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 13:7" href="/Exodus.13.7"><i>Ex</i>. 13:7</a>, once in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 16:4" href="/Deuteronomy.16.4"><i>Deut.</i> 16:4</a>.</i>.

The verse says, <i>it shall not be seen as yours.</i> How is this? If he deposited with him it is forbidden; if he gave him a separate place it is permitted.
The argument of Rebbi Jehudah seems inverted<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">It is not spelled out what other opinion of R.

It seems that while he is stringent in the requirement of triple checking before the holiday he is lenient in not requiring anything afterwards if checking was not done by the time of elimination.</i>.

But the Sages say, if he did not check at nightfall of the Fourteenth, he has to check on the Fourteenth.” Does he have to check three times? Since at a time before its term of elimination you are saying that he has to check three times, at the moment of the term of elimination not so much more? <sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The text in parentheses was deleted by the corrector and therefore is not found in the printed texts. It is a necessary component of the argument.</i>(No, it need not be so. If he did not check on the Fourteenth, he has to check on the holiday. Does he have to check three times? Since at a time before its term of elimination you are saying that he has to check three times, at the moment of the term of elimination not so much more?) No, it need not be so. If he did not check on the holiday, he has to check after the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The answer to the question was that certainly R. Jehudah would agree with the Sages that checking during or after the holidays is required if it was not done beforehand (a position rejected by the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 10b-11a" href="/Pesachim.10b-11a">Babli 10b–11a</a>.) The only question is whether in these cases also R. Jehudah requires triple checking. Since he does not spell out his position, an attempt to determine this by inferences is unsuccessful. Since practice does not follow R. Jehudah, a final answer is not given.</i>.
“And what he leaves he should deposit at a guarded place so that he would not be obligated to repeat checking<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Any bread and leavened matter to be used on the morning of the Fourteenth must be secured after the checking in the evening since if some of it would be missing in the morning the entire checking procedure would have to be repeated.</i>.” What does he do?

Joḥanan in a second version. In this first version, Ḥizqiah must hold that an inference from a verse is only valid if there is no second verse leading to the same result. The theoretical basis is the recognition that the legal texts in the Torah are incomplete and sometimes contradictory as a system. In addition, it is held that words do not change their meaning in legal contexts. Therefore, a mechanism of translation of the Torah text into a coherent and reasonably complete system must exist. The rule quoted by Ḥizqiah is one of the translation rules; cf. H. Guggenheimer, Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition, in: Ph. Longworth (ed.), <i>Confrontations with Judaism</i> (London 1966) pp. 171–196.<br>Since here the mention of the torn limb and the carcass both lead to the same argument, either one of them would be superfluous and, therefore, both must be needed for other inferences.

In the opinion of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 23a" href="/Pesachim.23a">Babli 23a</a>, the verse is needed to permit any use of profane fat since otherwise one would argue that since fat is forbidden for humans but required for the altar, fat of animals unfit for the altar should be permitted for use in the Temple but forbidden for profane use. In the <i>Sifra Ṣaw (Parasha</i> 10), the argument of the Babli is attributed to R. Yose the Galilean; R. Aqiba concludes that fat of domesticated animals is not food nor subject to the impurity of food.<br>In the opinion of the Yerushalmi, since some fat is permitted for unrestricted use, no fat can be forbidden for usufruct in the absence of an explicit verse. For Ḥizqiah, this is a third verse that could be used for R. Eleazar’s argument; nobody will contest that three parallel verses invalidate the argument. In the second version of Ḥizqiah’s position (below, after <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 2:1:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.2.1.9">Note 49</a>), he needs the verse to permit use of fat for work on Temple property.</i>: <i>But fat of a carcass and fat of a torn animal may be used for any work, only it may not be eaten</i>.

At noontime it no longer can be eaten by biblical standards, it becomes biblical leftover before its time and has to be burned. That latter statement is independent of the disagreements between R. Jehudah, Rebbi, and the Sages.</i>?

But here you infer <i>mazzah</i> from leavened bread? In addition, from the following which was stated: “A person may acquit himself of his obligation with a soaked wafer, or a cooked wafer, as long as it did not lose its shape.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 41a" href="/Pesachim.41a">Babli 41a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 38b" href="/Berakhot.38b"><i>Berakhot</i> 38b</a>.</i>” It only says, “as long as it did not lose its shape,” therefore not if it lost its shape.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How does one separate <i>ḥallah</i> in impurity on the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The problem is mainly for the holiday of Passover. Since <i>ḥallah</i> is a kind of heave, it must be consumed by a Cohen in purity. Dough of a minimum volume (cf. Introduction to Tractate <i>Ḥallah</i>) is forbidden as food as long as its heave was not taken. It is permitted to bake bread on a holiday which is not a Sabbath. If the dough is impure (e. g., if the person kneading the dough is impure, as is everybody today), the <i>ḥallah</i> is impure and has to be burned as impure heave. But since <i>sancta</i> other than Temple sacrifices may not be burned on any holiday, the impure <i>ḥallah</i> may not be burned immediately and, therefore, can be expected to become fermented. (In the talmudic languages, <i>ḥallah</i> never means “Sabbath bread” as in Eastern European Yiddish.)</i>? Rebbi Eliezer says, it should not be given a name until after it is baked<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">He permits to bake the bread without <i>ḥallah</i> being taken from the dough (even though in this case the bread in the oven is forbidden as food) and to remove <i>ḥallah</i> (preferably a small loaf intended as <i>ḥallah</i> from the start) and declare it as such, which then releases the remainder of the bread for human consumption and retroactively justifies baking it on the holiday.</i>. Ben Bathyra<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jehudah ben Bathyra of Nisibis on the upper Tigris. In the interpretation of the Halakhah, he requires that the dough be kneaded continuously with cold water until the end of the holiday.</i> says, one should keep it in cold water. Rebbi Joshua said, this is not leavening where one is warned that it should not be seen nor found, but one separates it and leaves it until the evening, and if it fermented, it fermented<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>ḥallah</i> is for Cohanim, it is not property of the maker of the dough and since the prohibition is that <i>yours shall not be seen, yours shall not be found</i>, it does not apply in this case and it is preferable to bake the dough into bread when clearly permitted as food.</i>.

This one outside, how do you treat it? As having become impure outside or having become impure inside<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">To answer R. Samuel bar Rav Isaac’s question one first has to determine the status of impurity of the meat. It is accepted by everybody (and discussed in the last paragraph of this Tractate) that sacrificial meat outside the place appropriate for its consumption is biblically disqualified and rabbinically impure. The modalities of burning depending on the status of the impurity are in dispute in Mishnah <i>Šeqalim</i> 8:6–7.</i>? Rebbi Yose said, since it is disqualified because of its place it becomes as if having become impure outside. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, it is pure by the words of the Torah. You have decided that it be impure. It is not enough that you decided that it be impure, but you also want to make it as if having become impure outside?

Rebbi Yose said, that is, for merit<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">If one follows all the rules, both <i>Pesaḥ</i> and the daily evening sacrifice have to be brought at 3:30 pm.

If you are saying so, you are eliminating <i>between the evenings</i> of the <i>Pesaḥ.</i> If you are keeping <i>between the evenings</i> of the <i>Pesaḥ,</i> are you not eliminating <i>between the evenings</i> of the daily sacrifice? If you are neglecting <i>between the evenings</i> of the daily sacrifice now, you can observe it at other times. If you are neglecting it now for the <i>Pesaḥ,</i> when can you ever observe it?

Could not both be brought simultaneously? Rebbi Yose said, the sheep is second, the <i>Pesaḥ</i> is not second. It was stated: Rebbi Nathan says, every day the daily sacrifice was slaughtered at eight and a half, and brought at nine and a half. What means “every day”? Every Passover Eve.

Rebbi Ḥananiah said before Rebbi Mana in the name of Rebbi Yudan.

If one slaughtered for its purpose with the intent to pour its blood not for its purpose, it is disqualified.

If one slaughtered for its purpose with the intent to burn its parts not for its purpose, would that not be <i>piggul</i>? If at the moment of burning he does not think, then if one would come to perform a certain action without thinking, one continues the thinking from another action<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 5:2:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.5.2.6">Note 71</a>, the intent at the moment of the action after the pouring of the blood cannot have retroactive influence on the validity of the sacrifice.</i>.

What results from the difference between them? Rebbi Samuel ben Eudaimon said, switching on the other days of the year.

Rebbi Yose said, from that of Rebbi Eleazar one may deduce two [conclusions].

But if from the start there was explicit intent to include incapable or disqualified persons, the intent was disqualifying (S. Liebermann).</i>.

For those who eat it in volumes of an olive and those who cannot eat it in volumes of an olive, it is qualified<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">This is the normal case mentioned in the Mishnah.</i>. For those who eat it in volumes of an olive and those who cannot eat it in volumes of half an olive, it is qualified <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i>.

It is possible that there be hope from him. They sent and called him. The said to him, did you ever hear, if the Fourteenth falls on the Sabbath, whether <i>Pesaḥ</i> pushes aside the Sabbath or not? He told them, do we have only one <i>Pesaḥ</i> which pushes aside the Sabbath every year? Are there not many <i>Pesaḥim</i> which push aside the Sabbath every year? There are Tannaim who state: 100.

He started to explain to them by analogy, by an argument <i>de minore ad majus,</i> and by equal cut. By analogy: The daily sacrifice is a public offering and <i>Pesaḥ</i> is a public offering. Since the daily sacrifice as a public offering pushes aside the Sabbath, also <i>Pesaḥ</i> as a public offering pushes aside the Sabbath. By an argument <i>de minore ad majus.</i> Since the daily sacrifice, whose action is not subject to extirpation, pushes aside the Sabbath, it is only logical that <i>Pesaḥ,</i> whose action is subject to extirpation, push aside the Sabbath.

No, if you said this about daily sacrifices which are fixed in number, what can you infer for <i>Pesaḥ</i> which is not fixed in number?

No, if you said this about daily sacrifices which are most holy, what can you infer for <i>Pesaḥ</i> which is a simple sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The relationship between daily sacrifice and <i>Pesaḥ</i> is not that of minor and major; the argument is intrinsically invalid.</i>?

He told them, I was informed of the practice, but I forgot. But let Israel act; if they are not prophets they are descendants of prophets. Then everybody whose Passover sacrifice was a lamb stuck them in its fleece, for a kid goat he bound them to its horns; it turned out that the Passover sacrifices brought their knives with them. When he saw the action he remembered the practice. He told them, this is what I heard from Shemaya and Avtalion.

Incidentally by this act she becomes his wife, but this is not the point here. Since his act is in obeying a biblical commandment it cannot be sanctioned; even though he was negligent in not asking her whether sex with her was permissible; in the interpretation of R.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, if the act is [not]<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">An addition by the corrector which seems to be erroneous.</i> meritorious, for example two spits, one with slaughtered meat, the other with carcass meat, and he intended to eat from one but ate from the other<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence seems to be corrupt. Eating non-kosher meat is a simple violation, not a deadly sin whose commission in error would require a purification sacrifice. One might try to amend the text; which has been done in very many different ways, none of which is convincing. If one assumes that the uncorrected text is genuine, one has to assume, in the general spirit of the discussion, that the kosher meat is <i>sanctum,</i> whose consumption is meritorious. R. Joḥanan asserts that if the intended act was meritorious, the actual action, while a sin, cannot be sinful.</i>. A Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Šabbat</i> 19:4, about two babies to circumcise, one on the Sabbath and one on Sunday.</i>: “If he forgot and circumcised the one for Sunday on the Sabbath, Rebbi Eliezer makes him liable for a purification sacrifice but Rebbi Joshua declares him not liable.” In this case the act is not meritorious and Rebbi Joshua declares not liable. Samuel from Cappadocia said, the next day it is meritorious<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Since on Sunday the baby is lawfully circumcised, the Mishnah cannot be used to show that R.

<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The text from here to the end of the Halakhah is from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 19:4:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.19.4.2-3"><i>Šabbat</i> 19, Notes 110–141</a>. The connection with the topics here seems to be the mention of <i>mazzah</i> in the last two sentences.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is Rebbi Meïr’s, since Rebbi Meïr said, for something where there is a commandment performed one is not liable, but if no commandment is performed whether he is liable is disputed. Rebbi Simeon says, where there is a commandment performed one is liable, but if no commandment is performed whether he is not liable is disputed. Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Joḥanan: The words of Rebbi Meïr are, on condition that it be a sheep without blemish, a yearling, and a well-being sacrifice fit to be changed into a Passover sacrifice. One understands from this three consequences. One understands something which is not a fixed number. And which is not usually exchanged. And doing something which fulfills a commandment. What means “something which is not a fixed number”? Rebbi Jeremiah wanted to say that the Torah did not specify how many <i>Pesaḥ</i> sacrifices should push the Sabbath aside in any given year. Rebbi Yose wanted to say, where you cannot determine the amount. When Rebbi Yose came to these “children in doubt” he used to say, Rebbi Jeremiah taught us correctly. Could you say that you cannot determine the amount? But the Torah did not specify how many <i>Pesaḥ</i> sacrifices should push the Sabbath aside in any given year. Rav Ḥisda said, one may explain the words of Rebbi Simeon if a group was there which did not slaughter. Rebbi Zeˋira said, the word of Rebbi Yannai implies that he forgot and circumcised the one for the Sabbath on Friday. It he circumcised him in the morning, Rebbi Zeˋira said that Rebbi Yannai was of the opinion that he is not liable. Rebbi Abba said, he is liable. In relation to what did Rebbi Yannai say it? He comes to tell you in which cases can there be a switching of children. In Rebbi Zeˋira’s opinion following Rebbi Yannai Rav followed Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yose, what Rav Ḥisda said follows Rebbi Simeon, and what Rebbi Yannai said follows Rebbi Meïr. Can one object anything between Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Simeon? Do we find a difference between Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Simeon about the remainder? How do you treat the babies in doubt? Like something which is a fixed amount or something which is not a fixed amount? If you are treating it like something which is a fixed amount, even if there is no (one) [other] baby to circumcise. If you are treating it like something which is not a fixed amount, only if there remains (one) [another] baby to circumcise. Come and see: If he anticipated his time he is not liable, if he delayed his time he is liable? Rav Ḥuna said, the Mishnah is the other way around, as it was stated: Rebbi Simeon said, Rebbi Eliezer and Rebbi Joshua did not disagree about one which was to be circumcised after the Sabbath if he circumcised him on the Sabbath that he is liable, but one who was to be circumcised before the Sabbath if he circumcised him on the Sabbath where Rebbi Eliezer makes him liable for a purification sacrifice and Rebbi Joshua declares him not liable. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, because of this objection it was difficult for Rebbi Yannai, only if he forgot and circumcised the one of the Sabbath on Friday. Rebbi Ada bar Ahawah said, these are the words of Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Simeon, but the words of Rebbi Yose [are]: Even if no commandment is performed he is not liable since he erred on behalf of a commandment.
If he finished he can return only for fibers which would invalidate the circumcision. Rebbi Joḥanan said, the words of Rebbi Yose, even if he finished he may even return for fibers which do not invalidate the circumcision. Which [statement of] Rebbi Yose? That which we stated, “Rebbi Yose says, if the first day of Tabernacles falls on a Sabbath, if he forgot and took the <i>lulav</i> out into the public domain he is not liable because he took it out with permission.” Does the same hold for a knife for circumcision, the same for unleavened bread? Since Rebbi Joḥanan said, the words of Rebbi Yose, even if he finished he may even return for fibers which do not invalidate the circumcision; this implies the same even for a knife for circumcision, the same for unleavened bread.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> How does one roast the <i>Pesaḥ</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:9" href="/Exodus.12.9"><i>Ex.</i> 12:9</a> requires: <i>Do not eat from it raw, or cooked in water, but roasted in fire, its head with its hooves and its innards.</i></i>? A spit of pomegranate wood<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hardwood which will not ooze sap into the meat. The sap would cook the meat near the spit; and the meat may not be eaten as <i>Pesaḥ.</i></i> he sticks from its mouth to its buttocks and puts the hooves and its innards into it, the words of Rebbi Yose the Galilean. Rebbi Aqiba says, this is a kind of cooking<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since the innards will be heated not by the fire but by hot moist meat.</i>; but one hangs them outside.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “How does one roast the <i>Pesaḥ”</i> etc. Why of pomegranates? Rebbi Ḥiyyas bar Abba said, all wood oozes fluid, but of pomegranates does not ooze fluid. Where do we hold? If fresh, even pomegranate {[wood} oozes. If dry, all other wood does not ooze. But it is so: All other wood if it is dry outside still is moist inside. Pomegranate {wood} if dry outside is dry inside.

He said to them, just as the wooden one is not burned, so the metal one does not heat. They said to him, wood is not comparable to metal, for wood, if it is hot somewhere, is not hot everywhere, but metal if hot somewhere is hot everywhere.
There are Tannaim who stated, he sticks from its buttocks to its mouth. In the opinion of this <i>baraita</i> teacher he turns it around<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The argument implies that the lamb was roasted on a vertical spit, like shawarma.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Who is the Tanna of “majority”<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Discussion of the statement in the Mishnah, that <i>Pesaḥ</i> is celebrated in impurity if most (50%+1) of the people are impure. The following is an extended version of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 1:5:6" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.1.5.6">Halakhah 1:6</a> in <i>Horaiot</i>, where the problem is what is called “community”.</i>? Rebbi Meïr<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that everywhere 50%+1 represent “all”; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Horayot 5b" href="/Horayot.5b">Babli <i>Horaiot</i> 5b</a>.</i>, as it was stated: Either half of the tribes or half of each tribe, if only it be a majority<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">In order to trigger the ceremony required if <i>all the community acts in error</i>(<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:14" href="/Leviticus.4.14"><i>Lev.</i> 4:14</a>), by following an erroneous ruling either of the High Court at the central sanctuary or of a majority of tribal High Courts.</i>. Rebbi Jehudah says, half of each tribe, but only a majority of entire tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">The language is somewhat self-contradictory.

One tribe drags all tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">If one tribe has more members than all the others together, the action of one tribe triggers the obligation of all of them.

Rebbi Meïr says, all tribes are called “the public”<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The purification sacrifice for an erroneous ruling by the Court has to be brought by “the public” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:14" href="/Leviticus.4.14"><i>Lev.</i> 4:14</a>). The difference of opinions in the Mishnah is traced to different interpretations of this notion. R. Meïr holds that only the entire people of Israel qualify as “public”; RR. Jehudah and Simeon consider each tribe as a separate public. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Horayot 5b" href="/Horayot.5b">Babli <i>Horaiot</i> 5b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 80a" href="/Pesachim.80a"><i>Pesaḥim</i> 80a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Menachot 15a" href="/Menachot.15a"><i>Menaḥot</i>15a</a>).</i>. Rebbi Jehudah says, each single tribe is called “public”. What is between them? Dragging. Rebbi Meïr says, a single tribe does not drag all tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore he requires a separate sacrifice for the people of Israel in their entirety.</i>, but Rebbi Jehudah says, one tribe drags all tribes. And Rebbi Jehudah follows Rebbi Simeon. Just as Rebbi Simeon said, one tribe drags all tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Horaiot,</i> the opposite is asserted, that in this particular R. Simeon sides with R. Meïr; this also is required by the later statements in this Halakhah. R.

Even though Rebbi Jehudah says, one tribe drags all tribes, he agrees that only if the ruling came from the ashlar hall<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Even though each tribe has to bring its own sacrifice, the ruling of a tribal High Court cannot trigger an obligation of any other tribe; only the Court sitting at the central sanctuary has this power.</i>.

R. Jehudah argues that the verse promises forgiveness for all of Israel even if only one tribe followed an erroneous ruling; this proves that “one tribe drags all the other tribes.” R.

How does Rebbi Jehudah uphold Rebbi Simeon’s reason, <i>since the entire people acted in error</i>? Except if the beginning was criminal and the conclusion in error. Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Benjamin bar Levi: The verse supports him who said that each tribe is called “public”, as it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 35:11" href="/Genesis.35.11"><i>Gen.</i> 35:11</a>, said to Jacob after the birth of 11 sons. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Horayot 5b" href="/Horayot.5b">Babli <i>Horaiot</i> 5b</a>.</i>: <i>A people and a public of peoples will come from you,</i> and Benjamin was not yet born. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, just as they differ here, so they differ about impurity, as it was stated: If the public was half pure and half impure; pure [people] celebrate the first [<i>Pesaḥ</i>] and impure the second, the words of Rebbi Meïr.

They told him, there is no split Passover; either all celebrate in purity or all celebrate in impurity. Who is “they told him”? Rebbi Meïr. The argument of Rebbi Jehudah seems inverted, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Menachot 2:2" href="/Mishnah_Menachot.2.2">Mishnah <i>Menaḥot</i>2:2</a>.<br>The Mishnah refers to the two public cereal offerings which have to be baked, <i>viz.,</i> the weekly show-bread and the two leavened loaves presented at Pentecost.

In Rebbi Meïr’s opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">This name attribution seems to be in error since R. Meïr is quoted in the preceding paragraph that in this case the pure persons celebrate the First <i>Pesaḥ</i> and the impure the Second. One has to read “R.

If you are saying as a minority, the impure persons cannot make the Second<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">The formulation is not very clear. If one considers the impure (by the impurity of the dead) as a majority, then the service in the Temple is conducted in impurity, and the pure persons cannot make their sacrifice in purity. If the pure are considered a minority, there is no Second <i>Pesaḥ</i> for the impure.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, he did not say that a majority of pure persons cannot make the First, a majority of impure persons cannot make the Second. He only said, a majority of impure persons is not pushed to the Second <i>Pesaḥ</i><sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The problem only is apparent, not real. For the <i>Pesaḥ</i> to be offered in impurity one needs a real majority; a 50–50 split in practice is equal to a majority of the pure.</i><i>.</i>
In Rebbi Jehudah’s opinion, how does one act if they are half and half? Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav: One defiles one person with a crawling animal<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">He is impure, but can become free of impurity by immersion in a <i>miqweh,</i> which will make him pure for <i>sancta</i> at sundown. This kind of impurity does not prevent a person to be counted in a group eating the <i>Pesaḥ</i> in purity; accepting the person in the count of the impure is questionable; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 80a" href="/Pesachim.80a">Babli 80a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 80b" href="/Pesachim.80b">80b</a>.</i>. Samuel said, one sends one person on a far-away trip<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 80a" href="/Pesachim.80a">Babli 80a</a>. He automatically must bring the Second <i>Pesaḥ.</i></i>. This follows him who said, a single person clinches for impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 80a" href="/Pesachim.80a">Babli 80a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 6:2" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).6.2">Tosephta 6:2</a>.</i>. But for him who said, a single person does not clinch for impurity, one has to send two persons away. Rav’s opinion parallels Rebbi Eleazar, as Rebbi Eleazar said, if the public was touching carcasses, touching crawling animals, one makes it in impurity if there is not water there to immerse in; but if there is water to immerse in, one does not make it in impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Since these are impurities which are eliminated by immersion in water.</i>. Rebbi Eleazar said, if it comes while the Temple vessels are impure, comes in impurity; if it comes in impurity of Temple vessels, comes in impurity of hands, comes in impurity of knives<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">This means that <i>Pesaḥ</i> is brought in impurity if the necessary Temple implements are impure and cannot be purified in time; this could happen only in times of a siege of Jerusalem.</i>.
If the public were one third sufferers from gonorrhea<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">A person who suffers a single episode of gonorrhea is impure for the day and can be purified by immersion in a <i>miqweh.</i> If he has two episodes in at most two consecutive days, he is impure for seven days; after seven days in remission he can be purified by immersion in a <i>miqweh.</i> After three episodes he still needs seven days in remission but then is still prohibited <i>sancta</i> unless on the eighth day he brings a couple of birds as sacrifice to the Temple. A sufferer from gonorrhea who is impure for seven days, on the seventh day is a questionable candidate for <i>Pesaḥ</i> since if he suffers another episode he has to start all over again.</i>, one third impure<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Impure in impurity of the dead.</i>, and one third pure. Rebbi Mana in the name of Ḥizqiah: The sufferers from gonorrhea and the impure form a majority against the pure and one brings in impurity.

While healed sufferers from gonorrhea can bring the Second <i>Pesaḥ</i> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 9:7:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.9.7.2">Halakhah 9:1</a>), there can be no Second <i>Pesaḥ</i> if the First was celebrated in impurity.</i>. Rebbi Zeˋira said, they made the sufferer from gonorrhea like the apostate for ruling<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">If it is a question whether most of the people followed an erroneous ruling of the Supreme Court, apostates are not counted as part of the people.

As one says there, the apostate in matters of ruling neither adds nor subtracts, also here he neither adds nor subtracts.
If one of the members of a group became impure<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Impure in impurity of the dead.</i> but it is not known who it is, they must make the Second. If one of the public became impure but it is not known who it is, Rebbi Zeˋira said, they shall make the Second.

Since tradition fixes the inauguration of Tabernacle and Priesthood on a First of Nisan <i>(Seder Olam</i> Chapter 7, in the author’s edition p. 82; cf.

“An orphan for whom guardians<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">. If there are multiple guardians (Greek ἐπίτροπος, ὁ).</i> slaughtered may eat where he desires.” The Mishnah refers to an underage orphan. But an adult orphan is like one who subscribed to two <i>Pesaḥim;</i> as Rebbi Ḥiyya stated<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Pesachim (Lieberman) 7:3" href="/Tosefta_Pesachim_(Lieberman).7.3">Tosephta 7:3</a>; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 89b" href="/Pesachim.89b">Babli 89b</a>.</i>, one who subscribed to two <i>Pesaḥim</i> eats from the one which was slaughtered first<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore the adult orphan has no choice but the order of slaughter determines where he is obligated to eat.</i>.

“A slave of two owners may not eat from either of them.” Rebbi Yose said, his master has no right to say, it is impossible that you should be counted for a <i>Pesaḥ,</i> but he may say to him, you may not be counted for this one, only for that one<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">To resolve the problem spelled out in the Mishnah, one of the masters may bar him from his own <i>Pesaḥ</i> and thereby force him to eat from the other owner’s <i>Pesaḥ.</i> But he cannot forbid him a <i>Pesaḥ</i> since it is a biblical obligation.</i>. Sometimes he is counted for three <i>Pesaḥim</i> simultaneously. How is this? A slave of two owners must subscribe to a <i>Pesaḥ.</i> If one of them freed his part, he has to subscribe to another <i>Pesaḥ</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The part of his which is free cannot fulfill his absolute obligation with the dedication for the limited obligation of a slave.</i><i>.</i> If both of them freed, he has to subscribe to yet another <i>Pesaḥ.</i> Samuel bar Abba asked, may the slave eat from all three of them? If you are saying that the slave may not eat from all three of them, then he should not be able to subscribe to a <i>Pesaḥ,</i> since perhaps his master might want to free him and it turns out that an invalid dedication is mixed up in the offering<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">It is a biblical obligation that circumcised slaves eat from their master’s <i>Pesaḥ</i> (and the master is barred from <i>Pesaḥ</i> if he owns uncircumcised slaves). If manumission would invalidate the dedication, neither slaveholder nor his slaves would be able to eat any <i>Pesaḥ</i> since there always would be the possibility that the master manumit a slave which would retroactively invalidate the dedication and an undedicated animal may not be sacrificed. Therefore it is clear that manumission does not invalidate dedication.</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said that Rebbi Zeˋira asked, may the owner fulfill his obligation by the slave’s dedication? Is that not a Mishnah: “One says to his slave, go and slaughter the <i>Pesaḥ</i> for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 8:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.8.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>.

“A person who is half slave and half freedman may not eat of his master’s.” Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If a man who is half slave and half freedman preliminarily married a woman, one disregards his preliminary marriage. It is the same for divorce<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously if there can be no marriage there can be no divorce. Therefore the text, which also is copied in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Gittin 4:5:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.4.5.2"><i>Giṭtin</i> 4:5 (Notes 135–141</a>), has to be interpreted in the light of the explanation given there, following the House of Hillel who say that he works for his owner one day and for himself the other day. On his owner’s day he is a slave unable either to marry or divorce; on his own day he can marry preliminarily (but is unable to consummate the marriage, as explained there.) In <i>Giṭtin</i> and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:1:32" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.1.32"><i>Qiddušin</i>1:1 (Note 139</a>), the statement about divorce is a straight declarative sentence which is unchallenged. Here it is possible to read it as a question: is it the same for divorce? Samuel holds that since on his own day he may contract a preliminary marriage, just as a half-freed woman can contract a preliminary marriage to be consummated after her complete emancipation, so he can dissolve the preliminary marriage on his own day</i>. Samuel says, one takes notice of his divorce. Samuel’s statement parallels Rebbi Jehudah’s, as we have stated, “One who kidnapped a person half slave and half free Rebbi Jehudah declares punishable but the Sages make him not prosecutable.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">He delegates him to dedicate and slaughter the <i>Pesaḥ</i> without detailed instructions about what to do.</i>”

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If one says to his children, I am going to slaughter the <i>Pesaḥ</i> in the name of whoever of you will come first to Jerusalem. When the first of them entered with his head and most of his body, he acquired his part and acquires for his siblings with him. Forever one subscribes to it as long as there is the volume of an olive for each participant. One subscribes to it or cancels until it has been slaughtered; Rebbi Simeon says until the blood is poured.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Joḥanan said, there is no “I am going to slaughter” here, only “I am going to dedicate.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Since after slaughter the animal is Heaven’s property, nobody can acquire a part of the animal. If the Mishnah mentions that the first to come acquires his own part and those of his siblings, by necessity this must be for the dedication as sacrifice.</i>” And why was it stated “I am going to slaughter”?

He lets him subscribe to his [part] and the money automatically becomes profane. How? It becomes profane and then dedicated again? Or for this purpose it was dedicated from the start<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since no Mishnah in <i>Pesaḥim</i> mentions the monetary aspect, it is up to Amoraim to determine how to harmonize this exception with the generally known rules of dedication of <i>sancta.</i> Either the <i>Pesaḥ</i> after dedication is not considered a <i>sanctum</i> but becomes one piecewise when olive-sized parts of it are sold to a subscriber and the sanctity of the dedicated money is transferred to the piece of the <i>Pesaḥ</i> while the money becomes profane in the hand of the seller, as is the general rule for money dedicated for sacrifices which become profane in the hand of the seller of the animal which is dedicated in being bought as sacrifice, or the money dedicated for <i>Pesaḥ</i> has a status different from money dedicated for any other sacrifice in that it is intrinsically profane with the restriction to be used only for the <i>Pesaḥ.</i> Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 89b" href="/Pesachim.89b">Babli 89b</a>.</i>?

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Yudan asked, is it the same for the substitute of a reparation offering, that the substitute of a reparation offering is sacrificed and the substitute of a reparation offering is not sacrificed<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:10" href="/Leviticus.27.10"><i>Lev.</i> 27:10</a> prescribes that the status of an (illegal) substitute of a sacrifice is that of the sacrifice for which it is substituted.

Therefore it is decreed (Mishnsh <i>Temurah</i> 3:3) that in all cases the substitute of a reparation sacrifice (in contrast to substitutes of purification sacrifices) should be sent to graze until it becomes unusable, then be sold, and for the money one shall buy elevation sacrifices. The question is why, if the animal was lost and only found after the original had been sacrificed, it cannot be used directly as elevation sacrifice. No answer is given. As S.

Joḥanan ’s statement: “This is not <i>R.</i> Jehudah’s.”</i> Rebbi Joḥanan said, this is Rebbi Jehudah’s as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 8:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.8.7.1">Mishnah 8:7</a>.</i>, “One does not slaughter the <i>Pesaḥ</i> for a single person, the words of Rebbi Jehudah; but Rebbi Yose permits.” Therefore not of the Fourteenth. Did not Rebbi Joḥanan say, this is Rebbi Jehudah’s? Rebbi Yose said, does it proclaim that it is Rebbi Jehudah’s? As we have stated there, “One does not slaughter the <i>Pesaḥ</i> for a single person, the words of Rebbi Jehudah; but Rebbi Yose permits.”

Rebbi Levi said, he who eats <i>mazzah</i> on Passover Eve is like one who sleeps with his betrothed in his father-in-law’s house<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">After the preliminary but before the definitive marriage, when she is forbidden to him.</i>, and he who sleeps with his betrothed in his father-in-law’s house is flogged.

Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Rebbi ate neither bread nor <i>mazzah.</i> No <i>mazzah</i> because of that of Rebbi Levi, and no bread because of that of Rebbi Jehudah ben Bathyra. Was Rebbi a student of Rebbi Jehudah ben Bathyra? No, he was a student of Rebbi Jacob ben Qorshai.

Why did he not eat during this day? To enter the Sabbath with appetite<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore it seems that Rebbi fasted every Friday.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the detailed discussion of the Mishnah.</i> Rebbi Levi said, because usually slaves eat while standing, and here one is forced to eat lying on couches, to proclaim that they went from slavery to freedom. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: This olive-sized bit with which a person fulfills his obligation on Passover he must eat lying down. Rebbi Yose asked before Rebbi Simon, even a slave before his master, even a woman before her husband<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For the entire paragraph, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 108a" href="/Pesachim.108a">Babli 108a</a>.

Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Ada said, because it is not agreeable for a person to eat from public assistance, and here even from the tray<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In general, people are encouraged not to use public assistance even if they are entitled to it. But for the Passover <i>Seder</i> it is an obligation of the poor to apply even to the distribution of food in kind, which is more demeaning than distribution of money, if otherwise he could not fulfill the requirements of the meal.</i>.
It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 109a" href="/Pesachim.109a">Babli 109a</a>.</i>: “A man has to make his family happy on a feast of pilgrimage.

Women with what is appropriate for them, for example shoes<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Reading מסאנין. N. J.

He told him, let us infer the hidden from the explicit since Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, the Four Cups which they said add up to an Italic <i>quartarius</i> of wine.
There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 18:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.18.1.1">Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 18:1</a>.</i>: “One removes four or five baskets.” Rebbi Zeˋira asked Rebbi Joshiah, what is the measure of baskets?

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, it is Rebbi Jehudah’s.

May one drink them together? Since Rebbi Joḥanan  said about <i>Hallel,</i> if he heard it in the synagogue he has fulfilled his obligation, this implies that if he drank them together he fulfilled his obligation. May one drink them with interruptions? They said that he should drink, not that he should get drunk. If he drinks them with interruptions, would he not become drunk? May one fulfill his obligation with Sabbatical wine? Rebbi Hoshaia stated, one may fulfill his obligation with Sabbatical wine. May one fulfill his obligation with spiced wine? Since Bar Qappara stated, spiced wine is like wine, which implies that one may fulfill his obligation with spiced wine. May one fulfill his obligation with mixed wine? Since Rebbi Ḥiyya stated: the Four Cups which they prescribed, one may fulfill his obligation either with unmixed or mixed, on condition that it have the taste and looks of wine. Rebbi Jeremiah said, it is meritorious to fulfill one’s obligation with red wine. What is the reason? <i>Do not see wine when it shows its red color</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 23:31" href="/Proverbs.23.31"><i>Prov.</i> 23:31</a>.</i><i>.</i> It was stated, cooked for spice. May one fulfill his obligation with cooked wine? Rebbi Jonah said, one may fulfill his obligation with cooked wine. Rebbi Jonah follows his own opinion, since Rebbi Jonah drank his four cups in the Passover night and had a headache until Pentecost.
Rebbi Jehudah bar Ilai drank his four cups in the Passover night and had a headache until Tabernacles. A lady saw that his face was shiny. She said to him, old man, old man, one of three things applies to you. Either you are drunk from wine, or you are lending on interest, or you are raising pigs. He answered her, this woman’s spirit shall be blown away, not one of these three things applies to me, but my learning is ever present with me, as it is written, <i>a man’s wisdom illuminates his face.</i>
Rebbi Abbahu descended to Tiberias. The students of Rebbi Joḥanan  saw that his face was shining. They said before Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Abbahu found a treasure. He asked them, why? They told him, his face is shining. He said to them, maybe he understood a new teaching. He came to visit him. He asked him, what new teaching did you hear? He said, an old Tosephta. He recited about him, <i>a man’s wisdom illuminates his face</i>
Rebbi Ḥanina said, the <i>log</i> of the Torah is the old Sepphorean eighth of fish sauce. Rebbi Jonah said, I know it. In the House of Rebbi Yannai they were measuring honey with it. It was stated, half of the old Tiberian eighth. Rebbi Joḥanan  said, this one we used. Why did he not say, the old one? Because it was in his days. Some are saying, it was small, then was enlarged, and diminished, but it was not made small as before. What is the measure of a cup? Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Jehudah bar Pazi, Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Samuel: Two fingers by two fingers high a finger and a half and a third of a finger<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This value of 2×2×1<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub> = <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 7:10:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.7.10.2-4">7<sup>1</sup>/</a><sub>3</sub> cubic digits compares to a Babylonian value of 10.8 cubic digits (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 109a" href="/Pesachim.109a">Babli 109a</a>). A cubit is 24 digits. Various cubits were in use; therefore it is difficult to define this volume in modern terms. The variability of the cubit is mirrored in the Greek world by the many values given for the <i>stadion,</i> which varies from 148 m for the (Egyptian) <i>itinerant stadion</i> to the Greek sacramental 184 m. Based on the itinerant <i>stadion</i> and 1 mile = 7.5 stadia = 2000 cubits, one would obtain 91 cm<sup>3</sup> for the cup.<br>In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 10:5:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.10.5.3"><i>Terumot</i> 10:7 (Note 80</a>), a <i>log</i> is defined as (volume corresponding to a weight of) 200 denar. If volume of water is intended, this would make a cup of 155 cm<sup>3</sup>. In <i>Terumot</i> 5:3, the <i>log</i> is defined as the volume of 4 eggs, the <i>modius</i> (16 <i>log)</i> as 96 eggs (in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 83a" href="/Eruvin.83a">Babli, <i>Eruvin</i> 83a</a>, 217 eggs, which, however, refers not to the Roman but the Syrian <i>modius,</i> twice the volume of the Roman). For the standard <i>modius</i> of 8.536 1, this gives the volume of a cup as the standard <i>quartarius</i> of 133 cm<sup>3</sup> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 10:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.10.1.1">Note 1</a>).</i>. It was stated, dried like the volume of an olive, the words of Rebbi Nathan. The rabbis of Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Rebbi Nathan follows Rebbi Simeon. Just as Rebbi Simeon says, a <i>quartarius,</i> so Rebbi Nathan says, a <i>quartarius,</i> when it jells it will have the volume of an olive.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> What is the reason of the House of Shammai? The Sanctification of the Day causes the wine to be served; he was obligated for the Sanctification of the Day before the wine was served. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? The wine causes the Sanctification of the Day to be recited. Another explanation: The wine is frequent, Sanctification is less frequent.
Rebbi Yose said: From the words of both of them it follows that for wine and <i>Havdalah,</i> the wine comes first. Is not the reason of the House of Shammai that the Sanctification of the Day causes the wine to be served? But here, <i>Havdalah</i> does {not}<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Added from <i>Berakhot,</i> missing here, but logically necessary.</i> cause the wine to be served; wine therefore has precedence. Is not the reason of the House of Hillel that the wine is frequent, Sanctification of the Day is less frequent? Also here, wine is frequent and <i>Havdalah</i> is less frequent: the wine has precedence. Rebbi Mana said: From the words of both of them it follows that for wine and <i>Havdalah, Havdalah</i> comes first. Is not the reason of the House of Shammai that he was obligated for the Sanctification of the Day before the wine came? Also here, since he is obligated for <i>Havdalah</i> before the wine came, <i>Havdalah</i> has precedence.

Rebbi Zeˋira said: One infers from the words of both of them that one may make <i>Havdalah</i> without wine but one may not make <i>Qiddush</i> without wine. That is the opinion of Rebbi Zeˋira since Rebbi Zeˋira said: One makes <i>Havdalah</i> on alcoholic beverages but one goes from one place to another to hear <i>Oiddush.</i>
Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said: There, they have the custom that at a place without wine, the reader descends before the Ark, recites one benediction that contains seven, and closes by “He Who sanctifies Israel and the Sabbath Day”.
