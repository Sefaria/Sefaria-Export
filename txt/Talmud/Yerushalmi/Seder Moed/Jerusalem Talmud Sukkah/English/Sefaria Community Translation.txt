Halakhah 7

Rabbi Eliezer says: One is obligated to eat fourteen meals in the sukkah, one in the morning, and one at night [on each of the seven days of the festival]. And the Sages say: the matter does not have a dictated amount, except on the first nights of the festival [when there is an obligation to have a meal]. And Rabbi Eliezer also said: One who did not eat [a meal in the sukkah] on the first night of the festival can compensate [for his obligation by having a meal] on the last night of the festival. And the Sages say: in such a matter there is no compensating; regarding this it was said: (Ecclesiastes 1:15) "That which is defective cannot be amended, and the deficiency cannot be counted."
What is Rabbi Eliezer's reason? It is said here "sit". And it says later (Leviticus 8:35): "And you shall sit at the door of the tent of meeting day and night." Just as sitting later [the tent] the nights are like the days, so too here the nights are like the days. Rabbi Yohanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: It is written (Leviticus 23:6) "the fifteenth" in Pesach, and it is written (Leviticus 23:34) "the fifteenth" in Sukkot. Just as "the fifteenth" in Pesach means that the first night is obligatory [to eat matza], and afterwards is optional; so too here "the fifteenth" means that the first night is obligatory [to eat in the Sukkah], and afterwards is optional.

Chapter 3



Halakhah 1


R. Chiya taught: "And you should take for you" (Leviticus 23:40), of your's and not stolen. R. Levi said, one who takes a stolen <i>lulav</i>, to what is he similar? To one who gave the king food from his own [the king's] storehouses. They said, woe is he who's defender becomes his prosecutor.
A <i>shofar</i> [which belongs to] a non-Jew, or of an idolatrous city, R. [E]lazar says [it is] Kosher. R. Chiya taught that it is Kosher, R. Hoshaya taught it was not Kosher. Everyone agrees that a [stolen] <i>lulav</i> is not Kosher. What is the difference between a <i>shofar</i> and a <i>lulav</i>? R. Yosse says, regarding a <i>lulav</i> it is written "And you should take for you", from your's, and not from that which is forbidden to benefit from. However, here [regarding a <i>shofar</i>] it is written "A day of trumpeting should be for you," (Numbers 29:1) from any place. R. [E]lazar said, there [regarding a <i>lulav</i>]. he does the <i>mitzva</i> with its body, however here [regarding a <i>shofar</i>], he does the <i>mitzva</i> with its sound. And is there any sound which is forbidden to benefit from?
What is the dispute? When he stole an unprepared <i>shofar</i>. If he stole it and prepared it, he only owes him money. He stole a prepared <i>lulav</i> from here, a myrtle from there, and a willow from there and bound them together. We can learn it from the stolen <i>sukkah</i>. There are those who teach that it is Kosher and there are those who teach that it is not Kosher. R. Simon in the name of R. Yehoshua b. Levi [say], those who said that it is Kosher, it is when he stole the land. The one who said it is not Kosher is when he stole the foliage. And is it possible for him not to tie the foliage [and in doing so acquire it]? Yes, he puts it down on top. The Rabbis of Caesarea said in the name of R. Yochanan, either way, it is not Kosher. Which thing that is stolen is invalid? Anyone who enters into his friend's <i>sukkah</i> without his knowledge. Like the one of Gamliel Zuga, who built a <i>sukkah</i> in the marketplace. R. Shimon b. Lakish said to him, who let you?
