Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> An alley which is higher than twenty cubits should be reduced; Rebbi Jehudah says, this is not necessary<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:23" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.23"><i>Šabbat</i> 1, Note 142</a>. The status of an alley, a narrow public road bordered by walls of houses, essentially is that of a <i>karmelit.</i> Since such an alley is not a thoroughfare, it is customary that under certain circumstances the dwellers in houses opening on the alley can turn it into their common private domain. A prior condition is that the alley be a dead-end street; an alley open at both ends, while not a public domain in the technical sense, does not qualify directly. The second condition, mentioned only in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a>, is that the entrance to the alley must be well defined and immediately recognizable; this is done either by placing a horizontal beam over the entrance (קוֹרַה) or placing there a vertical lath (לֶחִי). The Mishnah presumes that a beam was used; the majority holds that a beam placed higher than 20 cubits is not noticed whereas R. Jehudah holds that it always is noticed.</i>. If it is wider than ten cubits it should be reduced<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The entrance to the alley should not be wider than 10 cubits.</i>; if there is a door-frame even though it is wider than ten cubits there is no need to reduce<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If there are two door-posts and a beam from one to the other, even if there are no doors, it is clear that the domain is visibly separated from the thoroughfare onto which it opens.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “An alley which is higher than twenty,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The same text also is the introduction to Tractate <i>Sukkah</i>1:1 (<b>ס</b>).</i> Rebbi Yose said it without attribution, Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rav: The rabbis inferred it from the door of the Sanctuary, but Rebbi Jehudah inferred it from the door of the Hall<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis hold that one does not realize that a beam is there to indicate a door if it is higher than 10 cubits since the entrance door to the Herodian Temple was 10 cubits. R. Jehudah disputes this since the inner door between the antechamber and the main room, visible only to the officiating priests, was larger. The biblical accounts of Solomon’s Temple (<a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 6:2-3" href="/I_Kings.6.2-3"><i>1K.</i> 6:2–3</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="II Chronicles 3:3-4" href="/II_Chronicles.3.3-4"><i>2Chr.</i> 3:3–4</a>) do not give measurements of the doors. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 2a" href="/Eruvin.2a">Babli 2a</a>.</i>. An argument from the door of the Hall is sufficient only up to forty cubits, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Middot 3:4" href="/Mishnah_Middot.3.4">Mishnah <i>Middot</i> 3:4</a>.</i>: “The door of the Hall was forty cubits high and twenty cubits wide.” Rebbi Ḥiyya stated, even forty or fifty cubits; Bar Qappara stated, even a hundred cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">He disputes any connection with Temple measurements since R. Jehudah rejects height limitations in general. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 2b" href="/Eruvin.2b">Babli 2b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Abin said, Rebbi Jehudah follows his opinion and the rabbis follow their opinion, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 9:1:2-5:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.9.1.2-5.3">Mishnah 9:5</a>.</i>, “and similarly one carries under panelled bridges on the Sabbath, the words of Rebbi Jehudah, but the Sages forbid it.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The bridge is supported by a structure of beams underneath with beams running lengthwise on both sides. R. Jehudah holds that the boundary of the space below the bridge is clearly indicated if there are virtual walls hanging down from the beams enclosing the space which therefore assumes the role of a house. The rabbis accept only real walls.</i>” As you are saying there, one considers the cross-beam<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Greek μέλαθρον, τό. This is a substantial load-carrying beam used in construction.</i> as if it came down<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">As a virtual wall, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.3">Note 40</a>.</i> and closed, here also one considers the roof as if it came down and closed. This is the opinion of Rebbi Jehudah in the case of a <i>sukkah,</i> this is his opinion in the case of an alley. Also the opinion of the rabbis in the case of a <i>sukkah</i> is their opinion in the case of an alley. But they do not compare<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the rabbis take 20 cubits as upper height limit for both the entrance to an alleyway and a <i>sukkah</i> is accidental since the rules in both cases diverge widely.</i>. There are items qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> which are disqualified for an alley and those qualified for an alley but disqualified for a <i>sukkah.</i> Double pointed stakes<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Greek δίκρανον, τό.</i> are qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley, and it was stated thus: If he brought four double pointed stakes and thatched over them it is qualified as a <i>sukkah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">One may make a <i>sukkah</i> by putting up four poles carrying a frame on which one thatches a roof on condition that the poles qualify as walls, i. e., each of them is at least 4 hand-breadths wide. Otherwise one would have to make makeshift walls between the poles as described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.9.1">Mishnah 9</a>.</i> but disqualified for an alley<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The poles carrying the cross beam may not be much higher than the walls of the alley (or the cross beam cannot be fastened to the tops of the poles, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 9a" href="/Eruvin.9a">Babli 9a</a> top).</i>. That is, if they are higher by more than three [hand-breadths] than the walls of the alley. But if they are not higher by more than three [hand-breadths] than the walls of the alley it is qualified. If they are not, but if they are four [hand-breadths] wide they are qualified even if arbitrarily high<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">If a pole qualifies as a wall it is clear that it may be 20 cubits high for the rabbis and arbitrarily high for R. Jehudah.</i>. Walls may be qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley, and it was stated thus: “Two regular and the third even one hand-breadth is qualified<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Sukkah (Lieberman) 1:13" href="/Tosefta_Sukkah_(Lieberman).1.13">Tosephta <i>Sukkah</i> 1:13</a>. A <i>sukkah</i> must be at least 10 hand-breadths high and the sides have to be at least 7 hand-breadths wide.</i>.” Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Two of four hand-breadths each and the third even one hand-breadth is qualified<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:9:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.9.1">Mishnah 9</a>, a space of slightly less that 3 hand-breadths is disregarded. Therefore a wall qualifies as being 7 hand-breadths wide if the actual material wall extends to slightly more than 4 hand-breadths.</i>. But for an alley only if it is closed in its four directions<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">It must have three actual walls and a symbolic door on the fourth side.</i>. Wider than ten cubits is qualified for a <i>sukkah</i> but disqualified for an alley<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.1">Mishnah 1</a> for the alley. There are no limitations on the surface area covered by a <i>sukkah.</i></i>. “If he drew a vine or squash.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This may refer either to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.4.1">Mishnah <i>Sukkah</i> 1:4</a> or to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Eruvin (Lieberman) 1:7" href="/Tosefta_Eruvin_(Lieberman).1.7">Tosephta <i>Eruvin</i> 1:7</a>; shortened to leave out all of the argument. The thatched roof of a <i>sukkah</i> must be vegetal material not connected to the ground. Therefore vine or squash are disqualified to be used for thatching. But a vine growing in an arch over the entrance of an alley is as good as a beam to mark the entrance.</i>” That means, up to an area of two <i>bet se’ah.</i> But more than an area of two <i>bet se’ah</i> it is a partition made for agriculture where one may transport only four cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">A vine used to designate the entrance to an alley may be used only if the total area of the alley does not exceed 5’000 square cubits since this is the maximal size of farming or ranching corrals permitted for Sabbath use. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 23b" href="/Eruvin.23b">Babli 23b</a>.</i>. If its sunshine is more than its shadow it is disqualified as <i>sukkah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sukkah 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.1.1.1">Mishnah <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1</a>. Since alleys usually have no roof, they are not expected to provide shade.</i> but qualified for an alley. A roofed <i>sukkah</i> is disqualified, a roofed alley is qualified<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The essence of a <i>sukkah</i> is its makeshift thatched roof; it is not a <i>sukkah</i> if it has a waterproof roof. But if the entrance to an alley passes under a permanent roof at least 4 hand-breadths wide it does not need any other sign at the entrance. If the alley is open at both ends and one end is roofed, it is considered a dead-end alley. Cf. S. Liebermann, <i>Tosephta ki-Fshutah</i> part 3, p. 309, on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Eruvin (Lieberman) 1:7" href="/Tosefta_Eruvin_(Lieberman).1.7">Tosephta 1:7</a>.</i>. Rebbi Immi in the name of Rav Oshaia:<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">It is difficult to decide between this reading, quoting Babylonians, and <b>ס</b> “R. Aḥa in the name of R. Hoshaia”, quoting Galileans. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 3a" href="/Eruvin.3a">Babli 3a</a> the rule is given in the name of other Babylonian Amoraim.</i> Not only roofed, but if he put there a cross beam four hand-breadths wide, it makes the alley permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">A cross-beam 4 hand-breadths wide is a roof and not subject to any restrictions imposed on beams or laths in order to permit carrying in an alley.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The text is copied by Nachmanides in his <i>Novellae</i> to <i>Eruvin</i> Chapter 4 (col. 596–597 in the edition Jerusalem 1973); a parallel for the entire paragraph is in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 46a" href="/Eruvin.46a">Babli 46a</a>. A defective copy (by the corrector) also is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 6:2:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.6.2.2">Chapter 6, Note 33</a>.</i> Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥinena in the name of Cahana: Practice does [not]<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The scribe wrote “not” and then [erroneously] crossed it out. Therefore it is missing in the printed editions.</i> follow Rebbi Jehudah. If it were not so what would we say? Rebbi Jehudah versus the Sages, practice should follow Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">It should not be necessary to mention that practice does not follow the lone dissenter.</i>? But since Rebbi Jacob bar Idi said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, practice follows the lenient opinion in <i>Eruvin,</i> and Rebbi Naḥman bar Isaac<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Read with the later text and the quote in Nachmanides: R. Isaac bar Naḥman.</i> said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, practice follows Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 4:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.4.5.1">Mishnah 4:5</a>, about a person who fell asleep in an uninhabited area on Friday afternoon and was sleeping during twilight, the Sages hold that since he did not consciously determine his place of rest at sundown he only can move inside 4 cubits from the place where he slept, but R. Joḥanan ben Nuri lets him move 2’000 cubits in every direction.</i>. (We asked about it, did not Rebbi Jacob bar Idi say in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, practice follows the lenient opinion in <i>Eruvin,</i> and Rav Naḥman bar Isaac said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, practice follows Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri.)<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The text in parentheses is duplicated afterwards; it is not in Nachmanides.</i> We asked about it, we would think this<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">That one follows the lenient opinion.</i> refers to an individual versus an individual but not an individual versus the Sages. There came Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Jacob bar Idi said in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi, practice follows Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri even though the Sages disagree with him. Why should practice not follow Rebbi Jehudah even though the Sages disagree with him<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">If practice follows R. Joḥanan ben Nuri as a matter of principle, it also should follow R. Jehudah in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.1">Mishnah 1:1</a>.</i>? Samuel said, practice follows the lenient opinion in <i>Eruvin.</i> Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said to him, for example what we have stated there, “and similarly one carries under panelled bridges on the Sabbath, the words of Rebbi Jehudah, but the Sages forbid it<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The bridge is supported by a structure of beams underneath with beams running lengthwise on both sides. R. Jehudah holds that the boundary of the space below the bridge is clearly indicated if there are virtual walls hanging down from the beams enclosing the space which therefore assumes the role of a house. The rabbis accept only real walls.</i>”? He told him, did I not say <i>Eruvin</i> but partitions<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The case of a bridge is not a case of <i>turning</i> a common domain into private domain but whether the space under a bridge automatically has the status of a permanent dwelling which does not need any <i>eruv.</i></i>? Cahana shares Samuel’s opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">He agrees with Samuel not only that in matters of <i>eruv</i> one follows the lenient opinion but also that the principle does not apply to questions of partitions. In the matter of an alley he holds that turning it into a private domain needs two things, first the fixation of the entrance partition described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.1.1.1">Mishnah 1:1</a> to which the principle does not apply, and the collection of an <i>eruv</i> as described in Chapter 2, to which the principle does apply.</i>. Therefore it was necessary to say that practice does not follow Rebbi Jehudah.
They only said “higher than twenty”. Therefor at the end of twenty it is qualified. This follows Rav who said that the end of measurements is for leniency; Rebbi Joḥanan said that the end of measurements is for restriction<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">As a general principle, every rabbinic statement that a quantity <i>x</i> is qualified up to a limit <i>a</i> is read by Rav as “<i>x</i> less or equal to whereas R. Joḥanan reads it as “<i>x</i> strictly less than <i>a</i>”. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 3a" href="/Eruvin.3a">Babli, 3a</a> (last line), the position of Rav is represented by the Babylonian Rava, that of R. Joḥanan by the Galilean Ulla.</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: For an alley whose beam is higher than twenty he puts another beam within twenty and this reduces to less than twenty<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 3b" href="/Eruvin.3b">Babli 3b</a>.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, on condition that the entire qualification beam be within twenty<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The upper rim of the beam must be less than 20 cubits from the ground.</i>. Rebbi Ḥilqiah said in the name of Rebbi Aḥa, even this comes following Rav, as Rav said that slaughter half by half is qualified, and why did they say that it is disqualified? Because of the visual impression<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Rav said that the upper bound is qualified in theory, in practice he will agree with R. Joḥanan that to avoid errors one has to be restrictive. His example is the rule that ritual slaughter requires that as biblical requirement half of both windpipe and esophagus of the animal have to be cut in slaughter. Nevertheless as a practical rule, since 50–50 is not exactly determinable by visual inspection, one requires that clearly more than half be cut in one stroke; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 29a" href="/Chullin.29a">Babli <i>Ḥulin</i> 29a</a>.</i>. For if you say that he has to put it within twenty, he would put it higher than twenty<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible to read מסטבה.</i>.
“It should be reduced.” How does one reduce? He makes a platform<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible to read מסטבה.</i> at the entrance of the alley and permits the alley. How much must it be? Rebbi Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia: Four hand-breadths for an alley<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is difficult. Rashba <i>(Novellae</i> to <i>Eruvin,</i> first paragraph) reads: כדי מקים “as a space”, an expression also used in the next paragraph. An area of four by four hand-breadths is a space for itself; cf. Mishnah Šabbat 11:3. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 10a" href="/Eruvin.10a">Babli 10a</a>, top.</i>. Rebbi Yose says, one hand-breadth corresponding to the beam<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah only requires that the beam not be higher than 20 cubits above ground, it is necessary to lift the ground only directly below the beam.</i>. The colleagues say, anything, since here is no longer a height of twenty cubits in the widths of a hand-breadth<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">This follows R. Joḥanan in the preceding paragraph and refers to the case that the beam is exactly 20 cubits above ground everywhere. Then lifting the ground by an arbitrarily small amount at an arbitrarily small area satisfies the requirement of the Mishnah.</i>.
If its height was less than ten hand-breadths one has to dig out. How much does he have to dig? Rebbi Aḥa said, four cubits as an alley<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Since 4 cubits is the maximum one is permitted to carry in the public domain, it is the minimum for an alley to require an <i>eruv.</i></i>. Rebbi Yose said, four hand-breadths as a space. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa, Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">For chronological reasons one has to read “Yasa” instead of “Yose”.</i> in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan, he makes a ditch at the entrance of the alley, ten [hand-breadths] deep and four wide; this permits the alley from inside and out<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">From the outside the ditch hinders the access from the public domain; from the inside the ditch is as good as a fourth wall which would turn the alley into a courtyard.</i>, on condition that it be within three [hand-breadths] of the walls of the alley<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Since a distance of less than 3 hand-breadths always is disregarded.</i>. And even he who says there four, here he agrees with three. There it is outside of the alley, but here within the alley<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The reference to 3 and 4 hand-breadths is to a text close to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Eruvin (Lieberman) 1:6" href="/Tosefta_Eruvin_(Lieberman).1.6">Tosephta 1:6</a>, a case where there is not one beam crossing from one wall to the one on the other side of the alley but short beams sticking out from either wall. If the distance between these beams is less than 3 hand-breadths for the rabbis and 4 for Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, the beams are considered adjacent and qualify as one beam. It is noted that Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel also will agree that a ditch, which is not dug as a marker but to qualify for the minimal height of the alley walls, cannot be farther than 3 hand-breadths from a wall.</i>.
If he made a stone fence at the entrance to the alley, ten [hand-breadths] high and four wide, it permits the alley from inside and out<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">There had been a stone fence but it collapsed and now the heap is not 10 hand-breadths high on a basis 3 cubits wide; it does not qualify as a wall but is part of the alley. Cf. Babli <i>Šabbat</i> 100a.</i>. If there had been a stone fence, if it reduces to ten hand-breadths within three<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">It is not known where to find a relevant statement of R. Meїr.</i> it needs a beam, otherwise it does not need a beam. There are Tannaim who state, within four [cubits]. He who says, within three [cubits], the rabbis. He who says, within four [cubits], Rebbi Meїr<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">If the incline covers a height of at least 10 hand-breadths the dwellers in the two parts of the alley may make separate <i>eruvim</i> without additional beam or lath.

If there was a slope in the middle of the alley, for those at the high end it acts as a ditch, for those at the low end as a stone fence<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">A short pillar which reduces the width of the entrance to 10 cubits allows an <i>eruv</i> for the alley.</i>.
“If it is wider than ten cubits it should be reduced.” How does one reduce? He puts a cross-beam<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Greek μέλαθρον, τό.

Rebbi permitted a porch in Bet Shearim. How many pillars did it have? Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa said, Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">For chronological reasons one has to read “Yasa” instead of “Yose”.</i>, one said, six, but the other one said, eight.

But if it was used by the public even with two it will be forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Since an alley can be permitted as private space only if it is used exclusively by the inhabitants of the houses opening into it and their guests, the same must hold for a virtual alley.</i>, if it is not used by the public even with many it will be permitted.

If a porch was totally open to the public domain<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 94b" href="/Eruvin.94b">Babli 94b</a> calls this “a porch in an agricultural domain”.

Rebbi Yose said, does not Samuel agree that an alley roofed higher than twenty cubits is qualified<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Since in a house one does not require that the ceiling be lower than 20 cubits.</i>? But Samuel must hold, only if the qualifying beam be within twenty cubits. There came Rebbi Aḥa, Rebbi Ḥinena in the name of Rebbi Hoshaia, only if the qualifying beam be within twenty cubits. Rebbi Yose said, even if Samuel would think that an alley roofed higher than twenty cubits is qualified, an alley is not comparable to a porch. An alley is made for the use of the adjacent houses, a porch is made for the use (of a thing)<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is difficult to understand, S.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The beam about which they spoke must be wide enough to carry a tile which is half a brick of three hand-breadths<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore the tile is 1.5׳3 hand-breadths<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup>.</i>; therefore it is sufficient for a beam to be one hand-breadth wide to accept the tile lengthwise<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since a hand-breadth is counted as 4 thumb-breadths, the tile will extend over the beam by one thumb-breadth on each side.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “The beam about which they spoke,” etc. Rebbi Abba said, to accommodate a row<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Greek δόμος, ὁ.</i> of tiles lengthwise. It was stated: Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says, to accommodate a row of tiles crosswise. What is the difference between them? Rebbi Ashian said, strength is between them. In the opinion of the rabbis, forty tiles. In the opinion of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, twenty tiles<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">The formulation seems self-contradictory. The length of the beam is assumed to be the standard 10 cubits which is 60 hand-breadths. A tile is 3 hand-breadths long and 1.5 hand-breadths wide. If the tiles are put on the beam lengthwise, the beam has to carry 20 tiles, if crosswise, there are 40 tiles. Of the medieval commentators, Rashba (col. 105, Note 446) quotes the text as given here but adds “it seems that the formulation is slightly corrupt.” His student Ritba (<i>ad</i> 13b, ed. Warsaw 22a) switches the places of 40 and 20. The same is true for Meïri (ed. Herschler, col. 68a) but since he gives a paraphrase rather than a copy of the text it is not clear how he read it.

Two beams, on each one half of a hand-breadth; how much can be between them? Rebbi Zeˋira said, half a hand-breadth. What is the difference between half a hand-breadth on either side and half a hand-breadth in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the rabbis in the preceding paragraph. If two beams protrude from the walls on each side, they can be counted as one only if 20 tiles can be put on them. Therefore the gap between them must be bridged by one tile which according to R.

When applied to beams, the author of the present statement holds that on each side the solid part must be larger than the gap. To accommodate one hand-breadth, on each side one needs 1/3+ε of solid material to justify a gap of 1/3 -ε for arbitrary ε&gt;0.</i>.

If a beam protrudes from one wall but does not touch the second wall, or there were two opposite ones, if the gap between one and the other is three hand-breadths it needs another beam, otherwise it does not need another beam.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One makes planks for wells, four double columns<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word seems to be a Greek-Hebrew hybrid, δύο-עֲמוּדִים “double column”. The circular well is in the middle of a square; at each corner one erects planks 10 hand-breadths high and on each side 6 wide. Since from each side one sees two planks, these are “4 looking like 8”. Since the opening between two planks, space in excess of the width of 6 cows for R. Meïr or eight for R. Jehudah, is more than what is permitted as opening of a wall of a private domain, special rules are needed to permit grazing animals to drink from a well. Even though the meadows on which they are grazing is public domain or <i>karmelit</i>, the well or cistern is private domain if it is at least 10 hand-breadths deep. Therefore one has to see to it that the animals drink in a private domain. R. Meïr requires a straight plank (of indeterminate width) after a 5 cubits opening.</i> which look like eight, the words of Rebbi Jehudah. Rebbi Meïr says eight which look like twelve, eight double columns and four simple ones, their height ten [hand-breadths], and their width six, and their thickness arbitrary.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One makes planks for wells,” etc. Since what is breached is more than what is standing he makes double columns but not simple ones, which proves by itself that it is because of access to the well.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Paragraph. “In addition, Rebbi Jehudah ben Bava said,” etc. Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Jonathan, they inferred it from the courtyard of the Tabernacle: <i>the length of the courtyard 100 cubits wide 50 by 50</i><sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 27:18" href="/Exodus.27.18"><i>Ex</i>. 27:18</a>. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 23b" href="/Eruvin.23b">Babli 23b</a>. The expression “50 by 50” is read as meaning that the standard measure of area shall be a square of 5’000 square cubits.</i>. 50 times 100 are 5’000. 70 by 70 are 5’000 minus 100, and we have stated “seventy cubits and a remainder.” And Samuel stated, they stated cubits and two thirds of a cubit. Seventy times two thirds and seventy times two thirds make 140 thirds each; 140 thirds and 140 thirds are 93⅓. There is missing from there 4/9 for the corner, there remain nineteen thirds minus one ninth. As we have stated, there is a slight difference which the Sages could not compute<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Since 70<sup>2</sup> = 4900 and 71<sup>2</sup>= 5041 the square root of 5’000 is between 70 and 71. In order to compute 70⅔<sup>2</sup> one uses the binomial formula in its geometric form: A square of sides 70⅔ is composed of a square of sides 70 + two rectangles 70 by ⅔ + a square of area 4/9 for a total of 49937/9. The difference to 5000 is 62/9 = 19/3 -1/9. The additional correction was a problem. Not only is the square root of 5000 irrational, not expressible as a fraction, but of the two square root algorithms used in Antiquity, the Babylonian, using a kind of Newton approximation, is an approximation from above and the Hellenistic, using an equivalent of modern continued fractions, starts with an approximation from above, when the legal situation here demands an approximation from below. 70⅔, is a reasonable rational approximation from below to √5000 since 707/9<sup>2</sup> already is &gt;5009. The second term of the continued fraction development is an approximation from below, 70140/197, not a practical expression. The systematic approximation of square roots from below which used to be taught in our schools is essentially dependent on the notion of place values underlying Indian- Arabic numerals. The first approximation of √5000 both in the Babylonian and the Hellenistic methods, 705/7, is an exceedingly good low-denominator approximation from above, (705/7)<sup>2</sup> = 500025/49, and therefore not usable in this context. The approximation of 70⅔ cubits allows a measuring error of 1 digit without exceeding √5000. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Eruvin (Lieberman) 4:9" href="/Tosefta_Eruvin_(Lieberman).4.9">Tosephta 4:9</a>.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph and the next are from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 3:3:2-4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.3.3.2-4"><i>Qiddušin</i> 3:3</a>, explained there in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 3:4:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.3.4.2-5">Notes 116–131</a>. It is clear that the text here is a copy from there since in the text “here” refers to <i>Qiddušin</i> and the discussion between R. Ḥaggai and R. Yose at the end of the paragraph has absolutely nothing to do with the Mishnah in <i>Eruvin</i> but asks why the conditional distribution of land to the tribes of Gad and Reuben (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 32:29-30" href="/Numbers.32.29-30"><i>Num</i>. 32:29–30</a>) required a double condition, both positive and negative; this is relevant only for <i>Qiddušin</i>. Similarly the next paragraph has no connection with the topics of <i>Eruvin</i>.</i> Paragraph. “A person may make his <i>eruv</i> conditional,” etc. So is the Mishnah: “A person can impose a condition on his <i>ˋeruvin</i>.” Rebbi Eleazar said, who is the Tanna of “if they came”, “if they did not come”? Rebbi Meïr! Which Rebbi Meïr? The colleagues say, Rebbi Meïr of <i>Qiddušin</i>. As it was stated: If somebody say to a woman: You are preliminarily married to me on condition that there will be rain. If rain fell, she is preliminarily married, otherwise she is not preliminarily married. Rebbi Meïr says, she is preliminarily married whether or not rain fell unless he doubled his condition. Everybody agrees that if he said, after rainfall, if it rained she is preliminarily married, otherwise she is not preliminarily married. (But following the rabbis she is preliminarily married whether rain fell or not.)<sup class="footnote-marker">138A</sup><i class="footnote">To be deleted with G and <i>Qiddušin</i>.</i> Rebbi Yose said, it follows Rebbi Meïr in <i>Eruvin</i>, as we have stated there: “If it is a matter of uncertainty„ Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Jehudah say, he is a donkey driver-camel driver.” Rebbi Yose said, Rebbi Meïr said this only as a restriction. Rebbi Mana said, that is correct. He cannot acquire his ˋ<i>eruv</i> since he is not able to enjoy it. [Why not] like the people of his place? If he had decided to leave his place. And here, she is not preliminarily married to the first, since no rain came. She is not preliminarily married to the second, since the first did not double his condition. Rebbi Ḥaggai asked before Rebbi Yose: Is this “if” not a reaction? He answered, there is a difference since the land was in their hand and he wanted to take it away from them.

Rebbi Jeremiah: Rebbi Ḥananiah, the colleague of the rabbis, asked: Why does it have to follow Rebbi Meïr but not also the rabbis? Did not Rebbi Abbahu say in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The following is the contract text: “I, X son of Y, contract a preliminary marriage with you, Z, daughter of U, on condition that I shall give you property A and definitively marry you by day B. If that day should pass without me having taken you in, I shall have no claim on you.” Why can he not say “on condition” but not double his stipulation? If he did not double his stipulation, could this eliminate the preliminary marriage? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, everywhere Rebbi Meïr holds that from “no” you infer “yes”, except here?

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If somebody slept on the road and did not realize that night fell he has 2’000 cubits in every direction, the words of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri, but the Sages say, he only has four cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody agrees that if he slept in a town during nightfall, his Sabbath domain is that of the town. But if he is outside of town, R. Joḥanan ben Nuri holds that he automatically has a Sabbath domain of 2’000 cubits in every direction but the Sages hold that a Sabbath domain can be acquired only by conscious selection. If he slept at sundown, he made no selection and has no domain. In the interpretation of the Yerushalmi, R. Jehudah agrees with R. Joḥanan ben Nuri but specifies that he may choose the center of his Sabbath domain at will and, therefore, walk 4’000 cubits in one direction (which must be chosen at the start and cannot be changed.)</i>. Rebbi Eleazar says, he is in the center; Rebbi Jehudah says, in any direction which he chooses. Rebbi Jehudah agrees that if he selected one he cannot retract it.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Paragraph. “If somebody slept on the road and did not realize until after night fell,” etc. Rebbi Zeˋira in the name of Rebbi Ḥasdai. The reason of Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri: Since if he had been awake he would have acquired a Sabbath domain, when he was sleeping he did not acquire a Sabbath domain; he only has 2’000 cubits in every direction. Rebbi Jehudah says, even awake and he did not acquire a Sabbath domain; he only has 2’000 cubits in every direction<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 4:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.4.7.1">Mishnah 9</a>, a Sabbath domain is a rectangular domain (for a single person a square) oriented exactly NS-EW.

For a single person the domain can be determined only by a conscious choice. In the absence of such a choice the Sabbath region is a circle, for the Sages of diameter 8 cubits, for RR. Joḥanan ben Nuri and Jehudah (possibly also R. Eliezer) 2’000 cubits. For RR. Joḥanan ben Nuri and Eliezer the place of the person at sundown automatically is the center of the circle, for R.

Rebbi Ḥuna said, Rav Naḥman bar Jacob asked: if a proselyte immersed himself after sunrise. “Since if he had been awake he would have acquired a Sabbath domain,” what does Rebbi Joḥanan ben Nuri say in this case? Let us hear from the following.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously there is a lacuna here, it is not said how to decide the question. A proselyte becomes Jewish by immersion in a <i>miqweh</i> for the purpose of conversion (for a male, after circumcision), attested to by a competent court. The latter condition excludes conversion on a Sabbath, a fact which Rav Naḥman bar Jacob, chief judge of the Exilarch’s court in Babylonia, must have known. The problem here is not about a proselyte but a general question about the Sabbath domain for a person who on Friday evening was unable or unqualified to choose a Sabbath domain; for example an insane person who became lucid overnight.

He said, this also is my opinion. He said to him, what did you see to say “the superstructure”? Or should we say these in the back of the superstructure<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">It is difficult to make sense of this argument. In the opinion of S.

Rav Naḥman said, at the end of the country<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">He has no objection against extending the Sabbath domain of a city to contain all the country.</i>.

May one add completion to completion<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">After the preceding argument it should be obvious that the answer is positive.</i>? The word of Rebbi Simeon implies that one adds completion to completion, since “Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai said, I can cause that one may walk from Tyre to Sidon, from Tiberias to Sepphoris, by caves and by barns.” Here for walking, there for completion<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">It could be that one finds a particular path that may be applied to one special situation.

Rebbi Aḥa said, the Elder Rebbi Ḥiyya and Bar Qappara disagree. One said, this you are saying only about a large city.

Rebbi Phineas said, it happened that a bright<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Greek εὔθικτος, -ον.</i> student studied completions for three and a half years from his teacher; he went and completed Galilee<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">He found enough barns and isolated farmhouses to make the entire Galilee into one Sabbath domain.</i>.

Rebbi Abba, Rav Jehudah in the name of Rav: If a town is built like a bow, if between the ends there is [a distance of] 3’999 [cubits] he walks its entirety and outside it 2’000; 4’000 he only has 2’000 cubits from the place of his <i>eruv</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The town is built as a semi-circle. If the radius of the circle is &lt; 2’000, every point in the semi-disk bounded by the circle and the chord (the diameter) joining its end-points is accessible from the semi-circle. Therefore the chord is the border of the completed town and the Sabbath domain is a semi-disk of radius 4’000 plus a rectangular domain of 4’000×2’000 based on the chord plus two quarter disks of radius 2’000. This would imply that the statement of the Mishnah that a Sabbath domain always is a rectangular domain only applies to cities compactly built in the shape of a polygon, and this not in all cases; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Eruvin (Lieberman) 4:4" href="/Tosefta_Eruvin_(Lieberman).4.4">Tosephta 4:4</a>.</i>. Rebbi Aḥa said, Rebbi Samuel explained it. If he would put his sandals at one place he could go outside and put them on; and if he would put his sandals at another place he could go outside and put them on. He could come from either side to the outside. From one side it is forbidden, from both sides it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">A line segment can be the border of the completion of a town only if all of its points are accessible from the town on the Sabbath. Therefore if the radius of the semi-circle is &gt; 2’000, a point distant almost 2’000 from one side is not accessible from the other and the center is not accessible from anywhere. Therefore the chord cannot be the border of the completion; the Sabbath domain only is the set of all points of distance at most 2’000 from any point of the semi-circle. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 55a" href="/Eruvin.55a">Babli 55a</a>.</i>.
Rebbi Abba in the name of Rav Jehudah. If there was a large city and in it a ditch ten [hand-breadths] deep and four wide, one looks where it is full of earth and pebbles. Otherwise one considers it open<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Translation and explanation are tentative. A ditch 10 deep and 4 wide is a domain by itself. If the ditch runs through the entire town, is nowhere filled or bridged, it splits the town into two separate towns; otherwise it is disregarded.</i>.
Rebbi Abba, Ammi bar Ezechiel<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The brother of Rav Jehudah.</i> in the name of Rav. If a city is built on the banks of a river, if between it and the river are four hand-breadths one measures from the wall, three one measures from the outer bank of the river<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The bank far away from the city; the river being considered as part of the city wall.</i> unless the river be [wide] more than 70 and remainder<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Then the outer bank cannot be considered part of the city and one has to measure the Sabbath domain from the city wall.</i>.

If a rabbinic Jew does not want to be friendly with his neighbors, he can refrain from contributing to the <i>eruv</i> and instead cede his rights to carry in the courtyard to the members of the <i>eruv</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Paragraph. “When may one start giving away rights?

Since the Mishnah is not on the list of those where the House of Shammai is more lenient than the House of Hillel (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Eduyot 4" href="/Mishnah_Eduyot.4"><i>Idiut</i> 4</a>), one has to emend the Mishnah and switch the places of “Shammai” and “Hillel”.

“If somebody gave away his rights and then brought out.” So is the Mishnah: If somebody ceded his rights, “whether in error or intentionally, he forbids.” So is the Mishnah: He does not forbid<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">R.

It was stated: “If two people were partners in a courtyard and one of them died, and the house fell as inheritance to an outside person.

Rebbi Meïr holds that the hand of the wife is the hand of her husband! Rebbi Ḥananiah said in the name of Rebbi Phineas, explain it following the Tanna who stated<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta <i>Ma</i>`<i>aser šeni</i> 4:7. The Babli <i>Qiddušin</i> 24a restricts the statement of R. Simeon ben Eleazar to the case where the wife inherited Second Tithe. Since R. Meïr holds that Second Tithe is Heaven’s money, the Second Tithe does not become part of the estate. If the wife now redeems the tithe with household money, the money is the husband’s but the tithe is not; therefore, no additional fifth is due. The Babli rejects the conclusion of the Yerushalmi here.</i>: “His wife cannot redeem Second Tithe for him. Rebbi Simeon ben Eleazar says in the name of Rebbi Meïr, his wife can redeem Second Tithe for him.” For that Tanna, Rebbi Meïr makes the hand of the slave the hand of his master but not the hand of the wife the hand of her husband!

If the sump was full, there are Tannaïm who state that one has to empty, there are Tannaïm who state that one does not have to. Rebbi Mana said, it is one Tanna. He who says that one has to plug forbids to pour out<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">He reads לשפוך as “to pour into the yard”. If it is necessary to plug the hole so that no water may flow from it into the public domain, it will be forbidden to pour anything into the yard for the rest of the day.</i>, he who says that one does not have to plug permits to pour out. Rehhi Ḥiyya bar Marius said to Rebbi Mana: So said your father Rebbi Jonah, thinking about it<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Reading בָּהּ for בר “outside”.</i>: If it is sloping<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Greek καταφερής, -ές.</i> inside, even more than ten is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously this has to read “forbidden”. If the yard is on an incline, any water spilled there will immediately flow into the public domain.

The Mishnah disagrees with Rebbi Joḥanan: “Courtyard and porch combine for four cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">If the sum of the areas is at least 16 square cubits nothing has to be excavated.</i>.” He explains it if they are level. A <i>baraita</i> disagrees with Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: The terrace, the roof, and the courtyard combine for four cubits. Still it is if they are level. You should know that it is so since it was stated: The house, the upper floor, the courtyard, and the porch do not combine. Is that not because they are not level<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Since the disagreement between R. Joḥanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish is not indicated, it is difficult to assess the meaning of the discussion. An educated guess (by <i>Qorban haEdah</i>) is that R. Joḥanan holds that domains can be added only if they are on equal heights; the questioner assumed that the porch was higher than the courtyard. In the <i>baraita</i> quoted as opposing R. Simeon ben Laqish it is clear that courtyard and rooftop cannot be of equal height. It is conjectured that he holds that the list of the Mishnah, yard and porch, is exhaustive; this would exclude terrace and rooftop. The answer is that he accepts yard and everything on the same level, porch and everything on the same level. In this interpretation the <i>baraita</i> does not allow one to add the surface areas of courtyard and rooftop.</i>?
Rebbi Jeremiah said, Rebbi Meïr and Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob both said the same. Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob as we have stated: “Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, on the Sabbath one may pour water into a sewer which is covered for four cubits in the public domain, but the Sages are saying, even from a roof or a courtyard 100 cubits [wide] one may not pour into the sewer.” Rebbi Meïr as it was stated: In large cities one may pour water into flows even though they are perforated, the words of Rebbi Meïr<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">If a river is diverted into many small currents which run in streets and through courtyards (as can be seen, e. g., in Freiburg i. B., Germany), one may pour water into them on the Sabbath since it will not be noticed.</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The main discussion about prohibitions added because people may get a bad impression, which also includes the text here, is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 9:1:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.9.1.9"><i>Kilaim</i> 9:2 (Notes 34–40</a>, <i>Eruvin</i> problem Note 39).

But if they are outside of three hand-breadths in exempt domain they are accessible as long as they do not form a domain by themselves, containing a square of edge length 4 hand-breadths.
