Jerusalem Talmud Taanit



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> From when does one mention the Power of rains<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In the second benediction of the <i>Amidah</i> which celebrates God’s power in resurrecting the dead, during the rainy season in the winter one inserts the formula mentioned later celebrating God’s power to bring or withhold rain.</i>? Rebbi Eliezer says, from the first holiday of Tabernacles, but Rebbi Joshua says, from the concluding holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The last holiday is the eighth day of Tabernacles which follows the seven days of dwelling in huts when one returns to dwell in houses.</i>. Rebbi Joshua said, since rain during Tabernacles is not a sign<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Greek σημεῑον.</i> of blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This also is Maimonides’s version. In the Babli “a sign of curse”, since rain (in Israel) during Tabernacles is a sign that Heaven is not interested in the Jews sitting in huts.</i>, why should he mention? Rebbi Eliezer said to him, he only says “He Who makes the wind blow and brings down the rain”, in its appropriate time. They answered him, if that is so, one should always mention it<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If the intent only is to refer to the winter months, the prayer could be said 12 months a year.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “From when does one mention the Power of rains,” etc. The reason of Rebbi Eliezer, because these four kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The 4 kinds of plants to be waved on Tabernacles, cf. <i>Sukkah</i> Chapters 3–4. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 2b" href="/Taanit.2b">Babli 2b</a>.</i> grow on water, they become attorneys<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Greek παράκλητος.</i> for water. Another explanation, when the slave serves all his master’s needs he asks for his reward from him. Rebbi Joshua said to him, is it not that when the slave has served all his master’s needs and his master is satisfied with him<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, by showing through the absence of rain that the service of the Jews is agreeable to Heaven.</i> that he asks his [sustenance]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s text, overwriting the scribe’s which probably was פרס, “reward”.</i> from him? Another explanation. The slave asks for his reward only close to the time when his reward is due<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In this version, R. Joshua would have preferred to start mentioning rain only at the presumed beginning of the rainy season.</i>. It was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 2b" href="/Taanit.2b">Babli 2b</a>.</i>: Rebbi Eliezer says, from the time one takes the <i>lulav</i>; Rebbi Joshua says, from the time he puts it down. In the opinion of the latter Tanna, the opinion of Rebbi Eliezer in the first is his opinion in the latter<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The earlier opinion is that given in the Mishnah, the latter that of the <i>baraita.</i></i>. The argument of Rebbi Joshua is inverted. There, he says from the concluding holiday, but here he says, from the time he puts it down<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the Mishnah he designates the eighth day of Tabernacles; his opinion in the <i>baraita</i> can be read as meaning that on the seventh day after morning prayers, when the <i>lulav</i> is no longer needed, one should start mentioning rain in his prayers.</i>. Rebbi Mana says, because the entire day is qualified to take the <i>lulav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">While weaving the <i>lulav</i> during morning prayers is preferred, the obligation can be discharged during the entire day. As a generally applicable rule, R. Joshua’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> also refers to the eighth day.</i>. Should he not mention in the evening<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Since the first prayer on the eighth day is the evening prayer, there seems to be no reason for R. Joshua to wait until the second prayer in the morning, which is the third after the start of the day.</i>? Not everybody is there. Then he should mention it in the morning. He would think that maybe they mentioned in the evening and he will mention. Since he sees that they do not mention in the first {prayer} but mention in the later {prayer}, he understands that they did not mention in the evening<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Joshua it would have been better to start mentioning rain in the evening prayer but this turns out to be not practicable.</i>. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Marius said to him, so was your father Rebbi Jonah arguing it.
Rebbi Ḥaggai in the name of Rebbi Pedat: It is forbidden for the individual to mention before the public reader mentions<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">At a place where there is public worship with a quorum of ten adults, no individual may recite his <i>Musaf-Amidah</i> before the reader in the synagogue starts. This version may be read to mean that the individual may not start mentioning rain unless he could have heard the mention in the repetition of the prayer by the reader.</i>. Rebbi Simon in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: Is the matter dependent on the public reader<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">He seems to hold that private prayers are not dependent on public worship even in places where organized synagogue worship is held regularly.</i>? Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Ḥaggai, do they disagree? He said to him: no. That which you are saying, is the matter dependent on the public reader? The individual if he wants to mention, he mentions dew<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">On the first day of Passover, when one stops mentioning rain after the morning prayers, every individual is free to mention dew in the benediction celebrating God’s power but not obliged to do it (in the Galilean rite.) This conforms to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a> which requires that one stop mentioning rain on Passover but does not require starting to mention dew.</i>. But what you are saying is: it is forbidden for the individual to mention before the public reader mentions rain<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In the fall, where <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.1.2.1">Mishnah 2</a> requires that the mention of rain be initiated by the public reader of the second <i>Amidah</i> of the last holiday of Tabernacles.</i>. If they rise for prayer it is as if the public reader mentioned it<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The public is required to mention rain in their silent prayer whether or not the reader notified them.</i>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following paragraphs are reproduced in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 5:2:2-8" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.5.2.2-8"><i>Berakhot</i>5:2 (Notes 63–86</a>); the origin is here. The theme is that God has to be praised for rain in the prayer for resurrection of the dead during the rainy season (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Berakhot 5:2" href="/Mishnah_Berakhot.5.2">Mishnah <i>Berakhot</i>5:2, Note 62</a>).</i> Just as the resurrection of the dead brings life to the world, so rains bring life to the world. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba understood it from here: <i>He will resurrect us after two days, on the third day He will raise us up and we shall live before Him. We shall know, we shall pursue to know the Eternal, like morning His appearance is well based</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Hosea 6:2-3" href="/Hosea.6.2-3"><i>Hos</i>. 6:2–3</a>. The first verse of Hosea clearly speaks of resurrection, the second verse ends: <i>it</i>(knowing God) <i>will come like rain to us, like late rains which pour on the Land.</i> The verses are further discussed in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 11:6:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.11.6.3"><i>Sanhedrin</i>11:8 (Note 117</a>), Babli <i>Rosh Hashshanah</i>31a, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 97a" href="/Sanhedrin.97a"><i>Sanhedrin</i>97a</a>.</i>.
It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 17:1" href="/I_Kings.17.1"><i>1K</i>. 17:1</a>.</i> <i>Elijah the Tisbite, from the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Aḥab: By the Living Eternal One, the God of Israel, before Whom I stood, there will not be dew nor rain these years except by my word.</i> Rebbi Berekhia said, Rebbi Yose and the rabbis. One of them said, he was heard both for dew and for rain; the other one said, he was heard for rain but was not heard for dew<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Berakhot</i> the two statements were added by the corrector. Since these are the essence of the argument in the entire paragraph, the original omission in <i>Berakhot</i> shows that the text there is not original.</i>, from<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>1K</i>. 18:1. But dew is not mentioned. Since the sequel is a justification for the inclusion of praise for giving dew, it shows that including the sentence “Who brings down dew” in the prayer for resurrection is Galilean usage (unknown in Babylonia), as noted by I. Elbogen (<i>Der jüdische Gottesdienst in seiner geschichtlichen Entwicklung</i>, Chapter 2, §9).</i>: <i>Go, appear before Aḥab and I shall give rain on the face of the earth</i>. He who said, he was heard both for dew and for rain, where was the vow of dew dissolved? Rebbi Tanḥum from Edrei said, they are of the opinion that a vow that was dissolved partially is dissolved totally<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A minority opinion of R. Aqiba (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 9:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nedarim.9.6.1">Mishnah <i>Nedarim</i>9:6</a>) that if in an earthly court part of a vow is annulled (because is was made under false intent), the entire vow is annulled. This is not the majority opinion and is not practice; therefore it does not imply Heavenly standards.</i>. Some want to say, on the occasion of the son of the woman from Sarepta: <i>He called on the Eternal and said, o Eternal, my God, also the widow with whom I am dwelling You are doing evil to kill her son</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 17:20" href="/I_Kings.17.20"><i>1K</i>. 17:20</a>.</i>. Rebbi Judah ben Pazi said, about one who stole a doctor’s bag<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Greek νάρθηξ, a plant (<i>Ferula communis</i>), word also used for “casket for unguents”. Hesiod has Prometheus carry off the fire in the stalk of a νάρθηξ.</i>. When he left, his son was injured. He returned to him and said: Please, sir doctor, heal my son. He said to him: Go and return my bag because it is full of medicines, and I shall heal your son. So the Holy One, praise to Him, said to Elijah: Go and lift the vow of dew because the dead are resurrected only by dew, then I shall resurrect the son of the Sareptan. And from where that the dead will live only by dew? <sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 26:19" href="/Isaiah.26.19"><i>Is</i>. 26:19</a>.</i><i>Your dead will live, the corpses will arise. Wake up and jubilate, those who dwell in dust! For a dew of light is Your dew</i>, וָאָרֶ֭ץ רְפָאִ֥ים תַּפִּֽיל. What means וָאָרֶ֭ץ רְפָאִ֥ים תַּפִּֽיל? Rebbi Tanḥum from Edrei said, “the earth will give up what is deposited in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">R. Tanḥum from Edrei explains the difficult phrase, <i>it will fell Netherworlds</i>, by reading תַּפִּֽיל in the sense of Mishnaic Hebrew “having a miscarriage”: The Netherworld will expel what is in its belly. (Read totally differently in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 111a" href="/Ketubot.111a">Babli, <i>Ketubot</i>111a</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 111b" href="/Ketubot.111b">111b</a>).</i>”
<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph explains the reasons of those who say that Elijah’s prediction that there would be no dew never came true.</i> Rebbi Jacob from Kefar Ḥanan in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish: When Abraham their forefather did My will, I swore to him that I never shall remove dew from his descendants forever; what is the reason? <i>The Eternal swore and He will not change His intention, you are appointed forever</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 110:4" href="/Psalms.110.4"><i>Ps</i>. 110:4</a>.</i>. And it is written there<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 110:3" href="/Psalms.110.3"><i>Ps</i>. 110:3</a>.</i>, <i>you have the dew of your youth</i>. Rebbi Judah ben Pazi said, by a will<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Greek διαθήκη.</i> I gave it to Abraham: <i>God may give you from the dew of Heaven</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 27:28" href="/Genesis.27.28"><i>Gen</i>. 27:28</a>. While this is Isaac’s blessing for Jacob, later (28:4) it is called “Abraham’s blessing”.</i>. Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman said, when Israel comes to sin by their evil deeds the rains are arrested. They bring an old man like Rebbi Yose the Galilean, he prays for them and immediately the rains come. But dew does not descend by the merit of any creature, what is the reason? <i>Which do not listen to anybody nor wait for humans</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Micah 5:6" href="/Micah.5.6"><i>Micah</i>5:6</a>. The verse starts, <i>like dew from the Eternal</i>, <i>like light showers on grass.</i></i>.
Rebbi Ze`ira in the name if Rebbi Ḥanina: When someone stood {praying} in the rainy season and mentioned dew one does not make him repeat. In the season of dew and he mentioned rain one makes him repeat. But is it not stated<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 3b" href="/Taanit.3b">Babli 3b</a>.</i>: The Sages did not oblige one to mention dew and winds but if he wants to mention them, he may mention? One cannot compare one who takes it easy<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And does not mention the dew which he needs, but mentions the rain out of season.</i> to one who does not pray and does not take it easy<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Who prays neither for dew, nor for rain, nor for winds, and therefore does not slight anything.</i>. “When he stood in the rainy season and mentioned dew one does not make him repeat.” But is it not stated: If he did not ask for it in the benediction “for years”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The ninth benediction where in winter one prays for rain, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 5:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.5.2.1">Mishnah <i>Berakhot</i>5:2</a>.</i>, or he did not mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead”, one makes him repeat? That is about one who mentioned neither dew nor rain.
Rebbi Ze`ira in the name of Rav Ḥuna: If he did not ask in the benediction “for years” he says it in “He Who hears prayer”. If he did not mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead” he says it in “He Who hears prayer”. If the request, made under duress<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The request for rain is made only in the rainy season, “under duress” when rain is urgently needed. The mention of rain in the second benediction already starts “under easy circumstances” around the time of the fall equinox, some weeks before rain is needed. The benediction “He Who hears prayer” is the last of the middle benedictions, #15 (in Babylonia #16) on weekdays.</i>, may be recited in “He Who hears prayer,” the mention, made under easy circumstances, so much more! But is it not stated: If he did not ask in the benediction “for years” or that he did not mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead”, one makes him repeat from the start<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As a tannatic statement, this has precedence over the statement of Rav Ḥuna. How can Rav Ḥuna present his statement about power of rains? [The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Berakhot 29a" href="/Berakhot.29a">Babli, <i>Berakhot</i>29a</a>, has the statement formulated here in the name of Rav Assi from the Yeshivah of Rav in Babylonia; the Babli mentions neither the statement of Rav Ḥuna, Rav’s student, nor the explanation of Rebbi Abbamari.]</i>? Rebbi Abbamari<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Brother of the Amora R. Yose of the fourth generation. In the <i>Berakhot</i> text, the statement is attributed to R. Eudaimon, another brother of R. Yose. Neither of the two brothers is mentioned in the Babli.</i> the brother of Rebbi Yose, said, if he did not say it in “He Who hears prayer”!
Where does he return to<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">If he forgot either prayer for or mention of rain, and realizes his omission at the end of the <i>Amidah</i>.</i>? Just as Rebbi Simeon bar Abba said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: On the day of the New Moon<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">When the day has to be mentioned in “Temple service”, the first of the last three benedictions; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:1:27" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.1.27"><i>Berakhot</i>4:1 Note 90</a>.</i>, if he had moved his feet<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">During <i>Amidah</i> it is forbidden to move one’s feet since the angels do not move their feet (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 1:1:18" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.18"><i>Berakhot</i>1:1, Note 61</a>). Hence, moving after prayer is the outward sign that prayer is finished.</i> he repeats from the start, otherwise from “Temple service”. Here also, if he had moved his feet he repeats from the start<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, he returns to “He Who hears prayer.”</i>.
At Nineveh<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This is not Biblical Niniveh but Naveh in the center of the Bashan plateau, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:1:19" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.1.19"><i>Demay</i>2:1 (Note 99</a>). (Eusebius mentions that the Jews call it Nineveh) On the Golan plain, one needs spring rains if the winter was relatively dry.</i> they needed to make a fastday after Passover<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 14b" href="/Taanit.14b">Babli 14b</a>.</i>. They came to ask Rebbi. He told them, go ahead and make one but do not change the form of prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Since if one fasts for rain one must pray for rain in one’s <i>Amidah</i>.</i>. Where may he say it? Rebbi Jeremiah thought to say that he says it in “He Who hears prayer.” Rebbi Yose said to him: Did not Rebbi Ze`ira say in the name of Rav Ḥuna: If he did not ask in the benediction “for years”, or that he failed to mention the power of rains in “resurrection of the dead”, he says it at “He Who hears prayer”? But Rebbi said to them, go ahead and make one but do not change the form of prayer! According to the opinion of Rebbi Yose, where does one say it? In the six that he adds<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Six additional benedictions that the reader inserts in the public prayer of fast days for rain, as explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.1.2.1">Mishnah 2:2–10</a>. Rebbi Yose implies that even a local fast for rain is a public fast.</i>. That works for the public which has six. A private person who does not have six, where? Rebbi Ḥinena said, did not Rebbi Ze`ira say in the name of Rav Ḥuna<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:4:9" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.4.9"><i>Berakhot</i>4:4 Note 212</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 31a" href="/Taanit.31a">Babli 31a</a>.</i>, a private person asks for his personal needs in “He Who hears prayer,” and these are his needs<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Here ends the parallel in <i>Berakhot</i>. In the last two paragraphs, the omissions in the scribe’s text of <i>Berakhot</i>, filled by the corrector as given in the readings, again show the originality of the text in <i>Ta`aniot</i>.</i>.
It was stated: If he prayed but does not know what he mentioned, Rebbi Joḥanan said, all of thirty days there is a presumption that what he is used to he (would mention) [mentioned]<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">There is no difference in meaning between the texts of the (scribe) and the [corrector], even though the scribe’s text seems more appropriate. Since it was stated in the paragraph before the last that the <i>Amidah</i> has to be repeated in whole or in part if the appropriate mention of or prayer for rain was omitted, the question arises what to do if the person does not know whether he recited the required text or not. Within thirty days one presumes that he has to repeat, after thirty days one presumes that he has not to repeat. Since prayers and prayer texts are purely rabbinic institutions, this must be accepted as rabbinic decree. The problem is not mentioned in the Babli; therefore it is accepted as universal practice.</i>. Rebbi Abba in the name of Rebbi Ḥuna: On the second holiday of the diaspora he mentions in the morning prayers but not in the <i>musaf</i> prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 4b" href="/Taanit.4b">Babli 4b</a> this is quoted as opinion of the Galilee trained Rav (a little more in detail, that on the 8<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> day of Tabernacles one mentions rain only for <i>musaf</i> and on the 9<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> one starts with <i>musaf</i> and from there on one continues in all prayers), but rejected by the autochthonous Samuel.</i>. Afternoon prayers like morning prayers and evening prayers like <i>musaf</i> prayers. Ḥananiah the son of Rebbi Joshua’s brother<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">His name, as was his father’s, was Ḥananiah ben Ḥananiah; two generations of posthumous sons. One avoids the mention of this unlucky circumstance by circumlocution. He was one of Samuel’s ancestors.</i> says, in the Diaspora<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This may mean either Babylonian in general or Nahardea, presumed residence of King Jojachin, in particular. From the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 10a" href="/Taanit.10a">Babli 10a</a> one understands that all of Iraq is included, from Nisibis to the Persian gulf.</i> they did not have this custom, but until sixty days after equinox. Samuel said, practice follows Ḥananiah the son of Rebbi Joshua’s brother<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 10a" href="/Taanit.10a">Babli 10a</a>.</i>. And it was stated thus: When was this said? Outside of the Land. But in the Land of Israel, everything according to the season, everything according to the event<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The standard commentators emend the text, switching the places of inside and outside the Land. This switch is unjustified. It is stated that in Babylonia uniformly one starts praying for rain on the 20<sup>th</sup> of November, 60 days after the fall equinox, but in the Land of Israel the different dates for starting to pray for rain given in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.1.3.1">Mishnah 4</a> are matters of local need or local usage (denied in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 10a" href="/Taanit.10a">Babli 10a</a>).</i>. That is, about rain. But dew, if he wants to mention the entire year he may mention it.
“Rebbi Joshua said, since rain during Tabernacles is not a sign<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Greek σημεῑον.</i> of blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This also is Maimonides’s version. In the Babli “a sign of curse”, since rain (in Israel) during Tabernacles is a sign that Heaven is not interested in the Jews sitting in huts.</i>, why should he mention? Rebbi Eliezer said to him, he only says ‘He Who makes the wind blow and brings down the rain’, in its appropriate time.” In its time it is desirable like the resurrection of the dead. Rebbi Yose said, I am wondering how the rabbis could compare rainfall to the resurrection of the dead, but they are not comparable. A person prays all the time for the dead to become alive. Does a person pray for rain to fall all the time<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Since the last sentence of the last Mishnah in this Chapter notes that in Palestine summer rain is a curse.</i>?
“They said to him, if that is so, one should always mention it<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from the Mishnah, not quite correct. It is the objection of R. Eliezer to R. Joshua’s statement.</i>.” The argument of Rebbi Eliezer seems inverted; the argument of Rebbi Joshua seems inverted<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is not about the prayer text of the <i>Amidah</i> but about the doxology of the introductory benediction preceding to <i>Amidah</i>, “praise to You, Eternal, Redeemer of Israel”. According to R. Eliezer, redemption uniquely depends on Israel’s actions; therefore prayer for redemption either is unnecessary because all of Israel are repenting or it is useless because not all of Israel are repenting; the prayer text should be forbidden as vain invocation of the Name. According to R. Joshua the prayer is legitimate but one cannot understand why during the summer one should not mention God’s power to give rain in its time just as one prays for redemption in its time.</i>. As they disagree: Rebbi Eliezer says, unless Israel repent they never will be redeemed, as it is said, <i>by repentance and satisfaction you will be helped</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 30:15" href="/Isaiah.30.15"><i>Is</i>. 30:15</a>. The interpretation agrees with the interpretation in Targum Jonathan ben Uziel.</i>. Rebbi Joshua said to him, if Israel would stay and never repent, would they never be redeemed? Rebbi Eliezer said to him, the Holy One, praise to Him, causes a hard king like Haman to rule over them and immediately they repent and are redeemed. What is the reason? <i>It is an evil time for Jacob and from it he will be helped</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 30:7" href="/Jeremiah.30.7"><i>Jer</i>. 30:7</a>.</i>. Rebbi Joshua said to him, but is it not written, <i>gratis you were sold and not by money you will be redeemed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 52:3" href="/Isaiah.52.3"><i>Is</i>. 52:3</a>. Not by money, but by repentance. The argument is switched between RR. Eliezer and Joshua in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Sanhedrin 97b" href="/Sanhedrin.97b">Babli, <i>Sanhedrin</i>97b</a>.</i>?

How much rain should fall that it is considered fertilizing<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The root רבע of רְבִיעָה may mean either “to lie down”, as an Aramaism parallel to Hebrew רבץ, or it may have the same sexual connotation as the synonym שכב. Therefore רְבִיעָה either may be interpreted as the rain which “lies down” on the earth and moistens it for agricultural use or as “fertilizing”.<br>There are two parallel traditions, both of Galilean origin. The text here is almost identical with <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Taanit (Lieberman) 1:4" href="/Tosefta_Taanit_(Lieberman).1.4">Tosephta 1:4</a>. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Taanit 25b" href="/Taanit.25b">Babli (25b</a>) and the Yerushalmi source <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bereishit Rabbah 13:13" href="/Bereishit_Rabbah.13.13"><i>Gen. rabba</i>13(13</a>), Rebbi Meïr is reported to require that the rains penetrate the depth of the penetration of the ploughs̮hare (which is assumed to be three hand-breadths,) whereas R. Yehudah says that for dry earth, one handb̮readth was enough, for average ground two handb̮readths, and for well worked ground, three handb̮readths. If these are two equivalent formulations, then the text here has to be interpreted in the light of the text in Babli/Midrash: Not that R. Meïr requires a rainfall of three handb̮readths (10.8 inches) in one storm (or R. Yehudah rainfalls of 3.6, 7.2, 10.8 inches, respectively) but that the moisture has to penetrate the earth to the depth indicated. In that case, “dry earth” is simply the earth after the rainless summer months, average earth is the earth after the first winter storms, and well worked ground is the earth after an uninterrupted rain of seven days (the first, second, and third fertilizing periods in the language of Tosephta Taaniot 1:4). R. Simeon ben Eleazar seems to object to both R. Meïr and R. Yehudah because rain will make the ground water level rise by twice the amount of rain water; hence, moisture in the ground can come from below as well as from above. One must assume that in the Yerushalmi also the measurements are those of moist spots in the earth and not of rainfall in the modern sense.</i>? If it fills a vessel of three handb̮readths, the words of Rebbi Meïr. Rebbi Yehudah says, the first rainfall one handb̮readth, the second one two hand breadths, and the third one three handb̮readths.

[This is the traditional interpretation, given by Ashkenazic Rabbenu Gershom and North- African Rabbenu Hanan`el. Rashi, sensing the apparent contradiction to R. Levi’s statement, has a prosaic interpretation, that on both sides of the street the gutters will spout water one towards the other.]</i>. <i>The earth shall open</i>, like a female who opens before a male; <i>they should bear fruit of help</i>, that is being fruitful and multiplying; <i>and justice shall sprout,</i> that is rainfall; <i>I, the Eternal, did create it,</i> for this purpose I created it, for the wellb̮eing of the world.

Heaven already did wonders. They asked him, when you were on the mountain, we said to you “much success” but you did not answer us? He told them, I was occupied in my work and did not want to divert my thoughts from my work. They asked him, and when you sat down to eat, why did you not invite us to partake? He answered them, because I had with me only my portion. What could I say to you in flattery? They asked him, why when you finished you put the coat on top of the load? He told them, because it is not mine. It is borrowed so I could pray wearing it. Why should I denigrate it?

Yose stated that the <i>baraita</i> contradicts Rav, he takes the <i>baraita</i> to mean that a private person always recites 18 benedictions on weekdays, never 19, even on fast days. The additional days are mentioned to point out that insertions for a private person are always accommodated in an existing benediction, never as an additional one, in contrast to the opinion of R. Aqiba who states in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 5:2:2-16" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.5.2.2-16"><i>Berkahot</i>5:2</a> that <i>Havdalah</i> Saturday nights is a separate benediction.

Rebbi Aḥa bar Isaac in the name of the older Rebbi Huna of Sepphoris: An individual must mention the occasion on the Ninth of Av.

Yose’s Academy. They do not disagree with the rule which they state, but they note that the <i>baraita</i> does not deal with it; its correct interpretation is by R.

If in the evening he starts with `He Who makes evenings dark’ and ends with `Creator of light’, he did not do his duty. But if he started with ‘Creator of light’ and ended with ‘Making evenings dark’, he did his duty. The principle is: Everything is determined by the seal.” The Babli asserts that if in evening prayers one started out wrongly with the text appropriate for morning prayers then everything is O.K. if only the final doxology is correct. But the Yerushalmi speaks of one “who is standing in morning prayers and mentioned evening”, i. e., he started out correctly, forgot himself in the middle, and remembered in time to close with the correct text. The principles of prayer texts were instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly. They determined the contents of the prayers but not, in general, their texts. (For the Amidah, a later Mishnah reports that Rebbi Eliezer holds that one who repeats the same text for more than 30 days cannot really be an honest supplicant). The question is whether, in addition to the contents, the Men of the Great Assembly only determined the “seals” (following the Babli) or also the introductory sentences (following this Yerushalmi, but incompatible with the poetic versions of the daily prayers known from Yerushalmi sources from the Cairo Genizah).</i>. Rebbi Aḥa said, all benedictions in the kind of their seals<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The language is difficult. R. Eleazar Askari in his Commentary to <i>Berakhot</i> explains that Rebbi Aḥa insists that only the “seal” counts and, therefore, the text preceding the “seal” is unimportant; the text of the seal cannot be a verse. R. Shelomo Cirillo and R. Moshe ben Ḥabib in their Commentaries to <i>Berakhot</i> explain, on the contrary, that the seal must fit the text of the benediction just preceding and that this text cannot be a verse. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Pesachim 104a" href="/Pesachim.104a">Babli (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 104a</a>) this principle is spelled out only for Havdalah.</i>.

The text here states that the only acceptable place for a Biblical verse is before the “seal“. Since the Mishnah prescribes benedictions on fast days whose text is a Biblical verse, what is prohibited is using a verse in the final doxology.</i>.

In addition, it is stated here that in contrast to the public Temple service, this prayer has to be private. It is authorized as public ceremony only for a genuine holy man praying for a community in distress.

If these data are unknown to the Cohen, logically he should be forbidden wine and work all his adult life. Since this is obviously a rabbinic restriction which is impossible to follow, the restriction must be waved and his detriment, that he does not know his place in the genealogy of priests, is his improvement in that he may work and drink wine any day where this is permitted to non-Cohanim.</i>” As you are saying, his detriment is his improvement that he may not deliver eulogies, similarly is (his detriment his improvement) [his improvement his detriment] that he would be forbidden to work<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">The text of this sentence is thoroughly garbled in the scribe’s, the corrector’s, and G’s versions but the meaning is clear as explained in the preceding Note.</i>?

Halakhah 12

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Anywhere it is written in the Scroll “not to deliver eulogies”, before it is forbidden, afterwards is permitted. Rebbi Yose says, before and after are forbidden. “Not to fast”, before and after it is permitted; Rebbi Yose says, before is forbidden, afterwards permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">The “Scroll” is the “Scroll of fasts”, a late pre-Mishnah document mostly commemorating victories either of Maccabeans against Seleucids or revolutionaries against Romans, or Pharisees abolishing Sadducee usages.

Both are incompatible with a holiday spirit. In the Babli, the attribution to R.

All sources of <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> support the version in <i>Megillah</i>, here given in &lt;braces&gt;, that days of fast are fewer than days of no eulogies.</i>” Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said, why does it say “on them” twice? To teach that the night is permitted but the day forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">No restrictions apply to the night of the day mentioned in the Scroll.</i>. As it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megillat Ta`anit</i>, end of Month of Adar.</i>, “therefore a person who takes it on himself has to forbid himself in prayer.” Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, that he must mention it on the preceding evening<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">If a person intends to fast on a day where this is prohibited by <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i>, he has to start in the evening and mention his fast in the prayer.

This comes following what Rebbi Ze`ira said in the name of Rav Huna: Similar to Friday night and Sabbath day.
The Mishnah either follows Rebbi Yose on the eleventh or Rebbi Meïr on the twelfth<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following paragraph refer to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 1:3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.1.3.1">Mishnah <i>Megillah</i>1:5</a> where it is stated that even though if the Purim scroll cannot be read on the 14th, one reads it on one of the preceding days, this does not mean that the Purim celebration and the concurrent prohibition of fasting and public mourning are extended. Now <i>Megillat Ta`anit</i> for the month of Adar notes rabbinic festive days on the 12th and the 13th, Purim on 14th and 15th, and other holidays on 16th and 17th. Therefore the statement that one may fast and publicly mourn before the official Purim date certainly cannot apply to Adar 13th, and on first look also not to Adar 12th. Since the holiday on the 12th is rejected in the Halakhah, the Mishnah in <i>Megillah</i> may apply to Adar 12th for R. Meïr who does not extend the influence of rabbinic holidays to the preceding day, but only to Adar 11th for R. Yose following his opinion recorded here in Mishnah 14.</i>.

Only the last reading can be interpreted as “Trajanus”, and it is difficult to imagine that any happy occasion for Jews should be connected to this name.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One blows the <i>shofar</i> because of any danger which menaces the public except an overabundance of rain.<br>It happened that they said to Onias the circle-drawer, pray for rain. He said to them, go and shelter the Passover ovens so they should not get softened. He prayed but no rain fell. What did he do? He drew a circle, stood inside it, and said: Master of the World! Your children trusted me since I am like a familiar before You. I am swearing by Your great Name that I shall not move from here until You show mercy for Your children.<br>Rain started to drip.

On the other hand, as Rosh points out, the previous paragraph certainly implies that the עֲנֵנוּ prayer recited on all fast-days except Yom Kippur, not only on those for rain, must be recited also for <i>Musaf</i> since the day requires that the text be inserted in all prayers. One may at least understand the position of Rebbi Abba that on a fast day for rain which coincides with a day of the New Moon, one recites the usual <i>Musaf</i> with an additional fifth benediction which deals with the fast day, after the fourth for the New Moon. The dissenting opinions of Rebbis Ze`ira and Abba bar Mamal seem to imply that <i>Musaf</i> on a fast day consisted of the introductory and final benedictions that are common to all prayers and the additional benedictions for the fast day, whereas the section on the New Moon, for which <i>Musaf</i> is recited in the first place, is moved from its regular place to an insert in either the 16th or the 17th (“thanksgiving”) benediction.</i>.

Rebbi Yose met Rebbi Jehudah bar Pappai; he said to him, did you hear this from your father? He said to him, my father said this only about Eintab.

He said to him: Tomorrow, when I enter the assembly hall, stand up and ask me about this practice. The next day, this student stood up and asked Rabban Gamliel: What is about evening prayer? He said to him: It is obligatory. He said to him: But Rebbi Joshua told me that it was voluntary. Rabban Gamliel said to Rebbi Joshua: Are you the one who says it is voluntary? He answered him: No. He said to him: Stand up on your feet so that they may testify against you. Then Rabban Gamliel was sitting down and lecturing while Rebbi Joshua was standing up until the people started talking and said to Rebbi Ḥuṣpit the interpreter: Send the people home. They said to Rebbi Zenon the <i>ḥazan</i>: Start<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The ḥazan was not only the reader in congregational prayers, but also the general organizer of religious affairs.

They immediately appointed Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah to the Yeshivah when he was 16 years old; his head became all white. Rebbi Aqiba sat and was sad; he said, not that he is a greater Torah scholar than I am, but he comes from a greater family than I do; hail to the man whose forefathers created merit for him, hail to the man who has a peg to hang on to.

How many seats were there? Rebbi Jacob ben Sisi said: Eighty seats were there of accomplished scholars, not to count those standing behind the railing.

It means that the scholars sat there in rows like vines in a vineyard. Rabban Gamliel went immediately to pacify each one in his house. He came to Rebbi Joshua and found him occupied with the making of needles. He asked him: This is how you earn your living? He answered him: Until now you did not know? Woe to the generation whose caretaker you are! He said to him: I humble myself before you. They sent a washerman to Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah, but some say that it was Rebbi Aqiba. He told him: The sprinkler, son of a sprinkler, should sprinkle. Should anyone who is neither a sprinkler nor the son of a sprinkler say to the sprinkler: your water is water from a cave and your ashes are ashes from a fireplace? He said to him: You made your peace with him! I and you shall go in the morning to Rabban Gamliel’s door. Nevertheless they did not remove him from his dignity but made him head of the court.

A Samaritan said to him, do not go away, for I am seeing what to do that the city will submit to you. He went to the city gate, entered, and found Rebbi Eleazar from Modiin standing in prayer. He showed himself as if he would whisper into his ear. The people of the city saw him and brought him to Ben Koziba. They said to him, we saw this old man turning to your uncle. He asked him, what did you say to him and what did he say to you? He answered, if I shall tell you, the king will kill me; but if I do not tell you, you will kill me. It is better that the king should kill me but not you. He told him, he said to me, I will make the town submit to the king. He came to Rebbi Eleazar from Modiin. He asked him, what did this Samaritan say to you. He answered, nothing. What did you say to him? He answered, nothing. He kicked him and killed him.
