Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One waters irrigated plots on the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In this Tractate, “holiday” always means “intermediate days of Passover or Tabernacles.” While there is no verse forbidding work on these days, by rabbinic custom only agricultural work necessary to avoid losses and not involving excessive effort is permitted.</i> and in the Sabbatical year both from a well which flows newly<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Even though there is some work involved in guiding the waters of a new source to the plots.</i> and from a well which does not flow newly, but neither from rain water nor from pumped water<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Greek κήλων “pump-handle”. Pumping water for intensive agriculture would be excessive work on a holiday.</i>, nor does one make beds for vines<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Walled circular depressions around vines for purposes of irrigation. They may be serviced but not made anew.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One waters irrigated plots,” etc. One understands a well which does not flow newly. A well which flows newly? Is that not requiring effort<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since the water has to be directed to the desired spot, a bed has to be dug for the stream. This may involve more work than compatible with the idea of a holiday. (Differently in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 2a" href="/Moed_Katan.2a">Babli, 2a</a>.)</i>? But it follows Rebbi Meïr, as Rebbi Meïr says, one uses it to irrigate even a field depending on rain water<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The general rule is that agricultural work is forbidden unless needed to avoid loss. A new well is a precious source; to waste its water would be great loss. Since the water is not yet channelled, it may be directed to any place desired.<br>A field not irrigated depends on rain water. The expression <i>bet habba`al</i> really is idolatrous since <i>Ba`al</i>, like the Greek Zeus, is rain (considered the god of rain).</i>. Rebbi Yose said, it is the opinion of everybody if it was one and became two or its waters were few and it was blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In this case also no new bed has to be constructed.</i>. We have stated thus<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Moed Katan (Lieberman) 1:1" href="/Tosefta_Moed_Katan_(Lieberman).1.1">Tosephta 1:1</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 2a" href="/Moed_Katan.2a">Babli 2a</a>.</i>: “From a well which flowed newly one irrigates even a field depending on rain water, the words of Rebbi Meïr; but the Sages are saying one uses it to irrigate only an irrigated plot which dried up<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In this case also no new bed has to be constructed.</i>.” In the opinion of Rebbi Meïr one irrigates from it something not in danger of loss and something requiring effort. In the opinion of the rabbis one irrigates from it only something in danger of loss and only if not requiring effort. What do the rabbis say if there is danger of loss but it requires effort<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This case is not covered by the Tosephta.</i>? Let us hear from the following: Anything which is continuously losing value is an irrigated plot<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Even a field used in extensive agriculture becomes one of intensive culture if it needs additional water to save the crop.</i>. When it stopped weakening it is a field depending on rain water; the disagreement between Rebbi Meïr and the Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">R. Meïr but not the Sages would allow additional irrigation.</i>. How long does it have to be irrigated to become an irrigated field? Only if was irrigated two, three days before the holiday? Let us hear from the following: The Qabray<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">An otherwise unidentified Iraqi brook.</i> dried up three days before the holiday, and it came back on the holiday. The case came before Rav Ḥuna who said, those weakened shall be irrigated, those not weakened may not be irrigated<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A direct application of the rule spelled out before, following the Sages. In addition, it shows that anything happened more than 3 days before the holiday is disregarded, answering the question.</i>. Rebbi Jonah and Rebbi Yose instructed about that cool shadowy place which was sown with barley that it should be cut on the holiday to avoid their cracking and being lost<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">They extend the rule which turns extensive into intensive agriculture to all cases, not only the supply of water.</i>.
One understands pumped water. Rain water? Rebbi Joḥanan said, they decided about rain water because it is like pumped water<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 4a" href="/Moed_Katan.4a">Babli 4a</a>.</i>. Rebbi Bisna in the name of Rebbi La: They stated this only on a holiday; therefore in the Sabbatical it is permitted. <sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">There is a close parallel to this text in <i>Ševi`it</i>2:10 (Notes 107–109).</i> What is the difference between Sabbatical and holiday? In the Sabbatical when work is permitted they permitted both activities requiring effort and activities not requiring effort. On a holiday when work is forbidden they only permitted to avoid loss and only activities not requiring effort. Some want to understand it from the following: In the Sabbatical which is extended they permitted, on a holiday which is short they forbade. <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">From here on to almost the end of the Tractate there are Genizah fragments edited by L. Ginzberg (G).</i> Then these last seven days should be compared to the seven days of a holiday and be forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The last seven days of the Sabbatical then should be treated like intermediate days of a holiday in these matters. Since this is nowhere stated, the second argument is rejected.</i>.
Rebbi Jeremiah asked, what is the status of uninterrupted rest-water<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Water which is caused by rain but at the time of use it does not rain.</i>? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Mikvaot 1:5-6" href="/Tosefta_Mikvaot.1.5-6">Tosephta <i>Miqwaot</i>1:13</a>.</i>: “What is rest-water? All the time that it rains and the mountains are muddy<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is rain water, of restricted use for <i>miqwaot</i>.</i>; after the rain stopped and the mountains still are muddy it is rest-water. When they are no longer muddy it is like cistern water.” How far? Ḥiyya bar Abun<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Usually he is called R. Ḥiyya; the reason for the omission of his title and the addition of his patronymic are a riddle.</i> in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Until the soft soil<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Translation following G, reading the word as Arabic ברתׄ.</i> produces flowers. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Tanḥum ben Rebbi Ḥiyya: Until they become like goose feet<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That single drops are spread out like the impressions of goose feet.</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah asked: If the soft soil produced flowers before it stopped? Is it considered like a source<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Which purifies everything immersed in it.</i> retroactively or only for the future? In which respect? If he immersed in it needles and hooks<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Crotchet needles. These are small and can be immersed in water too shallow to be used to immerse larger items but still part of a connected body of water measuring 40 <i>seah</i>.</i>. If you are saying that retroactively it is considered like a source they are pure, only for the the future they are impure. Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Yose asked, how do you treat these waterfalls<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Latin <i>cataracta</i>, explanation of Arukh, completely justified by the reading of G.</i>? Like pumped water or not like pumped water? May one irrigate from a pond which was filled from a well, but water supply from the well stopped? Let us hear from the following: “but one irrigates neither from rain water nor from pumped water<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Greek κήλων “pump-handle”. Pumping water for intensive agriculture would be excessive work on a holiday.</i>.” Where do we hold? If in a time when it rains, is it not as if irrigating the ocean<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following arguments can be summarized simply by stating that the original source of the water in the pond is irrelevant. Using the water for irrigation on a holiday is permitted if the pond is replenished by a permitted source and forbidden if replenished by a forbidden source. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 4a" href="/Moed_Katan.4a">Babli 4a</a>.</i>? But we must hold in the time when the rain stopped. If it is in the time when the rain stopped, is this not like a pond which was filled from a well, but water supply from the well stopped? Since you are saying that one does not irrigate from it this implies that one does not irrigate from a pond which was filled from a well, but water supply from the well stopped<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following arguments can be summarized simply by stating that the original source of the water in the pond is irrelevant. Using the water for irrigation on a holiday is permitted if the pond is replenished by a permitted source and forbidden if replenished by a forbidden source. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 4a" href="/Moed_Katan.4a">Babli 4a</a>.</i>. May one irrigate from a pond which was filled with pumped water but one channelled well water into it<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Latin <i>piscina</i>.</i>? Let us hear from the following: One irrigates from an irrigated field which drips into another irrigated field. Rebbi Jeremiah said, as long as it drips. Is one able to irrigate because of the dripping, is it not rather because it is full? This implies that one irrigates from a pond which was filled with pumped water but one channelled well water into it. Samuel stated thus: One does not irrigate on a holiday from pools<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Latin <i>piscina</i>.</i> and ponds which were filled before the holiday. But one irrigates without hesitation if a water channel passes through them.
“Nor does one make beds for vines<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Walled circular depressions around vines for purposes of irrigation. They may be serviced but not made anew.</i>.” The beds are furrows around the roots of the trees, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kelim 29:7" href="/Mishnah_Kelim.29.7">Mishnah <i>Kelim</i> 29:7</a>.</i>, “the handle of the spade is four {handbreadths}<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the division of Mishnaiot in the Babli where the second part of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Moed Katan 1:1:2-8:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Moed_Katan.1.1.2-8.2">Mishnah 1</a> is formulated as separate Mishnah.</i>.”

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah says, one does not make new water canals on the holiday or in the Sabbatical year but the Sages are saying that one makes new water canals in the Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since this is construction rather than agricultural work, it is permitted in the Sabbatical but forbidden on the holiday.</i> and one fixes the broken ones on the holiday and one repairs all defects in the public water system and cleans it<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As the Babli explains, since commercial building activities are forbidden on the holiday, hiring people for public works helps the poor to find work and helps the public by keeping the wages low since there is no competition from the private sector.</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The following is repeated from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Shekalim 1:1" href="/Mishnah_Shekalim.1.1">Mishnah <i>Šeqalim</i>1:1, Notes 4–8</a>.</i> Also one repairs the roads, and the streets, and water pools, and one looks after all public needs, and marks the graves, and also goes to inspect for <i>kilaim</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the division of Mishnaiot in the Babli where the second part of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Moed Katan 1:1:2-8:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Moed_Katan.1.1.2-8.2">Mishnah 1</a> is formulated as separate Mishnah.</i> There, we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševi`it</i> 3:2.</i>: “Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah forbids unless he raises or lowers by three {hand-breadths} or puts it on a rock.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">While in the Sabbatical it is forbidden to work to ameliorate the fields, it is permitted to assemble dungheaps on or close to the fields to be used after the end of the Sabbatical. In Mishnaiot <i>Ševi`it</i>3:1–2 there are differences of opinion on whether it is necessary to clearly separate the dungheaps from the fields and how this is to be done.</i>” <sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">From here to the end of the paragraph the text is copied from a text of <i>Ševi`it</i> close to, but separate from, the text there, as shown later when the Mishnah here is quoted as “there”.</i> One may give two explanations. If he had a small amount{of manure} in his house from before the Sabbatical and he wants to transport it to his field during the Sabbatical, he may continuously add to it after the sinning sinners<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">A misreading of עוֹבְדֵי עֲבוֹדָה “agricultural workers” in the <i>Ševi`it</i> text. The agricultural workers will stop at the end of the harvest of the year preceding the Sabbatical.</i> stopped. Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah forbids it. What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah? Maybe there will be no more manure and it turns out that he fertilizes that place. It turns out that Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah parallels Rebbi Yose. Just as Rebbi Yose says<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">His position in Mishnah <i>Ševi`it</i> 3:1 may be interpreted in this way.</i>, manure is not easily found, so Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah says, manure is not easily found. One may give another explanation: If he had a small amount{of manure} in his house from before the Sabbatical and he wants to transport it to his field during the Sabbatical, he may continuously add to it after the sinning sinners stopped. Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah forbids it. What is the reason of Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah? Maybe there will be no more manure and it turns out that he fertilizes that place. Is it not already fertilized from before the Sabbatical<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since the addition is permitted only at a place already used as dungheap before the start of the Sabbatical.</i>? Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal: because of the bad impression, unless he transports ten boxes together<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Then everybody sees that the intent is to built a dungheap, not immediate use as manure.</i>. Do the rabbis not care about bad impressions? Rebbi Idi said his stick, his basket, and his shovel prove that he intends to make a dungheap. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun applied these traditions from here, as we have stated: “Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah says, one does not make new water canals on the holiday or in the Sabbatical year.” Rebbi Jeremiah<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">With the text in <i>Ševi`it</i> one has to read “R. Ze`ira” since in the next sentence R. Jeremiah is quoted accepting another opinion.</i> said, because he would prepare its banks to be sown. Rebbi Jeremiah, Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal: because of the bad impression. They wanted to say, the one who says there “because of the bad impression” also here “because of the bad impression”. The one who says there “because he would prepare its banks to be sown”, what would you have here? The only answer would be, “maybe there will be no more manure and it turns out that he fertilizes that place.” What is the difference between them? If he dug a water canal for a building. They wanted to say that the one who said there “because of the bad impression” also here “because of the bad impression”. The one who says here “because he would prepare its banks to be sown”, clearly here its banks will not be prepared to be sown. Everybody agrees that if he assembled there stones, pebbles, lime, or cement<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Greek γύψος.</i> it is permitted.
“One fixes the broken ones on the holiday.” If it is for the needs of the holiday, but anything not for the needs of the holiday is forbidden for an individual, however for the public even not for the needs of the holiday it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 5a" href="/Moed_Katan.5a">Babli 5a</a>.</i>. As the following<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Parallels to these examples are in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Moed Katan 4b-5a" href="/Moed_Katan.4b-5a">Babli, 4b–5a</a>.</i>: the baths of Sakuta were damaged on the holiday and Rebbi Abbahu permitted them to be repaired on the holiday. If it needs exertion and he planned it, we would not say so, only if he did not intend his work for the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Even for public works.</i>. They said, if it is not done now it never will be done. <sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">From here on there exists a parallel text from remainders of an Ashkenazic text edited by Jacob Suzman, <i>Kobez al-Yad</i> 12 (A).</i> The cauldron of Sepphoris was damaged on the holiday. The colleagues wanted to say that it is permitted from the following, “one repairs all defects in the public water system.” Rebbi Phineas said, Rebbi Jeremiah only forbade because of the rules of the hammer<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the High Priest Joḥanan forbade the use of hammers on the intermediate days of a holiday, <i>Ma`aser Šeni</i> 5:9.</i>. The cemetery of Bar Meqatia was damaged on the holiday. Rav Ḥuna was of the opinion that it is permitted from the following: “and one looks after all public needs.” Rebbi Mana told him, but did not Rebbi<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The title is omitted in A. Either one reads Rav Huna, Samuel, and Rebbi Mana I, or Rebbi Huna, Rebbi Samuel, and Rebbi Mana II.</i> Samuel state, “only to smooth its fissures<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">One may repair but not rebuild.</i>.”
“And cleans it.” One cleans it, as we have stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Mikvaot 4:3" href="/Mishnah_Mikvaot.4.3">Mishnah <i>Miqwaot</i> 4:3</a>.</i>, “he who cleans a pipe to get pebbles.”

“One marks the graves.” Were they not already marked in Adar?

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, one draws water from tree to tree, but he should not water the entire orchard. Produce which was not irrigated before the holiday he may not irrigate during the holiday. However, the Sages permit in both cases<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">One may irrigate an entire orchard tree by tree and irrigate any produce grown in intensive culture, since otherwise the farmer would incur substantial loss. However the water must be led from one tree to the next by a narrow channel, to avoid irrigating the entire surface area of the orchard.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This text is copied from <i>Ševi`it</i> 2:10 (Notes 102–109). In G, the text is replaced by a Note: “One repeats up to ‘forbidden’.”</i> Rebbi Mana said it anonymously, Rebbi Abun in the name of Samuel. They disagree anonymously<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishnah is in the name of R. Eliezer ben Jacob, not anonymous, it follows that the majority, whose opinion is disregarded, must disagree.</i>. Where are we holding? If they are widely spaced everybody agrees that it is forbidden. If they are tightly planted everybody agrees that it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">An orchard is widely spaced if the rules of <i>Kilaim</i> would permit to plant crops in the space between the trees; tightly planted if this is not possible.

But we deal with the case that they are planted ten to a <i>bet seah</i>. Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob treats it as widely spaced, the rabbis treat it as tightly planted. So the rabbis said, if widely spaced it is forbidden to irrigate<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Irrigate the entire orchard at the same time.</i>; may one continue<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Water the depression around one tree and then let the water flow in a narrow channel to the next tree, to avoid watering possible growing areas of vegetables.</i>? Let us learn the opinion of the rabbis from that of Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob. Just as Rebbi Eliezer ben Jacob says, it is forbidden to irrigate but permitted to continue, so the rabbis say that it is forbidden to irrigate but permitted to continue. Did we not think that according to everybody if they are widely spaced it is forbidden; but is white dust<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The earth of a “white field”.</i> not as if widely spaced? But here it is the Sabbatical, there the holiday. <sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Copied from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Moed Katan 1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Moed_Katan.1.1">Halakhah 1, Notes 19–21</a>.</i> What is the difference between Sabbatical and holiday? In the Sabbatical when work is permitted they permitted both activities requiring effort and activities not requiring effort. On a holiday when work is forbidden they only permitted to avoid loss and only activities not requiring effort. Some want to understand it from the following: In the Sabbatical which is extended they permitted, on a holiday which is short they forbade. <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">From here on to almost the end of the Tractate there are Genizah fragments edited by L.

“However, the Sages permit in both cases.” What means “in both cases”? Whether it was irrigated before the holiday or was not irrigated before the holiday? But both for tree and for vegetable.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> Similarly, if his wine was in the cistern and mourning or an emergency happened to him<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">By circumstances beyond his control he was prevented from pressing the olives before the start of the holiday.</i>, or he was mislead<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">He hired workers who did not show up.</i>, he may stir and treat and plug normally, the words of Rebbi Yose.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Rebbi Ze`ira said, it only says “if his wine was in the cistern.” Therefore to start is forbidden. Where do we hold? If it was time to harvest the grapes and he did not harvest, he caused the damage to himself. If it was not time for the grape harvest, what could he have done?

Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi in the name of Rav: One is permitted to knit a net on the holiday to catch fish on the holiday.

Therefore if the rabbinic rules for mourning are modelled on the biblical of the <i>nazir</i>, the Mishnah gives support both for the 30th and the 31st as days of shaving by the mourner.</i>, he shaves for the first on the 31st day, for the second on the 61st day.” Rebbi Yose said, there after it happened, here from the start<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">R.

R. Zeriqan seems to hold that what is acceptable after the fact in biblical rules is permitted from the start in rabbinic usage.</i>. Rebbi Jeremiah instructed Rebbi Isaac from Aṭoshia, and some say, Rav Ḥiyya ben Rebbi Isaac from Aṭoshia, to shave on the 30th day, following the Mishnah: “Eight days, the decree of 30 days is waived for him.” The eighth has the same status as the 30th day<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">The argument here goes as follows: If the 8th day of mourning was holiday eve, the mourner can shave in the afternoon in preparation for the holiday. The time elapsed from dawn to the afternoon is counted as a full day for him. Therefore, the person who shaves on the 30th day can nevertheless count the entire 30th day as being part of his mourning period.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, there is a difference; there they permitted in order to honor the holiday. You should know this, since Rebbi Ḥelbo, Rav Ḥuna said in the name of Rav: If his eighth day fell on the Sabbath, he shaves Friday. If you say that they did permit not in order to honor the holiday, then even if his 30th day falls on the Sabbath, he should shave Sabbath eve<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Nobody permits shaving on the 29th day.</i>.

It was stated: One makes no consolation visits on New Year’s Day and the Day of Atonement. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, one makes consolation visits on the Day of Atonement which falls on a Sabbath. As the following: Something happened to Rebbi Ḥizqiah. The rabbis came to pay him a consolation visit on the Day of Atonement. He said to them, did they not say that one makes no consolation visits on New Year’s Day and the Day of Atonement? Not because of prayer? There is a difference, concerning the Day of Atonement which falls on a Sabbath; there is a difference, concerning the Day of Atonement which falls on a weekday.

Rebbi Joḥanan said, really low. Rebbi Eleazar in the name of Cahana follows Rebbi Jehudah. If following Rebbi Jehudah, he should not tear at all! How about this?

Meïr interprets the verse to mean that in mourning he may not tear his garment in the way other people do The Mishnah is R. Meïr’s.
