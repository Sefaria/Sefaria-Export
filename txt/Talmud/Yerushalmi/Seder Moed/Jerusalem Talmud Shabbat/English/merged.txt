Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> There are two [kinds] of transport on the Sabbath which are four [kinds] inside, and two [kinds] which are four [kinds] outside<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sabbath it is forbidden to move any load from a private to the public domain (or for a distance of at least 4 cubits in the public domain.) Inside a private domain there are no restrictions unless the article may not be moved at all. While any transport between domains is forbidden, it is a prosecutable offense only if there is a completed action, i. e., one person lifted the item up, transported it, and put it down. This applies both to transport from the private domain to the public one (“inside”) and <i>vice versa</i> (“outside”). In each case, the transport may be effectuated either by the person inside or the person outside (in which case the person is prosecutable but the person standing in the other domain is not involved) or it may be taken up by one person, taken over while moving by another person who then puts it down. In this case both participants have sinned but are not prosecutable. The possible cases are enumerated in Mishnaiot 1–4. “Liable” and “not liable” refer both to the possibility of prosecution for intentional Sabbath desecration and the obligation of a purification sacrifice in the case of unintentional infraction.</i>. How is this? The poor man stands outside and the householder inside. If the poor man stretched out his hand inside and delivered into the householder’s hand or took something from it and brought it outside, the poor man is liable but the householder is not liable.<br>If the householder stretched out his hand outside and delivered into the poor man’s hand or took something from it and brought it inside, the householder is liable but the poor man is not liable.<br>If the poor man stretched out his hand inside and the householder took from it or gave into it and he then took it out, neither is liable.<br>If the householder stretched out his hand outside and the poor man took from it or gave into it and he then took it in, neither is liable.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For this and the following paragraphs there exists a reasonably complete Genizah text (G) edited by L. Ginzberg (שרידי ירושלמי New York 1909 p. 62). A slightly garbled parallel is in <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1, explained there in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:3:1-10:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.3.1-10.1">Notes 5–20</a>. The Notes here are restricted to references and short explanations.</i>“Export on the Sabbath,” etc. What means “two which are four”? Two which are four for liability and two which are four for no liability, or four for liability and four for no liability? Let us hear from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1.</i>: “There are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds.” Rebbi Abba said, there all are about liability, but here we come to state both liability and no liability<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Abba, there is a difference between the Mishnaiot in <i>Šabbat</i> and <i>Ševuot</i> in that in the case here at least one person involved always is not liable whereas in <i>Ševuot</i> only one person is mentioned and all cases are of liability. For R. Yose, the parallel is only that of Mishnaiot 1–2, not 3–4. Each Mishnah describes two cases of liability; these are two covering in all four cases of liability as in <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1.</i>. This implies four of liability and four of no liability. Rebbi Yose said, the Mishnah says so, “there are two kinds of oaths which are four kinds,” not because of liability? And similarly, “there are two kinds of export on the Sabbath which are four kinds,” because there is liability. But was it not stated<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Middot 4:1" href="/Mishnah_Middot.4.1">Mishnah <i>Middot</i> 4:1</a>. The Mishnah is purely descriptive of the construction of Herod’s Temple; the notions of liability or no liability are inappropriate.</i>, “the doors of the Temple hall were two which are four?” Can you say, liability and no liability? Should we state twelve cases of no liability<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">There are four cases in the Mishnah where one party is liable and the other is not involved. Then there are four cases in which both parties are involved but nobody is criminally liable. One might construct another four cases where nobody is liable; e. g., if the poor man reaches into the house, picks something up, which the householder then takes from his hand and deposits outside.</i>? We only come to state cases of no liability which correspond to cases of liability. Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, what is this “no liability” which we stated here? Permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since in Mishnaiot 1–2 only one person acts, it is inappropriate to apply the label “not liable” to the other person. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 2b-3a" href="/Shabbat.2b-3a">Babli 2b/3a</a>.</i>! Rebbi Yose said, the poor man and the rich man are one but the Sages counted them as two. Bringing in or taking out are one but the Sages counted them as two<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In G, <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1, <i>editio princeps,</i> and a quote in RITBA <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1: “Taking out or bringing in are two but the Sages counted them as one.” As noted later in this paragraph, taking out is called work by Jeremiah (which cannot be used as a legal text but is confirmation of the interpretation of the law) whereas bringing in is only forbidden by the argument that taking out from A to B is bringing in to B from A.</i>. Taking out on the Sabbath does not include bringing in; if one exports from one domain to the other, does this not include the one who imports? Let us hear from the following, as Rebbi Yasa said in the name if Rebbi Joḥanan: Somebody who brings in half the size of a dried fig and takes out half the size of a dried fig is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Even an intrinsic liability can be prosecuted only if a minimal amount was transported, which for food is determined as the size of a dried fig (Chapters 7–8). Since taking out and bringing in small quantities are to be combined, taking out and bringing in are representatives of one and the same action, <i>viz.,</i> transporting.</i>. And from where that taking out is called work? Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Jonathan<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Ševuot</i> 1:1 and the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 6b" href="/Shabbat.6b">Babli (6b</a>): R. Joḥanan; quoted without attribution by R. Ḥananel <i>Šabbat</i> 3b; in a number of Medieval sources R. Jonathan.</i> understood it from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 36:6" href="/Exodus.36.6"><i>Ex.</i> 36:6</a>. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 96a" href="/Shabbat.96a">Babli 96a</a>.</i>: <i>Moses ordered, they made a public proclamation in the camp as follows, men or women should no longer do work to contribute to the sanctuary.</i> The people refrained from taking objects out from their houses to give them to the collectors. Rebbi Ḥizqiah<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Missing in <i>Ševuot.</i> In G, R, Aḥa in the name or R. Ila; in <i>Sefer Haˋittim</i> (ed. Mekize Nirdamim p. 300) R.

Aḥa.</i> in the name of Rebbi Ila: You even understand bringing in from this. Just as the people refrained from taking objects out of their houses to give to the collectors so the collectors did not accept anything from them to bring into the office. Rebbi Ḥizqiah in the name of Rebbi Aḥa understood everything from the following<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jeremiah 17:22" href="/Jeremiah.17.22"><i>Jer.</i> 17:22</a>.</i>: <i>do not bring out any load from your houses on the Sabbath day, and perform no work.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For this and the next paragraph there also exists an additional Genizah text (<b>ג</b>) also edited by L. Ginzberg, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 64.</i> Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: If one brought in half a dried fig and took out half a dried fig he is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Here and in the following, “liable” only refers to the obligation to bring a purification sacrifice in case of unintentional infraction of the Sabbath rules. Since an intentional sin cannot be atoned for by a sacrifice (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 16:30" href="/Numbers.16.30"><i>Num.</i> 16:30</a>), a sacrifice is possible only if the perpetrator was oblivious either of the fact that the act was forbidden or, in the case of the Sabbath, that the day was a Sabbath. Sins committed during different periods of oblivion require different sacrifices. In addition, the prohibition of work on the Sabbath is not a single prohibition but, as explained in Chapter 7, a set of 39 different prohibitions, each with different minima of forbidden work which trigger the obligation of a sacrifice. Minimal infractions of different prohibitions do not combine to produce the obligation of a sacrifice. On the other hand, infractions which are subsumed under the same prohibition, even if one is clearly biblically prohibited (אַב מְלָאכָה “a master work” such as transporting <i>from</i> a private to the public domain) and one which is classified by a logical argument as belonging to the same class (תּוֹלְדָה “a derivative”, as transporting <i>to</i> the private domain) do combine to create the obligation of a sacrifice.</i>. What Rebbi Joḥanan said does not follow Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Tanna, ben Ḥalafta, the greatest authority of the fourth generation of Tannaim.</i>, as it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 80b" href="/Shabbat.80b">Babli 80b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bava Batra 55b" href="/Bava_Batra.55b"><i>Bava batra</i> 55b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Keritot 17a" href="/Keritot.17a"><i>Keritut</i>17a</a>. The first part is a Tosephta, <i>ed.</i> Liebermann 9:11, <i>ed. princeps</i> 10:7.</i>: “If one took out half a dried fig and again took out half a dried fig during one period of oblivion, he is liable; during different periods of oblivion he is not liable. Rebbi Yose said, during one period of oblivion and one domain he is liable, during one period of oblivion and two domains or during two periods of oblivion and one domain he is not liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since transporting has three components, lifting in one domain, removing to another, and depositing in the other domain, for R. Yose they cannot be combined unless all three components are the same (within one period of oblivion.)</i>” We find this difficult. If two different transorts do not combine following Rebbi Yose, <i>a fortiori</i> also not bringing in and taking out<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is not convincing since transporting into is a derivative of transporting from. R. Yose still could hold that the actions combine to create liability if the domains involved are the same.</i>? Therefore what Rebbi Joḥanan said could not follow Rebbi Yose.
Rebbi Ila said, not only if two doors open to two public roads<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Greek πλατεῖα (sc., ὁδός) “a wide (road)”, equivalent of Hebrew רְחוֹב.</i> but even if they open to the same public road will Rebbi Yose agree<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is assumed that each private house has only one door to the street, there are two different private domains involved; the transgressions do not combine for R. Yose.</i>, for Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in matters of liability<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Different domains from which transport starts or where transport ends are like different periods of oblivion for which no common purification sacrifice is possible by biblical standards.</i>. Just as Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in absence of liability so Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in matters of liability<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly the correct text is that of G: “Just as Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in matters of liability so Rebbi Yose compares domains to periods of oblivion in absence of liability.” The fact that incomplete actions in two different periods of oblivion do not combine to create the liability (or possibility) of a sacrifice is only a corollary to the statement that all infractions of the same kind committed during the same period of oblivion are atoned for by one single sacrifice.</i>. For if he took out the volume of a dried fig through this door and the volume of a dried fig through that door in one period of oblivion is he not liable twice<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For R. Yose, who negates the possibility of any sacrifice if the amounts each time are insufficient. For the anonymous majority, the situation is the opposite; two transports of insufficient quantities from two domains combine to create liability for a sacrifice but transports of greater quantities from different domains in one period of oblivion are atoned for by a single sacrifice.</i>?
<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph and the next also appear in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.12"><i>Horaiot</i> 3:3 (Notes 66–72</a>) in a different context. (R. Yose mentioned there is the fifth generation Amora).</i> Rebbi Yudan said, Rebbi Yose compares domains to eating slices<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to sacrifices due for eating forbidden food. Since purification sacrifices are due only for transgressions punishable at least by extirpation (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.4.1">Mishnah <i>Horaiot</i> 3:7</a>), the only example of such solid food is forbidden fat. A sacrifice for inadvertent consumption of forbidden fat is due if at least the volume of an average olive was eaten in the time needed to eat a slice of bread. The slice is defined (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Negaim 7:9-10" href="/Tosefta_Negaim.7.9-10">Tosephta <i>Negaˋim</i> 7:10</a>) as half a loaf when three loaves are baked from a <i>kav</i> of flour (about 35 cl)</i>. For if one ate the volume of half an olive during the time needed to eat one slice and another volume of half an olive in the time needed to eat another slice, is he not free from liability? If one ate several volumes of olives during several times needed to eat a slice in one period of forgetting, he is liable only once.
<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.12"><i>Horaiot</i> 3:3 Note 70</a>. The rabbis of Caesarea object to comparing the rules of the Sabbath to any other biblical prohibition. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 13:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.13.1.1">Mishnah 13:1</a> states that weaving is forbidden and the threshold for an action requiring a purification sacrifice is weaving two threads. For the majority, weaving two threads in one oblivion triggers the obligation of a sacrifice, for R. Yose only if the two rows were added to the same piece of cloth.</i> The rabbis of Caesarea say, before you compare this to fat, compare it to the rules of Sabbath itself. For if one was weaving one thread on this piece of cloth and weaving one thread on that piece of cloth, is he not free from liability? If he wove several threads on several pieces of cloth in one period of oblivion he is liable only once.
Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The one who takes out is not liable until he put it down<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.1">Note 1</a>, the Sabbath is desecrated only by a complete action, lifting up, transporting from one domain to another, and depositing. If the last act is missing, there was no punishable desecration.<br>The tradent R. Yose is the fifth generation Amora.</i>. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Unless he take up and put down. Rebbi Zeˋira required, unless he take it up with the intention to put it down<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This is a necessary clarification of the preceding statement. Not only must there be a complete action, but all three parts must be executed with the intent to perform the action. In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 35" href="/Exodus.35"><i>Ex.</i> 35</a>, the prohibition of work on the Sabbath is repeated (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 35:1-3" href="/Exodus.35.1-3">vv. 1–3</a>) as part of the commandment to build the Tabernacle (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 35:4-35" href="/Exodus.35.4-35">vv. 4–35</a>). In 35:33, the construction of the Tabernacle is described as “thinking work”. It is concluded that only “thinking work” is punishable (criminally or by a sacrifice) as desecration of the Sabbath. In the special case of transporting, there is desecration only if the three parts are done with compatible intent, if the lifting up was intended to be followed by a putting down.</i>. Not if he lifted it to eat and then changed his mind to put it down<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">It is perfectly legitimate to take food to eat in the domain where it was at the start of the Sabbath. If the first stage of a transport was executed in a perfectly permitted way based on a true thought, it never can become the first leg in a criminal transport. While the change of intent and the following action were forbidden and sinful, there can be no criminal or sacrificial liability attached to them. (As statement of R. Joḥanan himself, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 5b" href="/Shabbat.5b">Babli 5b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 20b" href="/Eruvin.20b"><i>Eruvin</i> 20b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 31a" href="/Ketubot.31a"><i>Ketubot</i> 31a</a>).</i>. What Rebbi Joḥanan said does not follow Rebbi Yose, as it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">An anonymous <i>baraita</i> following the statement here attributed to R. Yose is <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shabbat (Lieberman) 9:11" href="/Tosefta_Shabbat_(Lieberman).9.11">Tosephta 9:11</a>(ed. S. Liebermann); the first part Babli 80a.<br>Since in the public domain one is only permitted to move things by a distance of less than four cubits, things farther away are as in two different domains. If each transport was less that a minimal amount, the actions cannot be combined.</i>: “If he took out half the volume of a dried fig and put it down, and then took out another volume of half a dried fig. If he put it down within four cubits of the first piece he is liable, otherwise he is not liable. Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Tanna, ben Ḥalafta, the greatest authority of the fourth generation of Tannaim.</i> said, if he transported it over it, he is liable, otherwise he is not liable.” Rebbi Yose considers the person walking as if he was putting down<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Later in the Halakhah and in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 5b" href="/Shabbat.5b">Babli (5b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 91b" href="/Shabbat.91b">91b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 98a" href="/Eruvin.98a"><i>Eruvin</i> 98a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ketubot 31b" href="/Ketubot.31b"><i>Ketubot</i> 31b</a>) this opinion is attributed to Ben Azzai, a generation before R. Yose. It is agreed by everybody that standing still while transporting an object is legally putting it down, not on the ground but on the static person. This is the same as depositing the object on a pillar. R. Yose holds that a slow motion such as walking is the equivalent of standing still for a negligible time at many places. An action which does not result in instant deposition is throwing.<br>According to R. Yose, if the second object ever was within 4 cubits of the place where the first was deposited, the two actions combine for liability, even if the second was ultimately deposited somewhere else.</i>. Just as Rebbi Yose considers the person walking as if he was putting down for liability so he considers the person walking as if he was putting down for non-liability. When he took it out he is considered having put it down; then he should be free from liability<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">If the object is considered deposited the moment it was taken out of a private domain by a walking person, then any subsequent motion is a new transport. Since R. Yose (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.4">Note 44</a>) only considers combining transports if they originate and terminate in the same domains, the fact that later the second object was transported over the first should be irrelevant.</i>. Explain it if it was put down within four cubits [of the door]<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Added from G and <b>ג</b>.</i>, as it was stated<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Since transporting has three components, lifting in one domain, removing to another, and depositing in the other domain, for R. Yose they cannot be combined unless all three components are the same (within one period of oblivion.)</i>, “otherwise he is not liable.” Rebbi Abba the son of Rebbi Pappaeus said, explain it if the door was five cubits wide and he brought one out on this side, the other on the other side. Then the second was not taken out within four cubits of the first<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For the anonymous Tanna the final place of deposit determines liability; for R. Yose there is no liability if the two paths never were within 4 cubits of one another.</i>.
There<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Keritot 3:4" href="/Mishnah_Keritot.3.4">Mishnah <i>Keritut</i> 3:4</a>.</i>, we have stated: “Rebbi Meïr says, if it was a Sabbath and he carried it out<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">As noted before, a purification offering is possible only for transgressions punishable at least by extirpation. The Mishnah gives an example that a single act may trigger the obligation of 4 purification and one reparation offerings. An impure person who eats a piece of well-being offering (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 7:20" href="/Leviticus.7.20"><i>Lev.</i> 7:20</a>) which is fat (v.25) and more than 2 days old (v. 18) on the Day of Atonement (23:29). For the illicit use of a <i>sanctum</i> a reparation sacrifice is due (5:15–16). R. Meïr adds that if the day also was a Sabbath and the person would take the piece in a private domain, carry it out and eat it in the public domain, an additional purification offering is needed.<br>The text and R. Yudan’s explanation make it clear that the Yerushalmi does not read with some Babli sources “carried it out in his mouth.”</i>. They told him, it is not the category<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The five sacrifices are due for eating one piece; the Sabbath infraction would be for carrying. S. Liebermann explains אֵינוֹ הַשֵּׁם as “is not simultaneous.”</i>.” Because this one is liable because of walking and that one is liable because of putting down<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Eating may also be done while walking; the Sabbath infraction becomes a liability only when the motion stopped.</i>. Who is “they said to him”? Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">There is no other reference to the fact that the objection to R. Meïr originates with the Tanna R. Yose.</i>! The argument of Rebbi Yose is inverted. There, he does not consider the person walking equal to one who was putting down but here he is considering the person walking equal to one who was putting down<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This argument may support Liebermann’s interpretation. Since for R. Yose a person walking is considered stopping at every place, the Sabbath infraction and the desecration of the sacrifice are simultaneous.</i>! Rebbi Yudan said, explain it that he was laying on the threshold<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">An Accadic word (<i>askuppum</i>). The word describes not only the threshold but also the stairs leading from the road to the house. [Also cf. Latin <i>scapus</i> “post or newel of a circular staircase; main stile of a door on which it hinges” (E. G.)]</i> partially inside, his mouth outside, when he stretched out his hand, took it, and ate it. Then he did not walk<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">If the piece of fat was lying inside the private domain, the Sabbath violation did not involve any movement of his body; the reference to R. Yose’s opinion about transporting on the Sabbath is irrelevant, as is the explanation given in the preceding sentence. The difference in the status of the required sacrifices is as indicated in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:13" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.13">Note 62</a>.</i>.
Rebbi Yannai said, one who swallowed half the volume of an olive, then threw it up, and again swallowed it, is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 103b" href="/Chullin.103b">Babli, <i>Ḥulin</i> 103b</a>, statement and supporting argument are by R. Assi (Yasa) in the name of R. Joḥanan. The food swallowed is supposed to be forbidden fat.</i>. But one who brought in half the volume of a dried fig and took it out again, is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This is not the situation discussed in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.1.2">Note 32</a> where half a fig was brought in and half a fig taken out; in all a whole fig was transported. But here the same half fig was transported twice; neither transport created liability.</i>. What is the difference between this and the first one? There his palate enjoyed the volume of an olive, but here he never dealt with a full volume of a fig. Rebbi Yose said, sometimes a person may be dealing with a full volume of a fig and not be liable. How is this possible? He took out half of the volume of a dried fig<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts a new Genizah leaf (G), also edited by L. Ginzberg, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 65.</i>, put it down, again took out half of the volume of a dried fig, but did not manage to put it down before the first one was burned. He was dealing with a full volume of a fig but is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Shabbat (Lieberman) 9:11" href="/Tosefta_Shabbat_(Lieberman).9.11">Tosephta 9:11</a> (ed. Liebermann): “If the first half was eaten before the second came to rest he is not liable, whether in one or in two periods of oblivion.” As explained earlier, quantities less than the minimum trigger liability only if they exist together.<br>The statement is referred to as obvious in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 80a" href="/Shabbat.80a">Babli, 80a</a>.</i>. Because he compared it to forbidden fat he contrived this<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This is R. Yose’s explanation of R. Yannai’s statement. Since for fat a single half olive can create liability, there is good reason to formulate R. Yannai’s rule in the way indicated. For the Sabbath, R. Yannai’s statement is unnecessary; it is formulated purely as companion piece to the statement about fat.</i>.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A person should not sit before the barber close to the time of afternoon prayers unless he has prayed<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This Mishnah is not connected with the laws of the Sabbath in contrast to the following ones for which it is an introduction. The general rule is that once there is an obligation to pray, the obligation should be fulfilled before any profane action is taken, in particular if the intended action may be a lengthy one. The problem with afternoon prayers is that it is possible to pray starting half an hour after noon (“the great <i>minḥah</i>”) but the actual obligation starts only an hour and a quarter before sundown (“the small <i>minḥah</i>”). The “hours” mentioned here are variable, one-twelfth of the time between sunrise and sundown. From the Halakhah in the Yerushalmi it is clear that only the small <i>minḥah</i> is taken into account; in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 9b" href="/Shabbat.9b">Babli (9b</a>) both times are considered.</i>. Nor should one enter the bathhouse or the tannery, nor start eating, nor sit in judgment; if they started they should not interrupt.

Therefore there is no biblical obligation to pray at any fixed time; all rules are rabbinic even if based on <i>Dan.</i>6:11, a book without standing in <i>halakhah.</i> On the other hand, the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>ˋ evenings and mornings is a biblical requirement (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 6:7" href="/Deuteronomy.6.7"><i>Deut.</i> 6:7</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 11:19" href="/Deuteronomy.11.19">11:19</a>).

But if Rebbi Ḥiyya had stated rather than we<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly this must read: “If we had stated but R.

“Nor the tannery.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from Mishnah 5.</i>” Come and look, does one not avoid people who stink? And you say so? It comes only when he puts on his work clothes<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">A reasonable explanation of this paragraph has been given by S. Liebermann. R. Yose (the Amora) states later in the discussion of Mishnah 5 that one interrupts what one is doing for the recitation of the <i>Šemaˋ</i> but not for prayer since the recitation does not need concentration and therefore needs only a short moment whereas prayer requires concentration and a longer interruption. The question raised here is that it is forbidden to recite the <i>Šemaˋ</i> (or quote any verse) at smelly places (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 3:5:2-19" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.3.5.2-19"><i>Berakhot</i> 3:5</a>). Since tanning of hides produces bad smell, the tanner cannot recite anything unless he remove himself from his place of work and cleanse himself thoroughly, which consumes more time than people usually spend for prayer. Therefore reciting the <i>Šemaˋ</i> for a tanner should follow the rules of prayer and he should not be required to interrupt his work. The answer is that he is required to interrupt only if he already has put on his work clothes but not entered the tannery. The fact is noted in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 9b" href="/Shabbat.9b">Babli (9b</a>), the question is not asked.</i>.

Since Rav had washed his hands, he would have been able to recite Qidduš over wine only if the wine had been mixed and poured before the washing of the hands when the benedictions over wine and Qidduš are not counted as interruption between washing and starting the meal (as in the German minhag).</i>.

According to biblical standards, only original impurity or at most its first derivative can make food impure.

They remain pure only as long as one is aware of their washed status. At the moment one’s attention is diverted from this, they revert to the status of unwashed hands and automatically are impure in the second degree (even if the person’s body remains pure.)

The biblical text does not specify what the status is of the person between immersion and sundown, when he is called <i>ṭevul yom</i> “immersed during daytime”. While he is pure, by rabbinic convention (but following some opinions by biblical decree) he invalidates sanctified food by his touch as if he were impure in the second degree (cf. <i>Sotah</i> 5:2 Notes 42,46,47,68.)</i>, and food and vessels which became impure by fluids<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">While solid food impure in the k-th degree imparts impurity of the (k+l)st degree on what it touches, by rabbinic practice impure fluid always causes impurity of the first degree in what comes in touch with it.

Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: this is of the practices of obfuscation. Rebbi Yose said, so I asked before Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa: What means “of the practices of obfuscation? Do we say, at a place where Jewish bread is available it is logical that Gentile bread should be forbidden and they obfuscated about it and permitted it? Or at a place where Jewish bread is not available it would be logical that Gentile bread should be permitted and they obfuscated about it and forbade it? Rebbi Mana said, is there any obfuscation for prohibition? But is bread not like cooking of Gentiles? Are we saying: At a place where no Jewish cooking is available it would be logical that Gentile cooking should be permitted? But it must be the following: At a place where Jewish bread is not available it would be logical that Gentile bread should be forbidden and they obfuscated about it and permitted it because of the necessities of life. The rabbis of Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa: Following the words of him who was permitting, but only from the store; but one does not do this.

Their cheese. Rebbi Jeremiah said, why is a Gentile’s milk forbidden? Because of admixture from forbidden animals.

Because of uncovering. Let him make cheese! Rebbi Samuel ben Rav Isaac said, because of the poison left between the holes. It was stated so: There are three kinds of poison; one swims, one sinks down, and one is similar to a net on top. In the days of Rebbi Jeremiah the barrels of the Great Assembly were uncovered.

And Rebbi and his court permit what Daniel and his companions forbade? Rebbi Joḥanan follows his own opinion, for Rebbi Joḥanan said in the name of Rebbi Eleazar ben Rebbi Ṣadoq, I have a tradition that any restrictive edict passed by a court which is not accepted by the majority of the public is not an edict.

Isaac bar Samuel bar Martha went down to Nisibis. He met Rebbi Simlai the Southerner who sat and expounded: Rebbi and his court permitted the oil. Samuel accepted this and ate. Rav did not eat.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The House of Shammai say, one does not set traps for wild animals, or birds, or fish unless they may be caught when it is still daylight, but the House of Hillel permit it.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from Mishnah 10.

If the trap was sprung, it is certain that they were caught when it still was day. But if the trap was not sprung, it is certain that they were not caught when it still was day. And even if the trap was sprung, in worry one may say that they were not caught when it still was day<sup class="footnote-marker">370</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 3:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Beitzah.3.2.1">Mishnah <i>Beṣah</i> 3:2</a> reads: “One may not take from traps set for game, birds, or fish on the eve of a holiday unless one know that it was caught before the onset of the holiday. It happened that a Gentile brought fish to Rabban Gamliel who said they are permitted but I do not want to accept from him.” The question arises how can one know that an animal was trapped unless one go there and take it out before the holiday. Does the first part of the Mishnah have any practical application? The answer is that by observation from afar one may determine what happened.<br>The main subject of Tractate <i>Beṣah</i> is the requirement, based ostensibly on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 16:5" href="/Exodus.16.5"><i>Ex.</i> 16:5</a>, that on the Sabbath and holidays only food prepared beforehand may be consumed. Since cooking on the Sabbath is forbidden, there is no problem regarding Sabbath observation. For the holidays there first is the problem of extending a commandment given for the Sabbath to holidays and second the fact that cooking and other preparation of food is permitted (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 13:16" href="/Exodus.13.16"><i>Ex.</i> 13:16</a>). Therefore the application of the requirement of preparation can refer only to the accessibility of raw materials. If an animal is trapped before the onset of the holiday it is prepared in this sense and may be taken and turned into food on the holiday. Another question then is whether the extension of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 16:5" href="/Exodus.16.5"><i>Ex.</i> 16:5</a> to holidays is considered biblical (when cases of doubt have to be resolved restrictively) or rabbinic (when cases of doubt have to be resolved leniently).</i>.

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One who extinguishes a light because he is afraid of Gentiles, of robbers, of evil spirits, or because of a sick person to let him sleep, is not liable<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It is supposed that one extinguishes the light because one is afraid of an attack, whether by people or in the case of a mentally ill person who may become violent under the influence of an evil spirit. The “sick person” mentioned in the Mishnah must have a life-threatening sickness. In all these cases there is a danger to life and one is permitted (or required) to extinguish the light. The formulation mentions “not liable” which usually means “forbidden but not prosecutable” only to obtain a formulation parallel to the statement of R. Yose where the original meaning holds.</i>. If to save the light, to save the oil, to save the wick, he is liable<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since he completed an action according to his wishes. R. Yose holds (with R. Simeon on other occasions) that if the intent was not the action itself but a consequence of it, then in general the action is not prosecutable. In this case, if the intent was to prevent the clay lamp from bursting when the oil was almost used up, extinguishing the flame is not the object of his intent; the action “was not the object of his intent”. But if the intent was to preserve the wick, extinguishing the fire will automatically produce a charred tip of the wick which is the essence of producing a usable wick (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 2:3:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.2.3.2">Note 16</a>) and the action is the object of his intent.</i>. Rebbi Yose declares them all not liable except for the wick because he produces charcoal.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “One who extinguishes a light because he is afraid of Gentiles,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Quote from Mishnah 5.</i>” etc. Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac said, [so is the Mishnah:]<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Added from G.</i> because dangerous Gentiles, because of dangerous robbers. Rebbi Yose asked, if because of dangerous robbers one should have stated “it is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">If extinguishing the light is needed to save a life, it is not only permitted, it is required. The formulation of the Mishnah, “he is not liable” gives the impression that the action is sinful. This might cause people to hesitate to extinguish the light when it is necessary for survival, a very bad outcome.</i>” The rabbis of Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: It is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">They reformulated the Mishnah. The <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 30a" href="/Shabbat.30a">Babli, 30a</a>, agrees that in these cases it is permitted; they defend the formulation “not liable” because it also refers to the cases mentioned later in the Mishnah.</i>.
What is the difference between one who saves from what is in the light and one who saves what is in the olive<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">This is a question about the second part of the Mishnah. Why is the person who extinguishes the light to save oil liable? The person who stores olives to press them later is not liable.</i>? The rabbis of Caesarea in the name of Rebbi Shila from Naveh: One who saves from the wick itself cannot be compared to one who saves away from the wick itself<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The question is not well posed. If one removes oil from a burning lamp one causes the wick to be extinguished earlier; this is an act of extinguishing. But not to press olives is doing nothing. (S. Lieberman prefers to emend בבית “in the house” instead of בזית “in the olive”.)</i>.
Rebbi Joḥanan said, Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Simeon said the same thing. Just as Rebbi Yose said, not unless he needs the body of the wick<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">In the Mishnah, where he frees from liability all who extinguish the light except the one who does it for the wick.</i>, so Rebbi Simeon says, not unless he needs the body of the thing<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Further on in Mishnah 10:5 R.

In German this used to be called “Kochkiste.” The insulating material may not be anything which in a fermentation process will produce heat.</i>,” etc. Because these things are hot and produce heat; if he takes away and they cool in his hand he returns them and they add heat; therefore they forbade to store away in them following Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah, for Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah said, “a box he tilts on its side and takes out.” But according to the rabbis there? For they say, if it was a vat it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear what they permitted.

And there<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2 Mishnah 6.</i> we have stated “if there be doubt whether it is dark or not dark.” Because it was not dark; therefore if it is dark it is forbidden to store away in them.

While the rules about continued use of a cooking stove fall under the general rabbinic principles of building a “fence around the law”, the rules about storing away seem to be “fences around fences” which are frowned upon. One has to seek other reasons for these rules. The Babylonian rabbis think one tries to force people to finish all household chores before sundown so all can come to the synagogue and hear the sermon; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 1:4:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.1.4.3"><i>Soṭah</i> 1:4 Notes 185–191</a>.</i>; Rebbi Abba said, because of the suspicion<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is R.

For if you tell him that he is permitted he will not finish it completely when it still is daylight. Because you tell him that he is forbidden he will finish it completely when it still is daylight. What is the difference between them? To hide away snow and cold water.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “A comprehensive principle they said about the Sabbath,” etc. What means “comprehensive”? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, because it is more comprehensive than the principle of the Sabbatical year, since the Sabbath falls on everything but the Sabbatical year<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Sabbath prohibitions refer to all kinds of work everywhere; Sabbatical prohibitions refer only to agricultural work in the Land of Israel.</i> falls on agricultural work in the Land only. There we have stated<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ševiˋit</i> 7:1.</i>: “A comprehensive principle they said about the Sabbatical year.” What means “a comprehensive principle”? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, because it is more comprehensive than tithes, for the Sabbatical year falls on human food and animal feed but tithes apply to human food only<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Maˋserot</i> 1:1: “anything that is food, is guarded, and grows from the earth, is subject to tithes.” <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 68a" href="/Shabbat.68a">Babli 68a</a>. G everywhere reads not מַכָנִיסוֹ “what one stores” but מִיכָּנָסוֹ “what he had stored” making the obligation of tithes dependent on the action of the individual.</i>. Bar Qappara stated: a comprehensive principle they said about tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Our Mishnah <i>Maˋserot</i> 1:1 which is stated as “a principle” is “a comprehensive principle” for bar Qappara. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 68a" href="/Shabbat.68a">Babli 68a</a>.</i>. What means “a comprehensive principle”? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, because it is more comprehensive than <i>peah.</i> for tithes apply both to food that is stored and to food which is not stored, but <i>peah</i> applies only to food used as stored staple<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Peah</i> 1:4: “They established a principle for <i>peah</i>: Everything that is food, is treated as private property, grows from the earth, is harvested at one time, and is stored, is subject to <i>peah</i>.” <i>Peah</i> is the corner of the field which is reserved for the poor and may not be taken by the farmer.</i>. Some want to say, what means “comprehensive”? From here that there are derivatives<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">There are categories and sub-categories as for the Sabbath. This is the preferred explanation of the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 68a" href="/Shabbat.68a">Babli, 68a</a>.</i>.
We have stated: “Anybody who is oblivious of the principle of the Sabbath.” They stated in the House of Rebbi: Anybody ignorant of the principles of the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The only other place in which this formulation appears in our sources is <i>Sifra Ḥovah (Wayyiqra II) Pereq</i> 1(7).</i>. Rebbi Eleazar follows our Mishnah. Rebbi Joḥanan follows what was stated in the House of Rebbi. But Rebbi Eliezer said, “anybody who is oblivious of the principle of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Keritot 3:10" href="/Mishnah_Keritot.3.10">Mishnah <i>Keritut</i> 3:10</a> (quoted later in the Chapter, Note 48) he states that one who performs many works of the same category on many Sabbaths in one oblivion is liable for separate sacrifices for each occasion; opposed by R. Aqiba. This refers to the second case trated in Mishnah 1.</i>” Therefore if he does not know anything of the principles of the Sabbath is he not liable? Since Rav stated our Mishnah and explained it: who is the one who does not know anything of the principles of the Sabbath? A child who was taken prisoner among the Gentiles<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">He never heard of a Sabbath prohibition.</i>.

As Rebbi Joḥanan said, anybody ignorant of the principles of the Sabbath. Therefore (if he does not) [if he did]<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The text in [brackets] from G is clearly the correct one, not the one in (parentheses) from the Leiden ms.</i> know and forgot he is liable. Since what Rebbi Samuel, Rebbi Abbahu said in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: This entire Halakhah follows Rebbi Eliezer, but following the rabbis he is liable only once<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As will be stated in the next paragraph, all actions in one episode of oblivion trigger only one obligation of sacrifice.</i>. This implies that both versions are the same. They asked before Rebbi Yasa’s son: What did you hear from your father about Rebbi Yose<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yose ben Ḥanina.</i>? He said, following Rebbi Joḥanan. Rebbi Ḥizqiah told them, he did not say so. But Rebbi Simon bar Zavda was simply with Rebbi Yose’s son and heard from him following Rebbi Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The formulation in the Mishnah is not practice.</i>.
From where these things? <i>He did one, and did these, and did of these. He did one</i>, to obligate for each one separately; <i>and did these</i>, to obligate for all of them together<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:2" href="/Leviticus.4.2"><i>Lev</i>. 4:2</a> reads: <i>If a person should sin inadvertently against any of the prohibitions of the Eternal and did one of these</i>. The complicated structure of this verse is analyzed in detail in <i>Sifra Ḥova (Wayyiqra II) Parshata</i> 1, <i>Pereq</i> 1. The analysis of the Yerushalmi is attributed in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 103b" href="/Shabbat.103b">Babli 103b</a> to R. Yose ben Ḥanina, mentioned at the end of the preceding Paragraph. Echoes of the discussion in <i>Sifra</i> are in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 70a" href="/Shabbat.70a">Babli 70a</a>.<br>The questions raised about the verse are twofold. If it had simply said <i>and did one</i>, we would have inferred that every single infraction needs a separate sacrifice. If it had said <i>and did these</i>, all infractions committed in one state of inadvertence would be covered by one sacrifice. The mention of <i>one</i> in parallel with <i>these</i> creates a seeming contradiction. In addition, in each case the prefix מ “of” in standard rabbinic interpretation is read as “not all”. Then what does it mean that a single prohibition is partially violated?</i>. <i>Of these</i>, to obligate for derivatives<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The last question is easily answered for the Sabbath. Later in the Chapter the forbidden actions on the Sabbath are described by 39 categories. The particular actions labelling the categories are called אַב מְלָאכָה “primary actions”; any other action subsumed under the same category is a תּוֹלְדָה “derivative”. All actions subsumed under the same category are considered identical in some abstract sense even if they actually are very different; e. g. plucking feathers from a bird is forbidden as a derivative of shearing. Any one of the actions subsumed under one category triggers the liability for a sacrifice; it is not necessary that all actions carrying the same label be acted on. On the other hand, most actions trigger liability only if a certain minimum of work was done, as will be detailed in the following Chapters; an action which is too insignificant remains forbidden but does not trigger liability for a sacrifice.</i>. Or should we say that the verse refers to idolatry? Rebbi Zakkai stated before Rebbi Joḥanan: if one sacrificed, and burned incense, and poured a libation in one forgetting he is liable for each one separately. Rebbi Joḥanan said, Babylonian! You crossed by hand three rivers and were broken<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The expression is difficult to understand since one does not cross rivers (in this case Tigris, Euphrates, and Jordan) by hand but by boat. Since the expression is confirmed later in the Chapter and in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Nazir 6:1:2-14" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Nazir.6.1.2-14"><i>Nazir</i> 6:1</a>, it cannot be emended. It seems that Rav (not Rebbi) Zakkai swam crossing the rivers on his way to Palestine.</i>; he is liable only once<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 7:10:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.7.10.5"><i>Sanhedrin</i> Chapter 7:11 Note 256</a>. Worshipping strange deities in the way prescribed for Jewish worship in all its forms is one and the same offense. But worshipping strange deities in their own characteristic ways is a separate offense for each deity.</i>. Before it was broken in his hand there was <i>one</i> but no <i>these</i>; after it was broken in his hand there was <i>these</i> but no <i>one</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Since the question was raised whether <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:2" href="/Leviticus.4.2"><i>Lev</i>. 4:2</a> could be interpreted to refer only to idolatry the answer seems to be in the negative, since for R. Zakkai there are only single offenses (<i>one</i>) and no general category (<i>these</i>) whereas for R. Joḥanan the situation is the inverse, in contrast to the Sabbath when liability for a sacrifice can be triggered either by a single action (<i>one</i>) or by a multiplicity of different actions all falling under the same category (<i>these</i>).</i>. But it could be idolatry worshipped by the rules of worship of Heaven as by prostration. In its own worship to obligate for each one separately. By the rules of worship of Heaven to obligate one for all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since in the Second Commandment prostration is mentioned before worship of strange deities it clearly is a separate offense. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 7:9:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.7.9.3"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:11 Notes 252</a> ff.</i>. Like prostration to obligate for partial action<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It is punishable even if not executed in the full manner prescribed for the Temple, lying down flat with outstretched arms and legs.</i>. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac. It is written<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:3" href="/Leviticus.4.3"><i>Lev</i>. 4:3</a>.</i>, <i>if the anointed priest should sin to damage the people</i> … <i>he has to bring a bull</i>.

They objected, are there not fat and sexual taboos for which the Anointed brings a bull? We come only to state things that have derivatives. Fat has no derivatives<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Fat is forbidden if it is from an animal whose kind is acceptable as a sacrifice and which is of the kind exactly prescribed in <i>Lev</i>. to be burned on the altar.

In addition in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 20:18" href="/Leviticus.20.18"><i>Lev</i>. 20:18</a> the sex act is defined at touching of sexual organs; the only actions triggering the liability for a sacrifice are explicitly spelled out in the verses; there are no categories nor derivatives. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 7:5:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.7.5.3"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:5 (Notes 72–85</a>).</i>. The colleagues say, <i>a Sabbath it is for the Eternal</i>, to obligate for each single Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:3" href="/Leviticus.23.3"><i>Lev</i>. 23:3</a>. Since the attempt to derive the rules of the Mishnah from <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4:2" href="/Leviticus.4.2"><i>Lev</i>. 4:2</a> ran into difficulties, they propose a direct interpretation of verses referring to the Sabbath only.</i>. Rebbi Ila said, it is written<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 35:2" href="/Exodus.35.2"><i>Ex</i>. 35:2</a>. The Sabbath is mentioned in the singular.</i>: <i>Anybody doing work on it shall by put to death</i>, not one who does on it and another. You are saying, the Sabbaths do not combine. Do they separate<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That Sabbaths do not combine means that if somebody did less than a punishable amount of work on one Sabbath and again less than a punishable amount the next Sabbath they do not add up to the liability for a sacrifice even if the actions were committed in the same period of oblivion of the rules of the Sabbath. In this the rules of the Sabbath parallel the rules of forbidden fat. Eating forbidden fat triggers the liability for a sacrifice only if a minimum was eaten within the time of a meal (defined as time needed to eat half a loaf of bread, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:2:12" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.3.2.12"><i>Horaiot</i> 3:3 Note 66</a>). Less than minimum amounts eaten at different times do not trigger liability. On the other hand, once liability was triggered within one period of oblivion, it automatically covers all other offenses of the same kind during the same period of oblivion. The question is now asked whether if an inadvertent desecration of the Sabbath triggered the obligation of a sacrifice and the perpetrator did not become aware of his offense before committing the same also on another Sabbath, he is liable for only one or for several sacrifices?</i>? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Since the father is known in the Babli as Rabin, the reading of G, בין, seems better than the reading everywhere in the Leiden ms., בון.</i> said, just as they do not combine they do not separate.

If he realizes it on Monday, then he keeps the second Sabbath. But if it is Tuesday then it does not work. All the presumed Sabbaths of Rav Naḥman are on workdays. If we presume that Rav Naḥman’s scheme is periodic, that he pauses after 6,5,4,3,2,1,6,5,4,3,2,1,6,… days then his Sabbath will only be correct in the second period, in fact the seventh of his Sabbaths in the eighth try. In the following scheme the days of the week are numbered (Sabbath = 7) and Rav Naḥman’s Sabbaths are given in <b>bold face</b>:<br>3 4 5 6 7 ׀׀ 1 <b>2</b> 3 4 5 6 7 ׀׀<br><b>1</b> 2 3 4 5 <b>6</b> 7 ׀׀ 1 2 <b>3</b> 4 5 <b>6</b> 7 ׀׀<br><b>1</b> 2 3 4 5 6 7 ׀׀ <b>1</b> 2 3 4 5 6 <b>7</b>׀׀<br>The correct observation of the Sabbath first occurs in the second circuit, the eighth try, as spelled out in the text.</i>.

Then more than 39 liabilities could be created on one Sabbath, against the Mishnah here and in <i>Keritut</i>.</i>? Rebbi Jacob ben Dasai said, and in the House of Rebbi it was stated so: “If somebody performs many works on many Sabbaths all of the same category in one period of oblivion, what?

Rebbi Zeˋira said to him, is that not a case <i>a fortiori</i>? If he is intentional regarding the Sabbath and in error about works, is he not liable for each single one?

It is agreed that every single Sabbath creates new liabilities since the weekdays in between create awareness of days that are not Sabbaths. Similarly one may argue that having sex with the same woman in different menstrual periods creates separate liabilities since while the male may be oblivious continuously, the woman certainly knows the differences between the periods and she is bound by the law as he is. But an underage girl is not obligated by any law; therefore intercourse with her during different periods in one period of oblivion should create only a single liability.</i>? Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, explain it about an underage menstruating woman where days of purity came in the meantime<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Since we assert that a person who knows about the laws of the Sabbath but does not know which days are Sabbaths is liable separately for each Sabbath on which he worked, we also should assert that a man who knows the laws of <i>niddah</i> even if he does not know when his wife is impure is separately liable for intercourse in different periods which are separated by lengthy intervals of purity. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Keritot 17a" href="/Keritot.17a">Babli <i>Keritut</i> 17a</a>.</i>.

For idol worship, the principle is found close to the detail<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">In the same sentence. Cf.

The masoretic vocalization applying a definite article must refer to God in His function as Judge, God as Creator, Ruler of the physical world, to Whom propitiatory sacrifices are forbidden; sacrifices are legitimate only if offered to YHWH, God the Merciful and Dispenser of Grace. This is the interpretation adopted at the end of the paragraph. In all of <i>Lev</i>. and <i>Num</i>., there is never any mention of a sacrifice to Elohim.</i>. He mentioned the principle at one place and the details at another place! He said, since you do [not]<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Added from the text in <i>Nazir</i>, needed for an understanding of the text.</i> infer anything from it close up, you cannot infer anything from afar<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Since 34:14 does not teach anything not contained in Ex. 20:5.</i>. The colleagues say, it makes no difference; whether He gave the principle at one place and the detail at another, or gave principle and detail at the same place, it is a matter of principle and detail. For the Sabbath, He first gave the principle and then the detail. For idolatry, He gave the detail and only later the principle<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>prostrating</i> had been mentioned after <i>worshipping</i>, the 5th hermeneutical principle would imply that the two notions are identical in intent. As the verse stands, it cannot be interpreted as “principle and detail”, therefore the 9<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> principle does not apply to idolatry since the detail does not follow after the principle.</i>. Rebbi Yose said, it makes no difference whether He first gave the principle and then the detail or He gave the detail and only later the principle, or He gave principle, detail, and principle; it is a matter of principle and detail. For the Sabbath, He gave a general prohibition of work, followed by details; for idolatry, He gave the general principle regarding its worship but detailed the works of Heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition refers to performing for idolatry any ceremony commanded for the worship of Heaven.

Rebbi Mana said, lighting fire was mentioned unnecessarily<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Since the prohibition of making fire is implied in the Fourth Commandment in any reasonable interpretation. Therefore, making fire is a detail which can be used to characterize all work forbidden on the Sabbath.</i>; prostrating oneself was mentioned by necessity to explain about itself since it is not work<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Nothing is changed or produced by prostrating oneself; it is not obvious that it should be forbidden under any circumstances.</i>.

Rebbi Jeremiah said, lighting fire was mentioned by necessity, to teach that courts should not sit on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Yevamot 6b" href="/Yevamot.6b">Babli, <i>Yebamot</i> 6b</a>, this is a Tannaitic statement from the school of R.

Since “settlements” mentioned there refers to courts, “settlements” referred to here also refers to courts. Rebbi Samuel bar Eudaimon said, even if you say that it was mentioned separately necessarily is as if it was mentioned separately not by necessity,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Since the argument is based on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 35:29" href="/Numbers.35.29"><i>Num</i>. 35:29</a>, not on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 22:19" href="/Exodus.22.19">Ex. 22:19</a>, the latter verse can be used in an application of the 9<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> rule.</i> and any item mentioned separately unnecessarily instructs<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">It is axiomatic that the Torah contains no unnecessary statements.

Halakhah 7

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A potsherd to put between one half-brick and another, the words of Rebbi Jehudah. Rebbi Meïr says, to carry fire with it. Rebbi Yose says, to fill it with a <i>quartarius</i>. Rebbi Meïr said, even though it is no proof, it is a hint: <sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 30:14" href="/Isaiah.30.14"><i>Is</i>. 30:14</a>.</i><i>that in its splinters no shard be found to catch fire from the blaze</i>. Rebbi Yose told him, from there is proof, <i>to draw water from the pit</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> 7. “A potsherd (of any size) to put between one half brick,”<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The scribe wrote “a potsherd of any size”; the corrector then changed it into a quote of Mishnah 7. As S. Liebermann points out, the original text is correct and the paragraph starts not with a quote of Mishnah 7 but of a <i>baraita</i> close to Tosephta <i>Kelim Bava qamma</i> 7:17: “Potsherds which may contain even a minimal amount one used to fill, to sanctify, to sprinkle from it...”. The subject is the ceremony of cleansing from the impurity of the dead (<i>Num.</i> 19) which requires that some of the ashes of the Red Cow be in “flowing water drawn into a vessel” (19:17). In this context, “to sanctify” means to put the ashes into the water. From this moment on the slightest inattention will disqualify water and ashes from the ceremony. The paragraph fits in here since both for the rules of the Sabbath and the rules of impurity there is the problem of defining exactly what is called a “vessel”.</i> etc. Rebbi Joḥanan said, one may use it to sanctify; Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish says, one may not use it to sanctify. Rebbi Eleazar asked, in Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish’s opinion, why may one not use it to sanctify? Because it is impervious to impurity <sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">By definition, a vessel is a product of manufacture. Materials in their original state always are impervious to impurity (unless they are derived from animals). A first tentative opinion is that “vessel” is only a manufactured product susceptible to impurity.</i>. But are not vessels made of cow dung, stone vessels, earthen vessels impervious to impurity and one may use them to sanctify<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Parah 5:5" href="/Mishnah_Parah.5.5">Mishnah <i>Parah</i> 5:5</a>.</i>! But because it does not contain a <i>quartarius</i><sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Which everywhere is the minimum of a substantial volume of fluid.</i>. But does not Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish agree that one may sanctify using an arbitrarily small complete clay vessel? It is that the only reason is that it does not have the appellation “vessel”<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Which is required by the verse and, therefore, cannot be dispensed with.</i>. Then it is difficult for Rebbi Joḥanan. It is not enough to disqualify the body<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Meilah 4:5" href="/Mishnah_Meilah.4.5">Mishnah <i>Meˋilah</i> 4:5</a> states that ingesting a <i>quartarius</i> of impure fluid disqualifies a body from any activity requiring purity. It is difficult to see why this should be relevant to the topic at hand. S. Liebermann, following <i>Noˋam</i> <i>Yerushalaim</i> of R. Joshua Eizik of Slonim, suggests to change “body” into “<i>miqweh</i>”. The argument for this is that a <i>miqweh</i> may not be filled with water drawn by a vessel; in this context a “clay vessel” is defined by Mishnah <i>Miqwa’ot</i> 4:3 as one which may contain a minimum volume of one <i>quartarius</i>.</i> but one may use it to sanctify? But this follows Rebbi Yose, for “Rebbi Yose said, also the most minute amount of clay vessel<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">In Mishnah <i>Miqwa’ot</i> 4:3 he states that a clay vessel of <i>any</i> size is a “vessel”; the criterion of one <i>quartarius</i> applies only to potsherds.</i>.” Did not Rebbi Yose say this only for a complete one, and do we not deal here with a broken one? What Rebbi Ḥiyya stated<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Kelim Kamma 7:10" href="/Tosefta_Kelim_Kamma.7.10">Tosephta <i>Kelim Bava qamma</i> 7:17</a>.</i> supports Rebbi Joḥanan; what Rebbi Simeon ben Yoḥai<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>baraita</i> has not come down to us.</i> stated supports Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish.

Or since the menstruating woman imparts impurity through a cover stone<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Stone is impervious to impurity. In general, anything not susceptible to impurity cannot transmit impurity. The one and only exception is impurity caused by genital discharges where impurity by load (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 9:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.9.1.2">Note 2</a>) applies to anything under the affected person and even a stone plate covering a mattress will not shield the mattress from impurity if a person afflicted by a genital discharge sits on the stone. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Niddah 69b" href="/Niddah.69b">Babli <i>Niddah</i> 69b</a>.</i>, does idolatry impart impurity through a cover stone? Rebbi Zeriqan in the name of Rav Jehudah, but some say in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Rebbi Aqiba agrees with the Sages that idolatry does not impart impurity through a cover stone. But the rabbis say it was compared to <i>abomination</i> s of vermin. As vermin imparts impurity by motion<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Here one has a serious discrepancy between the technical terminology of the Babli and the Yerushalmi. In the Babli impurity by motion is a form of impurity by load: If a person suffering from a genital discharge moves something indirectly or is moved with it, he imparts impurity. In the Yerushalmi this is consistently designated by its Mishnaic name, מִדְרָס, “stepping on.” This kind of impurity emphatically does not exist for vermin, or anything other than genital discharges. Therefore היסט the “motion” mentioned here must be that of a person’s hand touching an impure object.

Just as real estate cannot become forbidden by idolatry, larceny by improper use of dedicated objects does not apply to real estate. If a house is considered real estate, it cannot become forbidden by worship, and its improper use while in the possession of the Temple cannot trigger a fine for larceny. If it is not considered real estate since the building materials were movables before being used, but it can become forbidden and improper use can trigger the fine.</i>? Rebbi Ḥaggai objected before Rebbi Yose, does not a Mishnah disagree with Rav? “A trough in a rock: one does not fill from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Parah 5:7" href="/Mishnah_Parah.5.7">Mishnah <i>Parah</i> 5:7</a>.

A vessel is movable; therefore a trough hewn into the rock is not a vessel. The water flowing from the source into the trough becomes standing water. Therefore it may be used neither (1) to fill a vessel for the ashes, nor (2) to put some ashes in the water, “to sanctify it”, nor (3) to sprinkle the water on impure persons to purify them.<br>In addition, a corpse in a “tent” makes everything in the tent impure including the contents of vessels whose cover is not tightly fastened (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 19:15" href="/Numbers.19.15"><i>Num</i>. 19:15</a>).

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> From where that a ship is pure<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">While a ship is a vessel, it is not subject to the impurity of vessels.

From where that a garden bed that is six by six hand-breadths one may sow with five kinds of seeds, four at its four sides and one in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The problem is that of <i>kilaim</i>, the prohibition to grow different kinds of produce on the same field. Different kinds if grown on parallel fields must be separated by an uncultivated strip, but such fields may touch one another at a single point. The minimum size of a plot that can be planted with several kinds is a 6-by-6 hand-breadths plot, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Kilayim 3:1" href="/Mishnah_Kilayim.3.1">Mishnah <i>Kilaim</i> 3:1 Notes 1–2</a>; the configuration envisaged by the Mishnah is shown there in fig. 3–1. It is suggested that one divide the plot into 36 squares of one hand-breadth edge length each. Along the four edges, the corner squares are left fallow. Then on each edge, a rectangle, 4 long and 1 wide, can be planted. These 4 rectangles may be planted with 4 different kinds since they meet only at a pair of vertical angles. Together, they contain 16 of the 1-by-1 squares. The interior edges of the rectangles enclose a 4-by-4 square. In this square, a square can be planted in the shape of a diamond, having its vertices at the midpoints of the inner edges of the rectangles. This is permitted as רֹאשׁ תּוֹר. The diagonals of the diamond have length 4; it covers exactly half of the internal square of 16 square hand-breadths. Hence, the entire cultivated area is 8 + 16 = 24 hand-breadths square. [If instead we assume that the fallow squares at the corners have edge length <i>a</i>, then the total cultivated area, in square handbreadths, is<br><i>f</i>(<i>a</i>) = 4<i>a</i>(6 - 2<i>a</i>) + 0.5(6 - 2<i>a</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup>.<br>A simple computation then shows that the maximum is attained for <i>a</i> = 1, <i>f</i>(1) = 24.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> 2<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts the discussion of Mishnah 2. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 83b" href="/Shabbat.83b">Babli 83b</a>.</i>. Did you have to learn from the sea<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">It is very irregular to derive halakhic principles from the Hagiographs since the only admitted source is the Pentateuch.</i>, just as the sea is pure so also the ship is pure?

These are described <i>as wooden vessels, or textiles, or leather, or a sack, or anything used in work</i>. This is read to mean that containers are subject to impurity only if they can be handled like a sack; i. e., transported by a human both empty and filled. Usually a ship is too large to be handled in this way.</i>? The sack may be used both on sea and on dry land; a ship can be used on sea but cannot be used on dry land<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This is a first argument to deny that a comparison with a sack is possible in this case.</i>. The rabbis of Caesarea say, this is about a clay vessel. Since the sack teaches only about what is written in the paragraph<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Clay vessels are not mentioned in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:32" href="/Leviticus.11.32"><i>Lev</i>. 11:32</a>; the rules for these must be derived from other sources which, however, do not lend themselves to interpretation based on size.</i>, this excludes clay vessels which are not mentioned in the paragraph so that the sack could have taught about it
<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The origin of this paragraph is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.1"><i>Kilaim</i> 3:1 (Notes 6–18</a>,<b>כ</b>). In the copy here, an essential sentence was omitted by the scribe. On the other hand, the spelling here is somewhat more careful than in <i>Kilaim.</i></i><i>Its sown seeds</i>: the minimum of seeds are two<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">It does not say, <i>it will make to germinate its seedling</i> but <i>its seedlings.</i> The verse uses a plural for the seedlings in a garden( interpreted as one garden bed); this proves only that it is possible to sow more than one kind.</i>. Rebbi Samuel bar Sisarta said, from two you infer four. Just as for two you start at the beginning of six and reduce continuously, so for four you start at the beginning of six and reduce continuously. It is impossible<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The correct Yerushalmi form for “impossible”; the form אי אפשר in <b>כ</b> is Babylonian.</i> that there should not be a free space to plant in the middle<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The argument as explained by R. Simson: At the end of the paragraph, it is stated that one deals with a vegetable bed surrounded by other vegetable beds. The rules of “jailing” (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 2:5:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.2.5.5"><i>Kilaim</i> 2:8 Note 120</a>) prohibit to grow one kind of produce on a field surrounded by four fields on which other kinds are grown and therefore require that at the corners squares of one hand-breadth each must be empty. In order to grow two kinds of plants, one may sow two strips, each 4 hand-breadths long, along parallel edges, each one 2.25 hand-breadths wide, so that the required separation of 1.5 hand-breadths be observed in the middle. But then the argument may be used also for the other two edges. This means that one sows four triangular patches; each one has a base of 4 hand-breadths on an edge of the garden bed, with base angles of 45°. These triangles must be separated by strips 1.5 hand-breadths wide. This means that at the edges, we must leave a square of edge length <i>a</i> empty, whose diagonal is 1.5 = <i>a</i>2<sup class="footnote-marker">½</sup>. Hence, <i>a</i> = 1.061; the bases of the triangle can only be 3.878 hand-breadths. In that case, the distance of the third vertex of the triangle from its base is equal to half the base on the edge, or 1.939 hand-breadths. The distance from the center is <i>a</i> = 1.061 &lt; 1.5. In order to plant a single seed in the middle, it is therefore necessary to cut off the triangles at distance 1.5 from center and edge, creating four congruent trapezoids. The height of a trapezoid is <i>h</i>=1.5, its base 2<i>b</i>=3.878. By similar triangles, the length <i>t</i> of its top is given by 2<i>b</i>/<i>b</i> = <i>t</i>/(<i>b-h</i>) or <i>t</i> = 0.878. That makes it possible to plant a single fifth kind in a small space in the middle. The total area planted amounts to four times the area of the trapezoids, 15.044 square hand-breadths, plus the area of the small space in the middle.</i>. Rebbi Jonah said, working space joins working space but a kind does not meet another kind to jail it<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Each separate kind needs a working space around it, given by the strip of width 1.5 hand-breadths, but the same strip does serve two different kinds without problem. Also, the rules of “jailing” only apply to fields, not to garden beds.</i>. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: <i>Its seed, its seeds, its sown seeds</i><sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Here starts a new approach, <i>viz</i>., that the verse itself implies more than 2 kinds. The word זרוע appears only twice in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 61:11" href="/Isaiah.61.11">Bible, <i>Is</i>. 61:11</a> and in a description of grain (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 11:37" href="/Leviticus.11.37"><i>Lev</i>. 11:37</a>): <i>seeds of seedlings that may be sown</i>. In contrast to modern dictionaries which take זרוע as a word different from זרע, the authors here take it as expansion of זרע “seed.” The root is expanded three times, by taking the plural, adding a possessive suffix, and adding the letter ו. Each change is taken as a plural, hence three plurals are added for a total of six units.</i>. That follows Rebbi Jehudah, since Rebbi Jehudah said six, <i>seed, its seed, its seeds, its sown seeds</i>. Rebbi Ḥaggai said, זרעיה has five letters; everywhere I find ו I delete it<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">R. Ḥaggai assumes that originally all Hebrew spelling was what is called defective. Hence, any ו or י that is neither part of the root nor required by grammatical rules is considered an addition by later scribes and therefore is disregarded. That eliminates the ו but leaves the י which is required as sign of plural. One ends up with five letters, following the anonymous opinion in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Kilayim 3:1:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kilayim.3.1.1">Mishnah <i>Kilaim</i>3:1</a>.</i>. This was asked of Rebbi Ḥuna, the scribe of the assembly, and he said, זירועיה is written plene<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The spelling זירעיה in the text is certainly wrong since the expression of <i>ṣere</i> by י is standard only in Mishnaic and later texts, not in Biblical ones. Hence, the <i>plene</i> writing refers to the masoretic spelling of the word; one has six letters, supporting Rebbi Jehudah.</i>. Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi Yannai: <sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Added from <b>כ</b>, needed by the context.</i>[All inside of six<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">All seeds are sown in the interior of the bed, away from the corners.</i>. Cahana in the name of Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish:] All at the outside of six<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The corners at the boundary, which are at the outside, are sown. Then one may sow four 1-by-l corner patches, four 1-by-l patches at the center of each edge, and a center diamond, for a total of nine patches.</i>. Then we should state “nine!” Rebbi Tanḥum from Bostra said, that is true. But our Mishnah speaks of a garden bed in the middle of garden beds<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Since the rules of “jailing” apply to garden beds as a whole, not to smaller patches, the corners cannot be sown. This is the opinion of Samuel in the Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 86b). Otherwise, it really is possible to sow 9 kinds, as the Babli puts it (<i>Šabbat</i> 86a), in the case of a garden bed planted on land otherwise dry, with no other beds nearby. Rav in the Babli still admits only five kinds even on dry land.</i>.

The text has to be read as follows:<br><i>Following him who said that they</i> <i>disagreed about two appellations</i>, it is clear that R. Eliezer declares liable but not R. Joshua. <i>But not following him who said that they disagreed about one appellation</i>. Since the distinction is made only by two authors it is clear that there is an assumption that there is an opposing opinion which holds that R.

But his (and a similar remark by Ritba <i>ad</i> 97a) cannot be taken as witness to the text since he is dependent on his teacher Nahmanides (<i>Novellae Sabbath</i>, ed. M.

Rebbi Isaac ben Rebbi Eleazar asked: If one threw from a private domain to the public domain and remembered when it was over the public domain, in Rebbi Aqiba’s opinion it should be considered as if it rested in the public domain and he should be liable twice<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The statement is elliptic since in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 11:1:2-6:4" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.11.1.2-6.4">Mishnah 7</a> it is stated that if one throws in oblivion of the Sabbath rules and recognizes his error while the object is in flight there cane be no liability for a purification sacrifice. Therefore one has to assume that there was only a fleeting consciousness of the Sabbath prohibition followed by another period of oblivion. Then for R. Aqiba the moment of recognition should be counted both as rest for a first and start for a second throw and there should be liability for two sacrifices. (Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 4b" href="/Shabbat.4b">Babli 4b</a> where Rav Jehudah holds that R.

It was stated: “If one brings the stone and another one the mortar, he who brings the mortar is liable. Rebbi Yose says, both are liable.” Rebbi Yose is of the opinion that stone without mortar is building. Everybody agrees that if one put up mortar first and someone then brought stone he is liable. “The builder who set the stone on top of the row is liable.” For whom is this needed? For the rabbis.

The question is whether using bread to absorb an excessive amount of vinegar and then sucking the vinegar out of the bread to treat the toothache is permitted or forbidden. This now is connected with a problem about heave, which must be eaten by a Cohen in purity. Consumption of heave by an unauthorized person not only is sinful but subjects the offender to a fine of 25% of the value of the food used illegitimately. If such a person uses heave vinegar to dip his bread he clearly uses food and is subject to the fine. If he uses the vinegar as medicine he sinned twice (he used heave illegitimately and he did not use it as food) but he is not subject to the fine. Sucking the vinegar out of the bread and using it for a toothache presents a problem similar to that of use on the Sabbath. Rebbi holds that it is food.</i>.

They were tying down the ropes. But was this not temporary? Rebbi Yose says, because they were travelling and camping by the Word, was it not permanent? Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, since the Holy One, praise to Him, has promised them that he will bring them into the Land, it is as if it were temporary. Rebbi Phineas said, they learned it from the gobelin needle-workers. If a thread broke, he was tying it. If it broke again, it was impossible to make many knots but he would untie the first one. Rebbi Ḥizqiah said, an expert tailor merges the two heads. And where was this said? As Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, they learned it from the weavers of the gobelins. What is the reason? <i>The length of one gobelin</i>, that it should be an entity. If [a thread] broke, he was tying it. When he came to the weave, he untied it and brought it in. Rebbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rav Ḥuna: Even on its warp there was neither knot nor connection.
Rebbi Hoshaia stated, a basket of palm leaves for dates or a plate of palm leaves one may tear and open, only one may not tie.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One saves food for three meals; human food for humans and animal feed for animals. How is this?

Nehemiah’s position since it is presented as anonymous opinion which implies that it is practice to be followed. The need in this case is the obligation to consume three meals on the Sabbath. Since there is no reason to restrict using food on the Sabbath, limiting the moving of food out of the house to the three obligatory meals can be explained only following R. Nehemiah.

It has to be brought <i>on the day after the Sabbath (Lev.</i> 23:15) which in rabbinic tradition is the second day of the Feast of unleavened bread, in the Sadducee tradition of the Book of Jubilees the day following the Feast, and in Boethusian tradition on the Sunday in the Feast. The common testimony of Philo and Josephus shows that rabbinic tradition was followed in the Temple service. The ˋ<i>omer</i> had to be brought to the Temple on a fixed date, even if this date was a Sabbath (except for Boethusians for which this never could happen.) Therefore it is clear that there is a biblical prescription to cut the barley on the Sabbath if that is the day on which the grain has to be offered.<br>The Two Breads are the only leavened bread ever permitted in the Temple precinct; they have to be presented to the altar (but not offered on it) on the festival of Weeks <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 23:17" href="/Leviticus.23.17"><i>(Lev.</i> 23:17</a>), which falls on the 50th day after the <i>ˋomer,</i> on the same day of the week as the <i>ˋomer.</i> These Two Breads permit the use of new wheat in the Temple service. R. Eliezer concludes from an argument of “equal cut”, since both the <i>ˋomer</i> and the Two Breads are referred to in the verse as “first fruits” that they follow the same rules and, therefore, if the two loaves were not baked before the Sabbath they may be baked on the Sabbath.</i>; this implies that Rebbi Eliezer does not disagree in all cases<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">If it were understood that in all cases of a prescribed action on the Sabbath the preparation also can be done on the Sabbath the argument of “equal cut” would be unnecessary. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 131a" href="/Shabbat.131a">Babli 131a</a>.</i>.

Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of Rav Ḥuna: Our Mishnah implies that it is forbidden to make walls of people, as we have stated: “Rebbi Eliezer says, if one did not bring the implement<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The knife for the circumcision.</i> before the Sabbath he brings it openly on the Sabbath.” For if you are saying that one may make, could he not find it possible to make and bring it<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is not from the statement of Rebbi Eliezer which is quoted here but from R.

Samuel said, because of the danger. Rebbi Yose asked, if it is because of the danger one heats hot water for him! Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun in the name of the rabbis there: One heats hot water for him. And it was stated thus: A person heats a linen cloth and puts it on his belly on the Sabbath. A person may not take a bottle full of hot water and put it on his belly on the Sabbath. Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, on the contrary it is permitted.

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If one had two children to circumcise, one on Friday and one on the Sabbath.

The text is unusually difficult.</i>“If one had two children,” etc. <sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">The main problem discussed in the paragraph is the correct reading in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 19:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.19.4.1">Mishnah 4</a>. The Mishnah printed in the Venice edition of the Yerushalmi and reproduced at the start of this Chapter (not from the Leiden ms.) states liability if the baby scheduled for Friday was circumcised on the Sabbath and notes a controversy if the one scheduled for Sunday was circumcised on the Sabbath. In the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 137a" href="/Shabbat.137a">Babli 137a</a> this version is attributed to R. Ḥiyya (the Elder). The Mishnah in the Babli switches the two cases. A <i>baraita</i> in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 137a" href="/Shabbat.137a">Babli 137a</a> in the name of R. Meïr keeps the order of the Mishnah of the Yerushalmi but states “not liable” in the first case. In the following, different authorities seem to accept different readings. The interpretation given here in general follows S. Liebermann.</i> Rebbi Joḥanan said, it is Rebbi Meïr’s who said, for something where there is a commandment performed one is not liable, but if no commandment is performed whether he is liable is disputed<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that R. Joḥanan reads in the Mishnah a text similar to that attributed to R. Meïr in the Babli. If he circumcises the baby scheduled for Sabbath on Friday he violates a positive commandment, <i>viz.,</i> to circumcise on the eighth day, but no liability for a sacrifice is created. If then he circumcises the one scheduled for Friday on the Sabbath, he violates the Sabbath but in the act satisfies a commandment; according to R. Meïr this frees him from liability.</i>. Rebbi Simeon says, where there is a commandment performed one is liable, but if no commandment is performed whether he is not liable is disputed<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simeon reads the Mishnah as given at the start of this Chapter. The fact that the baby scheduled for Friday had to be circumcised and the circumcision on the Sabbath accomplished this does not free from liability for the desecration of the Sabbath.<br>Since the text in <i>Pesaḥim</i> confirms the text here there is no possibility to emend “liable” into “not liable” as proposed by the classical commentaries.</i>. Rebbi Yose in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: The word of Rebbi Meïr is, on condition that it be a sheep without blemish, a yearling, and a well-being sacrifice fit to be changed into a Passover sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 6:5:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.6.5.1">Mishnah <i>Pesaḥim</i> 6:9</a> (6:5 in most independent Mishnah mss.) where in a discussion of liability if a Passover sacrifice was slaughtered incorrectly on a Sabbath which was a 14<sup class="footnote-marker">th</sup> of Nisan, R. Eliezer notes that obligatory sacrifices must be slaughtered on the Sabbath but that a person slaughtering a private sacrifice in the name of a public one on the Sabbath is liable but R. Meïr declares him not liable. R. Joshua rejects a comparison of public and private sacrifices since public sacrifices are prescribed in number but the number of private ones is unlimited.<br>R. Joḥanan notes that R. Meïr exempts from liability only if the error was excusable. A Passover sacrifice must be without blemish, male, and a yearling (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:5" href="/Exodus.12.5"><i>Ex.</i>12:5</a>). A blemished animal cannot be a sacrifice at all; slaughtering a blemished animal as a sacrifice is an inexcusable error. A well-being sacrifice may be male or female and of almost any age (more than 8 days old). Such an animal can be a candidate for Passover sacrifice only if it is a male yearling. If the three conditions are satisfied an illegal switching between the categories is excusable.</i>. One understands from this three consequences. One understands something which is not a fixed number<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">This excludes sacrificing privately in the name of public sacrifices.</i>. And which is not usually exchanged<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">This seems to contradict the prior statement that only well-being sacrifices are exempt from liability if they are fit to be Passover sacrifices. Therefore the commentaries emend the statement to read: And which usually is exchanged. Since the statement is not discussed further in the Halakhah, there is no certainty achievable but since the text is identical in both sources one would have to assume a corruption in the original common source. There is no difficulty explaining the text as it stands. If it were something that routinely can be changed, such as excess Passover animals reclassified as animals for well-being sacrifices, and if the slaughter were legitimate for the new denomination, there would be universal agreement that everything is legitimate and there is merit, never liability. The question of liability can arise only if such a reclassification is unusual and has not been effected.</i>.

Rebbi Zeˋira said, the word of Rebbi Yannai<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">As given in the next sentence.</i> implies that he forgot and circumcised the one for the Sabbath on Friday.

Yannai, there exists a (not otherwise reported) decision by Rav which follows the reading of the Mishnah ascribed to Rav, which therefore decides practice.</i>.

How do you treat the babies in doubt?

Eliezer that in matters of public sacrifices, which are fixed in numbers, there is no excuse for additional slaughter and any error will result in liability. But in matters of private offerings (excluding purification and reparation offerings, which follow the rules of public sacrifices) where the numbers are indefinite, he denies liability for additional infractions of the rules of the Sabbath.

Rebbi Zeˋira said, he only is spreading and folding it on the Sabbath. Rebbi Abba bar Cohen asked before Rebbi Yose, what is the rule for a spread over a chest?

Rebbi Zeˋira said, it is more reasonable that it should be because of sifting. Rebbi Yose and Rebbi Jonah both said, at the start we were saying that Rebbi Zeˋira said it correctly, since as in sifting the flour is below and the farina on top, so in filtering wine the wine as at the bottom and the yeast on top; but we were not saying anything.

The category of selecting was permitted: “he selects normally, on his chest, or from a pot”. <sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is missing in E (as noted in Chapter 7); it is also missing in the ms. text here but was added by the corrector.</i> Also the category of filtering was permitted, “on a holiday one puts into one which was hanging”. But the category of sifting was not permitted. As Rebbi Ḥanina Beroqa said in the name of Rav Jehudah, One does not re-sift the flour but one may pass it through the back of the sieve. If you say it is because of sifting, it should be forbidden. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, it does not follow Rebbi Jehudah, for it was stated in the name of Rebbi Jehudah, they also permitted preparations for making food. There is a question about the following: following the rabbis, may one re-sift the flour through the back of the sieve?

The following is in question: May one take from before one animal and give it before another animal? Is that not the Mishnah, “one may take from before one animal and put it before another on the Sabbath”? The Mishnah is about the same kind; what he asks is about another kind.

As the Babli explains, a donkey eats in a orderly manner, therefore food taken from before the donkey and put before a cow will be eaten.
