Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> An egg was laid on a holiday. The House of Shammay say that it may be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The preparation of food is permitted on a holiday (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:16" href="/Exodus.12.16"><i>Ex.</i> 12:16</a>), but this is restricted to foodstuffs which were available before the start of the holiday. The House of Shammai hold that an entire chicken is food since slaughter for food is permitted on the holiday, and since everybody agrees that an egg found inside a slaughtered chicken on a holiday is permitted food, there is no reason to consider a laid egg as something different.</i>, but the House of Hillel say that it may not be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The House of Hillel consider the laid egg as a new entity which did not exist before the holiday and which therefore is <i>muqṣeh</i> and may not be moved.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> “An egg was laid on a holiday,” etc. What is the reason of the House of Shammai? It is prepared in its mother’s body<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since a chicken may be slaughtered as food on a holiday, it was available all the time and therefore its eggs should not be treated differently.<br>For most of Chapter 1 there exist one or two parallel Genizah fragments edited by L. Ginzberg in his <i>Yerushalmi Fragments</i>, pp. 154–172, noted G and <b>G</b>, 302–303 (G).</i>. What is the reason of the House of Hillel? It is like <i>muqṣeh</i> which dried without him realizing it<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">While <i>muqṣeh</i> is the technical term for anything which is not available to be moved on the holiday or Sabbath, the original meaning is “cut-up”, <i>viz</i>., a heap of cut-up figs lying on the flat roof to ferment and to be made into fig cakes. During the fermentation process the mass is inedible; therefore it has become the paradigm of anything not currently available for use. Here the original meaning is intended. If the owner had inspected his roof on the eve of the holiday he would have realized that the figs were ready food for the holiday and therefore falling under the category of “prepared food” permitted on Sabbath and holiday. But since at sundown of the holiday he had no knowledge of the situation, the figs were not available to him at the start of the holiday and therefore remain forbidden for the rest of the holiday. Similarly, since the owner of the chicken does not know that the egg (which is completely formed with its hard shell) will be laid on the holiday, since it was not available at the start it cannot become available later.</i>, and is <i>muqṣeh</i> which dried without him realizing it not forbidden? But was it not stated<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 1:2" href="/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).1.2">Tosephta 1:2</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 2b" href="/Beitzah.2b">Babli 2b</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 6b" href="/Beitzah.6b">6b</a>.</i>, “if one slaughters a chicken and found eggs inside it, even if they are complete<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">With shell.</i> they are permitted”? Rebbi Ḥananiah and Rebbi Mana. One said, its taste when eaten from its inside is not comparable to its taste when eaten from the outside. But the other said, it is not completed for a chick<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It cannot be used for hatching a new chick. The Yerushalmi presumes that every egg potentially is either food or material for hatching, disputed by the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 2a" href="/Beitzah.2a">Babli, 2a</a>.</i> until it comes outside. What are they with milk<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Meat is forbidden to be used with milk. A laid egg may be used with either milk or meat. What is the status of a complete egg found inside a slaughtered chicken?</i>? Let us say, if they are connected to blood vessels they are forbidden, otherwise permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 6b" href="/Beitzah.6b">Babli 6b</a>.</i>.
“Everybody agrees that an egg of which a major part was laid before the start of the holiday may be eaten on the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 1:3" href="/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).1.3">Tosephta 1:3</a>; in one version in the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 7a" href="/Beitzah.7a">Babli 7a</a> (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 8a" href="/Bekhorot.8a"><i>Bekhorot</i> 8a</a>) this holds true even if the egg in the meantime had again disappeared into the body of the chicken.</i>”. Where do they disagree? If a minor part came out, where the House of Shammai say that it may be eaten, but the House of Hillel say that it may not be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is a logical consequence of the preceding statement. Since we consider an egg of which more than half is visible as completely laid, an egg of which less that half is visible is not laid at all and therefore is an egg totally laid on the holiday and not food available earlier.</i>. “<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 1:3" href="/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).1.3">Tosephta 1:3</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 3b" href="/Beitzah.3b">Babli 3b</a>,<a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 4a" href="/Beitzah.4a">4a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Shabbat 43a" href="/Shabbat.43a"><i>Šabbat</i> 43a</a>. On the holiday (and Sabbath) one may move only things which may be used on the day (except if one needs the place occupied by an unusable implement, when one may clear the place.) Since the egg is neither food nor a usable implement, it cannot be moved.</i> Just as it is forbidden as food so it is forbidden to be moved. If one was mixed with a hundred or a thousand, they are all forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In general, if prohibited material is a small minority in permitted material, it may be disregarded. For example, passive non-kosher ingredients in food may be disregarded if they constitute less than 1/60 of the permitted food. But if the prohibition either will disappear by itself (as in the case of an egg laid on the holiday which is permitted food on the next day) or may be removed by some action, no such disregard is permitted; the entire mixture is prohibited until the prohibition disappears.</i>”. How? Following him who said, if the preparation is in doubt it is forbidden; but him who said, if the preparation is in doubt it is permitted, here he agrees that it is forbidden. For wind-fall there is a doubt where it fell today or fell yesterday, but here one is forbidden and it is proof for all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">If fruit is found under a fruit tree on the holiday, there is a doubt whether it is forbidden as fallen on the holiday or whether it is permitted as fallen before the holiday. Therefore if this fruit is put into a basket with many other fruits, there is a doubt whether any of this is forbidden. If we hold that the requirement to use only food available before the holiday is biblical (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 16:23" href="/Exodus.16.23"><i>Ex.</i> 16:23</a>) the wind-fall is forbidden, but if the requirement is rabbinic and traditional, the wind-fall is permitted cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 24a" href="/Beitzah.24a">Babli 24a</a>. There is nothing clearly forbidden and the rule spelled out at the end of the preceding note cannot be applied. But if an egg was laid on the holiday, for the House of Hillel it certainly is forbidden and therefore the rule which forbids the mixture for the day can be applied.</i>.
Others say in the name of Rebbi Eliezer: It may be eaten together with its mother<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even a follower of the House of Hillel may eat the egg laid on the holiday if he also eats its mother since then the egg was food at the start of the holiday (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 1:1:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Beitzah.1.1.2">Note 6</a>).</i>. [What means, “it may be eaten together with its mother”?]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Corrector’s addition, justified by G.</i> If its mother was prepared for slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is an objection to R. Eliezer’s statement. If the chicken is raised to produce eggs, it is not food and therefore not prepared for the holiday, nor can be its egg before it is laid.</i>. But are not all chickens prepared for slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since a chicken which does not lay eggs anymore also is eaten, every chicken is potential food.</i>? Rebbi Abba said, it may be eaten based on its mother’s preparation<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Even a follower of the House of Hillel may eat the egg laid by a chicken raised for its meat. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 2a" href="/Beitzah.2a">Babli 2a</a>.</i>.
A calf born on a holiday is permitted since it permits itself by slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">An unborn calf inside its mother does not need separate slaughter; its mother’s slaughter also permits the calf which is considered part of its mother’s body. But once it is born, it must be slaughtered to become food. Since the birth on the holiday introduces the duty of slaughtering, an action to satisfy this duty removes also the rabbinic prohibition of moving the animal.</i>. Rebbi Ze`ira asked, in that case an animal kept outside should be permitted since it permits itself by slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A domestic animal kept all year outside, far from permanent human dwellings, may not be cared for on the holiday (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 5:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Beitzah.5.7.1">Mishnah 5:7</a>), therefore certainly it is not prepared to be food of the holiday. This seems to contradict the earlier statement.</i>, deer should be permitted since it permits itself by slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since one is prohibited from catching deer, it cannot possibly be holiday food unless caught before the holiday.</i>. Rebbi Ze`ira came back and said, a calf is fully formed the day before, but here<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In the case of the chicken egg.</i> it was born on the day it was fully formed. Rebbi Abba said, this follows him who said that an animal gives birth after split months; but what is for him who said, an animal gives birth after a fixed number of months<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 21a" href="/Bekhorot.21a">Babli <i>Bekhorot</i> 21a</a>, a disagreement whether cattle gives birth after a full 9 months or not. If the number of days of gestation is not fixed, the owner of the pregnant animal cannot have the intention to use the unborn calf as food on the holiday since he could not know the prospective date of birth.</i>? Think of it, that he knew when a male had mounted it<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In this case it might be possible to compute the day of birth in advance and the calf would be food if that day is a holiday.</i>. A pigeon chick born on a holiday is permitted since it permits itself by slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">An egg is permitted only if no chick developed. A fully formed chick in an egg still is not considered a chick but a forbidden egg; even if a human takes away the shell and slaughters the chick it is the slaughter of an egg which cannot possibly permit any food which was forbidden.</i>; did we not state, an egg which had started to develop, and chicks which do not yet have wings are forbidden as abomination, but one does not whip because of carcass meat? And Rebbi Ḥaggai said, even if he slaughtered them<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">An egg is permitted only if no chick developed. A fully formed chick in an egg still is not considered a chick but a forbidden egg; even if a human takes away the shell and slaughters the chick it is the slaughter of an egg which cannot possibly permit any food which was forbidden.</i>. Rebbi Abun said, explain it about those born with wings<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For these the argument of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 1:1:5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Beitzah.1.1.5">Note 21</a> applies.</i>.
Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Ḥanina (asked)<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Delete with G,<b>G</b>.</i>: <sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 7a" href="/Beitzah.7a">Babli 7a</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bekhorot 8a" href="/Bekhorot.8a"><i>Bekhorot</i> 8a</a>.</i> Any which has sexual relations during daytime gives birth during daytime, during nighttime gives birth during nighttime. They objected, does a chicken not have sexual relations only during daytime and it gives birth both during daytime and nighttime<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Denied by the <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 7a" href="/Beitzah.7a">Babli 7a</a> which holds that chicken eggs are laid only during daytime and therefore an egg found in the nest at early dawn of a holiday is permitted as laid the day before.</i>? Rebbi Abun said, there is a difference, since it gives birth without a male<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">It may lay several eggs from one fertilization by a male.</i>. Rebbi Ze`ira<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In both Genizah texts, Ze`ur (distinct from Ze`urah = Ze`ira).</i> in the name of Giddul: A calf born from a <i>ṭerefa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">An animal which cannot be expected to live for another 12 month; practically an animal injured or missing a limb or organ enumerated in <i>Ḥulin</i> Chapter 3.

The calf is permitted food, the mother is not. Before the birth the calf was forbidden as <i>ṭerefa</i>, now it is permitted and permits itself by slaughter.</i> hidden in something not prepared.
It has been said elsewhere: the egg from a carrion is of permitted use when similar ones are sold in the market; otherwise it is forbidden, according to the opinion of Shammai; Hillel forbids it in any case. What is the reason of the House of Shammai? Shammai allows it because he assumes that the egg was matured before the defect occurred in the animal.<br>If this is so, why should the permission depend on the suitability of the egg for sale in the market? If this is not the case, one would be allowed to eat even the egg that is still attached to the ovary (an integral part of the carrion and forbidden).<br>Is it true that Shammai conforms to the latter Mishna and Hillel to the former?
<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">A slightly corrupt parallel to this text is in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 2:7:3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.2.7.3"><i>Avodah zarah</i> 2:7, Notes 293–302</a>.</i> Rebbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: At first they were saying, one curdles<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">To make cheese. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Chullin 116a" href="/Chullin.116a">Babli <i>Ḥulin</i> 116a</a>.</i> neither with the stomach content of the carcass<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">An animal which was not slaughtered following the rules of ritual slaughter. whose flesh therefore is forbidden as meat.</i> nor with the stomach contents of the Gentile<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">“Gentile’s stomach content” naturally means “stomach content of animal slaughtered by a Gentile.”</i>. They changed to say, one curdles with the stomach content of the carcass but not with the stomach contents of the Gentile. Rebbi Yose ben Abun said, Samuel bar Abba asked: Does this follow Rebbi Eliezer, since Rebbi Eliezer said, the thoughts of the Non-Jew are about pagan worship<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Does this follow R. Eliezer (whom practice does not follow in general) since it treats Gentile rennet as more problematic than the one derived from a carcass? Since here practice is said to follow R. Eliezer, the tradition seems questionable; one has to search for parallel traditions either to confirm or to reject.</i>? Rebbi Yasa in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: Originally, they said, one does curdle neither with carcass stomach contents nor with Gentile’s stomach contents. They changed to say, one does curdle with carcass stomach contents and with Gentile’s stomach contents. Rebbi Yose said, the language of a <i>baraita</i> supports Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The first version which keeps the prohibition of rennet from Gentile sources.</i>: Stomach contents of a Gentile or a carcass is forbidden following the original teaching. The stomach contents of a qualified animal which suckled from a <i>ṭerefa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">An animal which cannot be expected to live for another 12 month; practically an animal injured or missing a limb or organ enumerated in <i>Ḥulin</i> Chapter 3. The meat from such an animal is biblically prohibited.</i> are forbidden following the former teaching, and the stomach contents of a <i>ṭerefa</i> which suckled from a qualified one are permitted following the later teaching. And even if the House of Shammai would argue like the House of Hillel in the first teaching, an egg is a growth of its body<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This now connects the discussion with the Mishnah here. The problem is to understand the position of the House of Hillel since the preparation of food is permitted on a holiday (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:16" href="/Exodus.12.16"><i>Ex.</i> 12:16</a>). According to the Babli and one opinion in the Yerushalmi the prohibition applies only to eggs laid by chickens raised to produce eggs. Then the mother was not food at the start of the holiday. While the egg is food according to everybody, for the House of Hillel it cannot change its character from non-food to food on the holiday. Then the question is raised why milk which is prohibited as food before being ingested by a ruminant becomes permitted by the animal’s stomach. In this question, the revised ruling in matters of rennet would agree with the stance of the House of Shammai. But the answer is that the two cases cannot be compared; the stomach contents of an animal never were part of the animal and do not have the latter’s status.</i>; the contents of the stomach come from the outside. It parallels what Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said in the name of Rebbi Joḥanan: It happened to the sons of Jehudah ben Shamuai that wolves tore more than 300 of their flock. The case came before the Sages who permitted their stomach contents<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">T he latter teaching which permits rennet from animals prohibited as meat is confirmed by a ruling in an actual case.</i>. They said, an egg is a growth of its body; the contents of the stomach come from the outside.
“If it was laid on the holiday it may be eaten on the Sabbath, on the Sabbath it may be eaten on the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">An egg laid on a holiday which is a Friday may be eaten on the following Sabbath; and an egg laid on a Sabbath may be eaten on a holiday which is on the following Sunday.</i>. Rebbi Jehudah said in the name of Rebbi Eliezer, this is the disagreement. The house of Shammai say that it may be eaten, but the House of Hillel say that it may not be eaten<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosefta Beitzah (Lieberman) 1:3" href="/Tosefta_Beitzah_(Lieberman).1.3">Tosephta 1:3</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 4a" href="/Beitzah.4a">Babli 4a</a>. According to R. Eliezer, the House of Hillel hold that the prohibition of newly available food on Sabbath and holiday is biblical; therefore since the egg was unavailable one moment before the start of the Sabbath it is unavailable on the Sabbath. For the anonymous majority and the House of Shammai the prohibition is rabbinical; since holiday and Sabbath represent two different kinds of holiness, the prohibition on one day has no influence on the other day.</i>.” Rebbi Ḥanina instructed the Sepphoreans about spontaneous growth of mustard<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In the Sabbatical year, as exception to R. Simeon’s rule that all spontaneous growth of cultivated plants are forbidden in the Sabbatical.</i> and about the egg following Rebbi Jehudah. Rebbi Joḥanan came and preached to them following the rabbis here and the rabbis there<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">That spontaneous growth of mustard is forbidden as object of trade, and that an egg laid on the holiday was permitted on the Sabbath. From here on to the end of the next paragraph the text also is in <i>Ševi`it</i> 9:1 (Notes 22–30,<b>שׁ</b>).</i>. Rebbi Abba bar Zemina in the name of Rebbi Joṣadaq: Because of these two things did Rebbi Joḥanan descend from Sepphoris to Tiberias. He said, why did you bring me this old man, what I am permitting he prohibits, what I am prohibiting he permits<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The historicity of this remark is doubtful since R. Joḥanan was R. Ḥanina’s student in Sepphoris (at least in Aggadah). It is reasonable to accept the fact that R. Joḥanan went to Tiberias to become there Chief Rabbi.</i>. Rebbi Abba said, there came a case before Rebbi Yasa and he wanted to act following Rebbi Joḥanan but when he heard that Rav and Rebbi Ḥanina disagreed he refrained.
<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph also is copied in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 3:8:2-3" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.3.8.2-3"><i>Eruvin</i> 3, Notes 169–176</a>, where the readings of <i>Beṣah</i> and <i>Ševi`it</i> are compared.</i> Because they disagreed: May the remainders of a wick, a fire, or oil that burned out on the Sabbath be lit on the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Eruvin 3:7:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.3.7.1">Mishnah <i>Eruvin</i> 3:9</a> where it is stated that if a holiday precedes or follows a Sabbath one may make two <i>eruvin</i> to move one’s Sabbath domain in two different directions for the two days. This clearly presupposes that the restriction of one’s Sabbath domain to 2’000 cubits outside of town is rabbinical. (It is agreed that the limit of 12 <i>mil</i>, 3 <i>parasang</i>, is biblical.) In the case here, it is agreed that the remainders of spent fuel are <i>muqṣeh</i> on the Sabbath, when lighting a fire was prohibited. If this is a biblical prohibition then it is <i>muqṣeh</i> also on the holiday which is on Sunday, but if it is rabbinic then it will be permitted on the holiday, when lighting a fire is permitted.</i>? Rav and Rebbi Ḥanina both say it is forbidden, but Rebbi Joḥanan says, it is permitted. Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yudan, is it the reverse regarding an egg<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Since the dispute between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai was described earlier as whether a chicken automatically is food on a holiday or only if it was raised for its meat, not for producing eggs.</i>?

Rav Ḥisda asked: the argument of Rav seems to be inverted. There, he makes it two sanctities, but here he makes it one sanctity. Because they disagreed: May the remainders of a wick, a fire, or oil that burned out on the Sabbath be lit on the holiday? Rav and Rebbi Ḥanina both say it is forbidden, but Rebbi Joḥanan says, it is permitted. Rebbi Mana said before Rebbi Yudan, is it the reverse regarding an egg? He said to him, since the rabbis compare it, it means that the two cases are identical<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of the last four sentences the source G simply states that one repeats from the start of the paragraph. Rav Ḥisda’s question really is not answered. The Babli gives several tentative explanations of Rav’s position. The one consistent with the Yerushalmi is that only weekdays can prepare for holidays but the Sabbath cannot prepare for a holiday. Since the reason for Rav’s ruling in the case of fuel is not based on the number of sanctities involved, his decisions are consistent.</i>.
Everybody agrees that wind-fall is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Fruit that fell from its tree on a holiday.</i>. Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked before Rebbi Ze`ira: What is the difference between wind-fall and eggs? Is wind-fall on its mother<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The tree. Since fruit hanging on a tree must be harvested before it can be moved, it is biblically forbidden.</i> not forbidden, but are eggs in their mother not permitted? Then if it was laid on the Sabbath it should not be eaten on the holiday, if laid on the holiday it should not be eaten on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">If the egg only is permitted because it may be eaten in its mother, on a Sabbath when slaughter is prohibited the egg should be prohibited according to everybody if the holiday was on a Friday.</i>! He answered him, is that so? Is it not enough that you were restrictive about it that if it was laid on the holiday it may not be eaten on the holiday that you want to be more restrictive that if laid on the holiday it should not be eaten on the Sabbath, if laid on the Sabbath it should not be eaten on the holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Since we had concluded earlier that also for the House of Hillel it is a matter of preparation, not harvest or a similar biblical injunction, there is no reason to pile rabbinic restrictions on rabbinic restrictions.</i>? Rebbi Jeremiah asked, what is the status of decorations of a <i>sukkah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Edible decorations. Since the <i>sukkah</i> may not be demolished during the week of Tabernacles, any decorations are part of the <i>sukkah</i> and may not be taken. The question is about the Eighth Day which is a holiday but not part of Tabernacles and not a time when the <i>sukkah</i> is used. Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 3:6:2" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.3.6.2"><i>Šabbat</i> 3, Note 170</a>.</i>? Rebbi Jeremiah turned around and said, all seven &lt;days&gt; they are insignificant in the <i>sukkah</i>, afterwards they are prepared<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This is a position denied by R.

Halakhah 1

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If the holiday falls on a Friday a person may not cook on the holiday especially for the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since the sanctity of the holiday is distinct from that of the Sabbath, the permission to prepare food on a holiday does not imply to prepare food for a different day.</i> but he may cook for the holiday and if he left over he left over; or<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the preferred way and is called <i>eruv tavshilin</i>, “and <i>eruv</i> for dishes.” One cooks for the Sabbath on Wednesday or Thursday, and declares that the dish is cooked especially for the Sabbath.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> The House of Shammai say, one brings well-being offerings without leaning on them, but not elevation offerings; but the House of Hillel say one brings both well-being and elevation offerings and one leans on them<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The pilgrimage to the Temple requires that the worshipper bring both an elevation offering for his appearance in the Temple and a well-being offering for the family celebration (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:2:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.2.1">Mishnah <i>Ḥagigah</i> 1:2</a>). Both an elevation offering (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 1:4" href="/Leviticus.1.4"><i>Lev.</i> 1:4</a>) and a well-being offering (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 3:2" href="/Leviticus.3.2"><i>Lev.</i> 3:2</a>) require that the offerer lean on the head of the sacrifice. The House of Shammai say that on the holiday one may bring a well-being offering since it is the basis of a family meal and therefore appropriate for the holiday, but do not allow for the leaning since the leaning has to be done as hard as possible, which they declare is using the animal comparable to riding it, which is rabbinically forbidden on the holiday. Since by biblical standards the sacrifice cannot be brought without being leaned on, they require the leaning being done before the holiday (after the dedication of the animal as sacrifice and in the Temple precinct.) They do not permit elevation offerings on the holiday itself since it is completely burned and does not represent food. The House of Hillel hold that both kinds of sacrifices are biblically required for holidays of pilgrimage and therefore cannot be excluded on the holiday itself. For them the biblical requirement of leaning-on overrides rabbinical restrictions.</i>.
<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This Halakhah also appears as <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:3:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.2.3.2-5"><i>Ḥagigah</i>2:3</a> (<b>ח</b>).</i> The House of Shammai say, irregular leaning-on was permitted. But the House of Hillel say, irregular leaning-on was not permitted. What is irregular leaning-on? From the day before. Rebbi Ze`ira said, everybody agrees that he did not fulfill his obligation regarding the reparation offering of a sufferer from skin disease if he leaned on the day before<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">While the ritual of rehabilitating the healed sufferer from skin disease nowhere explicitly requires leaning on the sacrifice, it is written there (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 14:13" href="/Leviticus.14.13"><i>Lev.</i> 14:13</a>) that “the reparation sacrifice follows the rules of the purification sacrifice”, and for the latter (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 4" href="/Leviticus.4"><i>Lev.</i> 4</a>) it is written repeatedly “he leans-on and he slaughters”, implying first that leaning on is required and second that the two actions have to be close in time.</i>; he fulfilled his obligation with voluntary well-being offerings for which he leaned on the day before<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Since these are sacrifices in satisfaction of a voluntary vow, no fixed time table is given here.</i>.

As well-being offerings they have no fixed time table (but they cannot be brought before the holiday), as obligatory offerings at fixed times, on the holidays of pilgrimage, they are more like the offering of the healed sufferer from skin disease whose sacrifice is required on the eighth day of his procedure.</i>. The House of Shammai treat them like voluntary well-being offerings; the House of Hillel treat them like the reparation offering of a sufferer from skin disease. Rebbi Yasa said, that what you are saying, he did not fulfill his obligation regarding the reparation offering of a sufferer from skin disease if he leaned on the day before, {only} on time. If its time has passed it becomes like voluntary well-being offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">If the eighth day has passed, the sacrifice can be brought at any time.

The House of Shammai said to them, vows and voluntary gifts are proof, since they are permitted to the private person but forbidden to Heaven. The House of Hillel said to them, no. If you are speaking about vows and voluntary gifts which have no fixed time, what does this imply for the festival offering which has a fixed time? The House of Shammai answered them, the festival offering has no fixed time since if he did not offer it on the first day, he may offer it on the second day, if he did not offer it on the second day, he may offer it on the third day. The House of Hillel told them, the festival offering has a fixed time, for if he did not offer it on the holiday of pilgrimage he may not offer it after the holiday. The House of Shammai said to them, is it not already said: <i>only what can be eaten by any person this alone may be made for you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 12:16" href="/Exodus.12.16"><i>Ex.</i> 12:16</a>.</i>? The House of Hillel answered them, is that a proof? <i>For you</i> it may not be made, [but] it is made for Heaven. Abba Shaul says it was based on another reason: Since when your stove is closed down, your Master’s stove is open, when your stove is open it only is logical that your Master’s stove should be open. Another explanation: It is not in order that your table should be full but the table of your Creator be empty.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">While there are two disputes between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai, about leaning on animals and about bringing elevation offerings on a holiday proper, it is clear that once it is decided that elevation offerings can be brought with the required leaning-on, well-being offerings also may be brought with all required ceremonies. Therefore the argument reduces to one about the possibility of offering private elevation offerings on a full holiday. The first argument of the House of Hillel is that on the Sabbath, when all cooking or other use of fire is forbidden to humans, the Temple altar is in full action, burning two daily and two <i>musaf</i> offerings. Therefore on a holiday when cooking is permitted, it must be possible for private persons to offer sacrifices to be burned on the altar. The argument is refuted by the House of Shammai since it is agreed that sacrifices not brought as festival offerings but in fulfillment of a vow (either as “vow”, i. e., a promise of <i>an</i> animal, or as “voluntary offering”, a promise of <i>this</i> animal) cannot be brought on the full holiday but only on the intermediate days (or for Pentecost, the week following.) The House of Hillel then point out that vows may be brought any time during the year, it only is a convenience to bring them when one has to visit the Temple anyhow; but festival offerings which are tied to the festival must be brought on the festival. The House of Shammai answer that the festival offerings may be brought on the intermediate days (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:6:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.1.6.1">Mishnah <i>Ḥagigah</i> 1:6</a>), when all work is permitted; but the House of Hillel retort that still after the end of the holiday period there is no possibility of making up for a missed holiday sacrifice. The inconclusive discussion is cut short by Abba Shaul and the “other explanation”, that the position of the House of Shammai leads to the Temple being empty of people on full holidays, crowded on the intermediate days, whereas Pentateuch, Prophets, and Psalms all indicate that the essence of a holiday of pilgrimage is that the Temple precinct be filled to capacity, and that therefore practice must follow the House of Hillel, as explained in the last paragraph of the Halakhah.</i>”
Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish was passing by the school when he heard them reciting the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">1<i>Chr</i>. 29:21.</i>, <i>they sacrificed animal sacrifices and brought elevation sacrifices the next day</i>. He said, he who interrupts follows the House of Shammai<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">If one reads <i>they sacrificed animal sacrifices, but they brought elevation sacrifices the next day</i>, one implies that the day when Solomon was definitively installed as King in an assembly of all of Israel was a holiday, a natural assumption. While זֶבַח simply means “slaughtered offering”, in the Talmudim the expression always is interpreted to refer to family sacrifices, well-being or thanksgiving offerings. The verse then implies that it was permitted to bring well-being sacrifices on the same day, but not elevation offerings, which seems to follow the House of Shammai. (Since the House of Shammai require that the leaning-on ceremony be performed the day before, this interpretation presupposes that everybody knew in advance what David was going to do; unlikely but not impossible.)</i>; he who reads it as one sentence follows the House of Hillel<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">If one reads the verse following the masoretic accents it is one unit and implies that well-being and elevation offerings were brought on the same day, but since the next day was supposed to be a workday, what one should formulate that the verse describe a situation equally acceptable to both Houses.</i>.

This implies that all elevation sacrifices were State sacrifices; following the House of Shammai the well-being sacrifices of all of Israel would have to be mentioned before, not after, the elevation sacrifices.</i>?

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> <sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The entire Halakhah was copied in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:7:2-5" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.7.2-5"><i>Šabbat</i> 1 (Notes 369–379</a>) relating to Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 1:10.</i> Who informs? If the trap was sprung, it is certain that they were caught when it still was daytime. But if the trap was not sprung, it is certain that they were not caught when it still was daytime. And even if the trap was sprung, in worry one may say that they were not caught when it still was day<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah requires that it be known that an animal was trapped before the start of the holiday. How can this be ascertained unless one go there and take it out before the holiday? Does the first part of the Mishnah have any practical application? The answer is that by observation from afar one may determine what happened.<br>If an animal is trapped before the onset of the holiday it is prepared to be food on the holiday and may be taken and processed on the holiday. Another question then is whether the extension of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 16:5" href="/Exodus.16.5"><i>Ex.</i> 16:5</a> to holidays is considered biblical (when cases of doubt have to be resolved restrictively) or rabbinic (when cases of doubt have to be resolved leniently).</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, if it was set in a forest. You should know that it is so since we have stated “fish”. Are fish not there where they are found?

(Quoted by <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tosafot on Shabbat 17b:7:2" href="/Tosafot_on_Shabbat.17b.7.2">Tosaphot <i>Šabbat</i>17b <i>s.v</i>. אלא</a>).</i>.
Rebbi Ze`ira in the name of Rav, they wanted to say, they are permitted the next day<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This now refers to the fish brought by a Gentile to Rabban Gamliel. Did he want to say that they can be handled by Jews on the holiday but not eaten on that day or are they as if prepared by a Jew beforehand (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 24a" href="/Beitzah.24a">Babli <i>Beṣah</i> 24a</a>)?</i>. Rebbi Ḥizqiah and Rebbi Uziel the son of Rebbi Onias of Barat Hauran: They are really permitted. They wanted to say, its doubt made it permitted. Rebbi Ḥanina and Rebbi Jonathan both say, if in doubt whether it was prepared it is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As explained earlier, the disagreement is whether the requirement of prior preparation is biblical or rabbinic.</i>. But Rebbi Joḥanan said, if in doubt whether it was prepared it is permitted.
The Elder Rebbi Ḥiyya and Rebbi Simeon ben Rebbi, one said a Gentile needs preparation, the other said, a Gentile does not need preparation<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As explained earlier, the disagreement is whether the requirement of prior preparation is biblical or rabbinic.</i>.

He came and told it to his teacher who said to him, this one follows the argument of Rebbi Simai, as Rebbi Simai said, a Gentile does not need preparation. Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Joshua ben Levi: The red grapes in a vineyard are forbidden. Rav Huna in the name of Rav: The hard dates on palm leaves are permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Grapes which still are hard at harvest time and left to ripen in late autumn do not fall down by themselves; one must assume that they were plucked from the vine on the day they were brought; one may not accept them from a Gentile who brings them on a holiday.

Halakhah 3

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> A dangerously sick animal<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">One is afraid the animal might die and be lost as food. The animal can be slaughtered only if it is possible to use it as food on the holiday.</i> one should not slaughter unless it be known that one may eat from it a roasted piece in the size of an olive during daytime.

Should one not worry that maybe they were punctured? The presumption of intestines is that they are qualified. It was stated: But one may bring it on its hide. What does he do? He leaves one limb on it and brings it together with it<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">While in Chapter 1 it was permitted to give the hides to the tanner, this refers to hides of animals destined from the start as food on the holiday and therefore prepared for the holiday. But the animal in question here was not prepared and the raw hide is not an implement; there is no reason to permit its movement on the holiday. The expedient to use is not to skin the animal completely but leave one ;piece of meat on the hide. Then this meat is potential food and may be moved; the hide is moved as an appendix of that meat.</i>.

Halakhah 4

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> If a firstling<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The unblemished firstling has to be given to a Cohen who has to sacrifice it in the Temple.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> The argument of Rebbi Jehudah seems inverted since we stated there<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 24:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.24.4.1">Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i> 24:4</a>.</i>, “Rebbi Jehudah says, if it was not a cadaver before the Sabbath it is forbidden since it is not prepared<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">He does not permit dog food if it was not available before the start of the Sabbath, how can he permit human food which was not available on the the eve of the holiday?</i>.” And here he says so? Rebbi Jehudah follows his own opinion since Rebbi Jehudah said, the expert is not from the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah Bekhorot 4:3" href="/Mishnah_Bekhorot.4.3">Mishnah <i>Bekhorot</i>4:3</a>, R.

He must hold that by biblical standards it is only the fact of the blemish that counts, not its certification by an expert. In addition, any kosher animal is potential food at all times.</i>. Rebbi Ḥuna in the name of Rebbi Abba: It is Rebbi Jehudah’s since Rebbi Jehudah gives the same rules for inspecting a firstling as inspecting <i>ṭerefah</i>. As you are saying there, one inspects for <i>ṭerefah</i> on a holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">An animal suffering from a life-threatening defect is prohibited as food. While there is a long list of such defects, these disqualify as food only if they are found, but one does not have to examine every slaughtered animal for all of these defects except for the lung for which it is obligatory to check for tubercular lesions which would make the animal unfit for human consumption. Since slaughter is permitted on the holiday, inspection for <i>ṭerefah</i> automatically is not only permitted but in fact required to legitimize the slaughter.</i>, similarly one inspects a firstling on the holiday. Rebbi Yudan asked: <i>Demay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Demay</i> is produce of which it is not known whether tithes were taken, cf. Introduction to Tractate <i>Demay</i>.</i> is from their words. and inspecting for <i>terefah</i> is from their words. Since you are saying that one inspects for <i>ṭerefah</i> on a holiday, does one separate <i>demay</i> on a holiday<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi Huna’s argument is disproved since it would imply that <i>demay</i> can be removed on the holiday. But it is stated in Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i>2:7 that <i>demay</i> may be tithed only during twilight on Sabbath (and holiday) eve, therefore not on the holiday itself.</i>? Rebbi Abbahu in the name of Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina: Any whose defect was visible on the eve of a holiday but the expert permitted it only on the holiday is not prepared<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This statement clearly follows the opinion of R.

But if a healthy calf is born on the holiday, it is food at least for R. Jehudah.</i> calf which was born from a <i>terefah</i> animal on the holiday is permitted. Rav Ḥisda said, explain it if the expert transgressed and saw it<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">If the corrector’s addition is deleted, then R. Ḥisda explains R.

There came a case<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Of a firstling falling into a cistern.</i> before Rebbi Immi who wanted to say, between Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon, practice follows Rebbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumot</i>3:1, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Eruvin 46b" href="/Eruvin.46b">Babli <i>Eruvin</i>46b</a>.</i>.

Rebbi Eliezer said, he should lift the first one for the purpose of slaughtering it and slaughter it. The second one has to be provided for at its place so it should not die. Rebbi Joshua says, he should lift the first one for the purpose of slaughtering it and not slaughter it, and be cunning and lift the second one<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As long as it is not determined which animal is to be turned into food, both are potential food and can be moved.</i>.

Rebbi Abun bar Ḥiyya asked: Is the argument of Rebbi Eliezer not inverted? Here he says, one is prohibited from cunning but there he says, one is permitted to be cunning<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In the matter of an animal and its young he requires strict adherence to the rules. By the biblical rules, a piece of bread dough has to be given to the Cohen under the rules of heave (cf. Introduction to Tractate <i>Ḥallah</i>). Impure <i>ḥallah</i> must be burned but unusable <i>sancta</i> may not be burned on the holiday and dough kneaded on the holiday would become leavened if stored for the next day. Therefore R. Eliezer instructs the baker to bake the <i>mazzah</i> completely and then remove a small part as <i>ḥallah</i>, a method frowned upon on any other day of the year. R. Joshua instructs to follow all the usual rules of <i>ḥallah</i> and burn the dough after the holiday since he holds that leavened matter is forbidden only to Jews, not to Heaven, and <i>ḥallah</i> is Heaven’s property.</i>. There it is because “not to be seen nor found”; here, what do you have<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In matters of dough on Passover there is no other way out (short of not making food on the holiday); in the matters of animals it is possible to follow all the rules.</i>?

Rebbi Idi said, here it is a rabbinic Sabbath prohibition, but there liability for a purification offering<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Muqṣeh</i> is rabbinic; eating bread without taking <i>ḥallah</i> is a deadly sin.</i>. Rebbi Yose ben Rebbi Bun said, here it is to protect Jews’ money; there what do you have<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The animals in the cistern are valuable; impure <i>ḥallah</i> is worthless.</i>?

Halakhah 5

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> An animal which dies<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">And no longer is food; it became <i>muqṣeh</i> and may not be moved on the holiday.</i> one may not move from its place.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Samuel said, the five Elders who instructed Rebbi Tarphon in Lydda erred<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Since in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 24:4:1" href="/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.24.4.1">Mishnah <i>Šabbat</i>24:4</a> the anonymous majority (following R.

Jehudah permits that only for animals having died before the Sabbath, it is established that on the Sabbath practice follows R. Simeon who in most cases denies that the rules of <i>muqḥeh</i> apply.

Rav Mattanah said, the case concerned a firstling<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">He holds that the Elders ruled correctly but that the case says nothing about the disagreement between RR.

Halakhah 6

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One does not subscribe to an animal on the holiday but one subscribes to it on the eve of the holiday and then slaughters and distributes among them<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">One may not say to the butcher on the holiday that he is willing to take so-and-so much meat from an animal which he slaughters on the holiday, but one may do so before the holiday for meat to be freshly slaughtered on the holiday.</i>.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Therefore adding one adds.

Halakhah 2

<strong>MISHNAH:</strong> One is liable on the holiday for everything classified as Sabbath rest, classified as obligatory, classified as meritorious<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">All the prohibitions listed in the Mishnah are rabbinic; therefore the expression “one is liable” is difficult to understand since usually it is reserved for severe biblical infractions. The activities classified as Sabbath rest are rabbinic restrictions, mostly to avoid possible biblical infractions. Those classified as obligatory may also be meritorious, nevertheless they are rabbinically forbidden on the holiday (cf. S. Liebermann, <i>Tarbiz</i>5, p. 96–99). Those classified as meritorious are deeds to the Temple. Most of the items are discussed in detail in the Halakhah. The reasons for the prohibitions given in the Babli cannot be presumed for the Yerushalmi.</i>. These are classified as Sabbath rest: One does not climb on a tree, nor ride on an animal, nor sail on water, nor clap the hands in anger, nor clap the hands in joy, nor dance. These are classified as obligatory, one does not judge, nor contract preliminary marriage, nor give <i>ḥaliṣah,</i> nor enter levirate marriage. These are classified as meritorious, one does not dedicate<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Animals as sacrifices or property to be given to the Temple.</i>, nor dedicate one’s worth<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As described in <a class="refLink" data-ref="Leviticus 27:2-8" href="/Leviticus.27.2-8"><i>Lev.</i> 27:2–8</a> and Tractate <i>Arakhin</i>.</i>, nor dedicate as <i>herem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Gifts to the priests, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 18:14" href="/Numbers.18.14"><i>Num</i>. 18:14</a>.</i>, nor collect heaves and tithes.

<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> Sabbath rest which is voluntary, and obligation which is meritorious. What is Sabbath rest which is voluntary?

This applies also to dry vines, but in contrast to active vines the vegetables do not become forbidden for usufruct.</i>? It is everybody’s opinion; they forbade the dried-up tree because of a moist tree. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi came running before Rav. He asked him, how did you come? He told him, [by] the warped date palm<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that he stepped over the trunk, which for Rav is forbidden.</i>.

But if they are not three {hand-breadths} high they are like the ground.
Why did they say that one does not climb on a tree? Is it lest he forget and eat, or maybe lest he forget and shake it? Let us hear from the following: If he was riding on an animal one tells him, descend. This implies, lest he forget and shake it<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It will be shown in the sequel that riding on an animal is a biblical infraction. Since riding on an animal is quoted in the same sentence as climbing on a tree, the prohibition of climbing must be to avoid a biblical infraction. Shaking a tree to have its fruit fall down is the regular way of harvesting olives; therefore for all trees shaking is harvesting and a biblical transgression.</i>.

Rebbi Aḥa bar Pappus stated before Rebbi Ze`ira: There is a difference, because he is commanded about the rest of his animals like his own: <i>That your ox and your donkey rest</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Exodus 23:12" href="/Exodus.23.12"><i>Ex.</i> 23:12</a>.</i><i>; like you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Deuteronomy 5:14" href="/Deuteronomy.5.14"><i>Deut</i>. 5:14</a>.</i>. There are Tannaim who state, one may lean on an animal. There are Tannaim who state, one may not lean on an animal. Rav Ḥisda said, he who said one may lean on, if he is healthy; he who said one may not lean on, if he is weak<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">A healthy person leans on an animal as he would lean on a human; this must be permitted. A sickly person might use the animal to support his entire weight; this is counted as a biblical infraction.</i>. Rebbi Yose says, Rebbi Abba bar Mamal and the colleagues disagreed. One said, one may lean on, but the other said, one may not lean on. He who said one may lean on, if he leans a little bit; he who said one may not lean on, if he puts on his full weight. We do not know who said what. Since Rebbi Yose did not say anything in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Mamal, this implies<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since R. Yose reported the disagreement between Amoraim without further discussion he indicated that this disagreement was unimportant since the apparent disagreement between Tannaim already was explained away by Rav Ḥisda; the latter’s explanation was accepted also in the Galilean Academy.

“Nor sail on water<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The person sailing does not do anything; the wind provides the power which pushes the water away on both sides of the boat.</i>” Rebbi Jacob bar Zavdi in the name of Rebbi Abbahu: This implies that it is forbidden to set something under sail to send it away from him.

Rebbi Abba Mari and Rebbi Mattaniah were sitting<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">On a weekday; therefore they did not have to actually intervene.</i>.

“Nor clap the hands in anger.” סִיפּוּק is in anger, as you are saying, <i>Balaq got angry about Bileam and he clapped his hands in anger</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Numbers 24:10" href="/Numbers.24.10"><i>Num</i>. 24:10</a>.</i>.

We did not know who said what, but since Rebbi Jonah said, in our days there were old men who were clapping the backs of their hands on the Sabbath; this implies that he said, this way it is permitted, the other way it is forbidden. Rebbi was marrying off his son Rebbi Simeon where they were clapping the backs of their hands on the Sabbath.

May one light an idle candle<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">A candle lit for no particular purpose.</i>? Ḥizqiah said, it is forbidden.

If the permission to make fire were restricted to the preparation of food, the inference from the first verse would not be needed.

But if there is only one cow hand, the owner already knows that if he does not want to slaughter the animal that it will be given to that cow hand, it is as if delivered before the holiday and may be moved only to places accessible to the cow hand. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Beitzah 37b" href="/Beitzah.37b">Babli 37b</a>.</i>”
