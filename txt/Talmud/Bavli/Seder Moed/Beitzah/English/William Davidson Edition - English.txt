Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an egg that was laid on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:1), <b>Beit Shammai say: It may be eaten</b> even on that day, <b>and Beit Hillel say: It may not be eaten,</b> as the Gemara will explain at length. Apropos this exceptional case, in which Beit Shammai are lenient and Beit Hillel are strict, the mishna cites additional <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals in which this unusual phenomenon occurs (<i>Yoma</i> 79b). <b>Beit Shammai say: Leaven,</b> i.e., dough that has leavened to such an extent that it is no longer used as food but as a leavening agent for other dough, is prohibited on Passover in the measure <b>of an olive-bulk.</b> However, the measure for edible <b>leavened bread</b> is greater, that <b>of a large date-bulk. And Beit Hillel say:</b> For both <b>this and that,</b> the measure is that <b>of an olive-bulk.</b>
Furthermore, with regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:2), in which case there is a mitzva from the Torah to cover the blood after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13), <b>Beit Shammai say: He digs</b> earth <b>with a shovel and covers</b> the blood with that earth <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>unless he had earth prepared</b> for that purpose <b>while it was still day. But</b> even Beit Hillel <b>concede that if one</b> already <b>slaughtered</b> the animal or the bird, <b>then he should dig with a shovel and cover</b> the blood. Additionally, they agree <b>that the ashes of a stove are</b> considered <b>prepared</b> for the use of covering blood, as will be explained by the Gemara.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing</b> in this mishna? <b>If we say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a chicken that is designated for eating,</b> i.e., one planned to slaughter and eat a chicken that laid an egg, <b>what is the reason that Beit Hillel</b> prohibit eating the egg? <b>It is food that has been separated [<i>de’ifrat</i>].</b> The entire chicken is considered food, as it is designated for eating, and this egg is simply a part that became detached. Just as one may partake of the chicken itself on a Festival, its egg should likewise be fit for consumption.
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to the case <b>of a chicken designated for laying eggs.</b> Since the owner of this chicken decided not to eat it on the Festival, it is classified as set-aside [<i>muktze</i>], and <i>muktze</i> items may not even be moved, let alone eaten. Since the chicken itself is <i>muktze</i>, its egg is <i>muktze</i> as well.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is the reason of Beit Shammai</b> for permitting one to eat the egg? After all, <b>it is <i>muktze</i>.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this question: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps Beit Shammai do not hold</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>?</b> There are different opinions with regard to the scope of the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>. It is possible that Beit Shammai, like other <i>tanna’im</i>, maintain that there is no prohibition of this type of <i>muktze</i>. Perhaps this is the subject of their dispute with Beit Hillel.
Before stating its proposed solutions for this difficulty, the Gemara notes: <b>It enters our mind</b> to say that <b>even one who permits</b> moving an item that was <b>set aside</b> by its owners on a Festival or Shabbat <b>prohibits</b> the owners from doing so <b>with</b> an object that <b>came into being [<i>nolad</i>]</b> on a Festival. One may not move an object that came into being on a Festival or Shabbat, since the owner never entertained the notion that he would be able to use it. This egg is certainly an object that came into being on the Festival. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is the reason of Beit Shammai?</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said: Actually,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a chicken designated for laying eggs.</b> However, our previous assumption was mistaken, as the Sage <b>who holds</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> in general also <b>holds</b> that there is a prohibition of objects that <b>came into being,</b> while one <b>who does not hold</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> likewise <b>does not hold</b> that there is a prohibition of objects that <b>came into being</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 45b). Consequently, the dispute can be summed up as follows: <b>Beit Shammai</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that there is no prohibition of <i>muktze</i>; <b>and Beit Hillel</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who rules that there is a prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.
The Gemara is puzzled by this explanation: <b>And did Rav Naḥman</b> actually <b>say that</b> Beit Hillel hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 143a) that <b>Beit Shammai say: One</b> may <b>remove bones and shells</b> left from the meal <b>from the table,</b> despite the fact that they are inedible and are <i>muktze</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is prohibited to do so; rather, <b>one</b> may <b>remove the entire board [<i>tavla</i>]</b> that is the table surface, which is a vessel that may be carried, <b>and shake it</b> all at once. By moving the table, which is not <i>muktze</i>, one is able to shake off the bones and shells, but he may not move the items themselves.
<b>And Rav Naḥman said:</b> That version of the mishna is not in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>; rather, the opinions should be reversed, as <b>we</b> have <b>nothing other</b> than the following version of this dispute: <b>Beit Shammai</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that the prohibition of <i>muktze</i> applies, while <b>Beit Hillel</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that the <i>halakha</i> of <i>muktze</i> does not apply. Why, then, does Rav Naḥman explain that the ruling of Beit Hillel in the case of the egg in the mishna is based on the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that there actually is a prohibition of <i>muktze</i>?
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Naḥman</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in reply: <b>With regard to Shabbat,</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna, which is generally accepted as the <i>halakha</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 156b): <b>One</b> may <b>cut pumpkins before an animal</b> to facilitate their consumption, <b>and</b> likewise one may cut up <b>an animal carcass before dogs,</b> even if the animal died on Shabbat, to enable them to consume it. Although that carcass is classified as <i>muktze</i>, it may be moved on Shabbat.
The Gemara concludes: That unattributed mishna in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. For this reason, Rav Naḥman <b>establishes</b> that the dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai should be understood to mean <b>that Beit Hillel</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> whom the <i>halakha</i> apparently follows, as there is a principle that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel’s opinion. <b>However,</b>

Daf 2b

<b>with regard to a Festival,</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 156b), <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna in this tractate: <b>One</b> may <b>not chop wood</b> on a Festival <b>from beams</b> prepared for use in construction work, <b>nor</b> may one chop kindling wood <b>from a beam that broke on a Festival.</b> As the beams were not prepared for this use when the Festival began, they are classified as <i>muktze</i>; this demonstrates that an unattributed mishna prohibits <i>muktze</i> on a Festival. Consequently, Rav Naḥman <b>establishes</b> the opinion <b>of Beit Hillel in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who prohibits <i>muktze</i>. He does so by asserting that the mishna is referring to the case of a chicken designated for laying eggs, which is <i>muktze</i>. This concludes the Gemara’s explanation of Rav Naḥman’s rendering of the tannaitic dispute.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now since,</b> i.e., consider the following: <b>Who is the one who</b> wrote and edited the Mishna, and arranged <b>the unattributed <i>mishnayot</i>?</b> It was <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Since the same Sage formulated the statements in both tractates, the question arises: <b>What is different</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat, that</b> he <b>stated the unattributed opinion</b> and ruled <b>for us in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and what is different</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a Festival, that</b> he <b>stated the unattributed opinion</b> and ruled <b>for us in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b>
<b>They</b> answer and <b>say:</b> In the case of <b>Shabbat, which is stringent</b> with regard to its punishments (see 35b), <b>and</b> therefore people <b>will not come to treat it with contempt,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught us the unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who rules leniently.</b> Conversely, with regard to <b>a Festival, which is lenient,</b> as certain labors may be performed on a Festival, <b>and</b> therefore people <b>will</b> be more likely to <b>come to treat it with contempt,</b> he <b>stated the unattributed opinion for us in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who rules stringently.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you</b> ultimately <b>establish</b> the mishna? It was established as referring <b>to a chicken designated for laying eggs, and</b> the prohibition is <b>due to <i>muktze</i>. If so, rather than disputing with regard to an egg</b> laid on a Festival, <b>let them dispute with regard to</b> the <b>chicken</b> itself. Instead of considering the secondary detail of an egg, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel could discuss whether or not the chicken itself may be slaughtered on a Festival.
The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel also disagree with regard to the chicken, but the dispute was phrased in this manner <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b> The formulation of the mishna emphasizes the extent of Beit Shammai’s lenient opinion, <b>that</b> even <b>in the case of</b> an egg, which is not a regular <i>muktze</i> item but an item that <b>came into being,</b> an especially stringent type of <i>muktze</i>, Beit Shammai nevertheless <b>permit</b> it. By stating the dispute with regard to an egg, the mishna stresses Beit Shammai’s lenient opinion.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>And let them disagree with regard to a chicken,</b> rather than an egg, <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, who prohibit</b> its use <b>even</b> in the more lenient case <b>of <i>muktze</i>. And if you say</b> it is better to present the dispute as in the mishna, so as to clarify the more lenient opinion, as <b>the strength of leniency is preferable</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 60a), there is another option: <b>And let them disagree with regard to both of</b> these cases.
The mishna could have said: With regard to <b>a chicken designated for laying eggs, it and its eggs, Beit Shammai say: It may be eaten, and Beit Hillel say: It may not be eaten.</b> In this manner, the mishna could have referred to all aspects of the dispute, without the need for any lengthy addition. Consequently, Rav Naḥman’s explanation of the mishna is inadequate.
<b>Rather, Rabba said: Actually,</b> the above explanation should be rejected. <b>We are dealing with a chicken designated for food and we are dealing with</b> an egg that was laid <b>on a Festival that occurs after Shabbat,</b> i.e., on a Sunday. <b>And</b> the relevant issue is not the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>muktze</i>; rather, one may not eat the egg <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>preparation</b> from Shabbat to a Festival.
<b>And</b> in this regard, <b>Rabba holds</b> that <b>any egg laid now was</b> already <b>fully developed yesterday,</b> and merely emerged from the chicken today. Consequently, an egg laid on a Festival that occurred on a Sunday may not be eaten, as it was prepared on Shabbat, despite the fact that it was prepared naturally, by Heaven, rather than by man.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabba,</b> who prohibits one to derive benefit even from something that was not prepared by man, conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning. As Rabba said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the manna: <b>“And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in”</b> (Exodus 16:5)? According to Rabba, it can be inferred from this verse that on an ordinary <b>weekday,</b> “the sixth day,” <b>one</b> may <b>prepare</b> what is needed <b>for Shabbat, and</b> similarly, on an ordinary <b>weekday one</b> may <b>prepare</b> what is needed <b>for a Festival.</b> However, on <b>a Festival one may not prepare for Shabbat, and</b> likewise <b>on Shabbat one may not prepare for a Festival.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> and the concern is only due to preparation, <b>let</b> an egg laid on <b>a regular Festival,</b> one that does not occur on a Sunday, <b>be permitted.</b> Rabba responded: That egg is not prohibited by Torah law, but by rabbinic <b>decree, due to</b> the case of <b>a Festival</b> that occurs <b>after Shabbat.</b> Abaye asked: On <b>a regular Shabbat,</b> one that does not occur after a Festival, <b>let</b> it <b>be permitted</b> to eat an egg that was laid on that day, provided that one does not cook it. Rabba similarly answered: It is <b>a decree due to a Shabbat</b> that occurs <b>after a Festival.</b>
Abaye further asked: <b>And do we issue a decree</b> of this kind? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see 6b): In the case of <b>one who slaughters a chicken</b> on a Festival <b>and finds inside it fully developed eggs</b> with their shells, <b>it is permitted to eat them on the Festival. And if it is so,</b> that the aforementioned decree is in effect, <b>let him issue a decree</b> and prohibit these eggs found inside the chicken, <b>due to those that are laid on that day.</b>
Rabba <b>said to him:</b> This is not difficult, as the case of <b>fully developed eggs</b> found <b>inside their mother is an uncommon matter, and</b> in a case of <b>an uncommon matter the Sages did not issue a decree</b> as a preventive measure (<i>Eiruvin</i> 63b). The Sages issued their decrees only for usual situations, in which people might err, but they did not apply them to rare cases. This concludes the Gemara’s discussion of Rabba’s explanation.
The Gemara proceeds to explain other interpretations of the mishna. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> An egg laid by a chicken designated for food is prohibited for a different reason: It is <b>a decree due to fruits that fall</b> from a tree (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39b). Fruits that fall from a tree on Shabbat or a Festival may not be eaten, and the same applies to eggs that emerge from a chicken.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: With regard to <b>fruits that fall, what</b> in fact <b>is the reason</b> that the Sages prohibited them?

Daf 3a

It is <b>a decree lest</b> one <b>climb</b> the tree <b>and pick</b> the fruit, as this would constitute the prohibited labor of harvesting. If so, the prohibition against eating fruit <b>is itself</b> due to <b>a decree. And will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b> Rav Yosef responded: That is not so; rather, when the Sages issued the initial decree, they enacted the prohibitions against both fruit that fall and a laid egg, as <b>all</b> the prohibitions <b>are</b> components of <b>one decree.</b> In other words, the similar cases of the fruit and the egg were both included in the original decree.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> a different reason: An egg that was laid on a Festival is prohibited as <b>a decree due to liquids that seeped</b> from the fruit (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39b), which is prohibited on that day. The legal status of an egg that was laid on a Festival is like that of liquids that seeped from a fruit on a Festival.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> With regard to <b>liquid that seeped</b> from fruit, <b>what is the reason</b> that the Sages prohibited it? It is <b>a decree lest one</b> purposely <b>squeeze</b> the fruit, and thereby perform the prohibited labor of threshing. However, the prohibition against consuming this juice <b>is itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree. And will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak replied: <b>All</b> the prohibitions <b>are</b> components of <b>one decree.</b> When the Sages prohibited this juice, they banned the eating of an egg laid on a Festival for the same reason, as the actions are similar.
As various explanations have been offered for this mishna, the Gemara seeks to clarify why each Sage was dissatisfied with the other explanations and suggested an alternative. The Gemara says: <b>All of them,</b> Rabba, Rav Yosef, and Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>did not state</b> their explanations <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, as</b> stated in <b>our</b> previously stated <b>objection</b> to Rav Naḥman’s explanation. The other Sages <b>also did not state</b> their explanations <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> as they <b>do not</b> accept that there is a Torah prohibition of using items whose <b>preparation</b> was from Shabbat to a Festival or from a Festival to Shabbat.
<b>However,</b> the following question arises: Since <b>Rav Yosef</b> provides an explanation that is similar to that of Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak?</b> The Gemara answers that Rav Yosef could have <b>said to you: An egg is food, and fruit is food,</b> i.e., an egg is comparable to fruits that fall. This observation would serve <b>to exclude juice, which is not food</b> but drink. Consequently, an egg is not comparable to juice and would not be included in the same decree.
The Gemara asks the reverse question: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you</b> that the case of an egg is more similar to juices that seep from fruit. How so? <b>An egg is enclosed</b> inside a chicken before it is laid, and likewise <b>juice is enclosed</b> inside the fruit. This observation serves <b>to exclude fruits</b> that fall from a tree, <b>which are standing exposed</b> on the tree. Therefore, the comparison between fruits that fall and an egg is weaker than the comparison between liquid that seeped from fruit and an egg.
§ The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds</b> that the prohibition against eating an egg laid on a Festival is <b>a decree due to liquid that seeped</b> from fruit. What proof can be cited for this? It is proven <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and a different statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, and he resolved</b> the apparent contradiction in a manner that indicates his own opinion.
The Gemara elaborates on the previous statement. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 143b): <b>One may not squeeze fruits to extract liquids from them</b> on Shabbat, <b>and if</b> the liquids <b>seeped out on their own, it is prohibited</b> to use them on Shabbat, lest he come to squeeze fruits intentionally. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the fruit is designated <b>for eating,</b> e.g., apples, the liquid <b>that seeps from them is permitted.</b> Since there is no concern that one might squeeze the fruit, there is no reason to prohibit its liquid. <b>And if</b> the fruit was originally designated <b>for liquids,</b> such as grapes for wine, there are grounds for concern that one might squeeze them, and therefore the liquid <b>that seeps from them is prohibited.</b>
From the fact that Rabbi Yehuda said that liquid from fruit intended for eating is permitted, one can infer that, <b>apparently, all food</b> that comes out of another food <b>is</b> classified as <b>food that was separated, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Food that was separated is not considered a new food, but part of the food that previously existed.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this from a different source: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda said further,</b> concerning untithed fruit, which may not be rendered fit to be eaten on a Festival by separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes from it (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39a): <b>A person may stipulate a condition with regard to a basket of</b> untithed <b>fruit on the first day of a Festival,</b> and say: If today is the true Festival day, the second Festival day is actually a weekday. Therefore, this fruit is permitted, once I separate tithes from it, as on any other weekday. And vice versa: If today is, in fact, a weekday, and tomorrow is the Festival, I hereby separate its tithes today.
Likewise, on the following day, he should again stipulate: If today is a weekday and yesterday was holy, I hereby separate tithes from the fruit now; if today is holy and yesterday was a weekday, separating the tithes yesterday was sufficient. <b>And he</b> may then <b>eat</b> the produce <b>on</b> the <b>second</b> Festival day, as in either case no prohibition is involved. <b>And similarly, an egg laid on</b> the <b>first</b> Festival day may <b>be eaten on</b> the <b>second</b> day, regardless of which day is the actual Festival.
Rabbi Yehuda’s statement indicates that <b>on the second</b> day, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted to partake of the egg; but if the egg was laid <b>on the first</b> day, <b>no,</b> one may not eat it. If so, Rabbi Yehuda apparently contradicts himself, as he said previously that liquid from food prepared for eating has the same status as the food itself, and that its emergence is considered to be nothing more than the separation of two foods from each other. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan resolves</b> the difficulty: <b>The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions</b> with regard to the second day of the Festival <b>is reversed</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 17b), so that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion corresponds with his ruling above.
The significance of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement for the issue at hand is as follows: <b>Since</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised a contradiction between</b> the cases of an egg and liquid that oozed, one may <b>conclude from this that it is the same reason</b> in both cases, i.e., an egg is prohibited on a Festival due to the rabbinic decree against liquid that oozed from fruit.

Daf 3b

With regard to the contradiction presented by Rabbi Yoḥanan, which led him to suggest that the opinions should be reversed, <b>Ravina said</b> that this is not the only possible resolution: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions. Rather, in the case of the two Festival days, one could claim that <b>Rabbi Yehuda spoke to them in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis,</b> rather than presenting his own opinion.
If so, Rabbi Yehuda’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>In my</b> opinion, <b>even on the first</b> Festival day, the egg is <b>also permitted, as it is food that was separated. However, according to your</b> opinion, which is that you prohibit liquid that comes from food, <b>at least agree with me that it is permitted on the second</b> day, <b>as they are two sanctities.</b> The first and second days of Rosh HaShana are not one unit, but two separate entities. Therefore, it is possible that the first day is sacred, while the second is a weekday. Consequently, an item prohibited on the first day might be permitted on the second. <b>And the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> the two days <b>are one sanctity,</b> i.e., they are viewed as a single continuous unit. The uncertainty applies equally to both of them.
<b>Ravina, son of Rav Ulla, said:</b> There is an alternative resolution to the contradiction raised by Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the egg laid on a Festival, Rabbi Yehuda prohibited eating the egg since it is not from a chicken designated for food, whose legal status is that of food. Rather, the case refers <b>to a chicken designated for laying eggs, and Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he holds</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>.</b> Since the egg is produced by something <i>muktze</i>, it is certainly <i>muktze</i> itself, which means that the <i>halakha</i> of food that was separated is inapplicable to this case.
§ The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>, which clarifies the issue differently: <b>Both an egg that was laid on Shabbat and an egg that was laid on a Festival</b> are considered to be <i>muktze</i>, and therefore in both cases, <b>one may not move</b> the egg, neither for the sake of food nor for any other purpose: <b>Not to cover a vessel with it, nor to support the legs of a bed with it.</b>
<b>However,</b> if one wishes, he may <b>cover</b> the egg <b>with a vessel,</b> without handling the egg itself, <b>so that it does not break</b> from being accidentally trodden upon. Although it is prohibited to move the egg itself, it is nevertheless permitted to move a vessel for its sake. <b>And</b> even if there is <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to whether this egg was laid on a Festival, it <b>is prohibited</b> to move it. <b>And,</b> furthermore, <b>if it became intermingled with a thousand</b> permitted eggs, they are <b>all prohibited.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, who said</b> that an egg is prohibited <b>due to</b> the lack of <b>preparation,</b> this case involves <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by Torah law; and</b> in <b>any</b> case of <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> the ruling <b>is stringent.</b> Therefore, the egg is prohibited even if there is uncertainty whether it was laid on a Festival.
<b>However, according to</b> the opinions of <b>Rav Yosef and Rabbi Yitzḥak, who say</b> that an egg is prohibited <b>due to a decree,</b> this case involves <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> in <b>any</b> case of <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by rabbinic law,</b> the ruling <b>is lenient.</b>
The Gemara answers: In <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we have arrived at</b> a different case. The case does not involve the prohibition of an egg laid on a Festival; the case involves an egg laid by a chicken with regard to which there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is <b>an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> which is prohibited by Torah law. The uncertainty with regard to the legal status of the chicken is relevant to the egg.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this response: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: If it <b>became intermingled with a thousand</b> other eggs, they are <b>all prohibited. Granted, if you say</b> that there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the egg was laid on <b>a Festival</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it was laid on <b>a weekday,</b> then <b>it is an object whose prohibition is temporary,</b> as the egg will be permitted on the following day, and the principle is: <b>Any object whose prohibition is temporary is not nullified, even by a thousand</b> permitted items. Since its prohibition will lapse on its own, there is no need to make use of the option of nullification.
<b>However, if you say</b> that the egg referred to in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>an uncertain <i>tereifa</i>, it is an object whose prohibition is not temporary,</b> as there is no way to permit the prohibition of <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and it should</b> therefore <b>be nullified by</b> a simple <b>majority.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>an egg is significant and is not nullified,</b> as nullification applies only to items that have no intrinsic significance, while a significant object cannot be nullified, <b>that</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we learned: Any</b> item <b>whose manner is</b> also <b>to be counted,</b> i.e., that is sometimes sold by unit, rather than by weight or volume, is considered significant. An egg falls into that category, as it is sometimes sold by unit.
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>we learned: That</b> item <b>whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted,</b> i.e., that is always sold by unit, is considered significant, <b>what can be said?</b> Although eggs are often sold by unit, they are also often sold by weight or volume.
The Gemara cites the mishna where the dispute cited above appears. <b>As we learned</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:6–7): With regard to <b>one who had bundles of clover,</b> a type of legume, that were <b>diverse kinds</b> of food crops that grew <b>in a vineyard,</b> from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, those bundles <b>must be burned.</b> If the bundles <b>were intermingled with others, and</b> those <b>others</b> were intermingled <b>with others, they must all be burned.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They may be nullified by one</b> part in <b>two hundred</b> similar parts. When the prohibited portion is less than one-half of one percent of the permitted portion, the prohibition is nullified.
The mishna continues: Rabbi Meir says that they must all be burned, <b>as Rabbi Meir would say: That whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted,</b> is considered significant and cannot be nullified. Therefore, it <b>renders</b> the entire mixture <b>forbidden,</b> and it must be burned. <b>And the Rabbis say: Only six items</b> are sufficiently significant to <b>render</b> the entire mixture <b>forbidden. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> There are <b>seven. And they are:</b> High-quality <b>nuts</b> from <b>Perekh, and pomegranates</b> from <b>Badan, and sealed barrels</b> of wine, <b>and branches of spinach, and cabbage stalks, and Greek pumpkin. Rabbi Akiva adds: Even loaves of a homeowner.</b>
Different prohibitions apply to these seven items. <b>That which is fit</b> to be forbidden due <b>to <i>orla</i>,</b> fruit that grows during the first three years after a tree is planted, is forbidden due to <b><i>orla</i>. That which is fit</b> to be forbidden due <b>to diverse kinds</b> of food crops that grew <b>in a vineyard</b> is forbidden due to <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard</b> (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 74a). <b>And it was stated about</b> the wording of this mishna that there is an amoraic dispute. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>we learned:</b> Only <b>that whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted</b> is significant and cannot be nullified, and it is therefore prohibited by Rabbi Meir. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> that <b>we learned: Any</b> item <b>whose manner is</b> also <b>to be counted,</b> is significant and cannot be nullified.
Returning to the matter of the egg, the Gemara reprises its question: This works out <b>well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, but according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, what can be said?</b> Since an egg is not sold exclusively by unit, it is not significant. Therefore, the egg of a <i>tereifa</i> should be nullified by a simple majority.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who said that an egg cannot be nullified, <b>is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a <i>litra</i> of dried figs, who,</b> based on his statement, <b>said: Any item that is counted, even</b> if it is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, cannot be nullified, and all the more so</b> items prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> e.g., the egg of a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a <i>litra</i></b> of <b>dried figs,</b> whose stems were removed, and were dried and pressed in different vessels and shaped into circles, the obligation to tithe fruits is by rabbinic law. If one forgot to tithe the figs, and later remembered that he placed the figs into a barrel, and during the process of producing a circle <b>he pressed</b> the figs <b>onto the mouth</b> of one of the <b>circular</b> vessels in which the circles are formed, <b>and does not know into which circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it;</b> or, if he recalls that he pressed it <b>on the mouth of a barrel, but does not know in which barrel he pressed it,</b> or if he recalls that he pressed it <b>on the mouth of a</b> straw <b>receptacle, but does not know in which receptacle he pressed it, Rabbi Meir says</b> that in all these cases there is a dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> of the previous generation: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b>

Daf 4a

<b>says: One considers the upper</b> circles of dried figs <b>as though they are separate</b> pieces, rather than one unit. <b>And the lower ones,</b> which were there beforehand and have certainly been tithed, <b>nullify the upper ones,</b> as there are enough circles of figs in the entire barrel to nullify the upper <i>litra</i>.
In contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: If there are one hundred mouths</b> of different barrels or circular vessels <b>there,</b> the prohibited <i>litra</i> of untithed figs on the mouth of one of the vessels <b>is nullified</b> by a ratio of one part of prohibited figs to one hundred parts of similar, permitted figs. <b>And if not,</b> all of <b>the</b> circles of figs at the <b>mouths</b> of the barrels or circular vessels <b>are prohibited,</b> as one of them clearly contains a prohibited <i>litra</i> that has not been nullified. <b>And the</b> figs on the <b>insides</b> of the vessels <b>are permitted,</b> as the prohibited figs certainly did not reach there. This is Rabbi Meir’s version of the dispute.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> a different version of the dispute. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If there are one hundred mouths</b> of vessels with permitted figs present <b>there,</b> in addition to the prohibited one, <b>it is nullified</b> by the one hundred permitted mouths. <b>And if not, the</b> figs at the <b>mouths are prohibited and</b> those at <b>the bottom are permitted. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even</b> if <b>there are three hundred mouths</b> present <b>there, they are not nullified,</b> as this <i>litra</i> cannot be nullified in any manner. Rav Pappa was referring to this opinion when he said that there is a <i>tanna</i>, meaning Rabbi Yehoshua in Rabbi Yehuda’s version, who maintains that even an item occasionally sold by unit, e.g., a circle of dried figs, can never be nullified.
The same mishna further states: If <b>one pressed</b> the <i>litra</i> of figs <b>into a circular</b> vessel <b>but he does not know into which circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it, everyone agrees</b> that the prohibited fig cakes <b>are nullified.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Everyone agrees? This is</b> the very matter of <b>their dispute,</b> whether or not the <i>litra</i> is nullified.
<b>Rav Pappa said: This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said,</b> i.e., he meant the following: <b>One pressed it onto a circular</b> vessel but <b>does not know onto which place,</b> which side of the <b>circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it, whether on its north or on its south</b> side. In this case, as the prohibited <i>litra</i> is not located in a specific place and it cannot be distinguished from the others, it certainly cannot be considered an object of significance, and <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is nullified.</b>
The Gemara explained why the egg mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, an egg laid by a chicken that is a <i>tereifa</i>, cannot be nullified even if it is mingled with a thousand permitted eggs. However, <b>Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be explained as referring to a case where there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is <b>a Festival or a weekday.</b> While it is true that according to most opinions this is a rabbinic prohibition, and the <i>halakha</i> is generally lenient with regard to uncertainties involving rabbinic law, <b>it is an object whose prohibition is temporary. And</b> with regard to <b>any object whose prohibition is temporary, even</b> if it involves a <b>rabbinic</b> prohibition, it <b>cannot be nullified.</b>
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> With regard to <b>an egg</b> laid on a Festival, <b>it and its mother may be eaten.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing? If we say</b> that this is dealing <b>with a chicken designated for food,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that <b>it and its mother are permitted. Rather,</b> say that this is dealing <b>with a chicken designated for laying eggs,</b> but in that case <b>it and its mother are</b> both <b>prohibited. Rabbi Zeira said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: The egg may <b>be eaten on account of its mother;</b> if the chicken is eaten on the Festival, the egg may also be eaten.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> In which case is it necessary to apply this ruling? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>bought</b> this chicken <b>without specifying</b> whether he intended to eat it or use it for its eggs. In that case, if the chicken <b>was slaughtered</b> on a Festival, <b>it has been</b> retroactively <b>clarified that</b> it was <b>intended for food,</b> and the eggs it lays are, therefore, permitted. If it was <b>not slaughtered, it has been</b> retroactively <b>clarified that it</b> was <b>intended for laying eggs,</b> and the eggs it lays are prohibited.
<b>Rav Mari said</b> that the phrase: It and its mother may be eaten, should not be taken literally. Rather, the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching an exaggeration [<i>guzma</i>],</b> for extra emphasis, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: An egg</b> may <b>be eaten, it and its mother, and a chick and its shell.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> the meaning of this addition: <b>Its shell? If we say</b> it is referring to <b>an actual shell,</b> is <b>a shell edible? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to the consumption of <b>a chick</b> that is still <b>in its shell.</b> This explanation is problematic, as <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov only</b> in permitting the eating of a chick immediately after it hatches, <b>when it has</b> already <b>entered the world. However, when it has not</b> yet <b>entered the world,</b> i.e., if the chick is still in its shell, <b>they do not disagree.</b> Even the Rabbis accept that this chick has the status of a creeping animal and may not be eaten.
<b>Rather,</b> evidently the expression: <b>A chick and its shell,</b> should not be understood literally, as it is <b>an exaggeration. Here, too,</b> the phrase: <b>It and its mother may be eaten,</b> is <b>an exaggeration.</b> It does not mean literally that the chick and its mother may be eaten, but is merely a statement of emphasis that the egg is undoubtedly permitted.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following issue (<i>Eiruvin</i> 38b): If <b>Shabbat and a Festival</b> occur on consecutive days, <b>Rav said:</b> An egg <b>laid on this one is prohibited on that one, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> An egg <b>laid on this one is permitted on that one.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Rav holds</b> that when Shabbat and a Festival occur on consecutive days, <b>it is</b> considered <b>one</b> continuous <b>sanctity,</b> i.e., a single, indivisible day.
<b>But didn’t Rav say: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>four elders,</b> who ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said:</b> When a Shabbat and a Festival occur consecutively, <b>they are two sanctities</b> rather than one long day; therefore, a joining of Shabbat boundaries need not be placed on a weekday, but may be placed on the first of the holy days to allow going beyond the Shabbat boundary on the second. Evidently, this issue cannot be the basis of their dispute.
<b>Rather, here they disagree with regard to Rabba’s preparation,</b> i.e., an item that was prepared on its own from one day to the other, whose use Rabba prohibits. <b>Rav holds</b> that items prepared by means of <b>Rabba’s preparation</b> are prohibited, whereas <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold</b> that items prepared by means of <b>Rabba’s preparation</b> are prohibited.
The Gemara comments: This dispute is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> An egg <b>laid on Shabbat may be eaten on a Festival;</b> if it was laid <b>on a Festival, it may be eaten on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> This opinion is not unanimous; rather, <b>it is still a</b> matter of <b>dispute, as Beit Shammai say it may be eaten, and Beit Hillel say it may not be eaten,</b> just as they disagreed about whether an egg is permitted on the day on which it was laid.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava’s host [<i>ushpizikhnei</i>] had these eggs</b> that were laid on a Festival that occurred on a Friday, and the host was unsure whether eggs laid on the Festival were permitted <b>from</b> the <b>Festival for</b> use on <b>Shabbat. He came before</b> his guest, Rav Adda, and <b>said to him: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to roasting</b> these eggs <b>now,</b> on the Festival, although eating them today is prohibited due to <i>nolad</i>, <b>and let us eat them tomorrow,</b> as they will be no longer be prohibited due to <i>nolad</i>?
Rav Adda <b>said to him: What is your opinion</b> that led you to pose this question? You evidently assume that in the dispute between <b>Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and therefore an egg laid on one day will be permitted on the following day. However, <b>even Rabbi Yoḥanan permitted</b> one <b>to swallow it only</b> raw, <b>on the next day,</b> when it is no longer prohibited; <b>but on the same day</b> that it was laid, he did <b>not</b> permit one even to move it, and certainly not to roast it.
<b>And it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>both an egg that was laid on Shabbat and an egg that was laid on a Festival, one may not move it, neither to cover a vessel with it nor to support the legs of a bed with it.</b>
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>Rav Pappa’s host, and some say</b> it was <b>a certain man who came before Rav Pappa, had these eggs</b> that were laid on <b>a Shabbat that</b> occurred before <b>a Festival. He came before him</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether it is permitted <b>to eat</b> these eggs <b>tomorrow,</b> on the Festival? Rav Pappa <b>said to him: Go</b> away from me <b>now, and come</b> back <b>tomorrow.</b> He said this because <b>Rav</b> would <b>not place a disseminator before him</b> to explain his lectures, <b>from one Festival</b> day <b>until</b> the end of the <b>other,</b> the second Festival day, <b>due to drunkenness.</b> Since it was customary in those times to drink a great deal of wine during Festival meals, Rav was concerned that his mind would not be sufficiently clear to issue a public ruling.
<b>When</b> that man <b>came</b> back <b>on the following day,</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 4b

<b>Had</b> I issued a ruling for you <b>then, I would have forgotten</b> the correct response, <b>and I would have said to you,</b> based on the accepted principle that in the case of a dispute between <b>Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that the eggs are permitted. However, <b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav with regard to these three</b> issues, in connection to the sanctity of Festivals and Shabbat, <b>whether</b> his ruling is <b>lenient, or whether</b> it is <b>stringent.</b> This is one of those three cases in which the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>branches that fell from a palm tree on Shabbat, it is prohibited to kindle them on a Festival</b> that occurs the next day. <b>And do not reply to me</b> by asking why I permit <b>an egg</b> to be eaten on the following day. <b>What is the reason</b> for the distinction between the two cases? In the case of <b>an egg, because on</b> the <b>day</b> of Shabbat <b>itself it is also fit to be swallowed</b> raw <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it is permitted</b> to be eaten <b>only the following day, one knows</b> that an egg <b>is prohibited on the day</b> it was laid. In contrast, with regard to <b>branches, which are not fit</b> for kindling <b>on</b> the <b>day</b> of Shabbat, as kindling a fire is prohibited, <b>if you permit them</b> to kindle the wood on the Festival that occurs on <b>the following day they will</b> mistakenly <b>come to say</b> that <b>on</b> the <b>day</b> that <b>they</b> fell off the tree <b>they are also permitted. And</b> as for the reason the branches were not kindled <b>yesterday</b> when they fell from the tree, <b>it was due</b> only <b>to Shabbat, as they were not fit for kindling</b> then.
<b>Rav Mattana said:</b> With regard to <b>branches that fell from a palm tree</b> directly <b>into an oven on a Festival, one</b> may <b>add to</b> those branches <b>wood prepared</b> from the previous day, which may be used for kindling, <b>and kindle them</b> all together. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t he turn over</b> and move <b>the prohibited</b> wood in the course of the cooking process? The Gemara answers: <b>Since most</b> of the wood <b>is permitted, when he turns</b> it <b>over, he turns over permitted</b> wood, as the prohibited part is nullified by the majority.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But doesn’t he</b> thereby <b>nullify a prohibited</b> item <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> by adding permitted wood to the pieces of wood that fell into the oven, which are prohibited? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (see <i>Terumot</i> 5:9): <b>One may not nullify a prohibited</b> item <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> principle <b>applies only to</b> items prohibited <b>by Torah law; but with regard to</b> items prohibited <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as in this case involving the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>, <b>one</b> may <b>nullify</b> the prohibition <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi, who said: Any object whose prohibition is temporary, even</b> if the prohibition applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> it <b>cannot be nullified, what is there to say?</b> Doesn’t Rav Ashi agree that it is permitted to kindle the wood after the Festival? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> principle <b>applies only where the prohibited</b> item <b>remains intact; here,</b> however, <b>the prohibited</b> item <b>is burned,</b> as the wood is turned over when it has already become charcoal. Therefore, one does not perform any action with prohibited items.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> for the <b>two Festival days</b> observed <b>in</b> the <b>Diaspora. Rav said:</b> An egg that <b>was laid on this</b> day <b>is permitted on that</b> one, <b>and Rav Asi said:</b> An egg that <b>was laid on this</b> day <b>is prohibited on that</b> one.
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that Rav Asi holds</b> that the two days <b>are one sanctity. But didn’t Rav Asi</b> himself <b>recite <i>havdala</i>,</b> the prayer of distinction at the end of a holy day, <b>from</b> one <b>Festival</b> day of the Diaspora <b>to the other?</b> This shows that, in his opinion, the first day is the true Festival, while the second day is considered a weekday. In earlier generations, they observed the second day of the Diaspora because they were unaware when the court sanctified the New Moon to mark the beginning of the month. Today, that determination is accomplished by means of calculations known to all, and the second day is observed as the custom of our fathers, not due to any uncertainty.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Asi was uncertain</b> whether the Sages’ ordinance that the second day is to be observed as a Festival was a fixed ordinance that applies even when the calculations determining the New Moon are known to all; or whether the ordinance was based strictly on the uncertainty stemming from their lack of awareness. Today, when everyone is aware of the beginning of the month, the second day is a weekday. <b>And</b> therefore <b>he acted stringently here,</b> and prohibited eating an egg on the second day that had been laid on the first day. <b>And</b> he also acted <b>stringently here,</b> and recited <i>havdala</i> between the two days.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is <b>reasonable</b> to say <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi</b> that the Sages considered the two days as one and it is not a practice instituted due to uncertainty, <b>as today we know the determination of the</b> first day of the new <b>month</b> based on a fixed calendar and the precise dates of the Festivals are known by all, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>we observe</b> the <b>two</b> Festival <b>days</b> of the Diaspora.
<b>Abaye said:</b> On the contrary, It is <b>reasonable</b> to say <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> that the second day is observed as a Festival due to uncertainty, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 22b): <b>Initially,</b> after the court sanctified the new month, <b>they would light torches</b> on the mountain tops, from one peak to another, to signal that the New Moon had been sanctified. <b>After the Samaritans</b> [<b><i>Kutim</i></b>] <b>disrupted</b> this method by lighting torches at the wrong times, the Sages <b>instituted that messengers should depart</b> to inform the people of the start of the month. Since the messengers could not reach all Diaspora communities before the beginning of the Festival, the Sages instituted that an additional Festival day should be observed there, due to the resultant uncertainty with regard to which day was the actual Festival day.
Abaye continues his argument: <b>And</b> this indicates that <b>if</b> the <b>Samaritans had desisted</b> from their interference, the Sages would have restored the earlier custom and <b>we would observe</b> only <b>one day. And,</b> similarly, in a place <b>where</b> the <b>messengers arrived</b> from Jerusalem on time, <b>we observe</b> only <b>one</b> Festival <b>day.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we know the determination of the</b> first day of the new <b>month, what is the reason</b> that <b>we observe two</b> Festival <b>days</b> in the Diaspora? <b>Because they sent</b> a warning <b>from there,</b> from Eretz Yisrael: Although now there is a fixed calendar and there is no uncertainty, <b>be careful to</b> observe <b>the custom of your fathers</b> that <b>you received,</b> because <b>at times the monarchy</b> will <b>issue decrees</b> of persecution restricting Torah study and the fixed calendar may be forgotten. <b>And</b> the people will <b>come to</b> have their proper observance of the Festivals <b>be disrupted</b> again. However, the fundamental <i>halakha</i> is that the observance of two Festival days is based on uncertainty.
§ <b>It was</b> further <b>stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> discussed a similar problem, with regard to the <b>two Festival days of Rosh HaShana. Rav and Shmuel both said:</b> An egg <b>laid on this</b> day <b>is prohibited on that one,</b> as the two days of Rosh HaShana have a special status. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 30b): <b>Initially,</b> the court <b>would accept testimony of</b> witnesses who saw the new moon to establish the first day of <b>the</b> new <b>month.</b> This system would also be used for the first of Tishrei, which is Rosh HaShana, and the court would accept this testimony on <b>the entire</b> thirtieth <b>day</b> of the month of Elul. <b>Once, the witnesses tarried</b> and managed <b>to arrive</b> only when the hour was late,

Daf 5a

<b>and the Levites erred in the song.</b> They were unsure whether to sing the weekday song or that of Rosh HaShana during the sacrifice of the afternoon daily offering, as it was unclear whether or not witnesses would arrive that day. From that point on, the court <b>instituted that they would accept witnesses</b> who came to testify that that day was Rosh HaShana <b>only up to <i>minḥa</i></b> time, i.e., when the daily afternoon offering was sacrificed. If witnesses had not arrived by then, they would declare Elul a thirty-day month and calculate the dates of the Festivals accordingly.
<b>And if witnesses came from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> although the calculations for the dates of the Festivals began only from the following day, the people would nevertheless <b>observe that day</b> on which the witnesses arrived as <b>sacred, and</b> they would also observe <b>the following day</b> as <b>sacred.</b> On the second day, they observed Rosh HaShana in full, both by sacrificing its offerings as well as calculating the upcoming Festivals from that date. It is evident that the observance of two days of Rosh HaShana did not stem from uncertainty in the Diaspora as to when the Festival began. Rather, the Sages instituted that the two days of Rosh HaShana are one unit due to the inherent difficulty in determining the date of a Festival that is celebrated on the first of the month.
<b>Rabba said: From</b> the time of <b>the ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai onward, an egg</b> laid on one day of Rosh HaShana <b>is permitted</b> on the other. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 30b): <b>After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> the court <b>should</b> once again <b>accept testimony</b> to determine the start of <b>the month all day.</b> Since the concern about errors was no longer relevant, they reverted to the original custom. As the court was aware of the exact date based on the testimony of the witnesses, those in proximity to the court kept only one day of Rosh HaShana. Those who lived far from the court observed two days merely due to uncertainty, and as one of those days was certainly a weekday, an egg laid on the first day was permitted on the second.
<b>Abaye said to him: But didn’t Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that <b>an egg is prohibited?</b> Rabba <b>said to him:</b> Your question is out of place; <b>I say to you</b> a statement in the name of the distinguished <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, and you say to me</b> a ruling of the <i>amora’im</i> <b>Rav and Shmuel?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel,</b> isn’t it true that <b>the mishna is difficult,</b> as it indicates that the special status of Rosh HaShana has been revoked? The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> ruling <b>is for us,</b> those who live outside of Eretz Yisrael, who have kept the ancient custom of observing two Festival days, and therefore Rosh HaShana is still considered one long day and constitute a single sanctity. Conversely, <b>that</b> ruling of the mishna <b>is for them,</b> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael. Since Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the court should once again accept testimony all day concerning the new moon, then even if circumstances dictate that Rosh HaShana would be observed for two days, each day is considered an independent sanctity.
<b>And Rav Yosef said: Even from the</b> time of the <b>ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai onward, an egg</b> remains <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion of Rav Yosef? It is that the decree prohibiting an egg laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana on the second day of Rosh HaShana <b>is a matter that</b> was established <b>by a vote</b> of the Sanhedrin, after that occasion on which the witnesses failed to arrive on time, <b>and any matter that</b> was established <b>by a vote requires another vote to permit it.</b> A new vote must be taken to render the prohibited item permitted, as the prohibition does not lapse even if the reason for the decree no longer applies.
<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? <b>As it is written,</b> after the Jews received the Torah: <b>“Go, say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26), where “your tents” is referring to your wives. <b>And it says,</b> before the revelation at Sinai: <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13). And it is stated: “Be ready for the third day, do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). In other words, although the original prohibition served a particular purpose, in this case the giving of the Torah, it was nevertheless necessary to explicitly render the prohibition permitted.
<b>And</b> this idea <b>was</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The fruit of a <b>fourth-year grapevine</b> have the status of second-tithe fruits, and therefore their owner <b>would ascend to Jerusalem</b> and eat them there. If he was unable to do so, due to the distance involved or the weight of the load, he could redeem the fruits with money where he was, and later redeem that money for other fruits in Jerusalem. However, the Sages decreed that fruit from the environs of Jerusalem should not be redeemed, but that the owners should bring the fruit itself to Jerusalem. The environs of Jerusalem for this purpose were defined as <b>a day’s walk in each direction. And this is its boundary: Eilat to the north; Akrabat to the south; Lod to the west; and the Jordan to the east.</b>
<b>And Ulla said, and some say Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> For <b>what reason</b> did the Sages institute this ordinance, that someone who lived near Jerusalem must bring his fruit there? <b>In order to adorn the markets of Jerusalem with fruit,</b> as this decree ensured that there was always an abundance of fruit in Jerusalem for people to eat.
<b>And it was</b> further <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Hyrcanus, a student of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, <b>had a fourth-year grapevine</b> located between Lod and Jerusalem, <b>to the east</b> of <b>Lod alongside the village of Tavi.</b> The grapevine was within the environs of Jerusalem for the purpose of this <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Eliezer could not bring the fruit to the Temple, as it had been destroyed,

Daf 5b

<b>and he sought to render</b> the fruit <b>ownerless</b> in favor <b>of the poor,</b> for whom it would be worth the effort to bring the fruit to Jerusalem. <b>His students said to him: Rabbi,</b> there is no need to do so, as <b>your colleagues have already voted</b> for <b>you and permitted it.</b> The members of the Sanhedrin have already taken a vote and permitted the redemption of the fruit of a fourth-year grapevine even near Jerusalem. The reason is that after the destruction of the Temple there is no need to adorn the markets of Jerusalem. The Gemara explains: <b>Who are: Your colleagues?</b> This is referring to <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.</b>
The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason is that they</b> explicitly <b>voted</b> to annul the decree, which indicates that if <b>they had not voted,</b> the ordinance would <b>not</b> have lapsed on its own, despite the fact that its justification was no longer applicable. Similarly, the prohibition of a laid egg is not nullified, as it was never explicitly permitted.
The Gemara seeks to clarify why Rav Yosef cited two verses as proof. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason for: <b>And it says?</b> Why does Rav Yosef find it necessary to quote a second verse? The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what he <b>is saying. Now since it is written: “Be ready for the third day, do not come near a woman”</b> (Exodus 19:15), <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“Go, say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26)? After three days the prohibition would lapse in any case. <b>Conclude from this</b> that <b>any matter</b> established by <b>a vote requires another vote to permit it.</b>
<b>And if you say</b> an alternative explanation, that the instruction to “return to your tents” was not given to permit the men to return home to their wives, but rather <b>it came</b> as a special command <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva of conjugal rights,</b> i.e., the obligation of a man to engage in periodic marital relations with his wife, then it was to refute this possibility that Rav Yosef continued: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from another verse: <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13).
<b>Now since it is written: “Neither shall the flocks nor the herds feed before that mount”</b> (Exodus 34:3), this indicates that the prohibition applies only when the Divine Presence is revealed on the mountain, and it is permitted immediately afterward. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long”?</b> Why is a special signal required? <b>Conclude from this</b> that <b>any matter</b> established by <b>a vote requires another vote to permit it.</b>
<b>And if you say: That</b> statement, that a specific vote is necessary, <b>applies</b> only <b>to</b> matters prohibited <b>by Torah law, but</b> in the case of a matter prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, no,</b> this <i>halakha</i> does not apply, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> the <i>baraita</i> concerning <b>a fourth-year grapevine.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that the fruit of <b>a fourth-year grapevine</b> must be brought to Jerusalem and may not be redeemed is <b>by rabbinic law, and they</b> nevertheless <b>said</b> to Rabbi Eliezer: <b>Your colleagues have already voted</b> for <b>you and permitted it.</b> This indicates that without a vote, the prohibition would not be abrogated.
<b>And if you say:</b> In the case of the prohibition of <b>an egg also, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai took a vote on it and permitted it;</b> the Gemara answers: <b>When they took a vote,</b> it was with regard <b>to testimony</b> to determine the start of the month; <b>they did not take a vote to</b> annul the prohibition of <b>an egg.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>an egg was</b> prohibited <b>by a vote?</b> Did the court take a special vote to render prohibited an egg laid on Rosh HaShana? Isn’t the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an egg dependent on</b> the matter of <b>testimony?</b> When <b>testimony</b> in the late afternoon <b>was prohibited,</b> the eating of <b>an egg</b> laid on Rosh HaShana <b>was</b> thereby <b>prohibited</b> as well, and when this <b>testimony was permitted,</b> the eating of <b>an egg was</b> automatically <b>permitted.</b> Rav Yosef’s observation is therefore incorrect.
<b>Rav Adda and Rav Shalman,</b> who <b>both</b> came <b>from Bei Keloḥit, said: Even from the</b> time of the <b>ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and onward, an egg</b> remains <b>prohibited. What is the reason? May the Temple speedily be built,</b> and the ordinance that testimony is accepted only until <i>minḥa</i> time will be restored, <b>and</b> people <b>will say: Last year, didn’t we eat an egg</b> laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana <b>on</b> the following day, <b>the second Festival</b> day <b>of</b> Rosh HaShana? <b>Now, too, we will eat</b> it, like last year. <b>And they will not know</b> the significant difference in <i>halakha</i> between the two cases, as <b>last year</b> the two days of Rosh HaShana were <b>two sanctities, and now they are one</b> long <b>sanctity.</b>
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so,</b> that this is the concern, <b>we also should not accept testimony</b> nowadays. <b>What is the reason? May the Temple speedily be built, and</b> the people <b>will say: Last year, didn’t we accept testimony</b> to determine the start of <b>the month all day? Now, too, we will accept</b> the testimony of witnesses even after <i>minḥa</i> time.
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to witnesses, <b>testimony is entrusted to the court,</b> and the court is capable of distinguishing between the reasons for decrees. <b>An egg,</b> however, is <b>entrusted to all,</b> and as not all people will consult a Sage about the status of their eggs, there is a legitimate concern about error.
<b>Rava said: Even from the</b> time of the <b>ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and onward, an egg</b> remains <b>prohibited.</b> Rava explained his reasoning: <b>Doesn’t Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai concede that if witnesses came from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>and onward,</b> even after the destruction of the Temple, <b>then one observes that day</b> as a <b>holy</b> day <b>and</b> also <b>the following day</b> as a <b>holy</b> day? The only difference is that during the time of the Temple any testimony delivered on the first day was not taken into account at all, which meant the second day was considered the first of the new year, whereas during the time of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai the new year was counted from the first day. As far as the sanctity of the Festival is concerned, however, the second day was also treated as sacred, which proves that when two days were observed in Eretz Yisrael, they were considered a single sanctity rather than two.
<b>And Rava said</b> in summary: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav in these three</b> cases, <b>whether</b> the ruling is <b>lenient, or whether</b> the ruling is <b>stringent.</b>

Daf 6a

§ <b>Rava said:</b> If one <b>died on the first day of a Festival, gentiles should attend to his</b> burial. If he <b>died on the second day of a Festival, Jews should attend to his</b> burial. <b>And even with regard to the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the legal status of the two days is like that of the two days of the Festivals; however, <b>that is not so with regard to an egg</b> that was laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana, as it remains prohibited on the second day.
The Sages of <b>Neharde’a say: Even with regard to an egg,</b> Rosh HaShana is no different from other Festivals, as an egg laid on the first day is permitted on the second. <b>As what do you think</b> i.e., what is your concern; <b>perhaps</b> witnesses will fail to arrive, and the court <b>will proclaim</b> the month of <b>Elul full,</b> i.e., thirty days long, and begin counting the year only from the following day? In that case, both days are kept as sacred <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Didn’t Rav Ḥinnana bar Kahana say</b> that <b>Rav</b> already <b>said</b> in this regard: <b>From the days of Ezra and onward we have not found</b> that the month of <b>Elul</b> was <b>full,</b> as the Sages employed various methods to ensure that there would be no need to add a thirtieth day. Consequently, Rosh HaShana would always occur on the thirtieth day after the beginning of Elul.
<b>Mar Zutra said: We said</b> that Jews should attend to the dead on the second day of Rosh HaShana <b>only when</b> the burial of the corpse <b>has</b> already <b>been delayed</b> and for some reason the burial was not on the day that he died. In that case, the body might begin to decay, and the dignity of the dead is at stake. <b>However,</b> if the burial <b>has not been delayed,</b> and there is no concern for the dignity of the corpse, its burial may not be attended to on the Festival; rather, <b>we delay it</b> until the Festival has ended.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even though</b> the burial <b>was not delayed,</b> but it is the day that he died, <b>we still do not delay</b> the burial. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>With regard to the dead, the Sages equated</b> the legal status of <b>the second Festival day with</b> that of <b>a weekday.</b> This is true to such an extent that on a Festival it is permitted <b>even to cut</b> material to fashion <b>a cloak for</b> the deceased. <b>And</b> similarly, it is permitted <b>to cut myrtles for</b> the deceased, to be placed on the bier in their honor.
<b>Ravina said: And nowadays, when there are <i>ḥabarei</i>,</b> this practice must be adjusted. The <i>ḥabarei</i> were Persian priests who made false accusations against Jews in Babylonia. They cited the fact that Jews were burying their dead on the second Festival day as proof that the day was not holy, and they forced them to work on that day. Since <b>we are concerned</b> about this possibility, we do not bury the dead on the second day.
The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina sat before Rav Ashi on the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana,</b> which occurred that year on Thursday and Friday. Ravina <b>observed that</b> Rav Ashi <b>was sad. He said to him: Why is the Master sad? He said to him:</b> Because <b>I did not prepare a joining of cooked foods,</b> and therefore I cannot prepare food or light a candle on Rosh HaShana for the upcoming Shabbat. When a Festival immediately precedes Shabbat, a joining of cooked foods is prepared before the Festival with ready-to-eat food. It is kept until Shabbat, symbolically indicating that any food prepared on the Festival for Shabbat is merely a continuation of that initial preparation.
Ravina <b>said to him: And let the Master prepare a joining of cooked foods now,</b> on the first day of Rosh HaShana, a Thursday. <b>Didn’t Rava say: A person may prepare a joining of cooked foods from</b> one <b>Festival day</b> of the Diaspora <b>to another, by stipulating</b> the following condition: If today is a weekday and tomorrow is holy, this shall be my joining of cooked foods, by means of which I may prepare food tomorrow for Shabbat; if today is holy and tomorrow a weekday, it is permitted to prepare food tomorrow as it is on any regular weekday, and a joining of cooked foods is not needed.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> You can <b>say that Rava stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the regular <b>two Festival days of the Diaspora;</b> but <b>did he</b> actually <b>say so with regard to the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana?</b> The two days of Rosh HaShana are considered one long day, and they are both equally holy.
Ravina replied: <b>Didn’t</b> the Sages of <b>Neharde’a say</b> that <b>even an egg is permitted</b> on the two days of Rosh HaShana, which are treated exactly the same as other Festival days in the Diaspora? The same ruling should apply to a joining of cooked foods. <b>Rav Mordekhai said to</b> Ravina: This does not resolve Rav Ashi’s difficulty, as <b>the Master,</b> Rav Ashi, <b>explicitly said to me that he does not hold</b> in accordance <b>with this</b> opinion of the Sages of <b>Neharde’a.</b> Rather, he maintains that Rosh HaShana differs from other Festivals, and in this case there is no way to make up for failure to prepare a joining of cooked foods.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following case: With regard to <b>a chick that hatched on a Festival, Rav said: It is prohibited. And Shmuel, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan, said: It is permitted.</b> The Gemara explains the reasoning for their respective opinions. <b>Rav said: It is prohibited</b> because <b>it is <i>muktze</i>. And Shmuel, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is permitted, since it itself is rendered permitted through slaughter.</b> The slaughter of the chicken, which renders it fit to be eaten, is made possible by its hatching. Consequently, hatching likewise removes the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.
<b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: And what is the difference between this</b> case <b>and</b> that of <b>a calf born on a Festival,</b> since you agree that a calf may be slaughtered on that day? <b>He said to them:</b> There is a difference. <b>Since</b> a calf inside its mother is considered <b>prepared on account of its mother, by slaughter,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If a cow is slaughtered, the calf inside its womb is also permitted. Therefore, that calf never had the status of <i>muktze</i>, whereas the chick was considered <i>muktze</i> before it hatched.
Rav Kahana and Rav Ashi further challenged Rav: <b>And what is the difference between this</b> case <b>and</b> that of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> If the mother has a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months, neither it nor the calf inside it may be eaten. Nevertheless, after it is born the calf may be slaughtered on a Festival and it is permitted. <b>Rav was silent</b> and did not offer an answer, as though he did not know how to respond to the question.
<b>Rabba said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yosef: What is the reason</b> that <b>Rav was silent? Let him say to them:</b> Even a calf born to a <i>tereifa</i> mother is not considered fully <i>muktze</i>, <b>since it is prepared on account of its mother</b> to be fed <b>to dogs.</b> On a Festival, it is permitted to slaughter a <i>tereifa</i> and give it to dogs as food, and therefore the calf is not fully <i>muktze</i> even before it is born. By contrast, a chick in its shell is not intended as food for dogs, and therefore a chick that hatched on a Festival was unfit for use when the Festival began. Consequently, it was considered <i>muktze</i> and it is now <i>nolad</i>, an object that came into being on Shabbat or a Festival, and it is therefore prohibited.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b>

Daf 6b

<b>Now,</b> we know that food <b>prepared,</b> i.e., fit, <b>for human</b> consumption that became spoiled <b>is not</b> automatically considered <b>prepared for dogs, as we learned</b> in a mishna (see 2a): <b>One may cut pumpkins before an animal</b> to facilitate their consumption, <b>and</b> likewise one may cut up an <b>animal carcass,</b> even of an animal that died on Shabbat, <b>before dogs. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the animal <b>was not</b> already <b>a carcass,</b> i.e., it was not dead and fit for dogs, <b>prior to Shabbat, it is prohibited, because it is not in the</b> category of items considered <b>prepared</b> for use on Shabbat. This shows that although this animal was fit for human consumption while alive, it does not automatically become prepared for dogs once it dies. If so, can food <b>prepared for dogs</b> be considered <b>prepared for humans?</b>
<b>He said to him: Yes.</b> It is not surprising that something <b>prepared</b> and fit <b>for humans is not</b> considered fit and <b>prepared for dogs, as that which is fit for a person, one does not throw it to dogs,</b> and he has therefore removed that animal from his mind. However, something <b>that is prepared for dogs</b> is also considered fit and <b>prepared for humans, as a person’s mind is on anything fit to</b> be eaten by <b>him.</b> One does not completely remove from his mind even food meant for dogs, if it is kosher and edible. Consequently, one has in mind the possibility that he might eat the calf of a cow that is a <i>tereifa</i> once it is born, since at that point it will be kosher and edible.
With regard to the dispute itself, the Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav; and it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, and some say</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav: A calf born on a Festival is permitted; a chick born on a Festival is prohibited. And what is the difference between this</b> case <b>and that one? This one,</b> the calf, <b>is prepared on account of its mother by slaughter; and that one,</b> the chick, <b>is not prepared on account of its mother.</b>
The Gemara further explains: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, and some say</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan: A calf born on a Festival is permitted, and a chick born on a Festival is</b> likewise <b>permitted. What is the reason? This one,</b> the calf, <b>is prepared on account of its mother; and that one,</b> the chick, <b>is itself rendered permitted through slaughter.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A chick born on a Festival is prohibited. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Even on a weekday,</b> the chick <b>is prohibited</b> on the day it hatched <b>because its eyes have not</b> yet <b>opened.</b> A small chick of this kind is not yet considered a bird fit for consumption; rather, it is similar to a creeping animal.
The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught:</b> The verse that states: <b>“Even all creeping animals that creep upon the earth,</b> you shall not eat them, for they are a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:42) comes <b>to include</b> in the list of prohibited creeping animals even <b>chicks that have not</b> yet <b>opened their eyes. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>
§ <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: An egg is fully</b> formed <b>upon its emergence;</b> i.e., it is not considered an egg until it is laid. The Gemara inquires: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the statement: An egg <b>is fully formed upon its emergence?</b> To which issue is Rava referring? <b>If we say</b> he meant an egg <b>is fully formed</b> and called an egg only <b>upon its emergence, and</b> at this stage <b>it is permitted to eat it with milk,</b> this indicates that while an egg is still <b>inside its mother,</b> even if it is fully formed, it is considered meat and it is <b>prohibited to eat it with milk. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds fully</b> formed <b>eggs inside it, it is permitted to eat them with milk?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement should be explained as follows: An egg <b>is fully formed upon its emergence</b> in that it is <b>permitted to eat it on a Festival</b> only if the entire egg emerged on a weekday. The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: This indicates that if an egg is found <b>inside its mother, it is prohibited to eat it on a Festival. But isn’t it taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds fully</b> formed <b>eggs inside it, it is permitted to eat them on a Festival?</b>
<b>And if you say: The <i>baraita</i> teaches us that which the mishna did not</b> explicitly <b>teach us,</b> and Rav stated the <i>halakha</i> accordingly; however, <b>this we</b> already <b>learned</b> in the mishna here, as it says in the mishna: With regard to <b>an egg laid on a Festival, Beit Shammai say it may be eaten, and Beit Hillel say it may not be eaten. And Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree only with regard to</b> an egg that was already <b>laid, but</b> concerning eggs <b>inside their mothers, all agree</b> that they <b>are permitted.</b>
<b>And if you say</b> that the mishna should be explained in the opposite manner, as <b>Beit Hillel also prohibit</b> eggs <b>inside their mothers, and</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Laid,</b> is <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> that <b>they permit even</b> an egg that <b>was laid. However,</b> consider <b>that which is taught</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds inside it fully formed eggs, it is permitted to eat them on a Festival.</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? It is the opinion <b>neither</b> of <b>Beit Shammai nor</b> of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Rav certainly did not prohibit an egg that has not yet been laid. Instead, his statement should be explained as follows: An egg <b>is fully formed upon its emergence, and it produces chicks,</b> i.e., an egg laid in the regular manner can be incubated and a chick will hatch from it. By contrast, an egg that remained <b>inside its mother cannot produce chicks.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical</b> halakhic <b>difference</b> of this observation? The Gemara answers: It is relevant <b>for buying and selling.</b> In other words, the difference between the types of eggs has ramifications for terms of commerce. This is <b>like</b> that incident involving <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who</b> would <b>say to</b> the general public: <b>Eggs</b>

Daf 7a

<b>of a live</b> chicken, <b>who has?</b> He sought to purchase eggs of this kind. <b>They gave him eggs of a slaughtered</b> chicken. <b>He came before Rabbi Ami,</b> claiming he had been cheated. Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> the sellers: This <b>is a mistaken transaction, and it is rescinded;</b> the sale is void.
The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that the transaction is void, as he specified exactly what he wanted. The Gemara answers: The ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this</b> individual <b>wants them for food</b> rather than for chicks, <b>and that which he said,</b> that he is looking for eggs <b>of a live</b> chicken, he said only <b>because they are hard-shelled,</b> mature eggs. <b>What is the practical difference,</b> i.e., what is this man claiming from the seller according to this rejected interpretation? He is merely demanding <b>to refund him the difference</b> in value <b>between the two</b> types of eggs. Rabbi Ami therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the sale involved a fundamental error, as the eggs of a slaughtered chicken are unfit for incubation. The transaction is therefore void.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>A certain person said to</b> vendors: Does <b>anyone</b> have <b>eggs of</b> a chicken that has had relations with <b>a rooster?</b> Does <b>anyone</b> have <b>eggs of a rooster? They gave him eggs</b> that a hen had <b>absorbed from the ground,</b> i.e., which had not been fertilized by a rooster. <b>He came before Rabbi Ami</b> claiming that he had been cheated. Rabbi Ami <b>said to them:</b> This <b>is a mistaken transaction, and it is rescinded.</b>
The Gemara again asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case. The Gemara explains: The ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this</b> person <b>wants</b> the eggs <b>for food, and that which he said,</b> that he wants eggs <b>of a rooster,</b> he said only <b>because they are fatter. What is the practical difference;</b> i.e., what is this man claiming from the seller according to this rejected interpretation? He is merely demanding <b>that they should refund him the difference</b> in value <b>between the two</b> types. Rav Ami therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case; rather, the sale is void.
The Gemara suggests another explanation of Rav’s statement. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the claim: <b>An egg is fully formed upon its emergence?</b> It means that <b>it is fully formed with the emergence of most of it, in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan. As Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that in the case of <b>an egg, most of which emerged</b> from the chicken <b>on a Festival eve, and</b> the egg <b>returned</b> inside the mother and was finally laid on the Festival itself, it <b>is permitted to eat</b> this egg <b>on the Festival.</b> Since most of the egg had emerged before the Festival began, it is considered to have been laid the day before.
<b>And some say</b> the following explanation: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b>Fully formed upon its emergence?</b> It means that <b>it is fully formed upon the emergence of all of it.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Upon the emergence of all of it, yes,</b> it is fully formed at this stage; <b>however,</b> if only <b>most of it</b> came out the day before, <b>no,</b> it is not considered fully formed. <b>And</b> this reading serves <b>to exclude</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> In any case, Rav’s statement can correspond to this statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
§ Apropos the halakhic status of eggs found inside a slaughtered chicken, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds inside it fully formed eggs, it is permitted to eat</b> these eggs <b>with milk. Rabbi Ya’akov says: If</b> the eggs <b>were</b> still <b>attached by sinews, it is prohibited</b> to eat them with milk, as they are considered meat.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who eats</b> one of the following parts <b>of the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird: From a cluster of eggs</b> that are still attached to it by sinews, or <b>from</b> its <b>bones, or from the sinews, or from meat that has been detached from a live</b> animal, is <b>ritually pure</b> because none of these are considered part of the meat of the bird, and therefore they do not impart the ritual impurity of an animal carcass.
However, if one ate <b>from the ovary of</b> its <b>eggs,</b> which contains very small eggs that do not possess any of the regular characteristics of eggs, or if he took a piece <b>of the craw or the intestines, or if he melted the fat</b> of a dead bird <b>and swallowed it,</b> he is <b>ritually impure</b> from the impurity imparted by the unslaughtered carcass of a bird.
<b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that if one ate <b>from a cluster of eggs he is pure,</b> which indicates that eggs still attached by sinews to the chicken are not considered part of the meat of the bird? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This ruling is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov. For if</b> you say it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, didn’t he say: If</b> the eggs <b>were attached by sinews</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat them with milk, indicating that he considers these eggs meat of the chicken.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Ya’akov stated</b> that these eggs are part of the chicken <b>only there, with regard to</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against eating the eggs with milk; <b>however,</b> perhaps <b>with regard to ritual impurity</b> he did <b>not</b> say that these eggs are considered part of the chicken.
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> ritual <b>impurity let us also issue a decree</b> and be stringent in a case of uncertainty and therefore rule that these attached eggs should be considered part of the chicken, <b>this</b> would serve to <b>proliferate impurity, and we do not proliferate impurity</b> that is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> One does not declare an item ritually impure by rabbinic law merely because uncertainty has arisen with regard to its status.
<b>And some say</b> a different version of this discussion, according to which the question is: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that if one eats <b>from the ovary of</b> its <b>eggs he is ritually impure? Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Ya’akov, who said: If</b> the eggs <b>were attached by sinews, they are prohibited. Abaye said to him: From where</b> do you know <b>that</b> the term <b>ovary</b> means: <b>From these</b> eggs <b>that are hanging from the ovary; perhaps</b> it is referring to the <b>ovary itself,</b> the part of the flesh of the bird where the eggs develop?
<b>And if you say:</b> If it is referring to <b>the ovary itself, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this? It is obvious that the ovary itself is meat. One can answer as follows: <b>Just as it is in</b> the case of <b>the craw and the intestines, that even though they are meat</b> according to all opinions, <b>since there are people who do not eat</b> them, <b>it was necessary to teach us</b> that they have the status of meat; <b>here, too,</b> with regard to an ovary, <b>since there are people who do not eat</b> it, <b>it was necessary to teach us</b> that it may not be eaten with milk. Therefore, this argument does not prove that this version of the discussion is incorrect.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse</b> occurs only <b>in the</b> hours of the <b>day</b> is <b>born</b> only <b>by day; any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs</b> only <b>at night is born</b> only <b>by night; any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs either by day or by night is born either by day or by night.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by day is born by day, this</b> is referring to <b>a chicken. Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by night is born by night, this is a bat. Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs either by day or by night,</b> this means <b>a human</b> being <b>and all that are similar to him.</b>
<b>The Master said: Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by day is born by day, this is a chicken.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>practical</b> halakhic <b>difference</b> of this statement? The Gemara answers: The halakhic difference is with regard <b>to that which Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana</b> said, <b>as Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana said:</b> If one <b>examined a chicken’s nest on a Festival eve and did not find an egg in it, and the following day,</b> on the Festival, <b>he rose early and found an egg in it,</b> the egg is <b>permitted,</b> as it can be assumed it was not laid that night.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t he examine</b> the nest before the Festival and fail to find an egg there? If so, the egg must have been laid on the Festival. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>he did not examine very carefully. And even</b> if <b>he did examine carefully,</b> you can <b>say</b> that <b>most of</b> the egg <b>emerged</b> on the eve of the Festival <b>and returned</b> inside its mother, and this ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> This <i>baraita</i> shows that the <i>halakha</i> does not take into account the possibility that a chicken could lay an egg at night.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul say</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one examined a chicken’s nest on a Festival eve and did not find an egg in it, and the following day he rose early and found an egg in it, it is prohibited?</b> This indicates that a chicken might indeed lay an egg at night. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it is referring <b>to</b> an egg <b>that</b> the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth,</b> i.e., one that was not formed by male fertilization. An egg that is not produced by intercourse can be laid at night as well.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so,</b> in <b>Rav Mari’s</b> case <b>too,</b> you can <b>say that</b> the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth</b> and laid the egg during the night of the Festival. How, then, could Rav Mari permit the egg? The Gemara answers: There it is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where there is a male with it.</b> The Gemara asks: Even <b>where there is a male with it,</b> one can <b>also say that it absorbed from the earth</b> rather than from the male. The Gemara answers that <b>Ravina said:</b> It is <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>anywhere that a male is present,</b> a chicken <b>does not absorb from the earth.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> exactly is it considered to have a male with it; How near must a rooster be for this principle to come into effect? <b>Rav Gamda said in the name of Rav:</b> The male must be <b>any place</b>

Daf 7b

<b>where</b> the hen can <b>hear its voice by day,</b> when sounds cannot be heard as easily as at night. If the chicken is close enough to hear the rooster’s call by day, the rooster is considered close enough to the chicken that the latter will produce eggs only through fertilization by the male.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Mari took action</b> in accordance with this opinion, when he found an egg on a Festival morning after he had looked in the nest the day before and failed to find an egg there. He examined <b>up to</b> a distance of <b>sixty houses</b> from the chicken, and although he did not find a rooster within this area, he assumed there was one further away and permitted the egg.
The Gemara comments: <b>And if</b> there is <b>a river</b> between the rooster and the chicken, the chicken <b>does not cross</b> the river; <b>but if there is a bridge,</b> it <b>crosses</b> the river. <b>And if there is</b> only <b>a rope bridge</b> suspended across the river, the chicken will <b>not cross</b> on the rope. The Gemara comments: Nevertheless, <b>an incident</b> occurred in which a chicken <b>crossed over on a rope bridge.</b> However, one may not rely on this possibility.
The Gemara further asks: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you establish</b> this <i>halakha</i> of Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul, who prohibits eating an egg discovered in a nest on a Festival morning after the previous day’s examination revealed nothing? You said that it is referring to a case <b>in</b> which the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth.</b> If so, <b>why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> a situation in which <b>one examined</b> the nest the evening before? The same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>even when one did not examine</b> the nest beforehand.
The Gemara answers: In a case <b>where he did not examine</b> the nest, one could <b>say</b> that the egg <b>was</b> laid <b>yesterday,</b> and there is no reason to prohibit its use. Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul therefore specified that he checked the day before and is certain that the egg was not laid prior to the Festival. The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so, when he examined</b> the nest <b>as well, say:</b> Perhaps this <b>is</b> a case in which <b>most of</b> the egg <b>emerged and returned, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> The Gemara answers: The case discussed <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> where most of the egg emerged from the chicken and returned, <b>is uncommon,</b> and therefore it is assumed not to have occurred.
Apropos one statement of Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul in the name of Rav, the Gemara cites another ruling that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rav said: This crushed garlic</b> poses the <b>danger of exposure.</b> If mashed garlic is not properly covered, there is concern that a snake might have tasted from it and thereby injected its venom into the food. This garlic is consequently prohibited as a health risk.
§ The mishna states that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The measure that determines liability for <b>leaven</b> is <b>an olive-bulk.</b> However, the measure for leavened bread is greater, a large date-bulk. According to Beit Hillel, the measure in both cases is an olive-bulk.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the measures are equal, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only the prohibition of <b>leavened bread, and it would not be necessary</b> to write <b>leaven, and I would say</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>If</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>leavened bread, whose leavening is not</b> as <b>extensive,</b> is <b>an olive-bulk,</b> then <b>leaven, whose leavening is extensive, all the more so</b> should the measure that determines liability be an olive-bulk. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the explicit reference to <b>leaven that the Merciful One wrote</b> in the verse: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19)? It must be <b>to tell you</b> that <b>the measure of this,</b> leavened bread, <b>is not equal to the measure of that,</b> leaven. Rather, the measure that determines liability for leaven is smaller.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Beit Hillel</b> maintain that both the mention of both leaven and leavened bread <b>are necessary. As if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>leaven, I would have said</b> its measure that determines liability is an olive-bulk <b>because its leavening is extensive. However,</b> with regard to <b>leavened bread,</b> whose <b>leavening is not extensive, say no,</b> that is not the measure. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to mention leavened bread as well.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>leavened bread,</b> I would have said that the measure that determines liability for leavened bread is an olive-bulk, <b>because it is fit for consumption</b> on its own; <b>however, leaven, which is not fit for consumption</b> on its own but only when used as a leavening agent for dough, <b>say no,</b> its measure is not like that of leavened bread. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to mention both cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Beit Shammai, don’t they hold</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi Zeira’s</b> opinion? <b>As Rabbi Zeira said,</b> the verse states: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel” (Exodus 12:19). <b>The verse begins with leaven and ends with leavened bread to say to you</b> that <b>leaven is equivalent to leavened bread.</b> How, then, can Beit Shammai maintain that the two are prohibited by different measures?
The Gemara answers: Indeed, <b>with regard to</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>eating, everyone agrees</b> that the same measure applies to leavened bread and leaven. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>removal</b> of leavened bread from one’s house. <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>removal from</b> that of <b>eating.</b> Rather, with regard to the obligation of removal, different measures apply to leavened bread and leaven. <b>And Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>removal from</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>eating.</b>
The Gemara comments: This idea <b>was also stated</b> explicitly by <i>amora’im</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel was stated <b>with regard to</b> the <b>removal</b> of leavened bread; however, <b>with regard to</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>eating, everyone agrees</b> that the measure for both <b>this and that</b> is <b>an olive-bulk.</b>
<b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be found in all your borders”</b> (Exodus 13:7). <b>This</b> obligation to remove leavened bread <b>is</b> subject to <b>a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, as Beit Shammai say:</b> The measure that determines liability for removal of <b>leaven</b> is <b>an olive-bulk, and</b> the measure for leavened bread is <b>a large date-bulk, and Beit Hillel say:</b> The measure for <b>both this and that</b> is <b>an olive-bulk.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is with regard to the obligation to remove leavened bread, not liability for eating it.
§ The mishna states that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel also dispute whether or not <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival,</b> without having prepared earth the day before with which to cover the blood after the slaughter, may dig out earth on the Festival itself to cover the blood.
The Gemara analyzes the wording of the mishna: <b>One who slaughters</b> an animal; this indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> one may dig out dirt, but <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> even Beit Shammai agree that one may not slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird if there is no prepared dirt. Otherwise, the mishna would have said: One may slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival. <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that one <b>may not slaughter</b> it. This proves <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that one <b>may slaughter</b> it even <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as Beit Hillel <b>said</b> and meant the following: <b>One may not slaughter</b> an animal <b>and cover</b> the blood. They are emphasizing that one may not cover the blood even if he slaughtered an animal, whereas Beit Shammai maintain that if one slaughtered he may cover the blood <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede that if he</b> already <b>slaughtered, then he may dig with a shovel and cover</b> the blood, which indicates that Beit Hillel were not emphasizing the covering of the blood. This proves <b>by inference that</b> the <b>first clause</b> of the mishna <b>is not</b> referring to one’s action <b>after the fact,</b> but to the <i>halakha ab initio</i>.
<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying.</b> The phrase: One who slaughters an animal, is not a broad directive on how to act, but rather it means: If there is <b>one who slaughters</b> animals <b>who comes to consult</b> a Sage on how to proceed, <b>what</b> should the Sage <b>say to him? Beit Shammai say</b> that the Sage <b>says to him: Slaughter</b> it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>dig, and cover</b> the blood. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may slaughter</b> the animal <b>only if he had earth</b> that was <b>prepared while it was still day.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef</b> provided a slightly different explanation of the mishna and <b>said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters animals who comes to consult, what does</b> the Sage <b>say to him? Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>he says to him: Go dig, slaughter</b> the animal, <b>and cover</b> the blood. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may slaughter</b> the animal, <b>only if he had earth</b> that was <b>prepared while it was still day.</b>
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Let us say</b> that <b>the Master,</b> i.e., Rav Yosef, <b>and Rabba dispute</b> the following statement <b>that Rabbi Zeira</b> said that <b>Rav said, as Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or bird is obligated to perform the mitzva of covering the blood, and therefore <b>he must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> it,<b> as it is stated: “And he shall pour out its blood and cover it in earth”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). It <b>is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth, but “in earth,”</b> indicating that the blood must be concealed inside the earth. The verse thereby <b>teaches that one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>must place earth beneath and earth above</b> the blood.
Abaye is suggesting <b>that the Master is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> and therefore he requires one to dig first and only afterward slaughter the animal and have the blood flow onto that earth and then cover it with additional earth, <b>and</b> that <b>Rabba is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira.</b>
Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: This is not so; rather, <b>both</b> according <b>to me and</b> according <b>to Rabba we are</b> of the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira, and here we disagree with regard to this</b> matter: <b>Rabba holds</b> that <b>if there is</b> prepared <b>earth beneath, yes,</b> in that case one may slaughter an animal, but <b>if there is no</b> earth prepared beneath, <b>no,</b> he may not slaughter it at all. Why not? Rabba says: <b>We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps one will reconsider and not slaughter</b> it at all, and he will have dug a hole on a Festival unnecessarily. <b>And according to my</b> opinion, <b>on the contrary: This</b> situation, in which he is permitted to dig first, <b>is preferable, since if you do not permit him</b> to dig in all cases for the purpose of slaughter, <b>he will</b> be unable to eat meat and will <b>refrain from rejoicing on the Festival.</b>
§ That mishna states: <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede that if one</b> transgressed and <b>slaughtered an</b> animal, <b>then he digs with a shovel and covers</b> the blood. <b>Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said: And that is</b> the <i>halakha</i> specifically <b>when one has a shovel</b> already <b>embedded</b> in the ground <b>while it was still day,</b> before the onset of the Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what purpose does an embedded shovel serve; <b>doesn’t he</b> still <b>perform</b> the act of <b>crushing,</b> as one must crush the lumps of earth to make the soil fit for covering? <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b>

Daf 8a

Here it is referring <b>to loose earth</b> that does not require further crushing.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But</b> even in the case of loose earth, <b>one makes a hole</b> by the very act of removing the earth or the shovel from that place. The Gemara answers: This ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba, as Rabbi Abba said: One who digs a hole on Shabbat,</b> but he <b>needs only its earth</b> and has no interest in forming a pit, <b>is exempt for</b> that act. Since he has no interest in the hole, he is considered to have performed a destructive act, and the <i>halakha</i> is that one who commits a destructive act is not liable for the performance of prohibited labor on Shabbat and Festivals.
§ The mishna states: <b>That the ashes of a stove are prepared.</b> The Gemara express puzzlement at this statement: <b>The ashes of a stove, who mentioned anything about it?</b> Why does the mishna suddenly speak about the ashes of a stove when it had not previously discussed or even mentioned them? <b>Rabba said: This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said: And the ashes of a stove are prepared.</b> In other words, everyone agrees that in addition to prepared earth, the ashes of a stove are also considered prepared, and one may cover the blood with them. It is not necessary to prepare these ashes especially for this purpose the day before.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: They only taught</b> that the ashes of a stove are considered prepared if the stove <b>was ignited on the Festival eve,</b> so that the ashes had already formed at the start of the Festival. <b>However,</b> if <b>it was ignited on the Festival</b> itself, the ashes are <b>prohibited. And if</b> the ashes are still hot and <b>fit to roast an egg in them,</b> they are not considered <i>muktze</i>, and therefore it is <b>permitted</b> to use them for covering as well.
The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they said</b> that <b>the ashes of a stove are prepared, they said</b> so <b>only when it was ignited on the Festival eve; however,</b> if <b>it was ignited on the Festival,</b> they are <b>prohibited. And if</b> the ashes are still hot and <b>fit to roast an egg in them,</b> they are <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara further states: If before the Festival <b>one brought earth into his garden or his ruin</b> to use for various needs, <b>it is permitted to cover</b> blood <b>with it. And Rav Yehuda</b> likewise <b>said: A person may bring in a basketful of earth</b> the day before the Festival <b>and use</b> both the basket and the earth it contains <b>for all his needs</b> on the Festival.
With regard to this case, <b>Mar Zutra</b> added and <b>taught</b> in public <b>in the name of Mar Zutra the Great</b> that the application of this <i>halakha</i> is limited: <b>And that is</b> the case only <b>if one designated a corner for this</b> earth, thereby demonstrating that he intends to use it for all his requirements, rather than merely bringing earth in to scatter over the floor of the house. In that case, the dirt is nullified. It is considered part of the floor, which means that it is once again classified as <i>muktze</i>.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this from a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 4:9): In the case of <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and non-domesticated animals, <b>one may not slaughter it on a Festival,</b> as it is uncertain whether or not its blood requires covering. <b>And if one did slaughter it, he may not cover its blood. And if it is so,</b> that one may use his basket of earth as he wishes, as claimed by Rav Yehuda, even if a <i>koy</i> is definitely a domesticated animal, <b>let him cover it, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara expresses surprise at this objection: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> one could equally suggest: <b>Let him cover</b> the blood of the <i>koy</i> <b>with ashes of a stove or with</b> earth dug up with <b>an embedded shovel. Rather,</b> this mishna must be referring to a situation <b>where one does not have</b> prepared earth to use for covering the blood; <b>here too,</b> one can say <b>that he does not have</b> a basket of earth ready for all his needs.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the mishna is referring to a situation where one does not have prepared earth, <b>why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> the case of a <i>koy</i>, where there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood? <b>Even</b> in the case of an undomesticated animal, whose blood must <b>certainly</b> be covered, slaughter should <b>also not</b> be permitted, as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel that one may not slaughter if he does not have prepared earth.
The Gemara explains that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>definite</b> undomesticated animals and birds, <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted <b>to slaughter</b> them; <b>however,</b> with regard to <b>an uncertainty,</b> one might <b>say: Due to the joy of the Festival let one slaughter</b> it <b>and not cover</b> its blood, as there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood, and therefore it is overridden by the mitzva to rejoice on a Festival. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one should not slaughter it <i>ab initio</i> if he does not have something prepared with which to cover the blood.

Daf 8b

The Gemara challenges this: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: And if he slaughtered it one may not cover its blood, it may be inferred that in the first clause we are dealing with</b> a situation <b>where he does have</b> something with which to cover the blood. If he does not have anything he can use, why is it necessary to state that one may not cover it? And consequently, if he does in fact have material with which to cover the blood, why may he not do so, either with his basket of earth, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, or with the ashes of a stove?
<b>Rather, Rabba said</b> that <b>the ashes of a stove,</b> which the mishna stated are prepared, are <b>prepared</b> only <b>for</b> covering the blood in a case of <b>a definite</b> obligation, but they <b>are not</b> considered <b>prepared for</b> a case of <b>uncertainty.</b> Although his intention was to use these ashes to cover the blood of any animal he slaughters, whether in a definite or an uncertain case, they are nevertheless not considered prepared for an uncertain case.
The Gemara inquires: In a case <b>of uncertainty, what is the reason</b> that the ashes are not considered prepared? If the reason is <b>that one makes a hole</b> in the mound of ashes when he removes part of it for covering, in <b>a definite</b> case <b>he also makes a hole.</b> If it is prohibited to make a hole, that prohibition applies in all cases. <b>Rather,</b> one must say, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba,</b> that the making of this hole is not considered prohibited labor, as he is merely performing a destructive act. If so, <b>here too,</b> in a case of uncertainty, there should be no cause for concern, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts from the previous suggestion and offers an alternative: With regard to a case of <b>uncertainty, what is the reason</b> that it is prohibited? The reason is that <b>perhaps one</b> will forget and <b>perform crushing</b> with this earth, to ready it for covering. However, the same problem arises as before: If so, <b>we should also decree</b> against covering the blood in <b>a definite</b> case, <b>because</b> he might <b>crush</b> the earth. The Gemara answers: This presents no difficulty, as when one fulfills the mitzva of covering the blood in <b>a definite</b> case, even <b>if he performs crushing,</b> the <b>positive</b> mitzva of covering the blood <b>comes and overrides</b> the <b>prohibition</b> concerning the desecration of a Festival.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>Say that we said</b> the following principle: <b>A positive</b> mitzva <b>comes and overrides a prohibition</b> in a case <b>such as</b> the <b>circumcision of</b> a child who has <b>leprosy.</b> Cutting off a leprous blemish is a violation of a prohibition. However, if a baby’s foreskin is leprous, it is permitted to cut it off by circumcision. <b>Alternatively,</b> the principle applies to a case of a linen <b>cloak on</b> which woolen <b>ritual fringes</b> are placed, despite the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds, i.e., a mixture of wool and linen.
The Gemara explains the difference between those <i>halakhot</i> and the issue at hand. In those cases, <b>at</b> the <b>time that one uproots</b> the <b>prohibition,</b> he <b>fulfills</b> the <b>positive</b> mitzva with the same act. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of covering blood, two separate actions are involved, as <b>at the time that one uproots</b> the <b>prohibition,</b> when he crushes the earth, he <b>does not fulfill</b> the <b>positive</b> mitzva of covering the blood. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as it is possible to say <b>that when one crushes</b> the earth, <b>he covers</b> the blood with it; he fulfills the positive mitzva by means of the same action through which he uproots the prohibition.
The Gemara challenges this explanation from a different perspective: <b>Ultimately, a Festival is</b> a mitzva that includes both the <b>positive</b> mitzva of rest <b>and</b> also the <b>prohibition</b> against performing prohibited labor, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>a positive</b> mitzva by itself <b>does not override a prohibition and a positive</b> mitzva together.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanation, in favor of the following. <b>Rava said:</b> One’s initial <b>intention</b> is to use <b>the ashes of a stove for</b> a mitzva that is <b>definite, and he does not have</b> this <b>intention for</b> cases of <b>uncertainty.</b> One may not use an article on a Festival for a purpose which he did not have in mind beforehand.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rava follows his</b> regular line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rava said:</b> If one <b>brought in earth</b> in order <b>to cover</b> a baby’s <b>excrement with it</b> on a Festival, <b>it is</b> likewise <b>permitted to cover with it the blood of</b> a slaughtered <b>bird.</b> Since he prepared this earth for a case of uncertainty, as it is possible that the baby will not soil the house, he certainly intended to use it for covering the blood of a bird prepared before the Festival for slaughter. If, however, one prepared the earth at the outset to cover <b>the blood of a bird, it is prohibited to cover excrement with it,</b> as he did not know in advance that he would require the earth for this purpose. He had only definite uses in mind, not possible ones such as covering excrement.
The Sages <b>of Neharbela said: Even</b> if <b>one brought in earth to cover the blood of a bird with it, it is permitted to cover excrement with it,</b> as it cannot be said that he did not intend this usage.
<b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥama and Rabbi Zeira disagree with regard to</b> this issue, <b>and some say</b> it was disputed by <b>Rava, son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama,</b> commonly mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud as Rava, without the patronymic, <b>and Rabbi Zeira.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>One</b> of them <b>said</b> that <b>a <i>koy</i> is similar to excrement</b> in this regard. Just as one may cover the blood of a bird with earth brought in for the purpose of covering excrement, he may likewise use it for covering the blood of a <i>koy</i>, as both the case of excrement and the case of the <i>koy</i> are cases of uncertainty. <b>And</b> the other <b>one said: A <i>koy</i> is not similar to excrement.</b> Since the covering of excrement is common, it is regarded as a definite purpose in comparison to a <i>koy</i>, which is by definition an uncertain case. It is therefore prohibited to cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> with earth prepared for the sake of covering excrement.
The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude that Rava is the one who said</b> that <b>a <i>koy</i> is similar to excrement, as Rava said:</b> If one <b>brought in earth to cover excrement with it, it is permitted to cover the blood of a bird with it;</b> if he did bring in earth to cover <b>the blood of a bird, it is prohibited to cover excrement with it.</b> One intends to use the earth for the definite rather than the uncertain purpose, and likewise in the case of a <i>koy</i>. The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <b>conclude</b> that this is the correct version of the opinions in the dispute.
§ <b>Rami, son of Rav Yeiva, said</b> a different reason: In the case of <b>a <i>koy</i>, this is the reasoning</b> for the <i>halakha</i> <b>that one may not cover</b> its blood: It is not because this action would constitute prohibited labor; rather, <b>it is</b> a rabbinic <b>decree due to the permission of its</b> prohibited <b>fat.</b> If one were to cover its blood, people might think that a <i>koy</i> is definitely an undomesticated animal, and it is well known that the fats of an undomesticated animal may be eaten, whereas those of a domesticated animal are prohibited.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so, even on a weekday as well,</b> the blood of a <i>koy</i> should not be covered, due to this concern. The Gemara answers: <b>On a weekday,</b> people will <b>say</b> that <b>he needs to clean his courtyard,</b> and that he is covering the blood merely to keep his courtyard presentable, rather than to fulfill the mitzva of covering blood.
The Gemara asks: And if <b>he slaughtered</b> <i>a koy</i> <b>in a dunghill,</b> a place used for the disposal of refuse, <b>what is there to say?</b> It will be evident that he is not concerned about its cleanliness, and that he is attempting to perform the mitzva of covering blood. Alternatively, if <b>he comes to consult</b> a Sage concerning whether or not he should cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> on a weekday, <b>what is there to say?</b> If the owner of the <i>koy</i> is instructed to cover the blood, would he not come to the erroneous conclusion that its fats are permitted?
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara answers: <b>On a weekday, even if</b> the matter <b>is uncertain, the Sages</b> nevertheless <b>say to him: Go</b> and <b>take the trouble and cover</b> it, as it involves the possible fulfillment of a mitzva. <b>On a Festival,</b> however, <b>if</b> there is <b>uncertainty, would the Sages say to him: Go</b> and <b>take the trouble and cover</b> it? If one was told to cover the blood on a Festival, this would indicate that a <i>koy</i> is definitely an undomesticated animal.
<b>Rabbi Zeira teaches</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Not only did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the blood of <b>a <i>koy</i></b> should not be covered on a Festival, <b>but even if one slaughtered a domesticated animal,</b> whose blood need not be covered, and also slaughtered <b>an undomesticated animal or a fowl,</b> whose blood must be covered, <b>and their bloods became mingled together,</b> it is <b>prohibited to cover</b> the mixture of blood <b>on a Festival.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yasinia said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one cannot cover</b> the entire mixture <b>by one thrust</b> of a shovel. <b>However,</b> if <b>he can cover it with one thrust, it is permitted.</b> Since the entire amount of blood can be covered with a single action, it does not matter if one unnecessarily covers the blood of a domesticated animal while performing the mitzva of covering the blood of a fowl or an undomesticated animal.
The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case; since he covers all the blood in a single action, clearly he performs a mitzva. The Gemara answers: This ruling is nevertheless necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we should decree</b> and prohibit even <b>one thrust, due to</b> the possibility that he might perform <b>two thrusts.</b> Therefore, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yasinia teaches us</b> that this concern is not taken into account.
§ <b>Rabba said:</b> If one <b>slaughtered a bird on the eve of a Festival, one may not cover</b> its blood <b>on the Festival</b> itself.

Daf 9a

If <b>one kneaded dough on a Festival eve,</b> i.e., the day before the Festival, <b>he may separate its <i>ḥalla</i> on the Festival.</b> In general, one may not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes on a Festival. However, since it is permitted to bake bread on the Festival for the requirements of the day, and because bread may not be eaten unless <i>ḥalla</i> has first been separated from it, separating <i>ḥalla</i> is considered a necessary stage in the preparation of bread, and the Sages permitted it. <b>Shmuel’s father said: Even</b> if <b>one kneaded dough on a Festival eve, he may not separate its <i>ḥalla</i> on the Festival,</b> as he should have separated <i>ḥalla</i> then. The mitzva of separating <i>ḥalla</i> goes into effect at the time of the kneading of the dough.
The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say that Shmuel disagrees with his father, as Shmuel said:</b> With regard <b>to <i>ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, where the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> is a rabbinic obligation, <b>one may proceed to eat</b> the bread <b>and afterward separate</b> the <i>ḥalla</i> from the remainder of the dough. This statement indicates that the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael is not required to render the bread permitted, in contrast to the separation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes from produce. Consequently, separating <i>ḥalla</i> is permitted on a Festival, as it does not involve a significant change. This contradicts the opinion of Shmuel’s father, who prohibited separating <i>ḥalla</i> that could have been separated before the Festival.
<b>Rava said:</b> This is not necessarily the case. <b>Doesn’t Shmuel concede that if one designated</b> a piece of dough <b>as</b> <i>ḥalla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>it is prohibited to non-priests?</b> This proves that even Shmuel admits that a certain measure of sanctity applies to the <i>ḥalla</i>. Therefore, he might also agree with his father that it is prohibited to separate <i>ḥalla</i> on a Festival even outside of Eretz Yisrael.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not carry a ladder,</b> which was used for reaching doves, <b>from one dovecote to another. However,</b> one may move it slightly so that <b>he tilts it from one window to another</b> in the same dovecote. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> even carrying a ladder from one dovecote to another.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> applies only in a case where one moves the ladder <b>in the public domain, as Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>one who sees</b> someone carrying his ladder will <b>say</b> to himself: <b>He</b> must <b>need</b> the ladder <b>to plaster his roof,</b> to prevent rainwater from dripping into his house. In other words, an onlooker will suspect him of performing prohibited labor on the Festival. <b>And Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>his dovecote proves about him</b> that he is not moving the ladder for the purpose of a transgression, as it is evident that he is placing the ladder alongside the second dovecote, and everyone will understand his intention. <b>However, in the private domain,</b> where one will not be observed by strangers, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said: Wherever the Sages prohibited</b> an action <b>due to the appearance</b> of prohibition, <b>even</b> if one performs the act <b>in</b> his <b>innermost chamber,</b> where no one will see it, it is <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One whose clothes fell into water on Shabbat or a Festival <b>may spread them out</b> to dry <b>in the sun, but he may not</b> do so <b>opposite the masses,</b> i.e., in a place where people can see him, lest they suspect him of laundering on Shabbat. However, <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> doing so even in private.
<b>Some say</b> a different version of this discussion. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies <b>to the private domain, as Beit Shammai are of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with that which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said,</b> and therefore Beit Shammai apply the decree to the private domain. <b>And Beit Hillel,</b> by contrast, <b>are of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> in accordance with that which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said. However, in the public domain, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to move the ladder.
The Gemara challenges this interpretation: <b>Should we say</b> that Rav <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> According to Rav Ḥanan bar Ami, only Beit Shammai maintains that anything prohibited by the Sages due to appearances may not be performed even in private.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: No, <b>it is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If clothes fell into water on Shabbat or a Festival, <b>one may spread them out in the sun but not opposite the masses. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> doing so. Rav Ḥanan bar Ami accepts the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, who rejects Rav’s principle. According to the opinion of that <i>tanna</i>, it can be claimed that Beit Hillel also rejected Rav’s principle, and they permitted moving the ladder in private but not in public. Rav, on the other hand, follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon in interpreting the opinion of Beit Hillel.

Daf 9b

§ With regard to the mishna itself, the Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said</b> that <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that one may carry a ladder from one dovecote to another</b> to take doves; <b>they disagree only</b> after one has finished at the second dovecote, whether it is permitted <b>to replace</b> the ladder to its original spot at the first dovecote, <b>as Beit Shammai say: One may not replace</b> the ladder, <b>and Beit Hillel say: One may even replace</b> it.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? With regard to a dovecote ladder,</b> which clearly serves the purpose of taking doves. <b>However,</b> in the case <b>of an attic ladder,</b> which has a variety of uses, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>prohibited,</b> as this will raise suspicions. <b>Rabbi Dosa says: One may tilt it from one window to another</b> in the same dovecote. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say in the name of Rabbi Dosa: One may even shift</b> the ladder from one place to another by shuffling its legs.
The Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya went out to the villages</b> to attend to their business. <b>When they came</b> back, <b>their father said to them: Did any incident</b> requiring a ruling of <i>halakha</i> <b>come to your</b> notice? <b>They said to him:</b> The issue of carrying an attic <b>ladder</b> to a dovecote <b>came to our</b> notice, <b>and we permitted it.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: Go out and prohibit that which you permitted.</b>
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons <b>thought</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>do not disagree with regard to an attic ladder,</b> this proves <b>by inference that</b> the <b>first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>they</b> do <b>disagree.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons thought that according to the first <i>tanna</i>, Beit Hillel permit even the use of a loft ladder, and they ruled in accordance with this opinion. <b>But that is not so,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> does not disagree with him, but rather <b>he explains</b> the <b>reason of the first <i>tanna</i>.</b>
<b>From where</b> can this be inferred? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the first <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: One may carry a ladder from one dovecote to another. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to an attic ladder,</b> if so, <b>this</b> phrase: <b>One may carry a ladder from one dovecote to another,</b> is inexact, as he <b>should</b> have said: <b>One may carry a ladder to a dovecote. Rather, isn’t this what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>a dovecote</b> ladder, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted to move it; however, in the case of <b>an attic</b> ladder, <b>no,</b> one may not use it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the others,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons, what is their reasoning? The Gemara answers that they would reply: <b>Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>A dovecote ladder?</b> It <b>teaches: From one dovecote to another, and</b> this simply means that it is permitted to do so <b>even</b> with regard <b>to several dovecotes.</b>
<b>Some say</b> a slightly different version of this incident. Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons <b>said to him: The tilting of an attic ladder came to our</b> notice, <b>and we permitted it.</b> We were asked whether an attic ladder positioned near a dovecote before the Festival may be moved from one window to another in the same dovecote, and we allowed it. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: Go out and prohibit that which you permitted.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>they thought: That which the first <i>tanna</i> prohibits,</b> i.e., moving an attic ladder, <b>Rabbi Dosa permits,</b> i.e. Rabbi Dosa is more lenient than the first <i>tanna</i> and permits moving even an attic ladder from one window to another. <b>And that is not so.</b> Rather, <b>that which the first <i>tanna</i> permits,</b> moving a dovecote ladder, <b>Rabbi Dosa prohibits.</b> He is more stringent and maintains that even a dovecote ladder may be moved only by tilting rather than in the usual manner.
§ The mishna taught: <b>However,</b> everyone agrees that <b>one may tilt</b> a dovecote ladder <b>from one window to another</b> in the same dovecote. The Gemara infers: <b>Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival,</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai is stringent, and</b> that of <b>Beit Hillel is lenient.</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the first mishna of the tractate (2a): With regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival, Beit Shammai say: He may dig</b> earth <b>with a shovel and cover</b> the blood, <b>and Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter</b> an undomesticated animal or a fowl, <b>unless he had earth prepared</b> for that purpose <b>while it was still day.</b> This indicates that it is Beit Shammai who are concerned for the honor and joy of the Festival, and they are therefore lenient with regard to covering the blood; whereas Beit Hillel do not share the same concern and are stringent about covering the blood, despite the fact that their ruling might adversely affect the joy of the Festival.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions</b> of the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>is reversed.</b> The opinion attributed to Beit Hillel is actually that of Beit Shammai, and vice versa. The Gemara rejects Rabbi Yoḥanan’s answer: <b>From where</b> do you infer that this extreme conclusion is necessarily the case? A different explanation is possible: <b>Perhaps Beit Shammai say</b> their opinion, that it is permitted to cover the blood, <b>only there, where there is</b> already <b>a shovel embedded</b> in the earth ready for this purpose, and therefore there are grounds for a lenient ruling. <b>However, where there is no embedded shovel,</b> they did <b>not</b> permit it.
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible to say that <b>Beit Hillel say</b> their opinion, that an act is permitted for the sake of the joy of the Festival, <b>only here, where his dovecote,</b> the place where he ultimately positions the ladder, <b>proves</b> with regard <b>to him</b> that he intended to use his ladder for a permitted purpose; <b>but there,</b> where there is no equivalent proof, they were <b>not</b> lenient. This shows that there is no clear contradiction between the rulings in the two cases.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the previous version and suggests that Rabbi Yoḥanan issued his statement with regard to a different issue: <b>If</b> the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>is difficult, this is</b> what is <b>difficult:</b> It was taught in a different mishna (10a): <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take</b> fledgling doves on a Festival <b>unless he shook</b> them, as an act of preparation, <b>while it was still day. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is indeed necessary to perform some act of preparation to permit the taking of fledglings on a Festival, but this does not have to be done by shaking them. Rather, it is enough if one <b>stands</b> the day before <b>and says: I</b> will <b>take this</b> dove <b>and that</b> one.
<b>Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival,</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai is stringent and</b> that of <b>Beit Hillel is lenient. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> as above: With regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival,</b> Beit Shammai are lenient and allow one to dig with a shovel to cover the blood, due to the joy of the Festival, whereas Beit Hillel do not permit one to slaughter at all, unless there was a shovel ready from the day before. It was with regard to this contradiction that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of <b>the opinions is reversed.</b>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But perhaps that is not so,</b> as a different explanation is possible: <b>Beit Shammai only state</b> their lenient opinion, that it is permitted to cover the blood, <b>where there is an embedded shovel.</b>

Daf 10a

<b>However, where there is no embedded shovel,</b> even Beit Shammai did <b>not</b> permit it. <b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible that <b>Beit Hillel say</b> their opinion <b>only here, since</b> a dove <b>is <i>muktze</i>,</b> which is prohibited by rabbinic law, and therefore <b>when he stands and says: I will take this and that,</b> it is <b>enough. However there,</b> where the prohibition applies by Torah law, they did <b>not</b> say so.
<b>Rather, if there is a difficulty</b> involving a contradiction, <b>this is the difficulty,</b> from a different mishna (11a): <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take a large pestle</b> from a mortar, which is normally used for crushing wheat in the preparation of porridge, for any other purpose on a Festival, e.g., <b>to cut meat on it; and Beit Hillel permit</b> it. <b>Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival,</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai is stringent, and</b> that of <b>Beit Hillel is lenient. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival, Beit Shammai</b> say: He may dig earth with a shovel and cover the blood, and Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter an undomesticated animal or a fowl, unless he had earth prepared for that purpose while it was still day. It was in this regard that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions is reversed.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>From where</b> do you know this? <b>Perhaps it is not so.</b> Rather, <b>Beit Shammai say</b> their opinion <b>only there, where there is a shovel embedded</b> and prepared the day before, <b>but where there is no embedded shovel,</b> they did <b>not</b> rule leniently. <b>Alternatively,</b> one can say that <b>Beit Hillel say</b> their opinion <b>only here,</b> with regard to a pestle, <b>which</b> at least <b>has the status of a vessel,</b> and therefore it is not completely <i>muktze</i>. <b>However, there,</b> in the case of slaughtering, Beit Hillel did <b>not</b> issue a lenient ruling.
<b>Rather, if there is a difficulty, this is the difficulty:</b> It is taught in a mishna (11a): <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not place</b> an unprocessed <b>hide before those who</b> will <b>tread on it,</b> as this is an instance of the prohibited labor of tanning on a Festival. <b>And one may not lift</b> the hide from its spot, as it is considered <i>muktze</i>, <b>unless there is an olive-bulk of meat on it,</b> in which case it may be carried on account of its meat. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> one to place a hide before those who will tread upon it.
Once again the Gemara states: <b>Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival,</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai is stringent, and</b> that of <b>Beit Hillel is lenient. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival,</b> Beit Shammai say, <b>etc.</b> Concerning this case, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions is reversed.</b>
Here too, the Gemara rejects this: <b>From where</b> do you know this? <b>Perhaps that is not so.</b> Rather, <b>Beit Shammai say</b> their opinion <b>only there, where there is a shovel embedded</b> and prepared the day before, <b>but where there is no embedded shovel,</b> they did <b>not</b> rule leniently. <b>Alternatively, Beit Hillel say</b> their opinion <b>only here,</b> with regard to a hide, <b>which is suitable</b> for people <b>to recline upon,</b> and therefore it is not completely <i>muktze</i>. <b>However, there,</b> in the case of slaughtering, they were <b>not</b> lenient.
<b>Rather, if there is a difficulty, this is the difficulty,</b> as it is taught (11a): <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not remove</b> the <b>shutters</b> of a store <b>on a Festival,</b> to open the store by raising them, due to the prohibition against building and demolishing on a Festival; <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> not only to open the shutters, but <b>even to replace</b> them. <b>Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival,</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai is stringent, and</b> that of <b>Beit Hillel is lenient. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival,</b> Beit Shammai say, <b>etc.</b>
<b>Granted,</b> the contradiction between one statement of <b>Beit Shammai</b> and the other statement of <b>Beit Shammai</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as it can be explained as follows: <b>There,</b> in the slaughtering case, it is referring to a situation <b>where there is a shovel embedded</b> and prepared the day before; <b>here, there is no embedded shovel,</b> and therefore Beit Shammai are stringent. <b>However,</b> the contradiction between one statement of <b>Beit Hillel</b> and the other statement of <b>Beit Hillel</b> is <b>difficult.</b>
It is with regard to this contradiction that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of <b>the opinions is reversed.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can suggest a different answer without reversing the opinions: <b>Beit Hillel say</b> their lenient opinion <b>only here,</b> in the case of the shutters, <b>because</b> they maintain <b>that there is no</b> prohibition against <b>building with regard to vessels and there is no</b> prohibition against <b>dismantling with regard to vessels,</b> which means that no Torah prohibition is violated in removing the shutters. <b>However, there,</b> in the case of slaughtering, where there are no extenuating circumstances, Beit Hillel did <b>not</b> permit it. Consequently, there is no contradiction that necessitates a reversal of the opinions.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take</b> fledgling doves from a dovecote on a Festival, <b>unless he shook</b> the ones he wished to take <b>while it was still day,</b> thereby preparing them. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is not necessary to shake; rather, it is sufficient if one <b>stands</b> the day before <b>and says: I</b> will <b>take this</b> fledgling <b>and that</b> one.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel applies <b>to</b> the <b>first brood,</b> the first pair of fledglings hatched in the first month of the year from a pair of doves. Those fledglings are usually left in the nest and are not used for food. <b>As Beit Shammai hold: We issue a decree</b> prohibiting taking them, as <b>perhaps</b> on the Festival <b>he will come to reconsider</b> after handling them and decide to leave them in their place, in which case he has moved them unnecessarily. However, once he has already shaken them, there is no further concern that he might change his mind on the Festival itself.
<b>And Beit Hillel hold: We do not issue a decree,</b> as there is no concern that one might change his mind, and therefore a verbal commitment is sufficient. <b>However, with regard to the second brood,</b> the fledglings born on the second cycle in the following month, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>enough</b> for one <b>to stand and say: I</b> will <b>take this</b> one <b>and that</b> one.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, why does one need to say: I</b> will <b>take this</b> one <b>and that</b> one? <b>Let him say: From here,</b> this dovecote, <b>I will take tomorrow.</b> Why does one have to specify exactly which fledglings he plans to remove from the dovecote?
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>Beit Hillel do not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation,</b> i.e., they reject the idea that a person’s original intention can be clarified retroactively, and therefore it cannot be said that the fledglings one takes on the Festival were the ones he had in mind beforehand, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ohalot</i> 7:3): If <b>a corpse</b> is located <b>in a house, and</b> the house <b>has many entrances,</b> whether they are open or closed, not only is the inside of the house ritually impure as a tent of the dead, but <b>all</b> the entrances <b>are</b> likewise <b>ritually impure</b> and impart impurity to the vessels they contain? The reason is that the corpse might be removed via any of the entrances, and therefore they all contract impurity.
If only <b>one of</b> the entrances <b>was open</b> after the person died, that entrance alone <b>is ritually impure,</b> as the corpse will certainly be removed through it, <b>and all</b> the other entrances remain <b>ritually pure.</b> The same applies if <b>one decided</b> from the outset <b>to remove</b> the corpse <b>through one of</b> the entrances, <b>or</b> to carry it out <b>through a window that is four by four</b> handbreadths in size, which is large enough for a corpse. This intention <b>spares all the</b> other <b>entrances</b> from ritual impurity, as it is clear that the corpse will not be removed through them.
With regard to this case, <b>Beit Shammai say: This</b> <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>if one had decided to remove</b> the corpse by a particular entrance <b>before the person died,</b> so that the entrance through which the body would be removed was already determined at the time of death. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even after the person died,</b> as the principle of retroactive designation is invoked, which means that the entrance through which the deceased will be removed is retroactively designated. This indicates that Beit Hillel do accept the principle of retroactive designation.
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Wasn’t it stated</b> by <i>amora’im</i> <b>with regard to this</b> mishna that <b>Rabba said:</b> In this case, Beit Hillel referred only <b>to purifying the entrances from that point forward.</b> In other words, after one has decided on an entrance that he will use to remove the dead, any vessels in the space of the other entrances do not become ritually impure. However, vessels that were located inside the space of the other entrances before the decision was made remain impure. According to these <i>amora’im</i>, Beit Hillel do not accept the principle of retroactive designation. <b>And, so too, Rav Oshaya said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> is referring <b>to purifying the entrances from that point forward,</b> which indicates: <b>From here onward, yes,</b> the entrances are ritually pure; <b>retroactively, no,</b> they are not considered pure.
<b>Rava said</b> that there is a different way to resolve the conflicting rulings of Beit Hillel: <b>Actually,</b> in the case of ritual impurity, Beit Hillel maintain that all the entrances are ritually pure <b>retroactively. And here,</b> with regard to fledglings, <b>this is the reason</b> why Beit Hillel insist that one designate which particular fledglings one plans to take on the Festival: <b>Perhaps one will move</b> fledglings, <b>and put</b> them <b>down,</b> and again <b>move</b> them, <b>and put</b> them <b>down</b> until he finds the pair he wants, thereby <b>moving an object that is not suitable for him,</b> i.e., which is <i>muktze</i>.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But</b> if this is indeed the concern, <b>didn’t you say</b> that <b>it is enough</b> if <b>one stands and says: I</b> will <b>take this</b> one <b>and that</b> one. In this case, too, he does not touch them. It is therefore possible that he may reconsider his choice of fledglings on the Festival after he handles them. The Gemara answers: <b>This applies only</b> when one made his choice <b>on the eve of the Festival.</b> Since he knows that he may not alter his decision on the Festival itself even if he does not like the ones he chose, he definitively decides to take those fledglings and will not handle others.

Daf 10b

<b>However, on the Festival</b> it is <b>prohibited, as sometimes</b> those that seemed to him to be <b>fat ones will be found</b> to be <b>thin, and thin ones</b> will be found to be <b>fat, and he</b> will <b>move an object that is not suitable for him,</b> thereby transgressing the prohibition against moving <i>muktze</i> objects. <b>Alternatively, sometimes they will all be found</b> to be <b>thin, and he will leave them</b> all, <b>and he will come to neglect the rejoicing of the Festival.</b> If, however, one announces the day before: I will take this one and that one, he will indeed take only those fledglings, thereby enhancing his Festival joy.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If, on the eve of a Festival, one <b>designated black</b> fledglings to be slaughtered, <b>and</b> on the following day <b>found white</b> ones in the dovecote, rather than the birds he had designated, or if one designated <b>white</b> ones to be slaughtered <b>and found black</b> ones, or if one designated <b>two</b> fledglings to be slaughtered <b>and found three, they are prohibited,</b> as these are not the same fledglings he had designated earlier. If, however, one designated <b>three</b> to be slaughtered <b>and found</b> only <b>two, they are permitted,</b> as it is presumed that one of the fledglings escaped.
If one designated them <b>inside the nest</b> and the next day he cannot find them there, <b>and he found</b> fledglings <b>before the nest, they are prohibited,</b> as they might be fledglings other than the ones he designated and left inside the nest. <b>But if there are only those</b> fledglings in the immediate vicinity, <b>they are permitted,</b> as it can be assumed that these are the ones he designated inside the nest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: But it is <b>obvious</b> that if one designated black ones to be slaughtered and found white ones, they are not the same birds. <b>Rabba said: With what are we dealing here?</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where one designated</b> both <b>black and white</b> ones to be slaughtered, <b>and he arose and found black ones in the place</b> where the <b>white ones</b> had been, <b>and white ones in</b> the <b>place</b> of the <b>black ones. Lest you say: These are those</b> same fledglings <b>and</b> they simply <b>exchanged</b> places, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this claim is not accepted. Instead, it is assumed that <b>these</b> ones that he designated <b>have gone to the</b> outside <b>world, and these</b> ones that he found <b>are others</b> that have come from elsewhere.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> this mishna <b>supports Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> When resolving an uncertainty with regard to the identity of an item, if the <b>majority</b> indicates one ruling but the item in question is <b>proximate</b> to a source that indicates otherwise, one <b>follows the majority.</b> In this case, the majority of fledglings are prohibited, as they were not designated for use on the Festival. Consequently, the found fledglings are prohibited, despite the fact that the nearest fledglings are the designated ones.
The Gemara refutes this suggestion: Perhaps it is <b>as Abaye said</b> with regard to a different issue: We are dealing with fledglings located <b>on a ledge,</b> a flat piece of wood protruding from the dovecote, around which many doves congregate. <b>Here too,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a ledge.</b> Since other doves are regularly found there, the principle that one follows the majority rather than the proximate source does not apply, as both the majority of doves and the proximate source of doves are not the original ones, and therefore all the fledglings are prohibited.
The mishna taught that if one designated <b>two and found three, they are prohibited.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at this matter, the fledglings are prohibited. <b>If these are others, they are others</b> that have not been designated. <b>And if they are not others,</b> i.e., two of the fledglings that one designated are still there, nevertheless <b>there is one</b> that he certainly did not designate and <b>that is mingled with them,</b> which renders the others prohibited as well.
§ The mishna taught that if one designated <b>three and found two, they are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains: <b>These are the same ones, and one of them has gone to the</b> outside <b>world,</b> leaving two behind.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and not</b> that of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>placed one hundred dinars</b> of tithe money in a safe place <b>and found two hundred</b> there, it is assumed that this is <b>non-sacred</b> money <b>and second-tithe</b> money <b>mingled together.</b> Someone must have come and added another hundred to his tithe money. Therefore, he separates one dinar from the total and states: Whatever part of this is the tithe, is fine; whatever part of it is non-tithe money, let it be used to redeem the tithe money, and this should be sanctified as tithe money in its place. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: It is all non-sacred</b> money. Since the money is not as he left it, the assumption is that someone took the original one hundred dinars; and he, or someone else, replaced it with two hundred dinars of regular money.
Conversely, if one <b>placed two hundred</b> dinars <b>and found one hundred dinars,</b> it is presumed that <b>one hundred dinars has been left</b> in its place and is tithe money, <b>and one hundred dinars</b> was <b>removed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: It is all non-sacred</b> money. It is assumed that someone removed all the money, and the one hundred dinars he found must have been placed there by someone else, and is not connected to the money he left. The <i>halakha</i> with regard to the case of fledglings apparently follows Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion in the case of second-tithe money.
The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it can be explained, as <b>it was stated with regard to this</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: Fledglings are different, since they typically hop</b> from place to place. Therefore, it is possible that one of them escaped. By contrast, a money pouch cannot move of its own accord and must have been taken by someone.
The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>to answer with regard to it: Fledglings are different, since they typically hop? But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna, which deals with a money pouch, <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar</b> disagree over it: <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies only <b>to</b> a case of <b>two pouches,</b> with one hundred dinars in each pouch. <b>However,</b> if all of the money was <b>in a single pouch, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>non-sacred</b> money, as it is unlikely that only half of the money was removed while the other half was left in its place. <b>And</b> the other <b>one</b> of them <b>said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies only <b>to one pouch, but with regard to two pouches, everyone agrees</b> that <b>one hundred dinars</b> of tithe <b>is left and one hundred dinars</b> has been <b>removed.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that the <b>dispute</b> deals with a case <b>of two pouches, this is</b> why <b>it was necessary to answer here: Fledglings are different, since they typically hop. However, according to the one who says</b> that the <b>dispute</b> involves a case <b>of one pouch, but with regard to two pouches everyone agrees</b> that <b>one hundred dinars</b> of tithe <b>is left and one hundred dinars</b> has been <b>removed, now</b> consider: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>to answer, with regard to it,</b> that there is a difference between that <i>halakha</i> and the case of fledglings? <b>You said</b> that <b>they do not disagree</b> even <b>with regard to two</b> separate <b>pouches,</b> and therefore they certainly do not disagree in the case of fledglings.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Here we are dealing with fledglings tied</b> together <b>and</b> with money <b>pouches tied</b> together. In other words, when it is stated that the dispute applies to one pouch, this refers to two pouches that are tied together, as well. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the rabbis agree only with regard to two pouches that are entirely separate. Consequently, it is necessary to explain that there is a difference between pouches tied together and fledglings tied together: <b>Fledglings</b> can <b>release themselves from each other,</b> and therefore it is possible that only one of them escaped, whereas <b>pouches cannot release themselves from each other.</b> Therefore, it is evident that someone must have taken them. Since they were tied together, he certainly took both of them.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is indeed the case, and it is obvious that someone came and took the money, what is Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s reasoning? The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi could have <b>said to you: Pouches, too, sometimes</b>

Daf 11a

<b>their knot becomes worn</b> and untied. Consequently, it is possible that someone took only one of the two pouches.
§ The mishna taught that if one designated fledglings <b>inside the nest and found</b> them <b>before the nest, they are prohibited.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say that this supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> In a case involving <b>a majority and</b> an item that is <b>near,</b> one <b>follows the majority.</b> Since doves from the outside world are more numerous than those that one designated, the assumption is that these fledglings are from the majority, and therefore they are prohibited.
<b>Abaye said,</b> in refutation of this claim: Here we are dealing <b>with a ledge</b> affixed to the front of the nest, where all the doves gather. Therefore, the principle pertaining to a majority and an item that is near does not apply to this case. <b>Rava said:</b> Here <b>we are dealing with two nests, one above the other,</b> i.e., adjacent nests rather than any two nests. <b>And it is not necessary</b> to state that in the case of <b>one</b> who <b>designated</b> the fledglings in <b>the lower</b> nest <b>and did not designate</b> those <b>in the upper one, and he found</b> fledglings <b>in the lower one and he did not find</b> fledglings <b>in the upper one, that</b> the fledglings <b>are</b> all <b>prohibited.</b> The reason is <b>that we say: These</b> that were in the lower nest <b>went to the</b> outside <b>world, while these</b> still present <b>have dragged themselves and come down.</b>
<b>Rather, even if one designated</b> fledglings <b>in the upper</b> nest <b>and did not designate</b> fledglings <b>in the lower</b> one, <b>and he came and found</b> fledglings <b>in the upper one and did not find</b> fledglings <b>in the lower one, those</b> in the upper nest <b>are also prohibited, as we say: Those</b> that he originally designated <b>went to the</b> outside <b>world, and those</b> in the lower nest <b>have clutched and climbed.</b> Therefore, there is cause for concern in both of these cases.
The mishna states that <b>if there are no</b> others <b>there apart from them, they are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> fledglings that <b>are</b> already <b>able</b> to <b>fly, it</b> is possible <b>to say</b> that <b>those</b> that he designated <b>went to the</b> outside <b>world, and the ones</b> that are present <b>are other ones.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring <b>to</b> fledglings that can only <b>hop</b> from one place to another. However, <b>if</b> it deals with a case <b>where there is</b> another dove <b>nest within fifty cubits,</b> the fledglings might have <b>jumped</b> and come from that nest; <b>and if there is no nest within fifty cubits,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that <b>they are permitted,</b> for from where could they have come? <b>As Mar Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> creature <b>that hops,</b> it <b>does not hop more than fifty cubits.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there is</b> another <b>nest within fifty cubits, and</b> it deals with a situation <b>where</b> the additional nest <b>is situated around a corner</b> from the first nest, rather than in a straight line from it. <b>Lest you say:</b> The fledglings <b>jumped</b> from one nest to the other, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <b>anywhere that</b> a fledgling <b>hops and turns and sees its nest, it will</b> continue to <b>hop. But if</b> it can <b>no</b> longer see its original nest, <b>it will not hop</b> any farther.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take a large pestle</b> from a mortar, which is normally used for crushing wheat in the preparation of porridge, for any other purpose on a Festival, e.g., <b>to cut meat on it; and Beit Hillel permit</b> it. Likewise, <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not place</b> an unprocessed <b>hide before those who</b> will <b>tread on it,</b> as this constitutes the prohibited labor of tanning on a Festival. <b>And one may not lift</b> the hide from its place, as it is considered <i>muktze</i>, <b>unless there is an olive-bulk of meat on it,</b> in which case it may be carried on account of its meat; <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> it in both cases.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>agree that if one</b> already <b>cut</b> the <b>meat</b> he needs for the Festival <b>on</b> the pestle, <b>it is prohibited to move</b> the pestle farther on the Festival. The reason is that the vessel is <i>muktze</i> as a utensil whose primary function is a prohibited use, and therefore it is permitted to handle it only when one requires it.
<b>Abaye said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> applies specifically <b>in</b> the case of <b>a pestle; however, in</b> the case of a wooden anvil used <b>for breaking bones, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious; we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>A pestle.</b> Why would one think that an object not even mentioned in the mishna is prohibited?
The Gemara answers: Abaye’s statement is necessary, <b>lest you say: The same is true,</b> i.e., Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree, <b>even</b> with regard to a wooden anvil used <b>for breaking bones; and that which</b> the mishna specifically <b>teaches: A pestle,</b> is <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> that <b>they permitted</b> moving <b>even an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for a prohibited</b> use. Abaye therefore <b>teaches us</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to a wooden anvil used for breaking bones.
<b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion. <b>Abaye said: It is necessary</b> to say <b>only: Even a new</b> wooden anvil used <b>for breaking bones</b> is also permitted. <b>Lest you say:</b> Perhaps <b>one will reconsider and not break</b> bones <b>on it,</b> but rather set it aside for a different purpose, Abaye therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is that so? <b>Are Beit Shammai not concerned</b> about the possibility <b>that</b> one might <b>reconsider? But isn’t it taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Beitza</i> 1:13): <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> On a Festival, <b>one may not lead a butcher with a knife</b> in hand <b>to an animal</b> located far from him, so that he can slaughter it; <b>nor</b> may one lead <b>an animal to a butcher with a knife,</b> lest he reconsider, in which case he will have handled the knife unnecessarily, which is prohibited; <b>and Beit Hillel say: One may lead</b> them <b>from one to the other,</b> as they are not concerned about unnecessary use of the knife.
By the same reasoning, <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bring spices or a pestle to a mortar, nor a mortar to spices and a pestle,</b> as he might change his mind and will have handled these utensils on the Festival for no purpose. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may bring one to the other,</b> as there is no concern that he may reconsider. This shows that Beit Shammai are, in general, concerned that one might reconsider, as they prohibit one to handle items for this reason.
The Gemara refutes this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted,</b> in the case of <b>an animal, one</b> is liable to <b>come to reconsider, as</b> he might <b>say: Let us leave</b> aside <b>this animal,</b> as it is <b>thin, and we will bring a different animal, fatter than it.</b> With regard to <b>a pot, too, one</b> is liable <b>to come to reconsider, as</b> he might <b>say: Let us leave</b> aside <b>this pot</b> of cooked food, <b>as</b> it <b>requires spices</b> and would take great effort to prepare, <b>and I will bring a different one that does not require spices</b> and can be cooked as it is. However, <b>here,</b> with regard to a wooden anvil used for breaking bones, <b>what is there to say?</b> Will one <b>reconsider and not break</b> the bones? <b>Since he has slaughtered</b> an animal, it <b>stands</b> ready for its bones <b>to be broken,</b> as it cannot be eaten in any other way.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not place</b> an unprocessed <b>hide</b> before the one who will tread on it. The Sage <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Beitza</i> 1:13): <b>And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>agree that one may salt meat for roasting on</b> this hide, and there is no concern that some of the salt will fall on the hide, which would be similar to tanning the hide by salting. <b>Abaye said: They taught</b> that one may salt meat <b>only for roasting,</b> in which case it is not salted a great deal. <b>However,</b> in the case of meat <b>for a pot,</b> i.e., for cooking, the Sages did <b>not</b> say that one may salt it on the hide, as meat must be well-salted on all sides before cooking, and a large amount of salt will inevitably spill onto the hide.
The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> the one may not salt meat <b>for</b> cooking in a pot, as <b>we</b> explicitly <b>learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> just cited: <b>For roasting,</b> and not for cooking. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> comes to <b>teach us that even</b> the permission to salt meat <b>for roasting</b> applies only if one does so in the usual manner. However, if one salts it <b>in a manner of</b> meat salted to be cooked in <b>a pot,</b> which requires more salt than is necessary for roasting, it is <b>prohibited.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> On a Festival, <b>one may not salt the fats</b> of an animal, which is done so that they will not decompose and emit a foul odor. This is true even if the animal was slaughtered on the Festival. <b>And one may not turn them over.</b> The fats are unfit for use on the Festival, and therefore they are <i>muktze</i>. <b>They said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: One may spread</b> the fats <b>out in the wind on pegs</b> to prevent them from decaying.
<b>Rav Mattana said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. Some say</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> this statement <b>is necessary.</b> Otherwise, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that since this is a dispute between <b>an individual and</b> the <b>many,</b> one should apply the principal that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>many.</b> Rav Mattana therefore <b>teaches us</b> that, in this case, the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the individual.</b>
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, this is <b>obvious.</b> In a case involving <b>an individual and</b> the <b>many, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the <b>many.</b> The Gemara answers: This ruling is nevertheless necessary, <b>lest you say: Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion is</b> more <b>reasonable, for if you do not permit him</b> to air out the fats, <b>he will refrain and not slaughter</b> an animal at all. Rav Mattana therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this factor is not taken into consideration.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> placing <b>a hide before those who will tread on it,</b> which Beit Hillel, whose ruling is accepted as <i>halakha</i>, permit for the very reason that, if one is not allowed to do so, he will refrain from slaughtering animals?

Daf 11b

The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of spreading out the hide, <b>the matter is not</b> so <b>evident</b> that it is spread out for tanning <b>because</b> in its current state, <b>it is fit to recline on,</b> and therefore it can be said that one placed it for this purpose. However, <b>here,</b> with regard to fats, he himself might <b>come to say: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages permitted</b> it <b>to me? So that it will not emit a foul odor.</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> if I <b>spread them out,</b> and <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> if I <b>salt them?</b> This reasoning will lead one to salt hides, which is a prohibited labor.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: A person may salt</b> on a Festival <b>several pieces of meat at one time, although he requires</b> only <b>one piece,</b> as it is all one act of salting. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> would <b>employ artifice and salt bone</b> by <b>bone.</b> After salting one bone, he would say: I prefer this one instead, and would thereby salt all the meat in his possession.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not remove</b> the <b>shutters [<i>terisin</i>]</b> of a store <b>on a Festival,</b> due to the prohibition against building and demolishing. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> one not only to open the shutters, but <b>even to replace</b> them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are these <b>shutters? Ulla said:</b> This is referring to <b>shutters of shops.</b> The marketplace shops or stalls were large crates or wagons, not buildings. They were closed at night with shutters. The shopkeepers would open the shutters on the Festival so that people who did not manage to finish all of their Festival preparations before the Festival could take the articles they required and settle accounts with the storekeeper later. Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disputed whether the shutters may be opened and closed on the Festival itself.
<b>And Ulla said:</b> With regard to <b>three matters,</b> the Sages <b>permitted</b> an action <b>whose result</b> is undesirable <b>in order</b> to encourage a desirable <b>initial</b> action. <b>And these are</b> the three matters: First, they permitted spreading out the <b>hide</b> of an animal slaughtered on a Festival <b>before those</b> who will <b>tread on it,</b> a stage in its tanning. This was permitted because the Sages wish to encourage slaughtering the animal to enable celebration on the Festival. <b>And</b> second, the Sages permitted the replacement of <b>shutters of shops</b> on a Festival, so that storeowners could supply the Festival requirements for those in need.
<b>And</b> the third permitted action is <b>the replacement of a bandage in the Temple.</b> If a priest had an injury on his hand, he would have to remove the bandage while performing the Temple service, as it is prohibited for any item to interpose between his hand and whatever he must handle as part of the rite. After concluding his Temple service, he was allowed to replace the bandage on Shabbat, despite the fact that this is ordinarily prohibited, so as not to discourage him from engaging in Temple service.
<b>And Raḥava</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There is <b>also</b> one other matter, i.e., another instance where the Sages permitted an action whose result was undesirable in order to encourage a desirable initial action. This concerns a <i>ḥaver</i>, a member of a group that is meticulous with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, <b>who opens his barrel</b> of wine or prepares <b>and begins</b> to sell <b>his dough</b> to pilgrims <b>for the sake of the Festival.</b>
<b>And</b> this is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: He may finish</b> selling all the bread made from that dough and all the wine in the barrel. Wine or dough sold to the general public is usually classified as ritually impure, as it might have been touched by an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, one who is not careful with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity. During a Festival, however, the Sages decreed that all wine and dough sold in Jerusalem is ritually pure, so as not to embarrass ignorant people, and they may therefore be bought even by a <i>ḥaver</i>. Rabbi Yehuda adds that even if a large quantity of wine or dough remains after the Festival, it retains its status as ritually pure and one may continue to sell it to a <i>ḥaver</i>. This is a case of permitting an action whose result is undesirable for the sake of an initial action, in that the Sages maintained the wine and dough’s status as ritually pure after the Festival in order to encourage people to sell wine and dough on the Festival.
With regard to Ulla’s statement, the Gemara asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one may spread out an animal’s <b>hide before those</b> who will <b>tread on it.</b> Why did Ulla find it necessary to restate an explicit teaching of a mishna? The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the reason of Beit Hillel</b> is <b>because</b> the hide <b>is fit for reclining on it, and</b> therefore <b>even</b> if the animal was slaughtered <b>on the eve of the Festival,</b> it would <b>also</b> be permitted to spread out its hide on the Festival. Ulla therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the reason for the leniency is that the Sages <b>permitted</b> an action <b>whose result</b> was undesirable <b>in order</b> to encourage a desirable <b>initial</b> action. Consequently, in the case of an animal slaughtered <b>on a Festival, yes,</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies; but with regard to one that was slaughtered <b>on the eve of a Festival, no,</b> one may not spread out its hide.
The Gemara further asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>shutters of shops as well,</b> as the mishna states that <b>Beit Hillel permit</b> one <b>even to replace them.</b> The Gemara explains: This, too, is necessary. <b>Lest you say: Beit Hillel’s reason</b> for being lenient <b>is that there is no</b> prohibition of <b>building</b> with regard <b>to vessels and no</b> prohibition of <b>dismantling</b> with regard <b>to vessels.</b> Since these shops are not attached to the ground, they are vessels rather than houses, and it is therefore permitted to replace their shutters; <b>and</b> as a result, the dismantlement and replacement of shutters of large vessels, <b>even of</b> those found in <b>houses,</b> should <b>also</b> be permitted. To counter this logic, Ulla therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the reason the Sages allowed the replacement of shutters of shops on a Festival is because they <b>permitted</b> an action <b>whose result</b> is undesirable <b>in order</b> to encourage a desirable <b>initial</b> action. Consequently, in the case of the shutters <b>of shops, yes,</b> they permitted their replacement; in the case of those <b>of houses, no,</b> they did not allow it.
The Gemara further asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the replacement of a bandage in the Temple as well: One may replace a bandage in the Temple but not in</b> the rest of <b>the country.</b> The Gemara explains that this <i>halakha</i> is necessary. <b>Lest you say: What is the reason</b> that a bandage may be replaced? It is <b>because rabbinic decrees prohibiting labor</b> do <b>not</b> apply <b>in the Temple.</b> Since the prohibition against applying a bandage is by rabbinic law, this leniency should apply to all who are in the Temple, <b>even</b> to <b>a priest who is not a candidate</b> to perform the Temple <b>service.</b> Ulla <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case; rather, it is an instance where the Sages <b>permitted a result for the sake of an initial action: If one is a candidate for service, yes,</b> he may replace his bandage; <b>if one is not a candidate for service, no,</b> he may not replace his bandage.
The Gemara asks a similar question with regard to Raḥava’s addition: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who opens his barrel</b> of wine, <b>as well:</b> In the case of <b>one who opens his barrel</b> to sell its wine, and similarly in the case of one who <b>begins</b> selling <b>his dough for the sake of the Festival,</b> the substance is ritually pure. If some is left over, the <i>tanna’im</i> disputed whether it retains its presumed status as ritually pure after the Festival and one may continue to sell it to a <i>ḥaver</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He may finish</b> selling the wine or dough, <b>and the Rabbis say: He may not finish.</b> What is added by including it in the list of matters where a result is permitted for the sake of an initial action?
The Gemara explains: Raḥava’s statement is necessary. <b>Lest you say:</b> It is permitted to finish selling the wine or dough because <b>the Sages rendered the ritual impurity of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> on a Festival as ritually pure, and although one did not begin</b> to sell this wine or dough on the Festival but at an earlier stage, he should <b>likewise</b> be permitted to finish, as items do not contract ritual impurity on a Festival. To counter this logic, Raḥava therefore <b>teaches us:</b> In this case, too, the Sages <b>permitted</b> an action <b>whose result</b> is undesirable <b>in order</b> to encourage a desirable <b>initial</b> action. <b>If one had begun, yes,</b> he may finish selling; <b>if one had not begun, no,</b> he may not do so.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Ulla, what is the reason that he did he not state this</b> <i>halakha</i> alongside the other cases he listed? The Gemara answers: <b>He is not dealing with</b> a case that is a matter of <b>dispute.</b> He listed only cases where the ruling is unanimous. The Gemara challenges this: <b>These</b> other three matters <b>are also</b> subject to <b>dispute,</b> as they all involve a disagreement between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. The Gemara answers: When <b>Beit Shammai</b> express an opinion <b>where Beit Hillel</b> disagree, Beit Shammai’s opinion is not considered a legitimate opinion in the <b>Mishna,</b> and it is completely disregarded. Since everyone knows that Beit Shammai’s opinion is entirely rejected by <i>halakha</i>, it is not taken into consideration. Therefore, those cases are not viewed as disputes at all.
§ The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that one may remove shutters on a Festival. They disagree only</b> as to whether it is permitted <b>to replace</b> them, as well, <b>as Beit Shammai say: One may not replace</b> them, <b>and Beit Hillel say: One may even replace</b> them. <b>And in what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When</b> these shutters <b>have a hinge</b> that can be inserted into a slot in the side of the vessel. <b>However,</b> if <b>they do not have a hinge, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted,</b> as this is merely replacement of a board, and it is not similar to building.
The Gemara challenges this claim: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> What is the situation in which Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree? They disagree <b>when</b> the shutters <b>do not have a hinge; however, if they have a hinge, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>prohibited. Abaye said</b> that the two sources can be reconciled: <b>When they have a hinge on the side, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>prohibited,</b> as the placement of a hinge in the side is a complicated endeavor that resembles building. If <b>they have no hinge at all, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted,</b> as it is considered merely the replacement of a board. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to a case <b>where they have a hinge in the middle</b> rather than on the side.

Daf 12a

One <b>Sage,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that <b>we issue a decree</b> and prohibit <b>a hinge in the middle due to a hinge on the side; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not issue</b> this <b>decree.</b> Since placing a hinge of this type does not constitute the prohibited labor of building, it is permitted.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may carry out</b> on a Festival <b>neither a minor</b> child, <b>nor a <i>lulav</i>, nor a Torah Scroll into the public domain,</b> as none of these are required for the preparation of food; <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The <i>tanna</i></b> who reviews <i>mishnayot</i> <b>teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: One who slaughters a gift offering on a Festival is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition: “No manner of work shall be done on them” (Exodus 12:16). Since this slaughtering was not performed for the purpose of eating, the action constitutes a prohibited labor on a Festival.
Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <b>said to</b> that <i>tanna</i>: <b>Who</b> could have <b>said</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to you? It is</b> evidently in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say</b> that <b>we do not say: Since carrying out was permitted</b> on a Festival <b>for the purpose</b> of food preparation, it <b>was also permitted not for that purpose. For if you say</b> the <i>baraita</i> is accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, they say: Since carrying out was permitted for the requirements</b> of food preparation, <b>it was also permitted not for</b> these <b>requirements. Here, too,</b> with regard to the prohibited labor of slaughtering, <b>since slaughter was permitted for the requirements</b> of food preparation, <b>it was also permitted not for</b> these <b>requirements.</b> It was permitted for any purpose that benefits people, whether directly or indirectly.
<b>Rabba strongly objects to this</b> reasoning: <b>From where</b> do you infer <b>that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree over this</b> issue? <b>Perhaps they disagree</b> about the following: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i> and</b> the prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to Shabbat,</b> but <b>there are no</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i> nor</b> a prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> on a Festival.
The Gemara clarifies the dispute according to this explanation: One <b>Sage,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> and the prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to Shabbat, and</b> similarly the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> and <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to a Festival.</b> The only difference is that, on a Festival, carrying, like other types of prohibited labor, is permitted for the sake of food preparation.
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> and the prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to Shabbat,</b> but <b>there are no</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> nor a prohibition against <b>carrying out on a Festival, as it is written: “Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Shabbat day”</b> (Jeremiah 17:22), from which Beit Hillel inferred: <b>On Shabbat, yes,</b> carrying from one domain to another is indeed prohibited; <b>on a Festival, no,</b> it is not prohibited. According to this explanation, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about whether a prohibited labor that is permitted for the purpose of food preparation on a Festival is also permitted when it does not serve that purpose.
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> explanation of Rabba: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the dispute is whether the prohibition against carrying out applies on a Festival, Beit Hillel should permit one to move <i>muktze</i> objects, as the prohibition of handling <i>muktze</i> is an extension of the prohibition against carrying out. Consequently, <b>let them differ with regard to</b> whether or not it is permitted to carry out <b>stones</b> on a Festival. <b>Rather, from</b> the fact that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>do not disagree with regard to stones</b> but concerning objects that serve some sort of purpose, <b>conclude from this:</b> Everyone agrees that carrying out is prohibited on a Festival, and the Torah permitted it only when it is necessary for sustenance.
Instead, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to carrying out</b> that is <b>not for the purpose</b> of food preparation. According to the opinion of Beit Hillel, since carrying out is permitted for the sake of sustenance, it is entirely permitted. According to Beit Shammai, the Sages permitted only labor that serves the purpose of food preparation.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the principle: <b>Since carrying out is permitted</b> on a Festival <b>for the purpose</b> of food preparation, it <b>was also permitted not for</b> this <b>purpose,</b> as <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: One who cooks the sciatic nerve in milk on a Festival and eats it is flogged</b> for violating <b>five</b> distinct prohibitions.
How so? (1) <b>He is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>cooking</b> the sciatic <b>nerve,</b> which is prohibited because the sciatic nerve is unfit for consumption; (2) <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> the sciatic <b>nerve,</b> which is explicitly prohibited by the Torah; (3) <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>cooking meat in milk;</b> (4) <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating meat</b> cooked <b>in milk;</b> (5) <b>and</b> lastly, <b>he is flogged</b>

Daf 12b

<b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b>kindling</b> a fire on a Festival.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> that <i>tanna</i>: <b>Leave and teach it outside,</b> i.e., this <i>baraita</i> is not fit for discussion in the study hall. The opinion that there is a prohibition against <b>kindling and cooking</b> on a Festival <b>is not a mishna</b> worthy of serious consideration. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it is a mishna</b> rather than an error, this statement is still not in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>it is</b> following the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say: We do not say: Since carrying out was permitted</b> on a Festival <b>for the purposes</b> of food preparation, it <b>was also permitted</b> when performed <b>not for</b> these <b>purposes. Here, too,</b> we do <b>not</b> say: <b>Since kindling was permitted</b> on a Festival <b>for the purposes</b> of food preparation, <b>it was also permitted</b> when performed <b>not for</b> these <b>purposes.</b>
The Gemara explains why the <i>baraita</i> cannot be attributed to Beit Hillel. <b>If</b> one were to suggest that this <i>baraita</i> follows the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> this cannot be the case, <b>as they say: Since carrying out was permitted for the purposes</b> of food preparation, <b>it was also permitted</b> when performed <b>not for</b> these <b>purposes. Here, too, since kindling was permitted for</b> the <b>purposes</b> of food preparation, <b>it was also permitted</b> when performed <b>not for</b> these <b>purposes.</b> Therefore, according to the opinion of Beit Hillel, kindling cannot be included amongst those prohibitions for which one is liable on a Festival.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The separation of <i>ḥalla</i> is permitted on a Festival, as one is permitted to prepare dough and bake it on a Festival, and bread may not be eaten without first separating <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bring</b> separated <b><i>ḥalla</i> or</b> any of the other priestly <b>gifts,</b> i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw of a slaughtered animal, <b>to a priest on a Festival,</b> though it is permitted to separate them from an animal slaughtered on a Festival. This is prohibited regardless of <b>whether they were separated last evening,</b> i.e., before the Festival, <b>or whether they were separated today. And Beit Hillel permit</b> it.
<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel: This <i>halakha</i> can be derived by <b>an analogy: <i>Ḥalla</i> and</b> the other <b>gifts</b> are both considered <b>a gift to the priest, and</b> likewise <b><i>teruma</i></b> separated from produce is also <b>a gift to the priest. Just as</b> you agree <b>that one may not bring <i>teruma</i></b> to a priest on a Festival, <b>so too, one may not bring the</b> other <b>gifts.</b>
<b>Beit Hillel said to them: No,</b> this analogy is incorrect. <b>If you said</b> that you derive the halakha from <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> where <b>its separation is not allowed</b> on the Festival, how <b>will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the gifts</b> from an animal or <i>ḥalla</i>, concerning <b>which their separation is allowed</b> on the Festival? Since it is not prohibited to separate these gifts, they may likewise be brought to a priest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It enters your mind</b> to explain <b>that</b> when the mishna states: <b>They were separated today,</b> it means: From animals <b>slaughtered today. And</b> the phrase: <b>They were separated last evening,</b> is referring to animals <b>slaughtered last evening.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>whose opinion is</b> expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not Rabbi Yosei nor Rabbi Yehuda, but</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not dispute with regard to gifts separated on the eve of a Festival, that one may bring</b> them to a priest on a Festival day itself along <b>with gifts separated that day and</b> from <b>those</b> animals <b>slaughtered that day. They disputed only</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of bringing</b> gifts separated the day before <b>by themselves, as Beit Shammai say: One may not bring</b> these gifts by themselves, <b>and Beit Hillel say: One may bring</b> them.
<b>And Beit Shammai would reason as follows: <i>Ḥalla</i> and gifts</b> from a slaughtered animal are <b>a gift to the priest, and <i>teruma</i></b> is <b>a gift to the priest. Just as one may not bring <i>teruma</i></b> to a priest on a Festival, <b>so too, one may not bring the</b> other <b>gifts. Beit Hillel said to them: No,</b> granted, <b>if you said</b> so <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>,</b> the reason is <b>that separation is not allowed</b> on a Festival, but how <b>will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the</b> other <b>gifts,</b> concerning <b>which separation is allowed</b> on the Festival? It is therefore permitted to bring these gifts to a priest as well. This is Rabbi Yehuda’s interpretation of the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, according to which Beit Shammai prohibit bringing even gifts separated on the Festival itself.
<b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> That is not the correct record of the dispute, as <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not dispute about</b> the fact <b>that one may bring the gifts</b> from an animal to a priest on a Festival. <b>They disputed only with regard to <i>teruma</i>, as Beit Shammai say: One may not bring</b> it, <b>and Beit Hillel say: One may</b> even <b>bring</b> <i>teruma</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel would reason</b> as follows: <b><i>Ḥalla</i> and gifts</b> are <b>a gift to the priest, and <i>teruma</i></b> is <b>a gift to the priest. Just as one may bring the</b> other <b>gifts</b> on a Festival, <b>so too, one may bring <i>teruma</i>. Beit Shammai said to them: No; if you said</b> so <b>with regard to the</b> other <b>gifts,</b> concerning <b>which their separation is allowed</b> on the Festival, <b>will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, whose separation is not allowed?</b>
<b><i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> that the dispute was as follows: <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not dispute with regard to <i>teruma</i>, that one may not bring</b> it to a priest on a Festival. <b>They disputed only</b> the case <b>of the</b> other <b>gifts, as Beit Shammai say: One may not bring</b> the other gifts, <b>and Beit Hillel say: One may bring</b> them. The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> only in accordance with the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>, and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara does not even suggest that the mishna might be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as it is clear that it cannot be reconciled with his explanation.
<b>Rava said: Is it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>They were separated that day and were slaughtered that day?</b> No; <b>it teaches: They were separated, and actually</b> the mishna should be explained as follows: <b>They were slaughtered last evening</b> and separated today, which is exactly what Rabbi Yehuda said. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>,</b> it can still be claimed that, in their opinion, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disputed the case <b>of these</b> animals that <b>were slaughtered last evening,</b> not those slaughtered on the Festival.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> the same opinion as that of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> What, then, is the difference between the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and <i>Aḥerim</i>? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>secondary</b> gifts. If one has gifts separated before a Festival, is he permitted to join them as secondary gifts along with others separated on the Festival and transport them together to a priest? Rabbi Yehuda maintains that secondary gifts may be brought to a priest, according to the opinion of Beit Hillel, whereas <i>Aḥerim</i> prohibit it.
With regard to the dispute cited in the <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Tovi, son of Rabbi Neḥemya, had a bottle of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>wine. He came before Rav Yosef</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>bringing</b> this wine <b>to a priest now,</b> on a Festival? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: That is what Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who maintains that Beit Hillel permit one to bring <i>teruma</i> to a priest on a Festival, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with their opinion.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>The host of Rava, son of Rav Ḥanan, had bundles of</b> unprocessed <b>mustard,</b> whose seeds remained in their stems. <b>He said</b> to his guest, the Sage: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to crushing</b> these mustard stalks <b>and eating from them on a Festival?</b> Rava, son of Rav Ḥanan, <b>did not have</b> an answer readily available, so he <b>came before Rava</b> to ask his opinion. Rava <b>said to him</b> that it was taught: <b>One may husk kernels</b> by rubbing them between one’s fingers, <b>and one may</b> likewise <b>crush legumes on a Festival.</b> This statement indicates that it is permitted to crush mustard stalks.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who husks kernels</b> of grain <b>on Shabbat eve, on the following day,</b> on Shabbat itself, <b>he may winnow</b> the chaff in an irregular manner by passing the kernels <b>from hand to hand and</b> then <b>eat</b> them. <b>However, one may not</b> do so, <b>neither by</b> means of <b>a basket [<i>kanon</i>]</b> that is occasionally used for sorting and separating the chaff <b>nor with a large vessel.</b>
With regard to <b>one who husks kernels</b> of grain <b>on a Festival eve, on the following day, he may winnow a little</b> grain <b>at a time and eat, even with a tray or a large vessel. However, he may not</b> do so <b>with a tablet, nor with a winnow, nor with a sieve.</b> Since these vessels are designed for winnowing, they are used only for large quantities, and therefore it will appear as though he were preparing for after the Festival, which is certainly prohibited. In any case, the wording of the <i>baraita</i> indicates: <b>On a Festival eve, yes,</b> one may husk or crush legumes; <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>no,</b> it is prohibited to do so.
The Gemara refutes this: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is permitted <b>on a Festival,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be understood. The reason is as follows: <b>Since he taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Shabbat eve,</b> as husking grain may not be performed on Shabbat itself, for it might lead to a prohibited labor on Shabbat, <b>he also taught in the latter clause: On a Festival eve.</b> However, this does not mean that rubbing or crushing legumes is prohibited on the Festival itself.
Abaye raises a difficulty against the opinion of Rava from a different angle: <b>If</b> you say <b>so, we</b> have thereby <b>found</b> a case of <b><i>teruma</i> for which separation is allowed</b> on a Festival. Before being rubbed, the grains of wheat were certainly not fit to be eaten, and therefore there was no obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> from them. Now that one has prepared them as food by rubbing them, he is obligated to separate <i>teruma</i> from them, and if one is permitted to eat them, he must be permitted to separate <i>teruma</i> from them first. <b>And we learned</b> explicitly in the mishna: <b>No, if you said</b> that you derive the halakha from <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> where <b>its separation is not allowed</b> on the Festival. This statement indicates that even Beit Hillel agree that one may not separate <i>teruma</i> of any kind on a Festival.
The Gemara refutes this challenge: This is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 13a

<b>This</b> source, the <i>baraita</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that one must separate <i>teruma</i> from kernels of grain on the stalk, and one may separate <i>terumot</i> on a Festival. <b>That</b> source, the mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that there is no need to separate <i>teruma</i> from kernels of grain on the stalk, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>brought inside</b> his house <b>stalks</b> of grain in order to grind them into flour and <b>to make dough from them, he may eat from them, as a snack,</b> before they are ground, <b>and he is exempt</b> from <i>teruma</i>. Provided that the grain has not yet been fully processed, the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> does not apply. The Sages decreed that such produce may only be consumed casually and not as part of a regular meal.
However, if from the outset one brought in the stalks of grain not to grind them but <b>to husk the kernels</b> and eat them a little at a time, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>obligates</b> him to separate <i>teruma</i> from them and prohibits him from partaking of the grain until he has done so. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, exempts</b> him from the obligation of <i>teruma</i>. He maintains that not even this intention renders one obligated to separate <i>teruma</i>, as the obligation for <i>teruma</i> applies only to fully processed grain.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> you can <b>also find</b> a case when one must separate <i>teruma</i> from grain that has not been fully processed. How so? <b>For example, if one brought inside</b> his house <b>stalks of grain to make dough from them,</b> thereby rendering himself obligated to separate <i>teruma</i> from them, <b>and he reconsidered</b> and decided <b>to husk them</b> in order to eat the kernels <b>on a Festival.</b> In <b>that</b> case, the prohibition of <b>untithed</b> produce takes effect <b>on that day</b> and one is obligated to separate <i>teruma</i>, only afterward is he permitted to eat the kernels.
<b>Rather,</b> one must say: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>teruma</i></b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree may not be separated on a Festival? It is referring to <b>most <i>teruma</i>,</b> e.g., grain that has been threshed and gathered into piles on the eve of the Festival. They do, however, admit that there are exceptional cases in which one may separate <i>teruma</i> on a Festival.
<b>Abaye said:</b> This <b>dispute,</b> concerning when the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> and the prohibition of untithed produce takes effect, is referring only <b>to stalks</b> of grain, which are typically brought into a granary, where they are processed in a standard manner. Until that point, the grain is not prohibited as untithed produce. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>legumes, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>bundles</b> are already regarded as <b>untithed produce,</b> and <i>teruma</i> must be separated from them at that stage.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> the following mishna <b>supports him</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 10:6): With regard to <b>one who had bundles of fenugreek,</b> a type of legume, <b>of untithed produce, he may pound</b> these bundles to remove the seeds from them. <b>And he calculates how many seeds</b> the bundles <b>contain and separates <i>teruma</i></b> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>seeds, but</b> he <b>does not</b> calculate and <b>separate</b> <i>teruma</i> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>stalks.</b> Although the stalks and leaves are also used for cooking, it is not necessary to separate <i>teruma</i> from them. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who said: There,</b> with regard to stalks of grain, it is <b>not</b> yet ready to be tithed, and therefore not prohibited as <b>untithed produce,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> i.e., with regard to the bundles of fenugreek, it is ready to be tithed and therefore prohibited as <b>untithed produce?</b>
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No,</b> this is no proof, as it can be claimed that the mishna dealing with fenugreek <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who obligates one to separate <i>teruma</i> in the case of stalks of grain. The Gemara challenges this: <b>If it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, what novel element does the mishna provide? <b>Why specifically</b> discuss <b>fenugreek?</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the same <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even to stalks</b> of grain <b>as well.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rather, what</b> then? Is the mishna in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> If so, <b>let him teach us</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>other types of legumes,</b> i.e., that they have the status of untithed produce when placed in bundles. <b>And all the more so</b> this would apply to <b>fenugreek,</b> which is eaten only in small quantities and is not processed in the manner of grain.
<b>Rather,</b> it cannot be proven that the mishna follows either the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, or that of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as it <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to state the case of <b>fenugreek</b> for a different reason: It could <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> in the case of fenugreek <b>the taste of its stalk and its fruit</b> are <b>identical,</b> as the branches of the fenugreek add flavor to a dish, perhaps one should <b>also separate</b> <i>teruma</i> based <b>on</b> the quantity of fenugreek <b>stalks,</b> as well. The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that there is no obligation to do so, and this is the novel element of his statement.
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Abaye said</b> the following: This <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring <b>to stalks</b> of grain; <b>however,</b> with regard to <b>legumes, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>bundles</b> are not yet ready to be tithed and are therefore <b>not</b> prohibited as <b>untithed produce.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this: With regard to <b>one who had bundles of fenugreek of untithed produce, he may pound</b> them <b>and calculate how many seeds they contain and separate <i>teruma</i></b> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>seeds, but he does not separate</b> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>stalks. What, is this not</b> referring to the normal case of <b>untithed produce of <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., produce from which the regular <i>teruma</i>, the initial portion taken from produce as the priests’ portion, must be separated?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a different case, that of first tithe that is still regarded as <b>untithed produce,</b> because <b>of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe</b> that must still be separated from it. First tithe is given to the Levites, who must separate ten percent as <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, to give to the priests. Before <i>teruma</i> of the tithe is separated, the first tithe may not be eaten.
<b>And</b> this statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>that Rabbi Abbahu</b> said that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> It can occur that a Levite might take the <b>first tithe before</b> the <i>teruma</i> is separated, <b>while</b> the grain is still <b>on the stalks.</b> The correct procedure is: After collecting the grain in a pile in the granary, one first separates <i>teruma</i>, and only afterward separates first tithe to give to the Levites.
If this order was not followed, and the first tithe was separated first while the grain was still attached to the stalks, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish maintains that the following <i>halakha</i> applies: <b>Its name,</b> i.e., the fact that it has been designated first tithe, <b>renders it</b> ready to be tithed and therefore prohibited as <b>untithed produce,</b> as pertains <b>to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe</b> that must still be separated from it. This shows that there can be a separation of a type of <i>teruma</i>, specifically the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, even before work on the produce has been completed, and this is the case to which the previously quoted mishna is referring.
The Gemara challenges this interpretation: If first tithe is considered untithed produce when it is named, <b>why do I</b> need the act of <b>pounding? Let</b> the Levite <b>say to</b> the priest: <b>As they gave to me</b> stalks of grain, or unprepared bundles, <b>so I am giving</b> them <b>to you</b> in the same state. <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>a penalty.</b> In other words, the Levite should indeed be entitled to issue this claim; however, as he acted improperly by taking his tithe prematurely, the Sages decreed that he may not separate the priest’s portion in its current state, but must first improve it.
The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. With regard to <b>a Levite who was given stalks</b> of grain <b>as his tithes, he renders them</b> into <b>a granary,</b> i.e., he must thresh and process them in the usual manner. Similarly, if he was given <b>grapes, he renders them wine;</b> if he was given <b>olives, he renders them oil; and</b> afterward he <b>separates <i>teruma</i> of the tithe for them and gives them to a priest. For just as <i>teruma gedola</i>,</b> i.e., standard <i>teruma</i>, <b>is not separated</b> from unprocessed produce,

Daf 13b

<b>but only from the granary and the winepress, so too, <i>teruma</i> of the tithe is separated only from the granary and the winepress.</b>
The Gemara asks: If the mishna is referring to produce from which <i>teruma gedola</i> has not been separated, it is appropriate to use the term: Calculates. However, according to the suggestion that it is referring to a first tithe, from which <i>teruma</i> of the tithe must be separated, why does the mishna state: <b>Calculates?</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>should have said: Measures.</b> The amount of <i>teruma gedola</i> to be separated is calculated by estimation, as there is no fixed amount for this <i>teruma</i> according to Torah law. With regard to the <i>teruma</i> separated from first tithe, however, the Torah established the fixed amount of one-tenth, and one is required to measure precisely.
The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Elazar ben Gimmel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Elazar ben Gimmel says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And your <i>teruma</i> shall be reckoned to you</b> as though it were the corn of the granary and as the fullness of the winepress” (Numbers 18:27). <b>The verse speaks of two <i>terumot</i>. One</b> is <b><i>teruma gedola</i>, and</b> the other <b>one is <i>teruma</i> of the tithe. Just as <i>teruma gedola</i> is separated by estimation</b> and is not measured exactly, <b>and</b> it is enough to separate it <b>by thought,</b> as the word “reckoned” implies that the mere intention to separate a particular portion serves to remove the rest of the produce from its untithed state, <b>so too, <i>teruma</i> of the tithe</b> can also <b>be separated by estimation and by thought.</b>
§ Since it was mentioned incidentally, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> With regard to <b>first tithe, in a case in which</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks, its name renders it untithed produce,</b> until he separates from it the <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava said: Since the name of</b> the first <b>tithe was called upon it,</b> the obligation of the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe takes effect as well.
The Gemara cites a similar <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> With regard to <b>first tithe, in a case in which</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks,</b> before it was threshed and turned into a pile, the owner separated first tithe before <i>teruma</i>. In that case, the separated tithe is <b>exempt from <i>teruma gedola</i>.</b> Although <i>teruma gedola</i> should have been separated from the produce first, and it should have included some of the produce taken as the first tithe, the Levite is nevertheless exempt from separating this <i>teruma</i>.
This is because <b>it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a <i>teruma</i> for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe”</b> (Numbers 18:26), which indicates: <b>A tenth part of the tithe,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>I,</b> God, <b>said to you</b> that you must separate it, <b>and</b> you are <b>not</b> obligated in both <b><i>teruma gedola</i> and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe from the</b> first <b>tithe.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so,</b> if there is a source for this <i>halakha</i> in the Torah, <b>even if</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest, i.e., first tithe was separated after the grain had been threshed and the kernels of grain placed <b>in a pile,</b> then it should <b>also be exempt</b> from <i>teruma gedola</i>. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states: “From all that is given you, you shall set apart that which is the Lord’s <i>teruma</i>”</b> (Numbers 18:29). This verse indicates that God’s <i>teruma</i>, i.e., <i>teruma gedola</i>, must be taken from all the produce, including the tithe.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to require the separation of <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that was taken from processed grain piled in the granary but not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <b>This,</b> grain that has been threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that,</b> grain that remains on the stalk, <b>has not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> Until the grain is threshed and assembled in a pile, the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> does not take effect, as it is not considered grain. When such unprocessed grain is designated first tithe, it ceases to be untithed produce and the opportunity to separate <i>teruma</i> from it has been missed. However, once the grain has been processed, and the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> has taken effect, it is as if the <i>teruma</i> is already mixed in, and the obligation to separate it cannot be overridden by the fact that this produce has been designated first tithe.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 4:5): <b>One who peels</b> grains of <b>barley</b> to eat them raw <b>may peel them one</b> by <b>one and eat them</b> immediately without tithing them, as this is considered a casual manner of eating. <b>But if he peeled and placed</b> several of them <b>into his hand, he is obligated</b> to separate tithes. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: And a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to Shabbat.</b> Peeling grains of barley one by one is not considered threshing, and it is permitted; if a whole handful of grains are peeled together, this does constitute the prohibited labor of threshing.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav’s wife peel for him</b> barley on Shabbat <b>by the cupful? And</b> likewise <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya’s wife</b> would <b>peel</b> barley <b>for him</b> on Shabbat <b>by the cupful. Rather, if</b> Rabbi Elazar’s comment <b>was stated</b> in this context, <b>it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of that same mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 4:5): With regard to <b>one who husks kernels of wheat</b> by hand, <b>he may blow</b> onto the chaff to disperse it <b>a little at a time and eat</b> the kernels without separating tithes. <b>But if he blows</b> on the kernels <b>and puts</b> a large amount of them <b>into his lap,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to separate tithes from the food. It was with regard to this teaching that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: And a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to Shabbat.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel strongly objects to this: And</b> with regard to <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, one should conclude: <b>Yes,</b> if one peeled a handful of barley, it is considered prepared <b>with regard to tithes,</b> but <b>no,</b> it is not considered threshing <b>with regard to Shabbat? But is there anything</b> that, <b>with regard to Shabbat, is not</b> considered the <b>completion of the labor</b> and may be performed; <b>and</b> yet, <b>with regard to tithes, it is</b> considered the <b>completion of the labor?</b> Isn’t the prohibition against work on Shabbat far more stringent than tithes in all its details?
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, strongly objects to this</b> claim: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> example of a <i>halakha</i> in which tithes are treated more stringently than Shabbat? <b>And is</b> there not the <i>halakha</i> of <b>their granary for tithes, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:5): <b>What is</b> the equivalent of <b>their granary,</b> i.e., the point at which the processing of various vegetables is completed so that they become obligated <b>in tithes?</b> With regard to <b>cucumbers and gourds,</b> they become obligated <b>from when one trims</b> the thin hairs that cover them <b>[<i>misheyefaksu</i>], and</b> for those <b>he did not trim, from when he assembles them in a pile. And we also learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:6), <b>with regard to onions,</b> that it is <b>from when one assembles them in a pile. Whereas with regard to Shabbat,</b> one who <b>assembles</b> produce <b>in a pile is exempt,</b> as this is not a prohibited labor on Shabbat.
<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> Why is one exempt if he forms a pile on Shabbat? <b>The Torah prohibited</b> only <b>planned,</b> constructive <b>labor</b> on Shabbat, the type of work that involves the creation of something new, and the formation of a pile is not considered that kind of labor. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to peeling barley, <b>the Torah prohibited creative work.</b> Although collecting the peeled barley in one’s hand is considered the completion of the labor in respect to tithes, it is not prohibited labor on Shabbat.
Apropos husking kernels on Shabbat, the Gemara asks: <b>How may one husk</b> grain on a Festival? <b>Abaye said in the name of Rav Yosef: One</b> finger <b>on another,</b> i.e., one may place the kernels between two fingers and rub. <b>And Rav Avya said in the name of Rav Yosef:</b> One may even do so <b>one on two,</b> i.e., between the thumb and two fingers. <b>Rava said: Since he alters</b> the manner in which he performs the activity, <b>he may even</b> do so with <b>one</b> finger <b>on all</b> the rest.
The Gemara further asks: <b>How</b> may one <b>blow</b> on the grain, to winnow it in a permitted manner on Shabbat? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that <b>Rav said: One blows</b>

Daf 14a

<b>from the joints of his fingers and above,</b> i.e., he does not place the kernels mixed with chaff in his palm but on his fingers, which is an unusual way to hold them.
<b>They laughed at this</b> explanation <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, saying: <b>Since he alters</b> his behavior from the usual method, doing so <b>even with</b> his <b>entire hand</b> should be permitted <b>as well. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as <b>Rav Elazar said: One may blow</b> while holding the grain <b>with one hand</b> but not two, <b>and</b> he may even do so <b>with all his strength,</b> as this is not considered similar to a prohibited labor at all.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: Spices may be pounded</b> on a Festival in a slightly unusual manner, <b>with a wooden pestle, and salt</b> may be pounded only <b>with</b> an earthenware <b>flask or with a wooden pot ladle,</b> in a manner very different from that of a weekday. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Spices may be pounded in their</b> usual <b>manner,</b> even <b>with a stone pestle, and</b> as for <b>salt,</b> although it must be pounded in an irregular manner, a slight modification such as pounding it <b>with a wooden pestle</b> is enough to render the act permitted.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>In any event, everyone,</b> both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>agrees</b> that the pounding of <b>salt requires a change;</b> it may not be performed in the regular weekday manner. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> disputed this issue. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> Everyone knows that <b>all dishes require salt,</b> and therefore one should prepare salt the day before the Festival. Since he failed to do so, this task may be performed on the Festival only in an unusual manner. <b>But not all dishes require spices,</b> and therefore it is possible that on the day prior to the Festival, one was not aware that he would require spices on the Festival.
<b>And</b> the other <b>one said</b> a different reason: <b>All spices lose their flavor</b> and cannot be prepared ahead of time, <b>and salt does not lose its flavor,</b> which means one could have prepared it the day before. Since he neglected to do so, he may prepare salt on the Festival only in an unusual manner.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical <b>difference between</b> these two reasons? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them is</b> in a case <b>where one knew</b> beforehand <b>which</b> type of <b>dish he wants to cook</b> on the Festival. Since he knew which spices he would require, he could have prepared them the day before, in which case spices are no different from salt, and one should be required to prepare them in an unusual manner. However, if the reason is that spices lose their flavor, the fact that he knew which dishes he planned to prepare is of no relevance. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a practical difference in the case <b>of saffron,</b> whose flavor does not dissipate over the course of a single day. Consequently, one who knows what dish he will prepare on the Festival could have prepared the saffron the day before.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: All</b> foods <b>that must be pounded</b> before being eaten may be <b>pounded in their</b> usual <b>manner, and</b> this applies <b>even</b> to <b>salt.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that everyone agrees that <b>salt requires a change</b> in its manner of preparation? The Gemara answers: He <b>said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree in</b> the case of foods <b>that are</b> regularly <b>pounded.</b> They both maintain <b>that they may be pounded in their</b> usual <b>manner, and salt</b> can be pounded together <b>with them.</b>
<b>They disagreed only</b> about whether it is permitted <b>to pound</b> salt <b>by itself, as Beit Shammai say: Salt may be</b> pounded <b>with a flask and with a wooden pot ladle for roasting,</b> i.e., in small quantities, as one does not require much salt for roasting meat, <b>but</b> it may <b>not</b> be pounded in the large quantities required to salt meat <b>for</b> a cooked <b>pot. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It may be pounded <b>by anything.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this last statement: <b>By anything? Can this enter your mind?</b> How can Beit Hillel say that one may pound salt in any manner, when it has been established that everyone agrees that this may be performed only in an unusual manner? <b>Rather, say:</b> Salt may be pounded <b>for anything,</b> whether it is a small quantity for roasting or a large quantity for salting meat.
<b>Rav Aḥa Bardela said to his son: When you pound</b> salt, <b>tilt it</b> a little <b>to the side and</b> then <b>pound,</b> so that it will at least be performed in a slightly different manner on a Festival. The Gemara similarly relates: <b>Rav Sheshet heard the sound of a pestle</b> pounding salt on a Festival. <b>He said</b> to himself: <b>This</b> sound <b>is not</b> coming <b>from inside my house,</b> as I have instructed the members of my household not to do so.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps they tilted it</b> and pounded in a permitted manner? The Gemara answers: This could not have been the case, <b>as</b> Rav Sheshet <b>heard that it was a clear sound,</b> unlike the one produced when a pestle is tilted. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps they were</b> pounding <b>spices,</b> which may be pounded in the regular fashion on a Festival? The Gemara answers: <b>The sound</b> produced by pounding <b>spices</b> is distinctive, <b>like a bark,</b> which he would have recognized.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On a Festival <b>one may not prepare groats [<i>tisanei</i>],</b> a dish comprised of grains of wheat crushed into quarters, which involves great effort, <b>nor may one grind</b> grain <b>with a mortar and pestle.</b> The Gemara expresses puzzlement: These are <b>two</b> contradictory rulings. The <i>tanna</i> first stated that groats alone may not be prepared, as this involves hard work, implying that other items may be ground. He subsequently states that one may not grind with a mortar and pestle at all. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what he said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> should be amended to read as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>one may not prepare groats? Because one may not grind with a mortar and pestle.</b>
<b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> simply <b>say: One may not grind with a mortar and pestle,</b> from which it can be inferred that groats may not be prepared. The Gemara explains that <b>if he teaches</b> only: <b>One may not grind with a mortar and pestle, I would have said</b> that <b>this applies only to a large mortar and pestle,</b> whose use has the appearance of a weekday activity; <b>but with a small mortar and pestle,</b> one might <b>say it seems well,</b> and one may prepare even groats with this mortar and pestle. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that groats may not be prepared in any manner.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one may not grind with a large mortar and pestle, but one may grind with a small mortar and pestle? Abaye said: Also, when</b> the first <b><i>baraita</i> was taught, it was taught</b> with regard to <b>a large mortar and pestle,</b> not a small one. In other words, the <i>baraita</i> is stating two <i>halakhot</i>, not one, as claimed previously. The <i>tanna</i> first rules that one may not prepare groats even with a small mortar and pestle, and he subsequently states that one may not use a large mortar and pestle for any purpose.

Daf 14b

<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult;</b> the <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict one another. <b>This</b> ruling, which permits a small mortar and pestle, <b>is for us,</b> the residents of Babylonia, who do not have servants, <b>and that</b> statement <b>is for them,</b> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, who have many servants. Since servants might treat the prohibition lightly, by using a large mortar and pestle and claiming they had used only a small one, they are prohibited from pounding in all cases.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappi happened to come</b> on a Festival <b>to the house</b> of <b>Mar Shmuel. He brought to him porridge,</b> made from wheat groats, <b>but he did not eat</b> it, out of concern that the wheat might have been pounded on the same day. The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps they performed</b> the pounding <b>with a small mortar and pestle,</b> in a permitted manner? The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, <b>as he observed that it was well ground,</b> which cannot be achieved by means of a small mortar and pestle.
The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps they prepared it the day before,</b> on the Festival eve? The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, <b>as he observed that the husks</b> of the groats <b>were bright,</b> an indication that they had been prepared recently. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he refrained from eating for another reason, because <b>the house</b> of <b>Mar Shmuel is different, as</b> he had slaves, and <b>slaves</b> are <b>lax</b> with regard to prohibitions. Therefore, Mar Shmuel ought to have prohibited all forms of grinding in his house, to ensure that no one grind anything in an inappropriate manner.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who selects legumes on a Festival</b> by separating the edible and inedible portions, <b>Beit Shammai say: He may select food and eat</b> it immediately, while leaving the refuse. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may select in his</b> usual <b>manner, in his lap, with a tray, or with a large vessel, but he may not</b> do so <b>with a tablet, nor with a winnow, nor with a sieve,</b> as these vessels are specially designed for selecting, which gives his action the appearance of a weekday activity. <b>Rabban Gamliel says: One may even wash</b> the legumes in water <b>and skim off</b> the refuse floating on top.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Under what circumstances did Beit Hillel permit the removal of the refuse in the weekday manner of selecting? In a case <b>where the</b> quantity of the <b>food is greater than the</b> quantity of the <b>refuse. However, if</b> the quantity of <b>refuse is greater than the</b> quantity of <b>food, everyone agrees</b> that <b>one must remove the food and leave the refuse.</b>
The Gemara asks: If the quantity of <b>refuse is greater than the</b> quantity of <b>food, is there an opinion that permits</b> it? Since the smaller amount of food is nullified by the refuse, the entire mixture is considered <i>muktze</i> and may not be moved. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the removal of the refuse <b>is greater in</b> terms of <b>effort, and</b> yet it is <b>smaller in size.</b> In other words, there is actually more food than refuse, but since greater effort is required to remove the refuse, it is preferable to remove the food.
The mishna taught that <b>Rabban Gamliel says: One may even wash</b> the legumes in water <b>and skim off</b> the refuse floating on top. <b>It is taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Beitza</i> 1): <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: This was the custom of the house of Rabban Gamliel, that they would bring a bucket full with lentils and pour water in it, and then</b> the <b>food</b> would sink <b>down and the refuse</b> would float <b>up,</b> which spared them from having to separate the lentils from the refuse manually.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t the opposite taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>, that the food rose to the top while the refuse sunk below? The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says the refuse sinks down, is referring <b>to</b> refuse in the form of <b>earth,</b> which sinks below the lentils; <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, where it is stated that the refuse rises, speaks <b>of straw,</b> which floats on water.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may send only portions</b> of prepared food <b>on a Festival,</b> but not any other gifts. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may</b> even <b>send</b> gifts of <b>domesticated animals, undomesticated animals, and fowl, whether alive or slaughtered.</b> Similarly, <b>one may send wines, oils, and</b> vessels of <b>flour, and</b> even <b>legumes, but not grain,</b> which is unfit for use, as one may not grind it on the Festival. <b>And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> sending gifts even in the case <b>of grain,</b> as it can be made into porridge without being ground.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yeḥiel teaches: And</b> one may send these items <b>provided that he does not do it by</b> means of <b>a convoy</b> of people, as they would look as though they were transporting merchandise to the marketplace. It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A convoy</b> consists of <b>no less than three people;</b> if there are fewer than three, it is not called a convoy and is permitted. <b>Rav Ashi raised a dilemma:</b> In a case of <b>three people and three</b> different <b>types</b> of food, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered a convoy, or does the fact that there are three different types of food mean that each of them is considered a separate item? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved, as no answer was found.
The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon permits</b> the sending <b>of grain. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon permits</b> the sending <b>of grain, for example: Wheat to prepare from it <i>ludiyot</i>,</b> a type of cookie; <b>barley to place before his animal;</b> or <b>lentils to prepare from them <i>resisin</i>,</b> a dish made from crushed lentils.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may send clothes, whether</b> they are <b>sewn or whether they are unsewn, and even if they contain diverse kinds,</b> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen [<i>sha’atnez</i>]. <b>But</b> one may do so only if <b>they</b> serve <b>the purposes of the Festival. However, one may not</b> send <b>a spiked sandal,</b> which has nails fixed to it, as the Sages decreed that one may not wear a sandal of this kind on a Shabbat or Festival, <b>nor an unsewn shoe,</b> which is not suitable for a Festival. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even</b> send <b>a white shoe,</b> which people do not usually wear, <b>because</b> it <b>requires an artisan</b> to paint it black. <b>This is the</b> general <b>principle:</b> Anything <b>that one may use on a Festival, one may send it.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks a question: <b>Granted,</b> it is permitted to send <b>sewn</b> clothes, as they are <b>suitable for wearing.</b> With regard to clothes <b>that are not sewn as well, they are</b> at least <b>suitable for covering</b> oneself. <b>But</b> in the case of clothes than contain <b>diverse kinds, for what</b> use <b>are they suited?</b> Since these clothes may not be used on the Festival, why is it permitted to send them?
<b>And if you say</b> that clothes of diverse kinds <b>are suited for one to place underneath himself, but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Neither shall there come upon you</b> a garment of diverse kinds” (Leviticus 19:19)? This verse teaches that one may not wear this garment, <b>but</b> by Torah law <b>you may spread it beneath you. However, the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so, lest a thread [<i>nima</i>] wind itself around his flesh.</b> This shows that the Sages prohibited even spreading underneath oneself a cloth that contains a mixture of wool and linen.
<b>And if you say that</b> the allowance of cloth of diverse kinds is referring to a case where <b>there is something separating between them,</b> i.e., one may place a garment of diverse kinds beneath another object, <b>but didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said, in the name of the sacred congregation in Jerusalem: Even</b> in a case of <b>ten mattresses</b> placed <b>one on top of the other and</b> a cloth of <b>diverse kinds underneath them, it is prohibited to sleep on them, as it is stated: “Neither shall there come upon you”</b> (Leviticus 19:19).
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a curtain [<i>vilon</i>]</b> of diverse kinds, which may be hung up, as it is not an item of clothing. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But didn’t Ulla say: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>a curtain is ritually impure,</b> i.e., that it can contract the impurity of a vessel despite the fact that it is not directly used by people? <b>Because the attendant warms himself with it.</b> Since attendants use curtains as makeshift blankets when they are cold, a curtain may not be made from a mixture of wool and linen.

Daf 15a

<b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>to hard</b> clothes, upon which it is permitted to sit even if they are a mixture of wool and linen. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>that Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> With regard to <b>this hard felt [<i>namta</i>]</b> material produced in the town <b>of Neresh, it is permitted</b> to sit or recline on it, and one need not be concerned about the fact that it is a mixture of wool and linen.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>felt socks [<i>ardalayin</i>], there is no</b> prohibition of <b>diverse kinds regarding them,</b> as they are hard. <b>Rava said: These bundles for coins,</b> comprised of hard fabric or felt, <b>there is no</b> prohibition of <b>diverse kinds with regard to them.</b> However, with regard to pouches <b>for</b> holding <b>seeds, there is</b> a prohibition of <b>diverse kinds with regard to them,</b> as they are larger and softer than both felt socks and hard bundles for coins. <b>Rav Ashi said: Both this and that have no</b> prohibition of <b>diverse kinds with regard to them because</b> using <b>these</b> items <b>is not the</b> usual <b>manner of keeping warm.</b> Even if these objects are placed close to one’s skin, this is not the usual way of wearing clothes and warming oneself, and therefore they are permitted.
§ The mishna taught: <b>However, one may not</b> send <b>a spiked sandal</b> on a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>A spiked sandal, what is the reason</b> that it may <b>not</b> be worn? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to an incident that occurred.</b> A great tragedy resulted when people wore spiked sandals on Shabbat, which led the Sages to decree that these sandals may not be worn on a Shabbat or Festival.
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>a spiked sandal, it is prohibited to wear it</b> on Shabbat, <b>but it is permitted to move it.</b> He clarifies: <b>It is prohibited to wear</b> a spiked sandal, <b>due to</b> the <b>incident that occurred. And it is permitted to move it, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: One may not send. For if it enters your mind</b> that <b>it is prohibited</b> even <b>to move</b> a spiked sandal, <b>now</b> consider: If <b>it were prohibited to move it,</b> is the mishna <b>required</b> to state that <b>one may send it?</b> Rather, it must certainly be permitted to move a spiked sandal inside the house, despite the fact that one may not wear it.
The mishna further teaches: <b>Nor</b> may one send <b>an unsewn shoe</b> on a Festival. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> as these shoes are unfit for wearing. The Gemara answers: This statement <b>was necessary</b> only to teach <b>that although</b> the shoe <b>is attached with pins</b> and can be worn, it may not be sent on a Festival. Since it is not properly sewn, it is not usually worn.
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even</b> send <b>a white shoe. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> the sending <b>of a black</b> shoe <b>but prohibits</b> the sending <b>of a white one because</b> a white one <b>requires a lump of chalk</b> to color it properly. <b>Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> the sending <b>of a black</b> shoe <b>because one needs to polish it.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And they do not disagree</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i>, as this <b>Sage</b> ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the custom <b>of his locale, and</b> this <b>Sage</b> ruled differently, <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale. In the place of</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, the leather was made so that the side of the hide facing the <b>flesh</b> is on the <b>underneath,</b> facing the inside of the shoe, and therefore it does not require polishing; whereas <b>in the place of</b> that <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, the leather was made so that side of the hide facing the <b>flesh</b> is <b>above,</b> facing the outside of the shoe. That side is often cracked and uneven and requires smoothing and polishing.
§ The mishna taught that <b>this is the</b> general <b>principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> article <b>that one may use on a Festival,</b> one may send it. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Sheshet permitted the Sages to send phylacteries on a Festival. Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>any</b> article <b>that one may use on a Festival, one may send it?</b> Phylacteries are not worn on Festivals. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> article <b>that one may use on a weekday, one may send it on a Festival.</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>phylacteries, since</b> this topic <b>has come before us</b> in the previous discussion, <b>let us say</b> a novel <b>matter about it:</b> If someone <b>was coming on the road</b> on the eve of a Shabbat or Festival, <b>and</b> he had <b>phylacteries on his head,</b> as the practice then was to don phylacteries the entire day, but not at night, <b>and the sun set</b> before <b>he</b> arrived at his destination, signaling the beginning of the Shabbat or Festival, when phylacteries may not be worn or even moved, <b>he places his hand upon them</b> to cover them so that people will not see them <b>until he reaches his house,</b> at which point he removes them. If <b>he was sitting in the study hall with phylacteries on his head, and the day</b> of Shabbat or the Festival <b>was sanctified, for</b> which <b>he</b> was unprepared, <b>he places his hand upon them until he reaches his house.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Ika, raised an objection</b> from the following teaching: If <b>one was coming on the road with phylacteries on his head, and the day was sanctified</b> before <b>he</b> arrived at his destination, <b>he places his hand upon them until he reaches the house nearest the wall,</b> where he removes them and leaves them there. <b>If he was sitting in the study hall,</b> outside the city, <b>and the day was sanctified, for</b> which <b>he</b> was unprepared, <b>he places his hand upon them until he reaches a house that is near the study hall,</b> where there are people who can guard the phylacteries. This shows that one may not bring phylacteries all the way to his house, but only to the nearest place within the city boundary.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one places the phylacteries in the house nearest the wall, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the phylacteries can be <b>safeguarded</b> there, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that he may bring them all the way to his house, deals with a situation <b>where they are not safeguarded</b> in the nearest house.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the phylacteries are <b>not safeguarded, why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> the case of phylacteries that were <b>on his head? Even</b> if one was not donning them but found them <b>placed on the ground,</b> he should <b>also</b> be required to don them and bring them to the house, <b>for didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 95a): <b>One who finds phylacteries</b> lying in a field outside of the city on Shabbat should don them and <b>bring them into</b> the city <b>one pair at a time?</b>
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, where it was taught that one need not don the phylacteries if they were not already on his head, is referring to a situation <b>where they are safeguarded from thieves and</b> also <b>from dogs. That</b> mishna, which stated that even if one found them on the ground, he must put them on and bring them into the city, is referring to a case <b>where they are safeguarded from dogs but are not safeguarded from thieves.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the novel element of the mishna’s ruling. <b>Lest you say: Since most thieves [<i>listim</i>] are Jews, who would not treat</b> phylacteries <b>with contempt,</b> one should not be allowed to carry them because there is no danger that they will be desecrated if they are left in their place, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> takes the minority of cases into account. It is therefore appropriate to don the phylacteries and bring them into the city.

Daf 15b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a Festival that occurs</b> on <b>Shabbat eve, one may not cook on the Festival with the initial</b> intent to cook <b>for Shabbat. However, he may cook</b> on that day <b>for the Festival</b> itself, <b>and if he left over</b> any food, <b>he left</b> it <b>over for Shabbat.</b> The early Sages also instituted an ordinance: The joining of cooked foods [<i>eiruv tavshilin</i>], which the mishna explains. <b>One may prepare a cooked dish</b> designated for Shabbat <b>on a Festival eve and rely on it</b> to cook on the Festival <b>for Shabbat.</b>
The <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed with regard to the details of this ordinance: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> For the purpose of the joining of cooked foods one must prepare <b>two cooked dishes, and Beit Hillel say: One dish</b> is sufficient. <b>And they</b> both <b>agree with regard to a fish and</b> the <b>egg that is</b> fried <b>on it that these are</b> considered <b>two dishes</b> for this purpose.
If <b>one ate</b> the food prepared before the Festival as an <i>eiruv</i> and none of it remained for Shabbat, <b>or if it was lost, he may not</b> rely <b>on it</b> and <b>cook with the initial</b> intent to cook for Shabbat. <b>If he left any part of</b> the <i>eiruv</i>, he may <b>rely on it</b> to cook <b>for Shabbat.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the source of the <i>halakha</i> of the joining of cooked foods and of the <i>halakha</i> that one who failed to prepare such an <i>eiruv</i> may not cook on a Festival for Shabbat? <b>Shmuel said</b> that the source is <b>as the verse states: “Remember the Shabbat day, to keep it holy”</b> (Exodus 20:8); from which he infers: <b>Remember it</b> and safeguard it <b>from another</b> day <b>that comes to make it forgotten.</b> When a Festival occurs on Friday, preoccupation with the Festival and the preparation and enjoyment of its meals could lead one to overlook Shabbat. Therefore, the Sages instituted an ordinance to ensure that Shabbat will be remembered even then.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Sages instituted this ordinance in particular to ensure that Shabbat would not be overlooked? <b>Rava said:</b> The Sages did so in deference to Shabbat, and they instituted an <i>eiruv</i> <b>so that one will select a choice portion for Shabbat and a choice portion for the Festival.</b> If one fails to prepare a dish specifically for Shabbat before the Festival, it could lead to failure to show the appropriate deference to Shabbat.
<b>Rav Ashi stated</b> a different reason: The Sages did so in deference to the Festival, <b>so that</b> people <b>will say: One may not bake on a Festival for Shabbat</b> unless he began to bake the day before; <b>all the more so,</b> one may not bake <b>on a Festival for a weekday.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may prepare a cooked dish on a Festival eve and rely on it</b> to cook <b>for Shabbat. Granted, according to Rav Ashi, who said</b> that the reason for an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>so that</b> people <b>will say: One may not bake on a Festival for Shabbat; that is</b> why <b>on a Festival eve, yes,</b> one may prepare the <i>eiruv</i>, but <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>no,</b> one may not do so, as it is a reminder that in principle one may not cook on a Festival for Shabbat. <b>However, according to Rava,</b> who stated that the reason for the <i>eiruv</i> is to ensure that one selects choice portions for both the Festival and Shabbat, <b>why</b> does the mishna discuss <b>specifically</b> preparation <b>on a Festival eve? Even</b> were one to prepare a dish for Shabbat <b>on the Festival as well,</b> it would guarantee that he accord the appropriate deference to Shabbat.
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> that objective could have been achieved even on the Festival. <b>However,</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> that the <i>eiruv</i> must be prepared on the Festival eve <b>lest one be negligent</b> and fail to prepare one entirely.
The Gemara comments: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the proof for <i>eiruv tavshilin</i> <b>from here,</b> the following verse: “Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Shabbat to the Lord. <b>Bake that which you will bake and cook that which you will cook,</b> and all that remains put aside to be kept for you until the morning” (Exodus 16:23). <b>From here Rabbi Eliezer said: One may bake</b> on a Festival for Shabbat <b>only</b> by relying <b>on that which was</b> already <b>baked</b> for Shabbat the day before, and adding to it; <b>and one may cook only</b> by relying <b>on that which was</b> already <b>cooked. From this</b> verse <b>the Sages established</b> an allusion <b>to</b> the <b>joining of cooked foods from the Torah.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer, who was sitting and lecturing about the <i>halakhot</i> of the Festival throughout the entire</b> Festival <b>day.</b> When <b>the first group left</b> in the middle of his lecture, <b>he said: These</b> must be <b>owners of extremely large jugs [<i>pittasin</i>],</b> who apparently have huge containers of wine awaiting them as well as a comparable amount of food, and they have left the house of study out of a craving for their food. After a while <b>a second group</b> departed. <b>He said: These are owners of barrels,</b> which are smaller than <i>pittasin</i>. Later <b>a third group</b> took its leave, and <b>he said: These are owners of jugs,</b> even smaller than barrels.
<b>A fourth group</b> left, and <b>he said: These are owners of jars [<i>laginin</i>],</b> which are smaller than jugs. Upon the departure of <b>a fifth group, he said: These are owners of cups,</b> which are smaller still. When <b>a sixth group began to leave, he</b> became upset that the house of study was being left almost completely empty and <b>said: These are owners of a curse;</b> i.e., they obviously do not have anything at home, so why are they leaving?
<b>He cast his eyes upon the students</b> remaining in the house of study. Immediately, <b>their faces began to change</b> color out of shame, as they feared he was referring to them and that perhaps they should have departed along with the others instead of staying. <b>He said to them: My sons, I did not say</b> that <b>about you but about those who left, because they abandon</b> the <b>eternal life</b> of Torah <b>and engage in</b> the <b>temporary life</b> of eating.
<b>At the time of</b> the remaining students’ <b>departure</b> at the conclusion of Rabbi Eliezer’s lecture, <b>he said to them</b> the verse: <b>“Go your way, eat the fat and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy to our Lord; and do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your strength”</b> (Nehemiah 8:10).
The Gemara clarifies this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>Because they abandon eternal life and engage in temporary life.</b> The Gemara wonders at this: <b>But isn’t the joy of the Festival</b> itself <b>a mitzva</b> and therefore part of eternal life? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as <b>he said:</b> Physical <b>joy on a Festival is</b> merely <b>optional.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person has no</b> way of fulfilling the mitzva of <b>a Festival</b> correctly <b>apart from either eating and drinking,</b> thereby fulfilling the mitzva of joy in a completely physical manner, <b>or sitting and studying</b> Torah, thereby emphasizing only the spiritual; and those who did not engage in Torah study to the fullest extent acted inappropriately. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> There is no need for such a dichotomy; rather, simply <b>divide it: Half to God,</b> Torah study, <b>and half to yourselves,</b> engaging in eating, drinking, and other pleasurable activities.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse,</b> i.e., the two of them addressed the same apparent contradiction between two verses, resolving it in different ways. <b>One verse states:</b> “It shall be <b>a solemn assembly for the Lord, your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8), indicating a Festival dedicated to the service of God, <b>and one verse states: “It shall be a solemn assembly for you”</b> (Numbers 29:35), indicating a celebratory assembly for the Jewish people. <b>How is this</b> to be reconciled? <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the two verses should be understood as offering a choice: The day is to be <b>either entirely for God,</b> in accordance with the one verse, <b>or entirely for you,</b> as per the other verse; <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that it is possible to fulfill both verses: <b>Split</b> the day into two, <b>half of it for God and half of it for you.</b>
§ Since the <i>baraita</i> mentions the verse from Nehemiah, the Gemara poses the following question: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: “Send portions <b>to him for whom nothing is prepared”</b> (Nehemiah 8:10)? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Send to one who does not have food of his own prepared for Shabbat that follows the Festival because <b>he did not prepare a joining of cooked foods</b> and must therefore rely on others. <b>Some say</b> that he said the following: It is necessary to provide food for <b>one who did not have</b> an opportunity <b>to prepare a joining of cooked foods</b> on the eve of the Festival; <b>but one who had</b> an opportunity <b>to prepare a joining of cooked foods and did not prepare</b> one <b>is negligent,</b> and there is no obligation to care for him.
The Gemara poses another question with regard to the same verse: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>“For the joy of the Lord is your strength”? Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people: My children, borrow on My</b> account, <b>and sanctify the sanctity of the day</b> of Shabbat and the Festivals with wine, <b>and trust in Me, and I will repay</b> this debt.
Apropos the statement attributed to Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, the Gemara cites another statement that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon: One who wants his properties to be preserved</b> and protected from ruin should <b>plant an <i>eder</i></b> tree <b>among them, as it is stated: “The Lord on high is mighty [<i>adir</i>]”</b> (Psalms 93:4). Due to the similarity of the words <i>eder</i> and <i>adir</i>, this is understood to mean that the <i>eder</i> tree bestows permanence.
<b>Alternatively: The <i>eder</i></b> tree will preserve one’s property, <b>as</b> implied by <b>its name, as people say: What is</b> alluded to in the name of <b>the <i>eder</i>?</b> Its name hints <b>that</b> it <b>endures for many generations [<i>darei</i>]. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A field that contains an <i>eder</i></b> tree <b>will be neither stolen nor forcibly removed</b> from one’s possession, as the <i>eder</i> serves as a clear indication of its owner, <b>and its fruit is preserved,</b> as the unique odor of the <i>eder</i> sap wards off insects.
§ The Gemara returns to the previous issue: <b>Rav Taḥlifa, brother</b> of <b>Ravnai Ḥoza’a, taught:</b>

Daf 16a

<b>A person’s entire livelihood is allocated to him</b> during the period <b>from Rosh HaShana to Yom Kippur.</b> During that time, as each individual is judged, it is decreed exactly how much money he will earn for all his expenditures of the coming year, <b>except for expenditures for <i>Shabbatot</i>, and expenditures for Festivals, and expenditures for</b> the school fees of <b>his sons’ Torah study.</b> In these areas, no exact amount is determined at the beginning of the year; rather, <b>if he reduced</b> the amount he spends for these purposes, <b>his</b> income <b>is reduced</b> and he earns that much less money in that year, <b>and if he increased</b> his expenditures in these areas, <b>his</b> income <b>is increased</b> to ensure that he can cover the expense. Therefore, one may borrow for these purposes, since he is guaranteed to have enough income to cover whatever he spends for them.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the verse</b> from which this dictum is derived? The source is: <b>“Blow the <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, at the concealed</b> time <b>for our Festival day”</b> (Psalms 81:4). <b>On which Festival is the new moon concealed?</b> You <b>must say</b> that <b>it is Rosh HaShana,</b> which occurs on the first of the month, when the moon is not yet visible, while the moon is visible during the other Festivals, which occur in the middle of the month. <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“For it is a statute [<i>ḥok</i>] for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5).
The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“statute [<i>ḥok</i>]” is a term</b> relating <b>to food? As it is written: “And they ate their allotment [<i>ḥukkam</i>], which Pharaoh gave them”</b> (Genesis 47:22). <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> One can learn that <i>ḥok</i> is referring to food <b>from here: “Feed me with my allotted [<i>ḥukki</i>] bread”</b> (Proverbs 30:8).
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They said about Shammai the Elder</b> that <b>all his days he would eat in honor of Shabbat.</b> How so? If <b>he found a choice animal, he</b> would <b>say: This is for Shabbat.</b> If <b>he</b> subsequently <b>found another one choicer than it, he</b> would <b>set aside the second</b> for Shabbat <b>and eat the first.</b> He would eat the first to leave the better-quality animal for Shabbat, which continually rendered his eating an act of honoring Shabbat.
<b>However, Hillel the Elder had a different trait, that all his actions,</b> including those on a weekday, <b>were for the sake of Heaven, as it is stated: “Blessed be the Lord, day by day;</b> He bears our burden, our God who is our salvation; Selah” (Psalms 68:20), meaning that God gives a blessing for each and every day. <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in more general terms: <b>Beit Shammai say: From the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, start preparing already <b>for your Shabbat. And Beit Hillel say: “Blessed be the Lord, day by day.”</b>
§ Apropos the statements about honoring Shabbat, the Gemara cites another statement on the same topic. <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: One who gives a gift to his friend need not inform him</b> that he has given it to him, and he need not concern himself that the recipient might not realize who gave it to him. <b>As it is stated: “And Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant”</b> (Exodus 34:29); Moses received this gift unawares.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this. Isn’t it written: “Nevertheless, you must keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, <b>that you may know that I am the Lord Who sanctifies you”</b> (Exodus 31:13), which the Sages expounded as follows: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, I have a good gift in My treasury, and its name is Shabbat, and I wish to give it to the Jewish people. Go and inform them</b> of this intention of Mine. <b>And from here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: One who gives</b> a gift of <b>a piece of bread to a child must inform his mother</b> of his actions, so that the child’s parents will be aware of the giver’s fond feelings for them, thereby enhancing friendly relations and companionship among Jews. This appears to be in direct contradiction to Rabbi Ḥama’s statement.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> case, where one need not inform the recipient, <b>is referring to a gift that is likely to be revealed,</b> such as Moses’ shining face, which everyone would point out to him; <b>that</b> case, where one must inform the recipient, <b>is referring to a gift that is not likely to be revealed</b> in the natural course of events. The Gemara challenges: Isn’t <b>Shabbat also a gift that is likely to be revealed,</b> as the Jews would eventually be instructed with regard to the time and nature of Shabbat? The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>its reward is not likely to be revealed.</b> Therefore, God told Moses to inform the Jews of the gift of Shabbat and its reward.
<b>The Master said</b> earlier that <b>from here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: One who gives a piece of bread to a child must inform his mother.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What does he do to him;</b> how does he inform the child’s mother? <b>He rubs oil on him and paints his eyes blue,</b> so that when the child arrives home his mother will ask him who did this to him and he will reply that it was a person who also gave him a piece of bread. The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays, when we are concerned about witchcraft,</b> i.e., that painting the child’s eyes might have been performed as an act of sorcery, <b>what</b> should one do? <b>Rav Pappa said: He rubs on</b> the child a little <b>of that same type</b> of food that he put on the bread, such as butter or cheese, and this will cause the child’s mother to notice that he received a present.
The Gemara cites a further statement with regard to the gift of Shabbat to the Jewish people. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: All</b> the <b>mitzvot that the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave to the Jewish people, He gave to them in public [<i>parhesya</i>] except for Shabbat, which he gave to them in private. As it is stated: “It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever”</b> (Exodus 31:17), meaning that in a sense, it is a secret between God and the Jewish people.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that it was given in secret so that not everyone knew about it, <b>the gentiles should not be punished for</b> not wanting to accept <b>it;</b> they are liable to receive punishment for refusing to accept the other mitzvot of the Torah. The Gemara answers: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>did inform them</b> of the concept of <b>Shabbat,</b> but He <b>did not inform them</b> of <b>the reward</b> for the fulfillment of the mitzva. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>He also informed</b> the gentiles of <b>its reward,</b> but about the idea of the <b>additional soul</b> given to each person on Shabbat <b>He did not inform them.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, gives a person an additional soul on Shabbat eve, and at the conclusion of Shabbat removes it from him, as it is stated: “He ceased from work and was refreshed [<i>vayinafash</i>]”</b> (Exodus 31:17). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish expounds the verse as follows: <b>Since he ceased from work,</b> and now Shabbat has concluded and his additional soul is removed from him, <b>woe [<i>vai</i>]</b> for the additional <b>soul [<i>nefesh</i>]</b> that is <b>lost.</b>
It was taught in the mishna that <b>a person may prepare a cooked dish on a Festival eve</b> and rely on it for Shabbat for the joining of cooked foods. <b>Abaye said: They taught</b> that the joining of cooked foods allows one to cook on a Festival for Shabbat <b>only</b> when it is made from <b>a cooked dish; however,</b> if it is composed of <b>bread</b> alone, <b>no,</b> this is not sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>bread that</b> makes it <b>not</b> fit for this purpose? <b>If we say</b> that <b>we require something that accompanies</b> bread, <b>and bread does not accompany</b> itself, the following difficulty arises: <b>Porridge also does not accompany</b> bread, as <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Those foolish Babylonians eat bread with bread,</b> referring to their custom of eating bread with porridge. This shows that porridge is no better accompaniment to bread than bread itself, <b>and</b> yet <b>Rav Neḥumi bar Zekharya said in the name of Abaye: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with porridge. Rather,</b> one must say as follows: <b>We require something that is not routine,</b> so that it will be clear that one is setting it aside for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and bread is routine,</b> whereas <b>porridge is not routine.</b>
<b>Some say</b> a different version of this discussion: <b>Abaye said: They taught</b> that a joining of cooked foods allows one to cook on a Festival for Shabbat <b>only</b> when it is made from <b>a cooked dish; however,</b> if it is composed of <b>bread, no,</b> that is not sufficient. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say that we require something that is not routine, and bread is routine,</b> the following difficulty arises: <b>Isn’t porridge not</b> particularly <b>routine? And</b> yet <b>Rav Neḥumi bar Zekharya said in the name of Abaye: One may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with porridge. Rather,</b> one should say as follows: <b>We require something that accompanies</b> bread, <b>and bread does not accompany</b> itself, <b>and porridge, too, does not accompany</b> bread, <b>as Rabbi Zeira said: Those foolish Babylonians eat bread with bread,</b> from which it is clear that like bread, porridge does not accompany bread and consequently cannot constitute an <i>eiruv</i>.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught:</b> With regard to <b>lentils that</b> remain <b>at the bottom of a pot</b> on the eve of a Festival, <b>one may rely on them for</b> the <b>joining of cooked foods.</b> Although they were not prepared with this purpose in mind, they are nevertheless considered a cooked dish. <b>And this applies only</b> if <b>there is an olive-bulk</b> of lentils in total. Similarly, <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said:</b> With regard to <b>fat</b> of meat and the like <b>that is on a knife, one may scrape it</b> off the knife <b>and rely on it for the joining of cooked foods; and this applies only</b> if <b>there is an olive-bulk</b> of fat in total.
<b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Small salted fish</b> that a gentile then cooked <b>are not considered the cooked food of gentiles</b> because cooking does not prepare them to be food any more than they already were, as they can be eaten in their salted state. <b>Rav Yosef said: And</b> even <b>if a gentile roasted them,</b> a Jew may <b>rely on them for the joining of cooked foods,</b> as they are not considered the cooked food of a gentile and are indeed already edible. However, <b>if</b> the <b>gentile made them</b> into <b>fish fried with oil and flour [<i>kasa deharsena</i>], it is prohibited</b> to eat them. In this case they are considered the cooked food of a gentile, since his actions have made them into noteworthy food.
The Gemara challenges: <b>It is obvious</b> that this is the case; it need not be taught. The Gemara answers: The justification for teaching it is <b>lest you say</b> that

Daf 16b

the <b>fish fat,</b> which one is permitted to eat even if cooked by gentiles, is the <b>essential element.</b> Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that <b>the flour</b> is the <b>essential element,</b> and the gentile has created a new and significant dish, which is consequently prohibited.
<b>Rabbi Abba said: A joining of cooked foods requires an olive-bulk</b> of food. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is it enough to have <b>one olive-bulk for all of</b> the household members who are relying on this <i>eiruv</i>, <b>or perhaps</b> must there be a separate <b>olive-bulk for each and every one</b> in the household? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>which Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: A joining of cooked foods requires an olive-bulk, whether</b> it is cooked <b>for a single</b> person <b>or for one hundred</b> people.
The Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>one ate</b> the joining of cooked foods that he prepared, <b>or if it was lost, he may not</b> rely <b>on it</b> and <b>cook with the initial</b> intent to cook for Shabbat; but if <b>he left any part of</b> the <i>eiruv</i>, he may <b>rely on it</b> to cook <b>for Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Any part of it? Doesn’t it</b> mean <b>that</b> it is valid <b>although there is not an olive-bulk?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the phrase: Any part of it, means <b>that there is</b> at least <b>an olive-bulk</b> left.
The Gemara attempts to bring another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> The <b>cooked dish</b> that is required for a joining of cooked foods may <b>be roasted, or even pickled,</b> or <b>well-boiled, or boiled</b> in the regular manner, <b>or</b> may even be <b>Spanish soft sea fish [<i>koleyas ha’ispenin</i>] upon which one poured hot</b> water <b>on the eve of the Festival,</b> rendering it cooked. With regard to <b>its beginning and end,</b> meaning its required size <i>ab initio</i> and after it has been reduced by being partially lost or partially eaten, the <i>eiruv</i> <b>has no</b> required <b>measure. What, is it not</b> that <b>it has no</b> required <b>measure at all,</b> not even a minimum one? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it means <b>it does not have a maximum measure, but it does have a minimum measure,</b> namely an olive-bulk.
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: A joining of cooked foods requires knowledge,</b> meaning that one must be aware of the <i>eiruv</i> for it to be effective. The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that <b>we require</b> the <b>knowledge of the one who prepares</b> the <i>eiruv</i>; the question is: Do <b>we</b> also <b>require</b> the <b>knowledge of the one for whom</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>is prepared, or do we not require</b> it?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following testimonies: <b>Shmuel’s father</b> would <b>prepare an <i>eiruv</i> for</b> the <b>entire</b> city of <b>Neharde’a,</b> and <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> would <b>prepare an <i>eiruv</i> for</b> the <b>entire</b> city of <b>Tiberias.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi</b> would <b>announce:</b> Anyone <b>who did not prepare a joining of cooked foods</b> for himself should <b>come and rely on mine.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And up to how much</b> may one rely on it, i.e., how far may one be from such an <i>eiruv</i> and still rely upon it? <b>Rav Neḥumi bar Zekharya said in the name of Abaye:</b> One may be <b>as far</b> away <b>as the Shabbat limit.</b>
The Gemara relates: With regard to <b>the blind person who would present <i>mishnayot</i> before Mar Shmuel,</b> the latter <b>observed that he was sad.</b> Mar Shmuel <b>said to him: Why are you sad? He said to him:</b> Because <b>I did not prepare a joining of cooked foods</b> before the Festival. Mar Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> Then <b>rely on mine. In the</b> following <b>year, he</b> once again <b>observed that he was sad. He said to him: Why are you sad? He said to him:</b> Because <b>I did not prepare a joining of cooked foods.</b> Mar Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> If so, <b>you are</b> consistently <b>negligent</b> in this regard. Therefore, <b>for the entire world,</b> i.e., anyone else but you, it is <b>permitted</b> to rely on my <i>eiruv</i> if they forgot to prepare one, but <b>for you</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to do so, as I did not intend to include such negligent people as yourself in my <i>eiruv</i>.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>a Festival occurs on Shabbat eve, one may not prepare an <i>eiruv</i></b> on that day, <b>neither a joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] nor a joining of courtyards [<i>eiruv ḥatzerot</i>],</b> for Shabbat. If one did not prepare these before the Festival, he may not do so on the Festival itself.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> On a Festival that occurs on a Friday, <b>one may prepare an <i>eiruv</i></b> for <b>a joining of courtyards, but not</b> for <b>a joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries.</b> His reasoning is as follows: There is a distinction between the two types of <i>eiruv</i> <b>because you may prohibit him from a matter that is prohibited to him,</b> e.g., venturing beyond the Shabbat limit, which is prohibited on a Festival as well as Shabbat, <b>but you may not prohibit him from a matter that is permitted to him,</b> e.g., carrying from one domain to another, which is permitted on a Festival. Therefore, on a Festival, one may not prepare a joining of Shabbat boundaries in order to render it permitted to venture beyond the boundary on the Shabbat following the Festival. However, one may prepare a joining of courtyards on the Festival in order to render it permitted to carry from one domain to another on the Shabbat following the Festival.
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed as to the conclusive ruling. <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who said that it is prohibited to prepare both types of <i>eiruvin</i>, <b>and Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and it is permitted to prepare a joining of courtyards on a Festival.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is stating that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>a leniency or a stringency?</b> The Gemara wonders at this query: It is <b>obvious that he stated it as a leniency.</b> The Gemara explains: The question was asked <b>because Rabbi Elazar sent</b> a message from Eretz Yisrael <b>to the Diaspora:</b> This <i>baraita</i> is <b>not as you teach</b> it <b>in Babylonia,</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits</b> one to prepare a joining of courtyards on a Festival <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> it. <b>Rather,</b> the opinions should be reversed, so that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>prohibits</b> it <b>and the Rabbis permit</b> it. Therefore, the question arose: <b>What</b> is the conclusive ruling for this <i>halakha</i>? Is it lenient or stringent?
The Gemara attempts to cite a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that Rav Taḥlifa bar Avdimi performed an action in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel,</b> who ruled that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rav said</b> in anger about this: <b>The first</b> public <b>ruling of this young Torah scholar is</b> bringing about <b>corruption</b> of the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said it as a leniency, this</b> explains <b>the corruption</b> of the <i>halakha</i> involved, as Rav was angered by a young scholar who relied on his own judgment to issue a lenient ruling on a disputed issue. <b>However, if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi meant it <b>as a stringency, what corruption</b> of the <i>halakha</i> <b>is there</b> in the young scholar’s ruling?
The Gemara answers: <b>Since it corrupts</b> the behavior of <b>the masses,</b> as, if they refrain from preparing a joining of courtyards on the Festival although it is permitted to do so, they might mistakenly carry from one domain to another on Shabbat,

Daf 17a

<b>this is the corruption</b> that might result from a ruling that renders it prohibited to prepare an <i>eiruv</i> the day before. Therefore, this cannot serve as proof of the conclusive ruling. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>to prohibit</b> one from preparing either type of <i>eiruv</i>. One may not prepare an <i>eiruv</i> either for courtyards or for boundaries, as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Elazar’s version of the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Festival that occurs on Shabbat, Beit Shammai say: One must recite</b> an <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> that includes <b>eight</b> blessings, inserting two additional blessings between the standard opening three and concluding three. As for the two middle blessings, <b>one recites</b> one <b>for Shabbat as an independent</b> blessing <b>and</b> a second <b>for the Festival as an independent</b> blessing. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One must pray</b> an <i>Amida</i> comprising only <b>seven blessings,</b> i.e., the three opening ones, the three concluding ones, and one in between. <b>One begins</b> the middle blessing <b>with Shabbat and concludes</b> it <b>with Shabbat, and he recites</b> a passage referring to <b>the sanctity of the day</b> of the Festival <b>in the middle. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He even concludes</b> this blessing with mention of both Shabbat and the Festival, saying: <b>Who sanctifies Shabbat, the Jewish people, and the seasons.</b>
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Ravina</b> with a slightly different reading: He concludes the blessing with: <b>Who sanctifies the Jewish people, Shabbat, and the seasons.</b> Ravina <b>said to</b> that <i>tanna</i>: <b>Is that to say that the Jewish people sanctify Shabbat? Isn’t Shabbat already sanctified</b> from the six days of Creation? Every seventh day is automatically Shabbat, without the need for any declaration on the part of the Jewish people. <b>Rather,</b> amend it and <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Who sanctifies Shabbat, the Jewish people, and the seasons,</b> as the Jewish people indeed sanctify the New Moon and the Festival days. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to the conclusion of the blessing <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and as</b> the difficulty was <b>resolved</b> by <b>Ravina.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>Shabbat that occurs on a New Moon or on</b> one of <b>the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> for <b>the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers, one prays</b> in his usual manner, reciting <b>seven</b> blessings in the <i>Amida</i>, <b>and recites</b> a passage <b>pertaining to the event</b> of the day, i.e.: May there rise and come [<i>ya’aleh veyavo</i>], <b>during</b> the blessing of <b>the Temple service,</b> known as <i>retze</i>; <b>and if he did not recite</b> it, <b>he is required to return</b> to the beginning of the <i>Amida</i> prayer and repeat it. <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> This passage is recited <b>during</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving,</b> known as <i>modim</i>. <b>And in the additional prayer one begins</b> the fourth blessing, the special blessing for the additional service, <b>with Shabbat, and concludes</b> it <b>with Shabbat, and recites</b> a passage pertaining to <b>the sanctity of the day</b> of the New Moon or the Festival <b>in the middle.</b>
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> disagree and <b>say: Wherever</b> one is <b>required to</b> recite <b>seven</b> blessings, whether in the evening, morning, or afternoon prayers, <b>he begins</b> the fourth blessing <b>with Shabbat and concludes</b> it <b>with Shabbat, and recites</b> a passage referring to <b>the sanctity of the day</b> of the New Moon or the Festival <b>in the middle. Rav Huna said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that pair</b> of scholars; rather, it is in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, that in the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers one recites the usual seven blessings and recites a passage pertaining to the event of the day during the blessing of the Temple service.
§ <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>a person</b> forgot to place an <i>eiruv</i> before a Festival occurring on Thursday and Friday in the Diaspora, he may act as follows: He may <b>place</b> an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries on</b> the first <b>Festival day for the next,</b> i.e., on the first Festival day for the second Festival day kept in the Diaspora, based on a doubt as to which day is the real day of the Festival, <b>and stipulate</b> as follows: If today is in fact the Festival, then tomorrow is a weekday, on which I may walk as far as I wish in all directions; and if today is a weekday and tomorrow is the Festival, I hereby place an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of Shabbat boundaries for tomorrow. On the following day he makes a similar stipulation with the same <i>eiruv</i>, so that he will have an <i>eiruv</i> for Shabbat.
<b>Rava said: A person may place</b> an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of cooked foods on</b> the first <b>Festival day for the next</b> day <b>and stipulate</b> as follows: If today is a weekday and tomorrow is the Festival, this is my joining of cooked foods, so that I may rely on it to cook tomorrow for Shabbat; and if today is in fact the Festival and tomorrow is a weekday, I may cook tomorrow as on a regular weekday.
The Gemara comments: With regard to <b>the one who said</b> this <i>halakha</i> concerning an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries, all the more so</b> would he permit one to act in this manner concerning an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of cooked foods.</b> On the other hand, <b>the one who said</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of cooked foods</b> spoke only with regard to the joining of cooked foods; <b>however,</b> as for an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries,</b> this is <b>not</b> permitted. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference? It is <b>that</b> they did <b>not</b> permit <b>the acquisition of residence on</b> a day of <b>rest,</b> even in a case of uncertainty. However, with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked foods, since it is merely symbolic, it is permitted for the sake of the honor of Shabbat.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not bake</b> bread <b>on</b> one <b>Festival day for the next,</b> i.e., on the first Festival day for the second Festival day kept in the Diaspora. Nevertheless, <b>actually, they said</b> the following established <i>halakha</i>: <b>A woman may fill an entire pot</b> with <b>meat</b> to cook on a Festival, <b>although she requires only one piece</b> for that day, and all the remainder will be for the following day. Similarly, <b>a baker may fill</b> an entire <b>barrel with water</b> in order to heat it up <b>although he requires only a jug</b> of hot water. <b>But with regard to baking, he may bake only that which he requires</b> for that day.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A woman may fill the entire oven</b> with <b>bread,</b> although she does not intend to use it all on that day, <b>because bread bakes well when the oven is full.</b> A full oven has less empty space and is therefore hotter; consequently, filling the oven with bread serves not only to provide bread for the next day but also to improve the bread to be eaten that same day. <b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b>
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>one who did not prepare</b> an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of cooked foods,</b> is <b>he prohibited</b> from cooking for Shabbat and <b>his flour is</b> likewise <b>prohibited,</b> meaning that none of his food may be prepared for Shabbat? <b>Or perhaps</b> only <b>he is prohibited</b> from performing this type of labor, <b>but his flour is not prohibited.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>practical</b> halakhic <b>difference</b> that emerges from this question? The Gemara explains: There is a difference with respect to whether or not he must <b>transfer</b> ownership of <b>his flour to others. If you say</b> that <b>he is prohibited and his flour is</b> also <b>prohibited, he must transfer his flour to others</b> so that they are able to bake for him if they so desire. <b>But if you say</b> that only <b>he is prohibited but his flour is not prohibited, he need not transfer his flour to others,</b> as they may bake for him even if the flour is not theirs. The Gemara asks: <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who did not prepare</b> an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of cooked foods</b> on a Festival eve <b>may neither bake, nor cook, nor insulate</b> food on the Festival for Shabbat that occurs on the following day, <b>neither for himself nor for others, and others may neither bake nor cook for him. What</b> should <b>he do</b> so that he will have food to eat on Shabbat? <b>He</b> must <b>transfer his flour to others, and they may</b> then <b>bake and cook for him. Learn from here,</b> from the fact that the <i>baraita</i> states that he must transfer his flour to others, that <b>he is prohibited and his flour is</b> also <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case.
Another <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>one who transgressed</b> this prohibition <b>and baked</b> on a Festival for Shabbat without having placed an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked foods on the eve of the Festival, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted to partake of his bread and his cooking? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this question from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who did not prepare</b> an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of cooked foods, what</b> should <b>he do</b> so that he will have food to eat on Shabbat? <b>He must transfer his flour to others, and they may</b> then <b>bake and cook for him.</b>

Daf 17b

<b>And if it is so</b> that if one baked without having placed an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked foods, it is permitted to eat the bread, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> simply <b>teach:</b> With regard to <b>one who transgressed</b> the prohibition <b>and baked, it is permitted</b> to eat the bread. <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said:</b> There is no proof from here, as the <b><i>tanna</i> is teaching a remedy</b> involving acting in <b>a permitted</b> manner, and <b>is not teaching a remedy</b> involving <b>a prohibited</b> act. The <i>tanna</i> did not want to teach that it is also possible to solve the problem in this proscribed manner.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who prepared</b> an <i>eiruv</i> for <b>the joining of cooked foods</b> on a Festival eve <b>may bake and cook and insulate</b> food on the Festival for Shabbat that occurs on the following day, <b>and if he wants to eat his <i>eiruv</i></b> on Shabbat, <b>he has permission</b> to do so. But if <b>he ate it</b> on the Festival <b>before he baked</b> or <b>before he insulated, he may neither bake, nor cook, nor insulate, neither for himself nor for others,</b> and likewise <b>others may neither bake nor cook for him.</b>
<b>However,</b> even without an <i>eiruv</i>, one in this situation <b>may cook for the Festival</b> itself, <b>and if he left over</b> part of what he cooked, <b>he has left</b> it <b>over for Shabbat, provided that he does not employ artifice</b> to circumvent the prohibition by saying that he is cooking a large amount for guests on the Festival, when in fact he has Shabbat in mind. <b>And if he employed artifice</b> to circumvent the prohibition, it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat the food, by decree of the Sages. This indicates that one who cooks on a Festival for Shabbat in a prohibited manner may not eat the food.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is no proof, as <b>you speak of</b> a case of <b>artifice,</b> and a case of <b>artifice is different, as the Sages were more stringent with regard to</b> one who employs artifice <b>than</b> with regard to one who <b>intentionally</b> cooks on a Festival for Shabbat. One who purposely transgresses is aware of his sin; therefore, he might repent and desist from his prohibited behavior, thereby preventing others from learning from his actions. However, one who employs artifice to circumvent a prohibition thinks that he is acting in a permitted manner. He is therefore likely to continue his practice. Furthermore, people might emulate him, and the <i>halakha</i> of preparing an <i>eiruv</i> might be forgotten.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that there is another reason to reject the proof from this <i>baraita</i>: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bake</b> bread on a Festival for Shabbat <b>unless he prepared an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the joining of cooked foods on the eve of the Festival specifically <b>with bread; and one may not cook</b> any type of dish <b>unless he prepared an <i>eiruv</i> with a cooked dish; and one may not insulate</b> food <b>unless there was hot</b> food <b>insulated from the eve of the Festival.</b>
<b>And Beit Hillel say: One may prepare an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the joining of cooked foods <b>with one cooked dish and use it for all his needs,</b> i.e., baking, cooking, and insulating. Since Ḥananya’s opinion in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai is strict in this case, it may be assumed that he is stringent after the fact as well, and therefore the <i>baraita</i> provides no proof.
The Gemara offers yet another suggestion. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>one who</b> transgressed a rabbinic prohibition and <b>tithed his produce on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> of it; if he acted <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> of it. This indicates that one may not derive benefit from a transgression that he committed intentionally. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where he has other produce</b> and therefore does not greatly suffer as a result. However, the Sages may have been more lenient with one who did not make an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked food and consequently has nothing to eat.
The Gemara poses another resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different source: In the case of <b>one who immerses his vessels on Shabbat,</b> an activity that the Sages prohibited because it is akin to repairing a vessel, if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may use them;</b> however, if he did so <b>intentionally, he may not use them.</b> This shows that the product of an action performed in a prohibited manner is prohibited.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where he has other vessels</b> and is not forced to use these ones. <b>Alternatively, it is possible</b> for him to manage <b>by borrowing</b> vessels from others. But if one failed to set aside an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked foods, perhaps the Sages allowed him to eat the food he cooked on the Festival for Shabbat since it is difficult to obtain food from others on Shabbat.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who cooks on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> the food that he cooked; but if he cooked it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> it. This demonstrates that one who purposely violated a prohibition may not benefit from his prohibited action. The Gemara rejects this argument: There is no proof from here; the <b>prohibition of Shabbat</b> desecration <b>is different,</b> since it entails <i>karet</i> and execution by a court. The same stringency might not necessarily apply to cooking on a Festival for the sake of the next day, and therefore the question raised above remains unresolved.
§ It is stated in the mishna: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that for the purpose of the joining of cooked foods one must prepare <b>two cooked dishes,</b> whereas Beit Hillel say that one dish suffices. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, who taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that two dishes are necessary. With regard to what do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> a fried <b>fish and the egg on it, as Beit Shammai say: Two</b> proper <b>dishes</b> are required, and this fish is considered only a single dish; <b>and Beit Hillel say: One dish</b> of this kind is viewed as two dishes and is therefore suitable for an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked foods. <b>And they</b> both <b>agree that if one sliced</b> a cooked <b>egg and placed</b> it <b>inside the fish, or if he mashed leeks [<i>kaflotot</i>] and placed</b> them <b>inside the fish, they are</b> considered <b>two dishes.</b>
<b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel</b> that one dish suffices.
The mishna states that if <b>one ate</b> the food prepared before the Festival as an <i>eiruv</i> <b>or</b> if <b>it was lost, he may not</b> rely <b>on it</b> and <b>cook</b> with the initial intent to cook for Shabbat. <b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> that if <b>one</b> prepared a proper <i>eiruv</i> and <b>began</b> kneading <b>his dough</b> on a Festival for Shabbat, <b>and</b> in the meantime <b>his <i>eiruv</i> was eaten, he may finish</b> baking the bread. Since he had begun in a permitted manner, he is allowed to complete the process and bake the bread.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a Festival <b>occurs</b> directly <b>after Shabbat,</b> i.e., on a Sunday, and one wishes to behave in a proper manner and purify himself and his vessels in honor of the Festival, <b>Beit Shammai say: One must immerse everything before Shabbat, and Beit Hillel say: Vessels</b> must be immersed <b>before Shabbat, but a person</b> may immerse himself even <b>on Shabbat.</b>
<b>And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel both <b>agree that one may bring</b> ritually impure <b>water into contact</b> with ritually pure water <b>in stone vessels</b> on Shabbat <b>in order to purify</b> the water. Impure water can be purified if it is placed into a vessel that does not contract ritual impurity, such as a stone vessel, and then lowered with the vessel into a ritual bath. The water becomes purified when it comes into contact with the water of the ritual bath. Although this is not considered proper immersion, water may nevertheless be purified in this manner. <b>However, one may not immerse</b> the impure water in a ritually impure vessel in order to purify the vessel at the same time. Likewise, <b>one may immerse</b> on a Festival <b>from</b> one <b>principle to another, and from one group to another,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>In any event, everyone agrees,</b> i.e., both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree, that one <b>may not</b> immerse <b>a vessel on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one may not do so? Which type of prohibited labor does it involve? <b>Rabba said:</b> It is <b>a decree</b> issued by the Sages as a preventive measure,

Daf 18a

<b>lest one</b> come to <b>pick up</b> the vessel <b>in his hand and carry it four cubits in the public domain</b> to a ritual bath. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: If <b>one has a pit</b> full of water of a ritual bath <b>in his courtyard,</b> so that this decree should not apply, <b>what is there to say?</b> Rabba <b>said to him:</b> The Sages issued <b>a decree</b> against immersing vessels even in <b>a pit</b> of water <b>in one’s</b> own <b>courtyard due to a pit</b> situated <b>in the public domain.</b>
Abaye posed another challenge: This works out <b>well</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> but <b>with regard to a Festival,</b> when there is no prohibition against carrying from one domain to another, <b>what is there to say?</b> Rabba replied: The Sages <b>issued a decree</b> that it is prohibited to immerse a vessel on <b>a Festival, due to</b> the prohibition against immersing it <b>on Shabbat.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we issue a decree</b> in such a case? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel both <b>agree that one may bring</b> ritually impure <b>water into contact</b> with ritually pure water <b>in stone vessels in order to purify</b> the water. <b>However, one may not immerse</b> the impure water in a ritually impure vessel in order to purify the vessel at the same time. <b>And if it is so</b> that such a decree was issued, <b>let us</b> also <b>decree</b> here that <b>bringing</b> ritually impure water <b>into contact</b> with ritually pure water is prohibited <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>immersing</b> a ritually impure vessel in a ritual bath.
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that there is substance to this question? <b>If he has</b> other <b>good,</b> ritually pure, <b>water</b> to drink, <b>why do I</b> need <b>to bring this</b> ritually impure water <b>into contact</b> with the ritually pure water? <b>Rather,</b> one must say <b>that he does not have</b> suitable drinking water, <b>and since he does not have</b> other water, <b>he is</b> particularly <b>careful about</b> this water, so that it not become impure. Therefore, perforce, this must be an exceptional case, as the water became impure despite the precautions that were taken; and the Sages did not apply their decrees to unusual cases.
Abaye <b>raised an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may draw water</b> from a spring or a ritual bath on a Festival <b>with a</b> ritually <b>impure pail, and</b> the pail becomes ritually <b>pure</b> because while being filled with water, the bucket is completely immersed in the ritual bath. <b>And if it is so</b> that the Sages issued such a decree, <b>let us</b> also <b>decree</b> here that it is prohibited to draw water on Festival with a ritually impure pail <b>lest one come to immerse</b> the pail <b>by itself.</b> Rabba answered: <b>It is different there; since it is permitted for him</b> to immerse the pail <b>only by drawing</b> water with it, <b>he remembers</b> that it is prohibited to immerse a vessel by itself, and therefore there is no reason to issue a decree.
Abaye <b>raised an objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>, in which it was taught: With regard to <b>a vessel that was rendered ritually impure on the eve of a Festival, one may not immerse it on the Festival;</b> however, if it became impure <b>on</b> the <b>Festival</b> itself, <b>one may immerse it on the Festival. And if it is so</b> that the Sages issued such a decree, <b>let us</b> also <b>decree</b> here <b>that</b> it is prohibited to immerse a vessel that became impure on <b>a Festival due to</b> the prohibition against immersing a vessel that became impure on the <b>eve of a Festival.</b> Rabba answered: Contracting ritual <b>impurity on a Festival,</b> when all are ritually pure, <b>is an uncommon occurrence, and</b> the general principle is that in the case of <b>an uncommon occurrence, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> as a preventive measure.
Abaye <b>raised</b> yet another <b>objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a vessel that was rendered</b> ritually <b>impure by a primary source of impurity, one may not immerse it on a Festival.</b> However, if it was rendered impure only <b>by a derivative source of impurity,</b> meaning that the vessel came into contact with an object that was rendered impure by a primary source of impurity, so that the object has the status of first-degree ritual impurity and confers upon the vessel the status of second-degree ritual impurity, a type of impurity that applies to vessels only by rabbinic decree; in such a case, <b>one may immerse</b> the vessel <b>on a Festival. And if it is so</b> that the Sages issued such a decree, <b>let us</b> also <b>decree</b> here that it is prohibited to immerse <b>this,</b> a vessel rendered impure by a derivative source of impurity, <b>due to</b> the prohibition to immerse <b>that,</b> a vessel rendered impure by a primary source of impurity.
Rabba replied: <b>Where do you find</b> a case where people are particular about purifying a vessel that contracted ritual impurity from <b>a derivative source of impurity?</b> It is only in one situation, namely, <b>with regard to priests,</b> since they eat <i>teruma</i>, and <i>teruma</i> contracts ritual impurity even from a vessel that came into contact with only a derivative source of impurity. An ordinary person, who eats non-consecrated produce, does not go to the trouble of purifying such a vessel, since regular produce contracts ritual impurity only from a vessel that came into contact with a primary source of impurity, but not from a vessel that came into contact with a derivative source of impurity. And as for priests, the general principle is that <b>priests are vigilant;</b> they are careful not to allow their vessels to become impure. Therefore, impurity in the case of priests is considered a rare occurrence, with regard to which the Sages did not issue a decree.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof, <b>as Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: A menstruating woman who has no</b> ritually pure <b>clothes</b> to wear after she immerses herself in a ritual bath to purify herself, as all her clothes had become impure, and it is Shabbat or a Festival, when she is unable to immerse them, <b>may employ an artifice</b> to circumvent the prohibition <b>and immerse</b> herself <b>in her clothes.</b> She is permitted to purify herself, and when she immerses herself while wearing her garments, they become purified at the same time. <b>And if it is so</b> that the Sages issued such a decree, <b>let us</b> also <b>decree</b> that it is prohibited for the woman to immerse herself in her clothes <b>lest she come to immerse</b> the clothes by <b>themselves.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there; since it is permitted for her</b> to immerse the clothes <b>only by</b> wearing them as <b>garments, she remembers</b> that it is prohibited to immerse them by themselves and will not come to violate this prohibition.
Apropos Rabba’s view that one may not immerse a vessel on Shabbat lest he come to carry it four cubits in the public domain, <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that it is prohibited to immerse a vessel on Shabbat for a different reason: It is <b>a decree</b> issued by the Sages as a preventive measure <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>wringing.</b> After immersing certain items, such as clothes, one might come to wring them, and this is prohibited on Shabbat and Festivals as a subcategory of the biblically prohibited labor of threshing.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: This works out <b>well</b> with regard to <b>vessels that are fit for wringing,</b> such as clothes, but with regard to <b>vessels that are not fit for wringing, what is there to say?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said</b> to him: The Sages issued <b>a decree</b> against <b>these</b> vessels, which cannot be wrung, <b>due to those</b> vessels, which can be wrung. Abaye <b>raised</b> against Rav Yosef <b>all of these objections</b> that he had raised against Rabba, in an attempt to prove that the Sages did not issue such a decree, <b>and</b> Rav Yosef <b>answered him as we answered</b> in the name of Rabba.
<b>Rav Beivai said</b> a different reason: The prohibition against immersing a vessel on a Festival is <b>a decree</b> issued by the Sages <b>lest one</b> come to <b>delay</b> the immersion of his impure vessels. Were the Sages to permit him to immerse vessels on a Festival, he might delay immersing all of his impure vessels until the Festival, when he has more free time; and were he to leave ritually impure vessels in his possession for a lengthy period, he might come to defile items that must be kept ritually pure, such as <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Beivai:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that became ritually impure on the eve of a Festival, one may not immerse it on a Festival,</b> due to <b>a decree lest he</b> come to <b>delay</b> and keep impure vessels in his home in order to immerse them on the Festival.
<b>Rava said</b> yet a different reason: It is prohibited to immerse a vessel on Shabbat <b>because it looks as if he is repairing the vessel.</b> Since the vessel was previously unfit for use, and the act of immersion renders it usable, this is similar to the repair of a vessel, which Torah law proscribes on Shabbat and Festivals. The Gemara challenges this understanding: <b>If so, a person</b> should <b>likewise</b> be prohibited to immerse himself, because it looks as if he is repairing himself through purification. The Gemara answers: <b>A person</b> undergoing immersion <b>looks as if he is cooling</b> himself. Since it is not clearly evident that he is immersing in order to purify himself, as he might be bathing for his pleasure, there is no reason to prohibit the immersion.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: This works out <b>well</b> in a case where he immerses himself in <b>good,</b> clean <b>water,</b> in which it would be a pleasure to bathe; but if he immerses himself in <b>bad,</b> murky <b>water,</b> as the water of a ritual bath is not always sufficiently clean, <b>what is there to say? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Even in that case, his actions do not prove that his intention is to purify himself, as <b>sometimes a person comes</b> home

Daf 18b

<b>on a hot day and washes</b> himself <b>even in</b> putrid <b>water</b> in which flax <b>was soaked,</b> because the heat has made him so uncomfortable.
The Gemara raises another objection: This works out <b>well in the summer season;</b> however, <b>in the rainy season,</b> when people do not usually immerse themselves in water in order to cool off, <b>what is there to say? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Sometimes a person comes</b> home <b>from the field soiled with mud and excrement and washes</b> himself <b>even in the rainy season.</b>
The Gemara continues with another objection: This works out <b>well</b> and explains why it is permitted for one to immerse himself <b>on Shabbat,</b> when it is permitted to wash, and therefore it can be argued that it is not clearly evident that he is immersing in order to purify himself; but <b>on Yom Kippur,</b> when all bathing apart from ritual immersion is prohibited, <b>what is there to say?</b> His actions prove that his intention is to purify himself, and this should be prohibited because it looks as though he is repairing himself through purification.
<b>Rava said:</b> It is impossible to prohibit immersion on Yom Kippur alone, as <b>is there anything that is permitted on Shabbat and</b> the very same act is <b>prohibited</b> as labor <b>on Yom Kippur?</b> In fact, the prohibition against labor is more stringent on Shabbat than on Yom Kippur. <b>Rather, since it is permitted on Shabbat, it is also permitted on Yom Kippur.</b> The Sages did not issue decrees with regard to Yom Kippur that would make it more stringent than Shabbat. Therefore, since they allowed a person to immerse on Shabbat because it looks as if he is doing so for pleasure, to escape the heat or to remove dirt, and not necessarily in order to purify himself, they permitted it on Yom Kippur as well, even though it is evident in that situation that his immersion is for the purpose of achieving purity.
The Gemara asks: <b>Does Rava accept</b> the principle of: <b>Since? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>One who is concerned</b> about pain <b>in his teeth may not sip vinegar through them</b> on Shabbat in order to alleviate his toothache; <b>however, he may dip</b> his food in vinegar <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> during the meal and eat it, <b>and if he is healed</b> by the vinegar, <b>he is healed. And we raised a contradiction to this</b> mishna from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not sip</b> vinegar <b>and</b> immediately <b>spit</b> it <b>out,</b> as this is clearly done for medicinal purposes; <b>however, one may sip</b> the vinegar <b>and swallow</b> it, since it looks as though he is drinking it. This indicates that there is a permitted way to use vinegar even without dipping his food into it.
<b>And Abaye said: Also when we learned</b> this ruling in <b>the mishna, we learned</b> it with regard to the case of <b>one who sips and spits</b> it <b>out. Rava said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna prohibits sipping vinegar even in a case where <b>one sips and swallows</b> it, it is still <b>not difficult: Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> permits sipping vinegar <b>before dipping</b> one’s food in it, as he appears to be doing so for pleasure. <b>There,</b> the mishna prohibits sipping the vinegar <b>after dipping</b> his food in it, when it is clear that one is doing so for medicinal purposes only.
The Gemara completes its question: <b>And if it is so</b> that Rava accepts the principle of: Since, <b>let him say: Since it is permitted</b> to sip vinegar <b>before dipping, it is also permitted</b> to do so <b>after dipping.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rava retracted that</b> statement with regard to vinegar and accepted Abaye’s resolution of the difficulty, along with the principle of: Since.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> can it be determined <b>that he retracted that</b> teaching? <b>Perhaps he retracted this</b> statement with regard to immersion in a ritual bath on Yom Kippur. The Gemara answers: <b>This cannot enter your mind</b> that he retracted his view in that case, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All</b> who are <b>obligated in immersions immerse in their</b> usual <b>manner, both on the Ninth of Av and on Yom Kippur,</b> even though it is prohibited to wash on these days. Rava would certainly have aligned his opinion with the explicit ruling of a <i>baraita</i>.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel both <b>agree that one may bring</b> ritually impure <b>water into contact</b> with ritually pure water <b>in stone vessels</b> in order to purify the water. However, one may not immerse the impure water. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the mishna’s statement: <b>However, one may not immerse</b> the impure water? <b>Shmuel said: One may not immerse</b> an impure <b>vessel on account of its water</b> in order <b>to purify it on a Festival.</b> The Sages allowed impure water to be purified through contact with ritually pure water only in a stone vessel or in another vessel that does not contract impurity, but not in an impure vessel that would itself become purified through this immersion.
The Gemara asks: If that is its meaning, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is the mishna?</b> It is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>nor</b> with that of <b>the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not immerse an</b> impure <b>vessel on account of its water</b> in order <b>to purify</b> the vessel, <b>and one may not bring</b> impure <b>water into contact</b> with pure water <b>in a stone vessel</b> in order <b>to purify</b> the water; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: One may immerse</b> an impure <b>vessel on account of its water</b> in order <b>to purify</b> the vessel, <b>and one may bring</b> impure <b>water into contact</b> with pure water <b>in a stone vessel</b> in order <b>to purify</b> the water.
If so, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, then the ruling with regard to <b>bringing</b> impure <b>water into contact</b> with pure water in a stone vessel is <b>difficult,</b> as in the <i>Tosefta</i> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prohibits doing so, whereas the mishna permits it; and <b>if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then the ruling with regard to the <b>immersion</b> of an impure vessel on account of its water is <b>difficult,</b> as in the <i>Tosefta</i> the Rabbis permit this, while the mishna, as explained by Shmuel, prohibits it.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi; and <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> How so? <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and explain that the <b>first clause of</b> that <b><i>baraita</i>,</b> i.e., the first part of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement in the <i>Tosefta</i>, deals with <b>a Festival;</b> it is in that case that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prohibits immersing an impure vessel on account of its water, but bringing impure water into contact with pure water in a stone vessel would be permitted. <b>And the latter clause,</b> which extends the prohibition to bringing impure water into contact with pure water, is referring <b>to</b> the more stringent case of <b>Shabbat. And the entire mishna</b> is referring to <b>a Festival,</b> when it is permitted to purify impure water by bringing it into contact with pure water in a stone vessel.

Daf 19a

<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and on a Festival one is permitted even to immerse an impure vessel on account of its water in order to purify the vessel. <b>And the entire mishna</b> is referring <b>to Shabbat,</b> when it is prohibited to immerse an impure vessel, but it is permitted to purify impure water by bringing it into contact with pure water in a stone vessel.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a vessel that became ritually impure on the eve of a Festival, one may not immerse it during twilight,</b> a time period of doubtful status whether it is a weekday or a Festival, due to the possibility of violating the prohibition against immersing vessels on a Festival.
<b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even on a weekday one may not immerse</b> an impure vessel during twilight <b>because</b> the vessel <b>requires sunset.</b> After an impure vessel is immersed, it remains ritually impure for certain purposes until the sun has set and the stars have come out. If one immerses an impure vessel during the twilight period, then owing to the uncertainty as to whether it is day or night, he must wait another full day, until the next sunset, before using the vessel. It is therefore preferable not to put oneself in a situation where one might come to use a vessel before its purification process has been completed.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>the first <i>tanna</i> not require sunset?</b> It is clear that this is required. <b>Rava said: I found the Sages of the school of Rav sitting and saying</b> with regard to this issue that <b>they disagree about</b> whether or not to accept the principle that one’s <b>intention is evident from his actions. And what are the circumstances</b> of this dispute? They are, <b>for example,</b> a case <b>where one was holding a vessel in his hand and running along at</b> the time of <b>twilight to immerse it.</b>
This <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that the fact <b>that he is running along</b> indicates that <b>he knows that</b> the vessel <b>requires sunset.</b> If he arrives at the ritual bath late, he will realize that he must wait another day, and there is no concern that he might come to use the vessel on the same day. Consequently, it is prohibited to immerse the vessel during twilight on the eve of a Festival, as, since it may already be night and he will be unable to use the vessel until the next evening, immersing the vessel would be considered to be preparing something on a Festival for a weekday, which is prohibited. However, it is permitted to immerse a vessel during twilight on an ordinary weekday evening.
<b>And</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, <b>holds</b> that perhaps <b>he is running due to his work</b> that he has not finished on time, and not necessarily because he knows that the purification of his vessel requires sunset. He believes that he may use the vessel immediately upon immersion; therefore, the Sages decreed that one should never immerse vessels during twilight.
Rava continues: <b>And I said to them: With regard to</b> the principle that one’s <b>intention is evident from his actions, everyone agrees</b> that this is accepted. <b>Where they disagree</b> is, <b>for example,</b> in a case <b>where</b> a vessel <b>became impure through</b> contact with a creeping animal <b>less than a lentil-bulk</b> in size, <b>and</b> the vessel’s owner <b>came before the Sages to ask</b> whether a vessel <b>becomes impure through</b> contact with <b>less than a lentil-bulk or not. One Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, <b>holds</b> that <b>since he does not know this</b> matter that a creeping animal smaller than a lentil-bulk does not impart impurity, it stands to reason that <b>he also does not know</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>sunset;</b> therefore, there is reason to prohibit him from immersing vessels during twilight even on a weekday. <b>And one Sage,</b> the Rabbis, who permit such immersion on a weekday, <b>hold</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the size of a creeping animal that <b>he does not know, but</b> the requirement of <b>sunset he does know,</b> as it is stated explicitly in the Torah.
It was taught in the mishna that <b>one may immerse</b> on a Festival <b>from</b> one <b>principle to another</b> and from one group to another. The Gemara attempts to clarify the meaning of this statement: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> does one immerse <b>from</b> one <b>principle to another? One who wishes to make his winepress,</b> meaning to immerse and purify vessels for the sake of his winepress, <b>in addition to</b> the purification of <b>his</b> ritually impure <b>pitcher,</b> may do so. In other words, if at first he merely intended to immerse his impure pitcher, but subsequently changed his mind and decided to use it for his winepress, and he wishes to immerse the pitcher a second time for the sake of the winepress, it is permitted to do so.
Similarly, one who wishes to make <b>his pitcher in addition to</b> the purification of his vessels for the sake of <b>his winepress may do</b> so. That is to say, if he originally intended to use the pitcher for his winepress, and after immersing it he decided not to use it for that purpose, and now he wishes to immerse his pitcher a second time, it is permitted to do so. Since the second immersion does not purify the vessel or fulfill any obligation, it is not considered a proper immersion and is not prohibited on a Festival.
Similarly, <b>how</b> does one immerse <b>from one group to another?</b> If one <b>was</b> planning to <b>eat</b> the Paschal offering <b>with this group,</b> and he immersed himself or his ritually impure vessels for that purpose; and now he has reconsidered <b>and wishes to eat</b> the offering <b>with a different group,</b> and he wants to immerse himself or his vessels a second time for the second group, in such a case <b>he has permission</b> to do so even on a Festival, for the same reason: Since this immersion is not obligatory, it is not viewed as an immersion at all.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may bring peace-offerings</b> on a Festival, <b>but one may not place</b> his <b>hands on them,</b> as this is considered using animals, which is prohibited on a Festival by rabbinic decree. <b>However, one may not</b> bring <b>burnt-offerings,</b> apart from the obligatory daily and additional offerings of the day, because burnt-offerings are consumed entirely on the altar and not by people, and slaughter is permitted on a Festival only for the purpose of human consumption. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may bring</b> both <b>peace-offerings and burnt-offerings, and one may</b> even <b>place</b> his <b>hands on them.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ulla said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies only <b>to Festival peace-offerings,</b> an obligation of the Festival, <b>with respect to placing hands</b> on them, <b>and to burnt-offerings of appearance,</b> which must be brought over the course of the Festival, <b>with respect to sacrificing</b> them. As <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that the verse <b>“You shall observe [<i>vaḥaggotem</i>] it as a Festival to the Lord</b> seven days in the year” (Leviticus 23:41) indicates: <b>Festival peace-offerings [<i>ḥagiga</i>], yes,</b> they may be sacrificed even on a Festival day, but <b>burnt-offerings of appearance, no,</b> they may not. <b>And Beit Hillel hold: “To the Lord”</b> means that <b>anything</b> brought <b>as</b> an offering <b>to the Lord</b> may be sacrificed throughout the seven days of the holiday, even on the actual Festival day.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings,</b> which are not part of the obligations of the day, <b>all agree,</b> even Beit Hillel, that they <b>may not be sacrificed on a Festival. And likewise, Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Ulla’s statement from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to a burnt-offering that is not</b> part of the requirements <b>of the Festival,</b> such as a vow-offering or a gift-offering, <b>that it may not be sacrificed on a Festival, or with regard to peace-offerings that are</b> part <b>of the Festival</b> obligations, such as Festival peace-offerings or peace-offerings of rejoicing, <b>that they may be sacrificed on a Festival,</b> as the Festival is their designated time, and if one fails to bring them then he will be unable to sacrifice them later.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>With regard to what,</b> then, <b>did they disagree?</b> It is <b>with regard to a burnt-offering that is</b> part <b>of the Festival</b> requirements, such as the burnt-offering of appearance, <b>and with regard to peace-offerings that are not</b> part <b>of the Festival</b> obligations, such as vow-offerings and gift-offerings. <b>As Beit Shammai say: He may not bring</b> them, <b>and Beit Hillel say: He may bring</b> them. This <i>baraita</i> contradicts Ulla’s opinion that all agree that vow-offerings and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival.
The Gemara answers: <b>Resolve</b> the contradiction by emending the text, <b>and say as follows: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to burnt-offerings and peace-offerings that are not</b> part of the requirements <b>of the Festival,</b> such as vow-offerings and gift-offerings, <b>that they are</b> certainly <b>not sacrificed on a Festival, or with regard to peace-offerings that are</b> part <b>of the Festival</b> obligations, such as Festival peace-offerings or peace-offerings of rejoicing, <b>that they may be sacrificed on a Festival. With regard to what did they disagree?</b> It is <b>with regard to a burnt-offering that is</b> part <b>of the Festival</b> requirements, such as the burnt-offering of appearance, <b>as Beit Shammai say: He may not bring</b> it, <b>and Beit Hillel say: He may bring</b> it.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> There were never any grounds for objection from the outset, as <b>have you removed</b> all <b>the <i>tanna’im</i> from the world?</b> This <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute among <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s opinion was not unanimously accepted. <b>As it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>peace-offerings that come on account of a Festival on the Festival,</b> e.g., Festival peace-offerings or peace-offerings of rejoicing, <b>Beit Shammai say: One places</b> his <b>hands on them on the eve of the Festival and slaughters them on the Festival, and Beit Hillel say: One places</b> his <b>hands on them on the Festival</b> itself <b>and slaughters them on the Festival.</b>

Daf 19b

<b>However,</b> with regard to <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings, all agree</b> that <b>they</b> may <b>not be sacrificed on</b> the actual <b>Festival day,</b> as stated by Ulla and Rav Adda bar Ahava.
§ The Gemara comments that in this matter, <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> are like those <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who also disagreed about the same issue, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not bring a thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> due to the leavened bread</b> included <b>with it,</b> as a thanks-offering must be accompanied by a meal-offering of forty loaves, ten of which are leavened bread, which may not be eaten on Passover. <b>Nor</b> may one bring this offering <b>on <i>Shavuot</i> because it is a Festival,</b> on which one may not bring any offering, even one that is eaten, if it is not part of the Festival obligations. <b>However, a person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: But it says: “On the festival of <i>Matzot</i>, on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:16), to teach: <b>Any</b> offering <b>that comes on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, and any</b> offering <b>that does not come on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may not come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> or on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: A person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> and fulfill with it his obligation</b> to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing.</b> One fulfills the mitzva to rejoice on a Festival by eating the meat of offerings, and this obligation can be fulfilled with the meat of a thanks-offering. <b>But he does not fulfill</b> with it the obligation to bring <b>a Festival</b> peace-<b>offering.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i> cited above. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>one may not bring a thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> due to the leavened bread</b> included <b>with it.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: It is <b>obvious</b> that one may not bring this offering on Passover, as it contains leavened bread. <b>Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Shmuel bar Abba</b> who said: <b>Here,</b> this <i>baraita</i> is not discussing Passover itself; rather, <b>we are dealing with</b> a thanks-offering sacrificed on <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, i.e., on Passover eve, <b>and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>one may not bring consecrated</b> offerings <b>to a situation</b> where the time that they may be eaten is restricted, thereby increasing <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>disqualification.</b> Although it is permitted to eat leavened bread until the sixth hour of the fourteenth of Nisan, one may not bring a thanks-offering on Passover eve. The reason is that a thanks-offering may usually be eaten for one full day and the following night, and if it is brought on the eve of Passover, the time available before disqualification is reduced.
It was further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Nor</b> may one bring a thanks-offering <b>on <i>Shavuot</i> because it is a Festival.</b> The Gemara explains: This <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>However, a person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>When? If we say</b> he may bring it <b>on the Festival day</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>itself,</b> this is difficult, <b>as didn’t you say: Nor</b> may one bring a thanks-offering <b>on <i>Shavuot</i> because it is a Festival,</b> indicating that a thanks-offering may not be brought on an actual Festival day? The same should apply to <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Rather,</b> it means that one may bring it <b>on the intermediate days of the Festival.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> further taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: But it says: “On the festival of <i>Matzot</i>, on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,”</b> to teach: <b>Any</b> offering <b>that comes on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, and any</b> offering <b>that does not come on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may not come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> or on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.</b> This seems to indicate that thanks-offerings may not be brought on any Festival. <b>Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this: Now,</b> if <b>we may chop</b> kindling wood on the intermediate days of the Festival for the sake of the Festival, <b>is it necessary</b> to state that it is permitted to sacrifice <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings</b> on the intermediate Festival days? How can it be suggested that Rabbi Shimon prohibits bringing thanks-offerings on the intermediate days of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>?
<b>Abaye said: With regard to sacrificing</b> these offerings on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>everyone agrees that it is permitted. When they disagree,</b> it is not with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of a Festival but with respect <b>to determining when one is liable for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>You must not delay.</b> If one vows to bring an offering but fails to fulfill his pledge, how much time must pass before he transgresses the prohibition: “You shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22)?
<b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One states three Festivals</b> in the Torah, <b>even not in their</b> proper <b>order,</b> meaning not in accordance with the yearly cycle found in the Torah: Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, <i>Sukkot</i>. As soon as three Festivals have passed from the day a person took his vow, if he has yet to bring his offering, he has transgressed the prohibition against delaying. Therefore, the first <i>tanna</i> advises a person who vowed to bring a thanks-offering to do so on <i>Sukkot</i>, even if it is the first Festival after his vow, and even though it is not the first Festival listed by the Torah. If he fails to do so, he will have to make a special trip to Jerusalem in order to sacrifice the offering, as he will not be able to sacrifice it on Passover due to the leavened bread it contains, or on <i>Shavuot</i> because it does not have intermediate Festival days.
<b>But Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that if three Festivals have passed <b>in their</b> proper <b>order, yes,</b> he has violated the prohibition against delaying; but if they have passed <b>not in their</b> proper <b>order,</b> he has <b>not</b> violated the prohibition. If, for example, one vowed to bring an offering between Passover and <i>Shavuot</i>, he may put off bringing the offering until <i>Sukkot</i> of the following year, and therefore he would not be required to travel an extra time to Jerusalem specifically for this purpose.
The <i>baraita</i> further taught that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: A person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>When? If we say</b> that he means <b>on the intermediate days of the Festival, this is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rather,</b> he must be referring to <b>the Festival day</b> itself, <b>and he holds</b> that <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings may be sacrificed on a Festival.</b>
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> that he cited it</b> specifically as an example of a Festival? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> and this ruling too is related to the prohibition against delaying. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse did <b>not</b> have to <b>say “the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,” of which the</b> immediately preceding <b>verse was speaking;</b> it was only necessary to add the other Festivals. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> “the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” <b>stated?</b> It is <b>to say that this</b> Festival, i.e., <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>must be the last one</b> with regard to the prohibition against delaying; one transgresses the prohibition only if the three Festivals have passed in their proper order, so that <i>Sukkot</i> is the last of the three.
However, <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> It comes <b>to say that this</b> Festival is what <b>causes</b> a person to be late in fulfilling his vow. In his view, the prohibition against delaying does not depend on the number of Festivals. Rather, it means that by the time of <i>Sukkot</i>, the last Festival according to the yearly cycle found in the Torah, one must have brought all of his vow-offerings of that year. Even one who vowed to bring an offering just before <i>Sukkot</i> must bring his offering before the Festival ends.
It is taught in the <i>baraita</i>: A person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>and fulfill with it his obligation</b> to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing, but he does not fulfill</b> with it the obligation to bring <b>a Festival</b> peace-<b>offering.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: It is <b>obvious</b> that one does not fulfill his obligation to bring a Festival peace-offering with his thanks-offering. The Festival peace-offering <b>is an obligatory matter,</b> as everyone is obligated to bring this offering, and the principle is that <b>anything that is an obligatory matter must come only from that which is non-sacred,</b> meaning that one cannot bring an obligatory offering from an animal that has already been consecrated for another purpose. It follows that one cannot discharge his obligation to bring a Festival peace-offering with a thanks-offering, as he is already obligated to bring the latter and has consecrated the animal for this purpose.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in order to teach <b>that even if one specified</b> at the time of his vow that he is consecrating the animal as a thanks-offering on condition that it may be used as a Festival peace-offering as well, he nevertheless does not fulfill his obligation with it.
This teaching is <b>similar to</b> the question <b>that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish asked of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> vows and <b>says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks-offering, and I will</b> also <b>fulfill</b> my obligation to bring <b>a Festival</b> peace-<b>offering with it;</b> or if he says: <b>I am a nazirite,</b>

Daf 20a

<b>and I will shave</b> my head, meaning I will purchase the nazirite offerings that are brought when a nazirite shaves himself, <b>with second-tithe money,</b> which I am obligated in any case to bring to Jerusalem, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> With regard to the thanks-offering, <b>he has vowed</b> and must bring the offering, but <b>he does not fulfill</b> his obligation of the Festival peace-offering with it, as the latter offering must be brought from unconsecrated animals. Similarly, one who took the vow of naziriteship is <b>a nazirite, but he may not shave</b> his head and bring nazirite offerings purchased with second-tithe money.
In relation to the previous case, in which one makes a conditional statement and only part of his statement is accepted, the Gemara relates a somewhat similar incident: <b>A certain man said to</b> those tending to him, in the form of a will: <b>Give four hundred <i>zuz</i> to so-and-so, and let him marry my daughter. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <b>four hundred</b> <i>zuz</i> <b>he takes, but</b> as for the benefactor’s <b>daughter, if he wishes, he may marry</b> her, and <b>if he wishes, he</b> need <b>not marry</b> her.
The Gemara comments: <b>The reason</b> is solely <b>that he said</b> it in this manner: <b>Give him</b> the money <b>and let him marry</b> my daughter, mentioning the gift before the condition. <b>However, if</b> he specified the condition first, by <b>saying: Let him marry</b> my daughter <b>and give him</b> the money, in that case, <b>if he marries</b> her, <b>he takes</b> the money, but <b>if he does not marry</b> her, <b>he may not take</b> it.
The Gemara relates: <b>Mareimar sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> with regard to one who attaches a condition to his vow to bring a thanks-offering <b>in his own name,</b> without attributing it to the Sage who stated it. <b>Ravina said to Mareimar: You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in this manner,</b> without attribution, whereas <b>we teach it</b> in the form of a question that <b>Reish Lakish asked of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
§ <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Abba:</b> The verse concerning the burnt-offering that Aaron was commanded to sacrifice for the inauguration of the Tabernacle: <b>“And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation”</b> (Leviticus 9:16), indicates that the <i>halakha</i> of an obligatory burnt-offering is <b>similar to the regulation</b> governing <b>a gift burnt-offering.</b> This <b>teaches with regard to an obligatory burnt-offering</b> that it too <b>requires</b> the person bringing the offering to <b>place</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of the animal to be sacrificed.
Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: He <b>who told you</b> that this <i>halakha</i> requires an explicit biblical source, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion did he say this? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Beit Shammai, who do not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>obligatory peace-offerings from</b> that of <b>gift peace-offerings</b> by way of an analogy [<i>binyan av</i>], as they distinguish between the two with regard to the requirement of placing hands on the peace-offerings brought on a Festival. <b>As, if</b> it were the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, since they learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>obligatory peace-offerings from</b> that of <b>gift peace-offerings,</b> there being no distinction between the two categories, then <b>an obligatory burnt-offering should also not require a</b> special <b>verse</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> they can <b>learn</b> it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a gift burnt-offering</b> by means of an analogy.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> may it be shown that <b>Beit Hillel learn</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>obligatory peace-offerings from</b> those of <b>gift peace-offerings? Perhaps</b> they do not learn the <i>halakhot</i> of obligatory peace-offerings from those of gift peace-offerings. Rather, <b>they learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing obligatory peace-offerings <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>an obligatory burnt-offering:</b> Just as an obligatory burnt-offering requires the one bringing the offering to place his hands on the animal to be sacrificed, so too do obligatory peace-offerings. <b>And an obligatory burnt-offering itself requires</b> an explicit <b>verse</b> from which to derive this <i>halakha</i>, and perhaps the verse cited above is the source: “And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation.”
The Gemara challenges this argument: <b>What is different</b> about obligatory peace-offerings such <b>that</b> Beit Hillel <b>do not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing them <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> applying to <b>gift peace-offerings?</b> It is <b>that</b> gift peace-offerings are more <b>common,</b> and perhaps a different <i>halakha</i> applies to them. If so, <b>they should also not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing obligatory peace-offerings <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> applying to <b>an obligatory burnt-offering, as</b> the latter is <b>entirely burnt,</b> unlike peace-offerings.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing obligatory peace-offerings <b>is derived from between</b> the two of <b>them.</b> The Torah explicitly states that one must place hands on the heads of both obligatory burnt-offerings and gift peace-offerings. It is possible to extend the same obligation to obligatory peace-offerings by combining the two sources, as follows: If one says that an obligatory burnt-offering is different from an obligatory peace-offering because it is entirely burnt, gift peace-offerings prove that this is not the critical factor; and if one counters that gift peace-offerings are different from obligatory peace-offerings because they are common, an obligatory burnt-offering proves that this is not crucial. Therefore, there is no proof from here with regard to Beit Hillel’s position, as they too might learn the <i>halakha</i> governing an obligatory burnt-offering from the verse: “And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation.”
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself: <b>And do Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>obligatory peace-offerings do not require placing of hands</b> on the head of the animal? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to the placing of hands itself that it is required</b> in the case of obligatory peace-offerings. <b>With regard to what,</b> then, <b>did they disagree?</b> They disagreed with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that states that <b>immediately</b> following <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering is its <b>slaughter. As Beit Shammai say:</b> It is <b>not necessary</b> to be particular in this regard, and the ceremony of placing hands on the animal’s head may be performed even on the eve of the Festival, long before the animal is slaughtered. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is <b>necessary,</b> and therefore one who brings an offering on a Festival must place his hands on the animal’s head on the Festival itself.
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>said</b> what he said <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>immediately</b> following <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering is its <b>slaughter, that it is necessary. With regard to what,</b> then, <b>did they disagree?</b> They disagreed with regard to <b>the placing of hands itself</b> on the head of obligatory peace-offerings. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> It is <b>not necessary, and Beit Hillel say:</b> It is <b>necessary.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the basic dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was an incident involving Hillel the Elder, who brought his burnt-offering to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard in order to place</b> his <b>hands on</b> the animal’s head <b>on a Festival. The students of Shammai the Elder gathered around him</b> and <b>said to him: What is the nature of this animal</b> that you are bringing? Hillel, being humble and meek, did not want to quarrel with them in the Temple and therefore concealed the truth from them for the sake of peace. <b>He said to them: It is a female, and I have brought it as a peace-offering,</b> as burnt-offerings are always male. <b>He swung its tail for them</b> so that they would not be able to properly discern whether the animal was male or female, <b>and they departed.</b>
<b>On that day,</b> when the incident became known, suggesting that even Hillel had accepted Shammai’s view, <b>Beit Shammai gained the upper hand over Beit Hillel, and they sought to establish the <i>halakha</i></b> in this regard <b>in accordance with their</b> opinion. <b>But a certain Elder of the disciples of Shammai the Elder was there, and Bava ben Buta</b> was <b>his name, who knew that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel</b> in this matter. <b>And he sent</b> for

Daf 20b

<b>and brought all the</b> high-quality <b>sheep of Kedar that</b> were <b>in Jerusalem, and he stood them in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard and said: Anyone who wishes to place</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of an animal should <b>come and place</b> his <b>hands</b> there. <b>And</b> on <b>that day Beit Hillel gained the upper hand</b> over Beit Shammai, <b>and they established the <i>halakha</i></b> in this case <b>in accordance with their</b> opinion, <b>and there was no one there who disputed the matter in any way.</b>
<b>And</b> some time later <b>there was another incident involving a certain disciple from among the disciples of Beit Hillel who brought his burnt-offering to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard in order to place</b> his <b>hands on</b> the animal’s head on a Festival. <b>A certain disciple from among the disciples of Beit Shammai found him</b> and <b>said to him: What is this placing of hands?</b> Why do you place your hands on the animal’s head and thereby violate the statement of Beit Shammai? <b>He said to him: What is this silence?</b> Why do you not stay silent, as the <i>halakha</i> was not established in accordance with their opinion? <b>He silenced him with a rebuke, and he,</b> Beit Shammai’s disciple, <b>departed</b> quietly.
<b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> it is clear from here that <b>a Torah scholar whose colleague says something</b> reprimanding or insulting <b>to him</b> should <b>not answer back</b> with <b>something more than his colleague had said to him,</b> to avoid adding fuel to the fire, <b>as</b> in the above story <b>the one said to</b> the other: <b>What is this placing of hands? and</b> the latter <b>responded to</b> the former using the same language: <b>What is this silence?</b>
§ With regard to the dispute concerning the sacrifice of burnt-offerings of appearance on a Festival, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: Just as in a place where it is prohibited</b> to slaughter <b>for</b> the sake of <b>a common person [<i>hedyot</i>],</b> e.g., on Shabbat, <b>it is permitted</b> to slaughter offerings in the Temple <b>for the Most High,</b> such as the daily and additional offerings, then so too, with regard to <b>a place where it is permitted</b> to slaughter <b>for</b> the sake of <b>a common person,</b> e.g., on a Festival, <b>is it not right that</b> it should be <b>permitted for</b> the sake of <b>the Most High?</b> This argument should include burnt-offerings of appearance as well. <b>Beit Shammai said to them:</b> This is no proof. <b>Vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings prove</b> that this reasoning is not valid, <b>as</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to slaughter an animal on a Festival <b>for a common person</b> to eat, <b>but</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to slaughter vow-offerings and gift-offerings on a Festival <b>for</b> the sake of <b>the Most High.</b>
<b>Beit Hillel said to them: If vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings</b> may not be slaughtered on a Festival, that is <b>because they do not have a fixed time</b> and there is no obligation to sacrifice them on a Festival in particular, but can <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a burnt-offering of appearance, which has a fixed time,</b> the Festival itself? <b>Beit Shammai said to them: It too has no fixed time, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who did not bring</b> his <b>Festival offering on the first Festival</b> day <b>of <i>Sukkot</i> may bring</b> it <b>throughout the entire Festival, including the last Festival</b> day <b>of <i>Sukkot</i>,</b> on the Eighth Day of Assembly, as that day is regarded as part of <i>Sukkot</i> for this purpose. This shows that a burnt-offering of appearance need not be brought at a fixed time on the Festival either.
<b>Beit Hillel said to them:</b> Although a burnt-offering of appearance need not be sacrificed on a particular day of the Festival, nevertheless <b>it too has a fixed time,</b> albeit a lengthier one. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If the</b> entire <b>Festival passed and he did not bring his Festival-offering, he is not accountable for it.</b> That is to say, he is not required to bring another offering, as the mitzva has already passed. This indicates that the offering is limited specifically to the Festival days, unlike vow-offerings and gift-offerings, which may be brought at any time.
<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel in support of their own position: <b>But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <b>for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), which indicates that for you may food be prepared, <b>but not for the Most High? Beit Hillel said to them: But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “You shall observe it as a Festival <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:41), which teaches: <b>Anything</b> sacrificed <b>to the Lord</b> may be sacrificed? <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “for you”?</b> It means <b>for you, but not for gentiles; for you, but not for dogs.</b>
<b>Abba Shaul stated</b> the same disagreement <b>in a different formulation,</b> that Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai as follows: <b>Just as in a place where your stove is closed,</b> i.e., on Shabbat, when a person may not cook for himself, <b>your Master’s stove is open,</b> as it is permitted to light a fire on the altar and sacrifice offerings upon it, so too, <b>in a place where your stove is open,</b> i.e., on a Festival, when one may cook food that he will eat, <b>is it not right that your Master’s stove</b> should be <b>open? And</b> it <b>likewise</b> stands <b>to reason that your table should not be full while your Master’s table,</b> the altar, remains <b>empty.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i> and Abba Shaul <b>disagree</b> in their different versions of Beit Hillel’s statement? The Gemara explains: <b>One Sage,</b> Abba Shaul, <b>holds</b> that according to Beit Hillel, even <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings may be sacrificed on a Festival,</b> and therefore Beit Shammai could not cite as proof the fact that they may not be sacrificed, as they claim in the first <i>baraita</i>. <b>And one Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that according to Beit Hillel, vow-offerings and gift-offerings <b>may not be sacrificed on a Festival,</b> and therefore Beit Shammai could adduce this <i>halakha</i> in support of their opinion.
<b>Rav Huna said: According to the statement of the one who says</b> that <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival, you</b> should <b>not say that by Torah law they are</b> in fact <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed, <b>and</b> that it was <b>the Sages who issued a decree about them</b> that they should not be sacrificed on a Festival as <b>a preventive measure, lest one delay</b> sacrificing them until the Festival, when it is more convenient for him to bring them to the Temple, and thereby transgress the prohibition against delaying the fulfillment of one’s pledge.
This is not the reason; <b>rather,</b> according to this opinion, <b>they are not fit</b> to be sacrificed on a Festival <b>even by Torah law. As the two loaves</b> brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>are an obligation of</b> that <b>day, and there is no</b> reason <b>to issue a decree</b> about them <b>lest one</b> come to <b>delay</b> their offering, since they may be brought only on that Festival, and yet their baking and preparation <b>override neither Shabbat nor the Festival.</b> According to this view, anything that need not be performed on the Festival itself may not be done on the Festival.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to the statement of the one who says</b> that <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival,</b> if <b>one transgressed and slaughtered</b> those vow-offerings and gift-offerings on a Festival, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava said: He sprinkles the blood</b> of these offerings on the altar <b>in order to allow the meat to be eaten</b> on the Festival. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> however, <b>said: He sprinkles the blood in order to burn the sacrificial parts</b> of the animal, including the fats and other portions that are brought upon the altar, <b>in the evening.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the opinion of Rava and that of Rabba bar Rav Huna, since both agree that the blood is sprinkled? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where <b>the meat became</b> ritually <b>impure or was lost. According to Rava,</b> who holds that the blood is sprinkled in order to permit the meat to be eaten, by rabbinic decree <b>one may not sprinkle</b> the blood, as this sprinkling is not required for the Festival. On the other hand, <b>according to Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> who holds that the blood is sprinkled in order to burn the sacrificial parts upon the altar in the evening, <b>he does sprinkle</b> the blood, even though it does not enable him to eat the meat.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabba bar Rav Huna from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the lambs of <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> i.e., the two lambs sacrificed as peace-offerings that accompany the two loaves of bread brought on that Festival, if <b>one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>purpose,</b> i.e., at the time of slaughter his intent was to slaughter them as a different offering, <b>or</b> if <b>he slaughtered them</b> not at their proper time, <b>whether before their time or after their time,</b> the offerings themselves are valid, although the community has not fulfilled its obligation. What is to be done with them? <b>The blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled and the meat</b> should <b>be eaten. And if</b> the day he slaughtered the lambs <b>was Shabbat,</b> on which cooking or roasting the meat is prohibited, then since the sprinkling of the blood serves no purpose, neither with regard to their mitzva nor for any other matter, <b>he may not sprinkle</b> the blood. <b>And if</b> nevertheless <b>he sprinkled</b> the blood,

Daf 21a

the offering <b>is accepted on condition that</b> he <b>burn the sacrificial parts</b> that are brought upon the altar <b>in the evening</b> and not during the day. The wording of the <i>baraita</i> indicates that if the meat may not be eaten on that day, then only <b>if he</b> already <b>sprinkled</b> the blood, i.e., <b>after the fact, yes,</b> it is permitted; however, he may <b>not</b> sprinkle it <b><i>ab initio</i>. Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> it works out <b>well, but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara comments: Indeed, it is <b>difficult. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>A rabbinic decree concerning Shabbat is different from a rabbinic decree concerning a Festival,</b> as the Sages were more stringent with regard to Shabbat than with regard to Festivals.
§ <b>Rav Avya the Elder raised</b> the following <b>dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> If <b>an animal</b> is owned in partnership, <b>half of it</b> belonging <b>to a gentile and half of it to a Jew, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to slaughtering it on a Festival?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: It is permitted.</b> Rav Avya <b>said to him: And what is</b> the difference <b>between this</b> case <b>and</b> that of <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings?</b> Vow-offerings and gift-offerings are similar to jointly owned animals, as part of the animal is sacrificed upon the altar while the other part is eaten by the owner and the priest. Why, then, is it not similarly permitted to slaughter them on a Festival? Seeking to distract Rav Avya so that he need not answer his question, Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Look, <b>a raven flies</b> in the sky.
<b>When</b> Rav Avya <b>left, Rabba, son of</b> Rav Huna, <b>said to</b> his father: <b>Was this not Rav Avya the Elder, whom Master would recommend to</b> us, saying <b>that he is a great man?</b> If so, why did you treat him in that manner and evade his question? Rav Huna <b>said to him: What should I have done for him? Today I am</b> in a state best described by the verse: <b>“Let me lean against the stout trunks; let me couch among the apple trees”</b> (Song of Songs 2:5), meaning I am worn out and exhausted from all the communal responsibility that has fallen upon me, <b>and he asked me</b> about <b>something that requires reasoning</b> and careful examination, and therefore I could not provide an immediate answer.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what,</b> then, <b>is the reason?</b> The Gemara explains the difference between a jointly owned animal and a vow-offering or gift-offering: A jointly owned <b>animal, half of</b> which belongs <b>to a gentile and half to a Jew, may be slaughtered on a Festival, as it is impossible to</b> obtain <b>an olive-bulk of meat without slaughtering.</b> If a Jew wishes to eat even a small portion of meat, he has no alternative but to slaughter an entire animal, even though he will not use all of it. Therefore, it does not matter if part of the animal belongs to a gentile. <b>However, it is prohibited to slaughter vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings on a Festival,</b> because in this case there is no real joint ownership of the animal, <b>as</b> the <b>priests, when they receive</b> their portions of the meat of the offering, and similarly, when Israelites partake of the offering, <b>they receive</b> their portions <b>from the table of the Most High.</b> In other words, the entire offering belongs to God, and those who partake of it are considered guests at His table; and as stated above, one may not slaughter an animal on a Festival for the sake of God.
In continuation of the previous discussion, <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A</b> jointly owned <b>animal, half of</b> which belongs <b>to a gentile and half to a Jew, may be slaughtered on a Festival because it is impossible to</b> obtain <b>an olive-bulk of meat without slaughtering.</b> However, with regard to <b>dough, half</b> of which belongs <b>to a gentile and half to a Jew, it is prohibited to bake it on a Festival, as it is possible for him to divide it</b> in half <b>during the kneading</b> and bake only the part that belongs to the Jew.
<b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai raised an objection</b> from the following mishna: <b>Dough</b> for bread that is meant <b>for dogs, when</b> it is of such quality that even <b>shepherds eat of it,</b> is considered like regular bread. Accordingly, one <b>is obligated</b> to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from such dough, <b>and one</b> may use it to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., a joining of courtyards and a joining of Shabbat boundaries, <b>and to establish a merging of alleyways, and one recites a blessing</b> before and after eating <b>it, and one invites</b> those with whom he ate to recite Grace after Meals after eating <b>it, and it may be baked on a Festival,</b> like all foods fit for human consumption, <b>and a person fulfills his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on</b> the first night of <b>Passover with it</b> if it has not leavened.
With regard to the allowance to bake this dough, the Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> may it be baked on a Festival? <b>Isn’t it possible to divide it during the kneading,</b> so that he bakes only the portion to be eaten by people and leaves aside the part given to dogs? The Gemara answers: <b>Dough</b> for bread meant for <b>dogs is different, since it is possible to appease them with a carcass.</b> It is possible that one of his animals will die, and he will feed the carcass to the dogs, in which case all of the dough will be eaten by people.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Does Rav Ḥisda accept</b> the principle of <b>since,</b> i.e., that since it is possible that the situation may change, the <i>halakha</i> is not determined based on the current circumstances? <b>But wasn’t it stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the <i>halakha</i> governing one <b>who</b> intentionally <b>bakes on a Festival</b> day <b>for a weekday? Rav Ḥisda said: He is flogged</b> for desecrating the Festival. <b>Rabba said: He is not flogged.</b>
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>he is flogged</b> because he holds that <b>we do not say</b> that <b>since,</b> if <b>guests happen to</b> visit <b>him,</b> whatever he bakes <b>will be fit for him</b> on the Festival itself, <b>now too,</b> although guests have not yet arrived, <b>it is</b> considered <b>fit for him.</b> According to that logic, baking would not be considered a full-fledged transgression, and one cannot be forewarned about it and does not receive lashes. <b>Rabba,</b> however, <b>said: He is not flogged,</b> as he holds that <b>we do say</b> the principle of: <b>Since.</b> As Rav Ḥisda himself does not accept the principle of since, how can it be used to resolve a difficulty raised against him?
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts its previous answer: <b>Do not say</b> that dough for dogs is different, <b>since it is possible</b> that one of his animals will die and he will appease the dogs with the carcass. <b>Rather,</b> the reference here is to a case <b>where he has a carcass</b> ready, so that <b>it is certainly possible to appease them with the carcass.</b> Consequently, when the shepherds bake the dough, it is highly likely that they will consume it all themselves.
§ <b>They raised a dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> With regard to <b>the</b> Jewish <b>residents of a village [<i>baga</i>] upon whom</b> the authorities <b>imposed</b> the obligation to supply <b>flour</b> and bread <b>to the</b> gentile <b>military troops</b> serving in the area, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>baking it on a Festival?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to</b> them: <b>We examine</b> the matter: <b>If</b> those villagers can <b>give bread</b> from the soldiers’ quota <b>to a child and</b> the soldiers <b>are not particular</b> about it, then <b>each and every one</b> of the loaves <b>is fit for</b> a Jewish <b>child, and</b> therefore <b>it is permitted</b> to bake them. <b>But if</b> the soldiers do <b>not</b> allow anyone else to partake of their bread, <b>it is prohibited</b> to bake the loaves for them on a Festival.
The Gemara challenges Rav Huna’s lenient ruling: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was an incident involving Shimon the Timnite, who did not come</b> on <b>the night</b> of the Festival <b>to the study hall. In the morning, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava found him</b> and <b>said to him: Why did you not come last night to the study hall? He said to him: A military unit on a search mission</b> [<b><i>balleshet</i></b>] <b>came to our city and wanted to pillage the entire city. We slaughtered a calf</b> in order to placate them, <b>and we fed them</b> with it <b>and had them depart in peace.</b>
Rav Yehuda ben Bava <b>said to him: I wonder if your gain,</b> that which you saved by preventing the soldiers from taking your possessions, <b>was not outweighed by your loss,</b> the punishment for your desecration of the Festival. <b>As the Torah states:</b> “Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <b>for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), which indicates that food may be prepared for you, <b>but not for gentiles.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> did Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava say this? <b>Wasn’t</b> some portion of the calf <b>fit to be eaten by them?</b> The conclusion seems to be that even if a Jew may eat from an animal, it may not be slaughtered on a Festival for the sake of a gentile.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In that case it <b>was a calf with a condition that would cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> which may not be eaten by Jews. The Gemara challenges: <b>But wasn’t it</b> still <b>fit to be eaten by dogs,</b> and it could be argued that it was slaughtered for the sake of dogs belonging to Jews?
The Gemara answers: The question of whether or not one may perform prohibited labor on a Festival for the sake of dogs <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done for you.” By inference, from that which is stated: “Every soul,” I</b> might <b>derive</b> that <b>even the soul of an animal is included, similar to</b> that <b>which is stated: “And he that kills the soul of an animal shall pay it”</b> (Leviticus 24:18), indicating that the life force of an animal is also called a soul. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> and emphasizes: <b>“For you,”</b>

Daf 21b

indicating <b>for you, but not for dogs;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> When the verse states “every soul,” it comes to teach that <b>even the soul of an animal is included. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “for you”?</b> It means <b>for you, but not for gentiles.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include dogs</b> among those on whose behalf one is permitted to perform a labor on a Festival, <b>and to exclude gentiles?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>I include dogs because</b> the responsibility for <b>their sustenance is</b> incumbent <b>upon you,</b> as one is obligated to feed the animals in his possession; <b>and I exclude gentiles because</b> the responsibility for <b>their sustenance is not</b> incumbent <b>upon you.</b>
With regard to this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: And according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said</b> that the verse indicates: <b>“For you,” but not for dogs, how</b> are <b>we</b> permitted to <b>cast date stones to animals on a Festival?</b> Since date stones are not fit for human consumption, they should be considered <i>muktze</i>, and therefore it should be prohibited to handle them.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Since they are fit for fuel,</b> they may be handled, and therefore they may also be given to animals. Abaye objected: This works out <b>well in</b> the case of <b>dry</b> date stones; but <b>in</b> the case of <b>moist ones,</b> which are not suited for fuel, <b>what is there to say? He said to him: They are fit for a large fire,</b> which dries them out, after which they burn well.
Abaye raised another objection: This works out <b>well in</b> the case of <b>a Festival,</b> when it is permitted to fuel a fire, but <b>in</b> the case of <b>Shabbat, what is there to say?</b> Why should one be permitted to handle date stones on Shabbat? Rav Yosef answered: <b>We carry them along with bread.</b> We place the date stones upon a loaf of bread and move them together with it. This is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A person may perform all his needs with bread;</b> as long as the bread remains edible, he need not be concerned that he is treating the bread contemptuously.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the ruling of Rav Huna that one is permitted to bake for gentiles on a Festival if they allow a Jew to eat of the bread <b>differs from</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One may invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on Shabbat,</b> as he will certainly not cook for him on Shabbat, and it is permitted to give a gentile food that was prepared the day before. <b>But one may not invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on a Festival;</b> this is prohibited as <b>a preventive measure lest he</b> come to cook <b>more for</b> the gentile’s <b>sake.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi holds that one may not prepare more for a gentile, even if the meal is primarily meant for Jews.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Even on Shabbat as well,</b> one may <b>not</b> invite a gentile for a meal <b>due to the</b> wine <b>remnants in the cups.</b> Once a gentile has drunk wine from a cup, whatever remains in the cup may not be used and is therefore considered <i>muktze</i>. Therefore, a Jew may not host a gentile on Shabbat lest he come to handle the <i>muktze</i> wine remnants on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, our</b> cups <b>should also</b> be prohibited, as they too contain wine remnants that have no use whatsoever and should therefore be considered <i>muktze</i>. The Gemara answers: The remnants in <b>our</b> cups <b>are fit for chickens.</b> The Gemara objects: If so, the remnants in <b>their</b> cups <b>are also fit for chickens.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: The remnants in <b>their</b> cups are <b>items</b> from which it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive any <b>benefit</b> whatsoever; consequently, they may not be handled at all.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let him move</b> what remains of the wine <b>on account of the cup,</b> which is a vessel that may be handled, as the wine remnants should be considered nullified in relation to the cup. <b>Didn’t Rava say: One may move a coal pan [<i>kannuna</i>] on account of the ashes</b> that can be used to cover filth, <b>even though there are broken pieces of wood on it</b> that have no use? This indicates that one may move something that is <i>muktze</i> along with something else that one is permitted to handle.
The Gemara rejects this argument: There is a difference between the two cases. <b>There,</b> the broken sticks <b>are not items from which</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive any <b>benefit</b> but are merely <i>muktze</i>, whereas <b>here,</b> what remains of the wine in the gentile’s cup <b>is an item from which</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive any <b>benefit,</b> and therefore the prohibition is more stringent.
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But let it be like a chamber pot for feces,</b> which may be removed from a room because it is repulsive. One should likewise be permitted to discard the remnants of these cups, since it is unseemly to leave them on the table. Ravina <b>said to him:</b> If the cups contain such remnants, they may be removed, but may <b>one make a chamber pot for feces <i>ab initio</i>?</b> The Sages ruled that one may not invite a gentile for a meal on Shabbat so as to avoid such complications.
In summary of this <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara states that <b>Rava authorized</b> the Sage <b>Mar Shmuel,</b> from the house of the Exilarch, to deliver a public lecture, <b>and</b> the latter <b>taught: One may invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on Shabbat, but one may not invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on a Festival</b> as <b>a preventive measure, lest he</b> come to cook <b>more for his sake.</b> It is related about <b>Mareimar and Mar Zutra</b> that <b>when a gentile would happen</b> to come <b>to their</b> house <b>on a Festival, they would say to him: If you are satisfied with</b> the food <b>that we have prepared for ourselves, good; and if not, we will not go to</b> any <b>extra trouble on your account.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: A person may not heat water</b> on a Festival in order <b>to</b> wash <b>his feet unless it is</b> also <b>fit for drinking,</b> as they hold that kindling a fire on a Festival is permitted only for the sake of preparing food, but not for washing. <b>But Beit Hillel permit</b> one to kindle a fire on a Festival even for washing. <b>A person may kindle</b> a large <b>fire and warm himself at it.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a fire, who taught it?</b> Is <b>it a statement</b> accepted by <b>all,</b> including Beit Shammai, <b>and Beit Shammai differentiate between benefit</b> affecting <b>one’s entire body and benefit</b> affecting <b>a single limb,</b> so that they agree that kindling a fire to heat one’s entire body is similar to kindling a fire for food and is therefore permitted, while heating water to wash one’s feet remains prohibited? <b>Or perhaps Beit Hillel taught it, but Beit Shammai do not differentiate</b> between the two cases, and they permit kindling a fire on a Festival only for the purpose of preparing food.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from an explicit <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say: A person may not make a fire and warm himself at it, but Beit Hillel permit</b> it. It is clear from here that the latter clause of the mishna was taught only in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabban Gamliel was stringent</b> about <b>three things in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai: One may not insulate hot food on a Festival</b> for Shabbat <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> but rather one ought to do so on the eve of the Festival; <b>and one may not set up</b> a metal <b>candelabrum</b> that fell <b>on a Festival; and one may not bake thick loaves</b> on a Festival <b>but only thin ones,</b> due to the great effort entailed in preparing the former. <b>Rabban Gamliel said: From the days of my father’s household they would never bake thick loaves</b> on a Festival, <b>but</b> only <b>thin ones.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: What shall we do for your father’s household, who were stringent with themselves</b> but <b>lenient with all of the Jewish people, to</b> allow them to <b>bake thick loaves and cakes baked on coals.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that Rabban Gamliel would not permit the insulation of hot water on a Festival <i>ab initio</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he prepared a joining of cooked foods [<i>eiruv tavshilin</i>], what is the reason that Beit Shammai</b> prohibit it? <b>And if</b> it speaks of a case <b>where he did not set aside an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i>, what is the reason for</b> the lenient ruling of <b>Beit Hillel? Rav Huna said: Actually,</b> I will <b>say to you</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where one did not prepare an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i>,</b> but Beit Hillel hold that <b>the Sages</b> nevertheless <b>permitted him</b> to prepare what he needs for <b>his</b> basic <b>sustenance.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>one who did not prepare an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i></b> on the eve of a Festival, others <b>may bake one loaf</b> of bread <b>for him, and cook one pot</b> of food <b>for him,</b>

Daf 22a

<b>and kindle a lamp for him. They said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: They may even roast a small fish for him. That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who did not prepare an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i>,</b> others <b>may bake one loaf</b> of bread <b>for him, and insulate one pot</b> of food <b>for him, and kindle a lamp for him, and heat one</b> small <b>jug [<i>kiton</i>]</b> of water <b>for him. And some say: They may even roast a small fish for him.</b>
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> one can say that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where one prepared</b> an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i>, and nevertheless, if he did not insulate hot food on the eve of the Festival for Shabbat he may not do so on the Festival itself, because <b>insulating</b> hot food <b>is different, as it is evident that he is acting with Shabbat in mind</b> and not for the Festival. Beit Shammai view this as a desecration of the sanctity of the Festival.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava’s opinion from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥananya says</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bake</b> on a Festival for Shabbat that occurs on the following day <b>unless he established a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>with bread, and he may not cook</b> for Shabbat <b>unless he established a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>with a cooked dish, and he may not insulate</b> hot food for Shabbat <b>unless he</b> already <b>had hot food insulated from the eve of the Festival. But</b> this indicates that if <b>he had hot food insulated, he may in any case act</b> in that manner and insulate hot food for Shabbat, even though <b>it is evident that he is acting with Shabbat in mind.</b> This shows that even according to Ḥananya, who rules in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, it is permitted to insulate hot food on a Festival for Shabbat.
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he established a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>for this,</b> meaning he baked and cooked before the Festival for the sake of an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>but he did not establish a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>for this,</b> i.e., he did not insulate hot food for Shabbat on the Festival eve. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, according to Beit Shammai,</b> with Rabban Gamliel’s household being stringent upon themselves in this regard.
§ The mishna states that one of the three stringencies that Rabban Gamliel practiced in accordance with Beit Shammai was that on a Festival <b>one may not set up a candelabrum</b> that fell. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> prohibited act <b>does one perform</b> when he sets a candelabrum upright? <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Bisna said: Here, we are dealing with a candelabrum</b> composed <b>of segments</b> that come apart; it is prohibited to reassemble such a candelabrum <b>because it looks like building. As Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>there is</b> a prohibition against <b>building with regard to vessels,</b> and therefore the pieces of this candelabrum may not be reconnected, whereas <b>Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition against <b>building with regard to vessels, and there is</b> also <b>no</b> prohibition against <b>dismantling with regard to vessels.</b> One may therefore reattach the pieces of the candelabrum if they came apart.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ulla</b> once <b>happened to</b> come to <b>the house of Rav Yehuda</b> on a Festival. Ulla’s <b>servant stood and tilted the</b> oil <b>lamp [<i>sheragga</i>],</b> diverting most of the oil to one side, with the intention of preventing the oil from reaching the wick so that the light would be extinguished more quickly. <b>Rav Yehuda raised an objection to Ulla</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught: <b>One who adds oil to a lamp</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable for</b> performing the prohibited labor of <b>kindling</b> on Shabbat, <b>and one who supplies himself</b> with oil <b>from</b> a lit lamp on Shabbat <b>is liable for</b> performing the prohibited labor of <b>extinguishing,</b> as he causes the light to be extinguished more quickly. This indicates that any action, even an indirect one, that causes a lamp to be extinguished earlier than it would have otherwise is considered extinguishing. Here too, by tilting the lamp, the servant extinguished a light on the Festival, which is prohibited. Ulla <b>said to him:</b> You are indeed correct; the act was performed by my servant <b>without my knowledge.</b>
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> governing extinguishing on a Festival, <b>Rav said: It is permitted to trim the end of a wick</b> that has become charcoal, so that it will burn better; this is not considered extinguishing.
With regard to this same issue, <b>Abba bar Marta raised a dilemma before Abaye: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>extinguishing a lamp</b> that is burning in a room on a Festival <b>for another matter,</b> a euphemism for marital relations? Since it is prohibited to have relations in a room where a lamp is burning, may one extinguish a lamp for this purpose? Abaye <b>said to him:</b> One may not extinguish it, as <b>it is possible</b> to have relations <b>in a different room.</b>
Abba bar Marta continued: If <b>he does not have a different room, what</b> should he do? Abaye replied: <b>It is possible to erect for oneself a partition</b> out of sheets and engage in relations on the other side of the partition. Abba bar Marta asked further: If he <b>does not have</b> sheets <b>to erect a partition, what</b> should he do? Abaye answered: <b>It is possible to invert a vessel over</b> the lamp in order to hide the light. Abba bar Marta further inquired: If <b>he does not have a vessel, what</b> should he do? Abaye <b>said to him: It is prohibited;</b> one may not extinguish the lamp.
Abba bar Marta <b>raised an objection to</b> Abaye’s opinion from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not extinguish a piece of wood in order to save it</b> from being needlessly burned, <b>but if</b> he extinguishes it <b>so that the house or a pot not become smoky, it is permitted.</b> This shows that it is permitted to extinguish a fire on a Festival if it serves people’s needs. Abaye <b>said to him: That</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who permits the performance of prohibited labors on a Festival for all of one’s needs and not only for the preparation of food; <b>when I spoke,</b> it was <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree.
Further on the topic of extinguishing, <b>Abaye raised a dilemma before Rabba: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to extinguishing a fire on a Festival?</b> He clarified his question: <b>Where there is danger to life, I have no dilemma, as</b> in that case <b>it is permitted even on Shabbat. When I raised the dilemma,</b> it was with regard to a case <b>involving</b> only <b>monetary loss. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rabba <b>said to him: It is prohibited.</b>
Abaye <b>raised an objection to his</b> opinion from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>One may not extinguish a piece of wood in order to save it</b> from being needlessly burned, <b>but if</b> he extinguishes it <b>so that the house or a pot not become smoky, it is permitted.</b> This indicates that extinguishing a fire on a Festival is permitted even if only to prevent a small loss. Rabba replied: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda; when I spoke,</b> it was <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
§ <b>Rav Ashi raised a dilemma before Ameimar: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>painting an eye</b> with a medicinal ointment <b>on a Festival?</b> He elaborated on his question: <b>Where there is a danger</b> to the eye, <b>for example,</b> the illnesses called <b><i>rira</i>, <i>ditza</i>, <i>dema</i>, <i>dimata</i>, and <i>kadaḥta</i>,</b> or the <b>beginning of an inflammation, I have no dilemma, as</b> in such cases <b>it is permitted</b> to apply an ointment <b>even on Shabbat. When I raised the dilemma,</b> it was with regard to less serious ailments, such as at the <b>end of an inflammation, or</b> in order to <b>brighten one’s eyesight. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such cases? Ameimar <b>said to him: It is prohibited.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>raised an objection to him</b> from the same <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not extinguish a piece of wood</b> in order to save it from being needlessly burned, but if he extinguishes it so that the house or a pot not become smoky, it is permitted. This indicates that a prohibited labor is permitted on a Festival, if it is performed for the sake of a bodily need. <b>And</b> Ameimar <b>answered him as we answered</b> before, that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ameimar permitted painting an eye</b> for medicinal purposes <b>on Shabbat by</b> means of <b>a gentile. Some say</b> that <b>Ameimar himself painted</b> his <b>eye on Shabbat by</b> means of <b>a gentile. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What is your reasoning</b> in permitting this practice? You must rely upon that which <b>Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, said: All the needs of an ill person</b> whose life is not in danger <b>are performed by means of a gentile on Shabbat. And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Hamnuna said:</b> With regard to <b>any matter in which there is no</b> life-threatening <b>danger</b> but only potential illness, <b>one says to the gentile</b> to perform the act, <b>and</b> the gentile <b>performs</b> the act for him.
However, <b>this applies</b> only <b>where</b> the ill person, or any other Jew, <b>does not assist</b> the gentile. <b>But</b> in this case <b>the Master,</b> Ameimar, <b>assists</b> the gentile while the ointment is being applied, <b>as he closes and opens</b> his <b>eye,</b> thereby allowing the ointment to penetrate more deeply. Therefore, this should be prohibited. Ameimar <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>There is</b> also the opinion of <b>Rav Zevid, who holds in accordance with your</b> opinion; he, too, raised the objection that it should be prohibited due to the fact that the Jew assists the gentile. <b>And I</b> already <b>answered him:</b> The assistance provided by one who <b>assists</b> another in performing a task that the other could essentially have performed himself <b>is insubstantial.</b> Inasmuch as the action is primarily performed by the gentile, the minor assistance given by the Jew may be overlooked.
The Gemara further relates that <b>Ameimar permitted painting an eye</b> with a medicinal ointment <b>on the second day of the festival of Rosh HaShana</b> if the eye is causing pain and requires treatment. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But didn’t Rava say</b> that if a person <b>died on the first day of a Festival, gentiles may attend to his</b> burial; if he died <b>on the second day of a Festival</b> observed in the Diaspora, <b>Jews may attend to his</b> burial? <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even on the second day of the festival of Rosh HaShana,</b>

Daf 22b

<b>which is not so with regard to an egg.</b> With regard to an egg laid on a Festival, the two days of Rosh HaShana are considered one long day and a single period of sanctity. It was only in deference to the dead that the Sages were lenient with regard to burial on the second day of Rosh HaShana, but with regard to all other matters, the two days of Rosh HaShana are viewed as one day and are governed by the same <i>halakha</i>.
Ameimar <b>said to him: I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of the Sages <b>of Neharde’a, who state</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>even with regard to an egg</b> laid on the Festival and other matters, as there is no difference between the two days of Rosh HaShana and the two days of other Festivals. <b>And what is your reasoning</b> that you are concerned? Is it that <b>perhaps they will extend</b> the month of <b>Elul</b> and declare it a thirty-day month, which would mean that the second day of the Festival is the first of Tishrei, the true date of Rosh HaShana? But <b>didn’t Rav Ḥinnana bar Kahana say: From the days of Ezra and onward we have not found</b> that the month of <b>Elul</b> was made <b>a full,</b> thirty-day month, and therefore there is no cause for this concern.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not bake thick loaves</b> on a Festival <b>but only thin ones. The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>one may not bake thick bread on Passover,</b> as it might become leavened before it has a chance to bake, <b>whereas Beit Hillel permit</b> it. <b>And how much</b> thickness renders a loaf <b>thick bread</b> that is permitted by Beit Hillel? <b>Rav Huna said:</b> It is up to a thickness of one <b>handbreadth, as we find likewise with regard to the shewbread</b> in the Temple, which must also be unleavened and which was one <b>handbreadth</b> thick.
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> argument of Rav Huna: <b>If</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> this leniency <b>with regard to</b> the shewbread that is prepared by priests, who are <b>vigilant</b> about the mitzvot and ensure that the dough is not leavened, would <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> bread that is prepared by ordinary people, who are <b>not</b> as <b>vigilant?</b> Furthermore, <b>if they said</b> this <b>with regard to</b> the shewbread, which is <b>well-kneaded [<i>amela</i>] bread,</b> would <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to bread that is not</b> as <b>well kneaded?</b>
Rav Yosef continues: <b>If they stated</b> this leniency <b>in</b> the case of <b>dry wood,</b> which was used in the Temple, as it would burn well and bake the bread quickly, would <b>they say</b> the same <b>in</b> the case of <b>moist wood,</b> which is what most people use to heat their ovens? Furthermore, <b>if they said</b> this <b>with regard to</b> the <b>hot oven</b> found in the Temple, would <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> a standard <b>oven,</b> which is typically <b>cold</b> in comparison to that of the Temple? And lastly, <b>if they said</b> this <b>with regard to</b> the Temple’s <b>metal oven,</b> which warms up quickly, would <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> the <b>earthenware oven</b> that most people use to bake their bread?
<b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: I asked my teacher in private, and who is</b> this teacher? It is <b>Rav.</b> Rav Yirmeya asked him: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>thick bread?</b> Rav explained that it means <b>a large quantity</b> of <b>bread,</b> a large amount of dough prepared in a single session. The concern here is not that the bread might become leavened, but that its preparation involves unnecessary exertion on the Festival.
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: I asked</b> this of <b>my teacher in private; and who is</b> Rav’s teacher? It is <b>our holy Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. And he explained the matter as follows: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>thick bread?</b> It means <b>a large quantity</b> of <b>bread. And why do they call it thick bread?</b> It is <b>because it is</b> greatly <b>expanded at the</b> time of <b>kneading</b> and therefore looks very thick. <b>Alternatively, in the place where this <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna lived, <b>a large quantity</b> of <b>bread was called thick bread.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, since</b> the prohibition here is <b>because he exerts himself unnecessarily,</b> then <b>why</b> did the <i>baraita</i> teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> with respect to <b>Passover?</b> The same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>with regard to the other Festivals as well.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> the <i>halakha</i> is not limited to Passover. <b>But the <i>tanna</i></b> who taught this <i>halakha</i> <b>was dealing</b> at the time <b>with the festival</b> of <b>Passover</b> and therefore mentioned this <i>halakha</i> in relation to that Festival, even though it applies in equal fashion to the other Festivals. The Gemara comments that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bake a large quantity of bread on</b> any <b>Festival, whereas Beit Hillel permit</b> it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Rabban Gamliel <b>also said three things as leniencies,</b> in opposition to the view of most of the Sages: <b>One may sweep the room of the couches</b> on a Festival, i.e., the dining room, where they would recline on couches to eat, as there is no concern that by sweeping the room one might come to fill in the holes and level the ground. <b>And one may place incense</b> consisting of fragrant herbs on burning coals in order to perfume one’s house <b>on a Festival. And one may prepare a whole kid</b> goat, meaning a kid goat roasted whole, with its entrails over its head, <b>on the night of Passover,</b> as was the custom when they roasted the Paschal lamb in the Temple. However, <b>the Rabbis prohibit</b> all three practices: It is prohibited to sweep lest one come to level the ground, it is prohibited to burn incense because it does not meet the criteria of permitted food preparation, and it is prohibited to eat a kid that was roasted whole on the night of Passover because it would appear as if he were eating consecrated food outside the Temple.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Asi said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> with regard to incense applies only to a case where one wishes to burn the incense in order <b>to perfume</b> his garments. <b>However,</b> if he burns the incense in order <b>to</b> enjoy the <b>smell, all agree</b> that this is like other bodily pleasures, the satisfaction of which has the same status as food preparation, and it is therefore <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav Asi’s understanding of the mishna from the following <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not sweep the room of the couches on a Festival</b> lest he fill in holes and level the ground, <b>but</b> in <b>the house of Rabban Gamliel they did sweep,</b> as they did not share this concern. <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok said: On many occasions I followed Father,</b> Rabbi Tzadok, <b>into Rabban Gamliel’s house, and</b> I observed that <b>they would not</b> actually <b>sweep the room of the couches on a Festival, but</b> rather they would do the following: <b>They</b> would <b>sweep</b> the room <b>on the eve of the Festival and spread sheets over it</b> so that it would not become dirty, and <b>on the following day, when</b> the <b>guests entered, they removed the sheets, and it turned out that the house was cleaned on its own.</b> The other Sages <b>said to him: If so, it is permitted to do so on Shabbat as well,</b> and there is no dispute in that case.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: Similarly, <b>one may not place incense</b> on burning coals <b>on a Festival, but</b> in <b>the house of Rabban Gamliel they did place</b> incense. <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok said: On many occasions I followed Father into Rabban Gamliel’s house, and</b> I noticed that <b>they would not</b> actually <b>place incense</b> on burning coals <b>on a Festival, but</b> rather they would <b>bring perforated coal pans [<i>ardaska’ot</i>] made of iron, filled them with</b> fragrant <b>smoke on the eve of the Festival, and plugged their holes on the Festival eve</b> so that their fragrant smell would not escape. <b>On the following day, when</b> the <b>guests entered, they opened the holes,</b> releasing the smell throughout the house, <b>and it turned out that the house was perfumed on its own.</b>
The other Sages <b>said to him: If so, it is permitted to do so on Shabbat as well.</b> This shows that the issue was not the perfuming of clothes but rather the burning of incense for the smell in the house. It follows that the Sages prohibit the practice even when the incense is burned for the enjoyment of the smell, against the opinion of Rav Asi.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts its previous statement and says that <b>if this was stated, it was stated as follows: Rav Asi said</b> that the <b>dispute</b> with regard to incense applies only to a case where one burns the incense in order <b>to</b> enjoy the <b>smell. However,</b> if he burns the incense in order <b>to perfume</b> his garments, all agree that it is <b>prohibited.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>smoking</b> fruit on a Festival with incense in order to enhance its aroma? <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: It is prohibited,</b> as it is not included in the category of permitted food preparation. <b>And Shmuel said: It is permitted. Rav Huna said: It is prohibited because he extinguishes</b> some of the coals when he sprinkles the aromatic powder on them. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him: And let the Master say</b> that it is prohibited <b>because he kindles</b> the coals, as afterward the fragrant spices cause the coals to burn even more strongly; why are you not concerned about this? Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Two prohibitions are indeed violated: <b>Its beginning</b> involves <b>extinguishing, and its end</b> involves <b>kindling.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> Sprinkling the aromatic spices <b>on the coals</b> themselves <b>is</b> in fact <b>prohibited</b> for the aforementioned reasons.

Daf 23a

However, placing them <b>on</b> a scalding fragment of <b>earthenware is permitted,</b> as there is no concern of extinguishing or kindling.
<b>And Rabba said:</b> Placing the spices <b>on</b> a hot piece of <b>earthenware is also prohibited, because it produces</b> a new <b>scent</b> in the earthenware, and one may not create new things on a Festival. The Gemara notes that similarly, <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both said</b> the following: <b>It is prohibited to overturn a cup</b> containing perfume <b>onto silk garments on a Festival. What is the reason</b> for this prohibition? It is <b>because it produces</b> a new <b>scent</b> in the garment.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case discussed in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may press</b> a piece of aromatic wood between his fingers <b>and smell it, and one may</b> also <b>snip off</b> a piece of it in order to release its fragrance <b>and smell it?</b> In those cases too he produces a scent. The Gemara answers: <b>There, the scent exists in any case, and he</b> merely <b>adds to the fragrance,</b> as his pressing or snipping causes the smell to be stronger. <b>Here,</b> on the other hand, where he overturns a cup of perfume on clothing, <b>he produces</b> a new <b>scent. Rava,</b> however, <b>said:</b> It is <b>even permitted</b> to sprinkle the aromatic spices <b>on</b> the <b>coals</b> themselves, <b>just as it is</b> permitted to place <b>meat on coals</b> for roasting.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil</b> once <b>taught at the entrance to the house of the Exilarch</b> that <b><i>ketura</i> is permitted</b> on a Festival; but he did not add any further clarification. <b>Ameimar said to him: What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>ketura</i>? If</b> it means <b>tying</b> [<b><i>ketura</i></b>] ornamental knots <b>by hand,</b> this is the <b>act of a craftsman</b> and is therefore certainly prohibited on a Festival. <b>And</b> if it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense [<i>ketoret</i>], this too is <b>prohibited, as he extinguishes</b> some of the coals when he sprinkles the aromatic powder on them. <b>Rav Ashi said to him: Actually,</b> it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense, which is permitted, <b>just as it is</b> permitted to place <b>meat on coals</b> for roasting.
<b>Some say</b> a slightly different version of this story, in which <b>Ameimar said to</b> Rav Geviha: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>ketura</i>? If</b> it means <b>tying</b> ornamental knots <b>by hand,</b> this is <b>the act of a craftsman,</b> which is prohibited. <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense, this too is prohibited, <b>as he produces a</b> new <b>scent. Rav Ashi said: I said</b> this <i>halakha</i> to Rav Geviha, <b>and I said</b> it <b>in the name of a great man,</b> Rava, that <b>actually</b> it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense, which is permitted, <b>just as it is</b> permitted to place <b>meat on coals</b> for roasting.
§ It is taught in the mishna that one of Rabban Gamliel’s three leniencies was that <b>one may prepare a whole [<i>mekulas</i>] kid</b> goat, meaning a goat roasted whole, with its entrails over its head, on the night of Passover. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in this regard that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Theodosius [<i>Todos</i>] of Rome,</b> leader of the Jewish community there, <b>instituted the custom for the Roman</b> Jews <b>to eat whole kids on the night of Passover,</b> in commemoration of the practice followed in the Temple. The Sages <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: Were you not Theodosius,</b> an important person, <b>we would have decreed ostracism upon you, as you are feeding the Jewish people consecrated</b> food, which may be eaten only in and around the Temple itself, <b>outside</b> the Temple.
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that the Sages really meant that Theodosius was feeding the Jewish people <b>consecrated</b> food outside the Temple? These goats are certainly not consecrated animals. <b>Rather, say</b> that he was feeding the Jewish people something <b>similar to consecrated</b> food, which people might mistake for a Paschal offering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>three things</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya permits and the Rabbis prohibit: His cow</b> would <b>go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with</b> a decorative <b>strap between its horns.</b> Rabbi Elazar holds that such a strap is considered an ornament for the cow rather than a burden, whereas the Sages view it as a burden.
<b>And one may comb [<i>mekardin</i>] an animal</b> with a fine comb <b>on a Festival</b> in order to remove ticks and dirt from its hair; the Rabbis prohibit this due to a concern that he might thereby come to wound or bruise the animal. <b>And one may grind pepper</b> needed on the Festival even <b>in its</b> own <b>mill,</b> although this appears similar to a weekday labor.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not comb an animal</b> to remove ticks and dirt from its hair <b>on a Festival because</b> this certainly <b>creates a wound, but one may brush</b> it with a wooden comb, as its blunt teeth do not wound the animal. <b>But the Rabbis say: One may not comb, nor may one even brush.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s cow would go out on Shabbat with a strap between its horns, the Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya had</b> only <b>one cow? But didn’t Rav say, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya would tithe from his herds thirteen thousand calves each and every year,</b> which means that he had ten times that number of calves alone. Why, then, does the mishna speak of his cow? The Gemara answers that <b>it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: This cow <b>was not his; rather, it was his neighbor’s. And because he did not protest her</b> conduct and tell her that it is prohibited to do so, the cow <b>was called by his name</b> to his discredit, as if it were his.
§ It is taught in the mishna that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds that <b>one may comb an animal on a Festival. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> considered <b>combing and what is brushing? Combing</b> is performed with <b>a small</b>-toothed comb <b>and makes a wound; brushing</b> is done with <b>a large</b>-toothed comb <b>and does not make a wound.</b>
<b>And there are three disputes with regard to</b> this <b>matter. Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>an unintentional act,</b> a permitted action from which an unintended prohibited labor ensues on Shabbat, <b>is prohibited,</b> as in his opinion it is prohibited to perform an action that involves a prohibited labor on Shabbat even if one has a permitted action in mind and does not intend to perform the labor in question. Therefore, one may not comb an animal in a manner that will cause a wound, even unintentionally. <b>However,</b> he differentiates between the cases: Although he prohibits <b>combing</b> with <b>a small</b>-toothed comb that <b>makes a wound,</b> he permits <b>brushing</b> with <b>a large</b>-toothed comb that <b>does not make a wound, and we do not issue a decree</b> and prohibit <b>brushing due to combing,</b> as there is no concern that people will err and come to permit even combing in the prohibited manner.
<b>And the Rabbis also hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to the fundamental issue that <b>an unintentional act is prohibited.</b> However, they maintain that <b>we issue a decree</b> and prohibit <b>brushing due to combing.</b> On the other hand, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds in accordance with</b> the dissenting opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that <b>an unintentional act is permitted.</b> Therefore, <b>both combing and brushing are permitted,</b> as even if the combing or brushing bruises the animal, there is no transgression of a prohibition, as there was certainly no intention to cause the animal a wound.
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> this teaching <b>himself:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> that an unintentional act is permitted on Shabbat, <b>as Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya agrees with him. Rava said to Rav Naḥman: And let the Master say</b> the opposite, that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as the Rabbis agree with him.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> Fundamentally <b>I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon;</b> I am merely adding <b>another</b> reason for doing so, which is <b>that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya agrees with him.</b>

Daf 23b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The</b> aforementioned <b>pepper mill</b> is a composite vessel, and each of its parts must be considered independently with respect to ritual impurity. It <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity because of</b> each of the <b>three vessels</b> of which it is comprised: It is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is a wooden <b>receptacle,</b> it is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a metal vessel, and</b> it is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a sieve.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A Sage <b>taught:</b> The <b>lower</b> section of the mill is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is viewed as <b>a receptacle,</b> since the ground pepper descends into it. <b>The middle</b> section is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a sieve,</b> as it serves to filter the pepper. Finally, the <b>upper</b> part, in which the pepper is actually ground, is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a metal vessel.</b> Although it is not a receptacle, it is nevertheless susceptible to impurity, since it is made of metal.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A child’s wagon,</b> with which he plays and upon which he also sits, <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> It is considered a fixed seat of the child, so that if the child is a <i>zav</i> and he sits on the wagon, it contracts the ritual impurity imparted by the treading of a <i>zav</i>. <b>And</b> this wagon <b>may be handled on Shabbat,</b> as it is considered a vessel. <b>And it may be dragged</b> on the ground on Shabbat <b>only upon cloth,</b> a stone pavement, or the like, as otherwise it would create a furrow when dragged, and one would be liable due to the prohibited labor of plowing.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> For this reason, <b>no vessels may be dragged</b> on the ground on Shabbat <b>except for a wagon,</b> which is permitted <b>because</b> its wheels do not make a furrow in the ground but merely <b>press</b> the earth down. Since no earth is moved from its place, this is not considered digging or plowing on Shabbat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is taught in the mishna that <b>a child’s wagon is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> Why? It is <b>because he leans on it.</b> The mishna also teaches that this wagon <b>may be handled on Shabbat.</b> Why? It is <b>because it has the status of a vessel,</b> and one may handle a vessel on Shabbat.
The mishna further teaches that a child’s wagon <b>may be dragged</b> on Shabbat <b>only upon cloth.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Upon cloth, yes,</b> it is permitted; but directly <b>on the ground, no,</b> it is not permitted. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>because he creates a furrow</b> in the ground when he drags the wagon across it. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: An unintentional act,</b> i.e., a permitted action from which an unintended prohibited labor ensues on Shabbat, <b>is prohibited,</b> even though the person performing it does not have the prohibited labor in mind.
<b>As, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, didn’t he say: An unintentional act is permitted,</b> since there was no intention to perform the prohibited action? <b>As we learned</b> explicitly in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A person may drag a bed, a chair, or a bench</b> on the ground, <b>provided that he does not intend to make a furrow.</b> Even if one forms a furrow unwittingly, one need not be concerned, as this was not his intention.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: No vessels may be dragged</b> on the ground <b>on Shabbat except for a wagon, because it</b> merely <b>presses</b> the earth down. This is not prohibited as plowing because it does not create a furrow. This indicates that a wagon may be dragged on the ground on Shabbat <b>because, yes, it presses</b> the earth down, <b>but it does not make a furrow.</b> Since it has already been established that the first section of the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, and there it appears that a wagon dragged along the ground makes a furrow, Rabbi Yehuda seems to contradict himself.
The Gemara answers: It must be explained that this is a dispute between <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> who hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> but differ with regard to the content of that opinion. The first <i>tanna</i> holds that even a wagon makes a furrow, whereas the other <i>tanna</i> maintains in the name of Rabbi Yehuda that a wagon does not make a furrow.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not trap fish from</b> their <b>ponds on a Festival</b> even with the intention of eating them, as this falls into the category of hunting, a type of labor that is not permitted on a Festival. <b>Nor may one place food before them,</b> as it is not his duty to feed them; rather, they maintain themselves by eating smaller fish or different types of algae that grow in the water.
<b>However, one may trap an animal or a bird from</b> their <b>enclosures [<i>beivarim</i>],</b> as they are viewed as already captured, and therefore the action is not considered an act of hunting. <b>And one may</b> also <b>place food before them</b> as one does for other household animals.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all enclosures are identical</b> with respect to the <i>halakhot</i> of hunting. <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> animal

Daf 24a

inside such an enclosure <b>whose trapping is inadequate,</b> meaning that the enclosure is large and contains hiding places so that it is still necessary to pursue and apprehend the animal, it <b>is prohibited</b> for one to catch it; <b>and</b> with regard to any animal <b>whose trapping is not inadequate,</b> as it is possible to seize it immediately without having to engage in further pursuit, it <b>is permitted</b> for one to catch it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from what is stated in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From enclosures of animals and of birds, one may not trap</b> animals or birds <b>on a Festival, nor may one place food before them.</b> This is <b>difficult</b> due to a contradiction between the ruling with regard to <b>an animal</b> in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <b>an animal</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>. This is similarly <b>difficult</b> due to a contradiction between the ruling with regard to <b>birds</b> in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <b>birds</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>.
The Gemara resolves the first contradiction: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the contradiction between the ruling concerning <b>an animal</b> in the mishna and the ruling concerning <b>an animal</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>, it is <b>not difficult,</b> because <b>this,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that prohibits trapping and feeding animals in the enclosures, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that an animal trapped in an enclosure whose trapping is inadequate, i.e., it is still necessary to pursue and apprehend the animal, is not considered trapped, and therefore one may not trap it from the enclosure on a Festival. Whereas <b>that,</b> the mishna that permits trapping and feeding the animals in the enclosures, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that an animal in an enclosure is considered trapped, and therefore removing it from there is not considered an act of hunting.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who</b> drives and <b>traps a bird into a closet or a deer into a house is liable.</b> The Gemara infers from this: <b>It is</b> only if he traps the animal <b>into a house that he is liable, but</b> if he traps it <b>into an enclosure,</b> he is <b>not</b> liable. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One is liable for trapping <b>a bird into a closet, and</b> for trapping <b>a deer into a garden, or into a courtyard, or into an enclosure.</b> This demonstrates that according to the Rabbis, an animal found inside an enclosure is regarded as already captured, whereas Rabbi Yehuda disagrees. From this it follows that Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis similarly disagree about catching an animal inside an enclosure and removing it from there on a Festival.
<b>However,</b> concerning the contradiction between the ruling with regard to <b>birds</b> in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <b>birds</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>, it is <b>difficult,</b> as all agree that they may not be caught, even in one’s house. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>this</b> contradiction is <b>also not difficult,</b> because <b>this,</b> the mishna that permits trapping, is referring to <b>a roofed enclosure,</b> in which a bird is considered captured, and therefore there is no prohibition against apprehending it on a Festival, and <b>that,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that prohibits trapping, is referring to <b>an unroofed enclosure,</b> in which a bird is not considered trapped and apprehending it is prohibited, that does not resolve the contradiction.
The Gemara explains why the proposed resolution must be rejected: <b>As</b> with regard to <b>a house, which is like a roofed enclosure,</b> there is no dispute. <b>And according to both Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, a bird</b> trapped <b>into a closet, yes,</b> it is considered trapped, while a bird <b>into a house, no,</b> it is not considered trapped.
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Here,</b> in the mishna, according to which a bird in a house is not considered trapped, <b>we are dealing with a free bird,</b> a sparrow, <b>which does not accept authority.</b> That bird is not intimidated and evades capture even in a house. <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Why is it called a free</b> [<b><i>dror</i></b>] <b>bird</b>? <b>Because it dwells</b> [<b><i>dara</i></b>] <b>in a house as it does in a field,</b> flittering from place to place. For this reason, it is not considered captured when it is inside a house. Therefore, the distinction between a roofed and an unroofed enclosure resolves the apparent contradiction between the mishna and the <i>Tosefta</i>.
The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> understanding, that the difference between the rulings in the two sources is predicated on different circumstances and not on a tannaitic dispute, the apparent contradiction between the ruling with regard to <b>an animal</b> in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <b>an animal</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> is <b>also not difficult. This,</b> the ruling in the mishna that permits apprehending the animal, is referring to <b>a small enclosure,</b> in which the animal cannot evade its pursuers and requires no further trapping. <b>That,</b> the ruling in the <i>Tosefta</i> that prohibits apprehending the animal, is referring to <b>a large enclosure,</b> from which the animal cannot escape, but it can still avoid being caught.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a small enclosure,</b> and <b>what are the circumstances</b> of <b>a large enclosure? Rav Ashi said: Any</b> enclosure <b>where one can run after</b> an animal <b>and reach it in one stoop</b> is <b>a small enclosure. And</b> any <b>other</b> is <b>a large enclosure. Or perhaps, any</b> enclosure <b>that has a series of corners</b> in which the animal could hide and evade capture is <b>a large enclosure, and</b> any <b>other</b> is <b>a small enclosure. Or perhaps, any</b> enclosure <b>where the shadows from the</b> different <b>walls fall upon each other,</b> because the walls are close together, is <b>a small enclosure. And</b> any <b>other,</b> a larger area where the walls are further apart, is <b>a large enclosure.</b>
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all enclosures are identical.</b> If the animal is inadequately trapped in the enclosure, it is prohibited for one to catch it; whereas if it is adequately trapped, he is permitted to do so. <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: If one rules that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with his opinion, does that mean <b>by inference</b> that the Rabbis <b>disagree,</b> or perhaps there is no dispute and everyone accepts the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: And what difference is there to you</b> whether or not the Rabbis disagree? In either case the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Why then does it matter whether or not the issue was in dispute? Abaye <b>said to him,</b> invoking a folk expression with regard to one who learns without reaching understanding: Is it simply <b>learn the lesson;</b> let <b>it be</b> like <b>a song?</b> In other words, is it sufficient to simply parrot the halakhic ruling? Rather, it is necessary to examine the issue to understand it even if it does not yield a practical halakhic difference.
It was further taught in the mishna: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> animal inside such an enclosure <b>whose trapping is inadequate</b> may not be caught and removed from there on a Festival, whereas any animal whose trapping is not inadequate may be apprehended and removed from there. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of an animal <b>whose trapping is inadequate? Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Any</b> animal <b>with regard to which one would say: Bring a trap so that we may catch it,</b> as the animal cannot be apprehended without the aid of a trap.
<b>Abaye said to him: But aren’t geese and chickens</b> that are loose in a courtyard creatures <b>with regard to which one would say: Bring a trap so that we may catch it,</b> as they freely roam about and evade capture? <b>And</b> nevertheless, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who traps geese, chickens, or domestic doves is exempt,</b> as they are considered already trapped.
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> There is a difference between the two cases: <b>These,</b> the geese and chickens, <b>enter their coop in the evening</b> and use it as their fixed dwelling place and are therefore considered trapped, <b>while these</b> animals in the enclosure <b>do not enter their coop in the evening</b> and therefore flee from those trying to seize them.
The Gemara challenges this argument: <b>But don’t doves of a dovecote and doves of a loft enter their coop in the evening, and</b> yet <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who traps doves of a dovecote, doves of a loft, or birds that are nesting in pitchers in buildings is liable</b> for their capture, although they enter their coop in the evening?
<b>Rather, Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> A distinction can be made as follows: <b>These,</b> the geese and chickens, <b>enter their coop in the evening, and</b> providing them with <b>their feed is your</b> responsibility. They are therefore accustomed to their owners and considered as trapped. <b>Whereas these,</b> the doves of a dovecote and the other birds mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, admittedly <b>enter their coop in the evening, but feeding them is not your</b> responsibility.
<b>Rav Mari said</b> an alternative distinction: <b>These,</b> the doves of a dovecote, <b>are likely to flee</b> from people, and therefore require trapping, <b>while these,</b> the geese, chickens, and domestic doves, <b>are not likely to flee</b> from them. The Gemara asks: <b>All of them are also likely to flee</b> when being pursued, even chickens. The Gemara answers: <b>We</b> meant to <b>say</b> that <b>they are likely to flee to their coop.</b> In other words, even when they reach their coop they do not remain still but continue in their attempts to escape, and are therefore not considered trapped.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>traps for animals, birds, and fish were set on the eve of a Festival, one may not take</b> anything <b>from them on the Festival, unless he knows that</b> the animals found in the traps <b>had</b> already <b>been caught on the eve of the Festival. And an incident</b> is related <b>where a certain gentile brought fish to Rabban Gamliel, and</b> the latter <b>said:</b> The fish <b>are permitted, but I do not wish to accept</b> them <b>from him,</b> as I despise him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a question about the story involving Rabban Gamliel. Was <b>an incident</b> cited above <b>to contradict</b> a previously stated <i>halakha</i>? The mishna first teaches that one may not eat an animal caught on a Festival, and then relates an incident in which Rabban Gamliel ruled that this is permitted. The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete;</b> it is missing an important element, <b>and it teaches the following:</b> Even in a case where it is <b>uncertain</b> whether or not the animal was <b>prepared</b> before the Festival, as it is unclear whether it was caught today or on the previous day, it <b>is prohibited; and Rabban Gamliel permits</b> it. <b>And an incident</b> is <b>also</b> related <b>where a certain gentile brought fish to Rabban Gamliel, and</b> the latter <b>said:</b> The fish <b>are permitted, but I do not wish to accept</b> them <b>from him.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel. Some teach this</b> halakhic ruling <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it is taught:</b> With regard to something about which <b>an uncertainty</b> exists whether or not it was <b>prepared</b> before the Festival, <b>Rabban Gamliel permits</b> it, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua prohibits</b> it. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. And</b> others <b>teach it in reference to this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it is taught:</b>

Daf 24b

<b>One may slaughter</b> animals <b>from</b> pens containing <b>pools</b> of drinking water <b>on a Festival, but not from</b> those found caught in <b>nets or</b> in <b>traps,</b> as they may have been caught on the Festival itself. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If <b>he came and found</b> the nets and traps <b>out of order on the eve of the Festival,</b> which indicates that an animal had been caught in them, then <b>it is known that</b> the animals <b>were caught on the eve of the Festival, and they are</b> therefore <b>permitted.</b> However, if he checked the nets and traps shortly before the onset of the Festival and found them intact, and <b>he</b> later <b>came and found them out of order on the Festival, it is known that</b> the animals <b>were caught on the Festival, and they are</b> therefore <b>prohibited.</b>
The Gemara poses a question: The <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult</b> because it contains an internal contradiction between its clauses: <b>You</b> first <b>said</b> that if <b>he came and found them out of order on the eve of the Festival, it is known that they were caught on the eve of the Festival. The reason</b> is <b>that he came and found them out of order, but</b> if there is <b>uncertainty,</b> the animals <b>are prohibited.</b> But <b>say</b> now <b>the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he came and found them out of order on the Festival, it is known that they were caught on the Festival. The reason</b> is <b>that he came and found them out of order, but</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the assumption is that <b>they were caught on the eve of the Festival and are permitted.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If he came and found them out of order on the eve of the Festival, it is known that they were caught on the eve of the Festival, and they are permitted. But</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty, it is considered as if they were caught on the Festival, and they are prohibited.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b> All these versions of Shmuel’s ruling are basically in agreement: In a case of uncertainty as to whether or not an item was prepared before the Festival, it is prohibited.
§ It was stated in the mishna that Rabban Gamliel <b>said</b> that the fish brought to him on the Festival by the gentile <b>are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Permitted for what</b> purpose? <b>Rav said: They are permitted to be received</b> and moved, but they may not be eaten. <b>Levi said: They are</b> even <b>permitted to be eaten.</b>
<b>Rav said: A person should never prevent himself from</b> attending <b>the study hall for even one moment,</b> and the proof is from this issue; <b>as Levi and I were before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>when he stated this <i>halakha</i>. In the evening he said: They are permitted to be eaten,</b> but <b>the</b> following <b>morning he said: They are permitted</b> only <b>to be received. I, who was in the study hall</b> in the morning as well, <b>retracted</b> what I said, and taught the matter in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s second opinion. <b>Levi, who was not in the study hall</b> in the morning, <b>did not retract</b> his statement.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a gentile brought a gift [<i>doron</i>] to a Jew</b> on a Festival, <b>even moist [<i>mefulamin</i>] fish or produce from that</b> same <b>day, they are permitted. Granted, according to the one who said they are permitted to be received, it is well;</b> the <i>halakha</i> is understandable. <b>However, according to the one who said they are permitted to be eaten, is produce from that</b> same <b>day permitted to be eaten?</b> If it was picked from the tree on that day, it is subject to the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.
The Gemara responds with a counter-question: <b>And according to your reasoning, is produce</b> picked <b>on that</b> same <b>day permitted to be moved?</b> Why, then, is it obvious to you that the produce is permitted to be received? <b>Rather,</b> it must be explained that <b>we are dealing with fish whose</b> gills <b>are</b> still <b>red and</b> with <b>produce that is preserved in greens,</b> not with produce that was actually picked on that day. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it called</b> produce <b>of that</b> same <b>day? Because it is</b> fresh and <b>similar to</b> produce picked <b>on that</b> same <b>day.</b> Such produce is permitted not only to be moved, but even to be eaten.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> in this regard <b>is</b> as follows: In the case of <b>a gentile who brought a gift to a Jew on a Festival, if there is of that species</b> still <b>attached</b> to a tree or the ground, <b>it is prohibited</b> to be eaten, as it may be assumed that the gentile picked it that same day. <b>And in the evening as well,</b> after the conclusion of the Festival, <b>it is prohibited for</b> the period of <b>time</b> needed <b>for its preparation,</b> i.e., the period of time necessary to detach it from the tree or the ground, as one may not derive benefit from a prohibited labor that was performed on a Festival on behalf of a Jew.
<b>And if none of that species is</b> still <b>attached</b> to the ground, then if the gift was brought from <b>within the limit,</b> i.e., the distance one may travel on a Festival, <b>it is permitted,</b> as no prohibited labor has been performed.

Daf 25a

If, however, the gift was brought from <b>outside the limit, it is prohibited. And</b> an item <b>that came</b> from outside the limit <b>for one Jew is permitted to another Jew.</b> No prohibition applies to the second recipient, as the gentile’s intention was not fulfilled. Since the <i>halakha</i> of limits is a rabbinic prohibition, the Sages decreed that the object is prohibited only to the one on behalf of whom it was brought, but not to others.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion about trapping animals on a Festival. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one dammed a water channel</b> that was used to irrigate a field <b>on the eve of a Festival, and the following day he arose and found fish in it, they are permitted.</b> These fish presumably arrived with the water before the Festival and were unable to escape, as the channel had been obstructed. Therefore, the fish are considered as having been prepared before the Festival.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: From</b> this <b>statement of our teacher,</b> Rav, <b>we learn</b> that <b>an undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard</b> near one’s house <b>does not require</b> special <b>designation</b> but is considered prepared. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> in response to this conclusion: <b>Our colleague,</b> Rav Ḥisda, <b>has fallen upon a great</b> matter, i.e., an issue that is not at all straightforward but is the subject of various disagreements. <b>Some say</b> a slightly different version of this statement, that <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: From</b> this <b>statement of our teacher,</b> Rav, <b>we learn</b> that <b>an undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard does not require</b> special <b>designation,</b> and with regard to this statement, <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that Rabba, <b>son of our colleague,</b> Rav Huna, <b>has fallen upon a great</b> matter. Rav Huna was a contemporary of Rav Naḥman’s, and they were both students of Rav; consequently, Rav Naḥman referred to Rav Huna as his colleague and called Rabba the son of his colleague.
Rav Naḥman explains the difference between the cases: <b>There,</b> in the case where the undomesticated animal nested in an orchard, the person <b>performed no action</b> at all, as the animal came of its own accord, whereas <b>here,</b> in the case where he dammed the water channel, <b>he performed an action</b> when he blocked the water from leaving the channel.
Rav Naḥman concludes his challenge: <b>And does</b> the animal <b>not require</b> further <b>designation? Isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard requires designation. And</b> as for <b>a free bird, one is required to tie its wings so that it will not be mistaken for its mother,</b> i.e., so that he not take a different bird, such as its mother, in its place. <b>And this</b> is <b>a testimony that was reported in the name of Shemaya and Avtalyon.</b> The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the Sages who drew an inference from Rav’s statement.
The Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> an undomesticated animal in an orchard really <b>require designation? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel concede</b> with regard to doves and the like <b>that one had designated</b> on the eve of a Festival when they were <b>inside the nest, and</b> on the Festival itself <b>he found</b> them <b>in front of the nest, that</b> they <b>are prohibited,</b> as these doves might not be the same ones that he had designated but rather others that came from somewhere else? <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>with regard to doves of a dovecote, doves of a loft, and birds nesting in pitchers or in a building. However, geese, chicken, domestic doves, and an undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard are permitted</b> in all cases, <b>and they do not require designation</b> in advance. In the case of <b>a free bird, one is required to tie its wings so that it is not mistaken for its mother.</b>
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>those</b> birds <b>whose</b> wings <b>were tied</b> as a sign, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>those that were shaken</b> in advance in order to designate them for the Festival, if they were <b>in cisterns, in houses, in trenches, or in caves, they are permitted</b> on the Festival. However, if they were <b>in trees, they are prohibited, lest one climb up</b> the tree <b>and detach</b> something from it, which is prohibited. <b>And those</b> birds <b>whose</b> wings <b>were tied</b> by another, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>those that were shaken</b> by another <b>are prohibited in all places,</b> even not on a Festival, <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>stealing.</b> Tying or shaking is considered an act of acquisition, and therefore others may not take them. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> clearly states that an undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard does not require designation.
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that an animal nesting in an orchard is permitted even without designation, is referring <b>to it,</b> a young animal that cannot escape; whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that designation is required, is referring <b>to its mother,</b> which is larger and can escape. The Gemara asks: But is mere <b>designation sufficient for its mother?</b> Doesn’t <b>it require complete capture,</b> as it is an undomesticated animal?
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>both this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> one are referring <b>to it,</b> a young animal that is unable to escape, and the difference between them is as follows: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which does not require designation, is referring <b>to a garden</b> situated <b>near the city,</b> so that one knows precisely where the animal is located and he can take it at any time. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which requires designation, is referring <b>to a garden that is not</b> located <b>nearby.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>an animal</b> is <b>in danger</b> of dying, in which case its meat would be prohibited as the animal had not been properly slaughtered, and one wishes to slaughter it in the hope that it will be found fit for eating and he will be spared a loss, <b>he may not slaughter</b> it on a Festival <b>unless there is</b> still <b>time in the day</b> for him <b>to eat an olive-bulk of roasted meat from</b> the animal, so that it is possible to say that he slaughtered the animal for the sake of the Festival. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> There need not be enough time for him to roast it; rather, it is sufficient <b>even</b> if there is only time to eat <b>an olive-bulk of raw</b> meat <b>from the place where</b> the animal <b>is slaughtered,</b> i.e., from its neck, without going to the trouble of removing its hide and roasting it.
If <b>one slaughtered</b> an animal on a Festival <b>in the field, he may not bring it</b> to his house <b>on a pole or on a set of poles</b> carried by two people, as this appears similar to a weekday activity. <b>Rather,</b> he must alter his usual weekday manner of performing this action <b>and bring</b> it in <b>by hand, limb by limb.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rami bar Abba said:</b> The mitzva of <b>flaying and cutting</b> the animal into pieces is mentioned in the Torah with regard <b>to the burnt-offering, and the same is true for butchers.</b> That is to say, we learn from the <i>halakhot</i> of the burnt offering that a butcher should first remove the hide and cut the animal into pieces. <b>From here the Torah taught</b> proper <b>etiquette, that a person should not eat meat before flaying and cutting</b> the animal into pieces.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> new <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> Rami bar Abba <b>teaching us? If we say</b> that he wishes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna,</b> there is a difficulty, <b>as Rav Huna said: An animal, while alive, retains its presumptive status of</b> being subject to the <b>prohibition</b> against eating a limb from a living creature, and it retains that status after slaughter <b>until it becomes known to you how it was slaughtered.</b> As long as it has not yet been clarified that the animal was slaughtered properly, it is presumed to be prohibited.
However, once the animal has been <b>slaughtered</b> properly, <b>it retains its presumptive status of being permitted until it becomes known to you how it became a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> an animal suffering from a wound or illness that would cause it to die within twelve months, which is prohibited to be eaten even after ritual slaughter. There is no need to conduct a special examination of the animal to determine if it had a defect or illness, as it is presumed to be permitted. Even if a defect is found, this does not necessarily render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, as one can say that it appeared only after the animal was slaughtered.
One might have understood from Rami bar Abba’s statement that he disagrees with Rav Huna and requires that the animal be examined. However, this is difficult, as <b>didn’t we learn</b> in <b>the mishna in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna? As we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is sufficient <b>even</b> if there is only time to eat <b>an olive-bulk of raw</b> meat <b>from the place where</b> the animal <b>is slaughtered. What, is it not</b> referring to meat <b>from the actual place where</b> the animal <b>is slaughtered,</b> from which it follows that one need not remove the hide or examine the animal?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> the mishna can be understood as follows: <b>From the place where</b> the animal <b>slaughters its food,</b> i.e., from its intestines, where digestion takes place. The hide must still be removed and the animal must be examined before it can be eaten.
<b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: From the actual place where</b> the animal <b>is slaughtered? Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanation and says that <b>Rami bar Abba</b>

Daf 25b

merely <b>teaches us</b> proper <b>etiquette,</b> even though no prohibition is involved.
§ The Sages teach proper manners unconnected to any prohibition, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> should <b>not eat garlic or onions</b> from the side of <b>its head,</b> i.e., its roots, <b>but</b> rather <b>from</b> the side of <b>its leaves. And if he did eat</b> in that manner, <b>he</b> gives the appearance of being <b>a glutton. Similarly, a person</b> should <b>not drink his cup</b> of wine all <b>at once, and if he did drink</b> in this manner, <b>he</b> gives the appearance of being <b>a</b> greedy <b>drinker. The Sages taught</b> in this regard: <b>One who drinks his cup</b> all <b>at once is a</b> greedy <b>drinker;</b> if he does so <b>in two</b> swallows, this is proper <b>etiquette;</b> in <b>three</b> swallows, he is <b>of haughty spirit,</b> as he presents himself as overly delicate and refined.
Apropos the previous discussion, the Gemara notes that <b>Rami bar Abba</b> also <b>said: The sea squill,</b> a plant from the lily family whose roots project deep into the ground, will <b>cut off the feet of the wicked</b> in the future on the Day of Judgment. It was customary to plant sea squill on the edges of fields as boundary markers because their roots grow straight down without spreading out. Those who overstepped boundaries and infringed upon their neighbor’s property should have heeded the markers and desisted.
Similarly, <b>young trees will cut off the feet of butchers and those who have relations with menstruating women.</b> After a tree is planted, one must wait three years before eating its fruit. This should serve as a lesson for those butchers who hasten to eat of the animal’s meat before removing its hide, and for those who have relations with their menstruating wives and do not wait for them to achieve ritual purification.
<b>The lupine [<i>turmus</i>],</b> an extremely bitter legume that is edible only after an extensive process, <b>will cut off the feet of the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves. <b>As it is stated: “And the children of Israel continued to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, and served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram and the gods of Zidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines, and they forsook the Lord and did not serve Him”</b> (Judges 10:6).
<b>By inference from</b> that <b>which is stated: “And they forsook the Lord,” do I not know that they did not serve Him? Rather,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state</b> the seemingly unnecessary words <b>“and did not serve Him”? Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: My children did not treat Me even like this lupine, which,</b> because it is inedible as it is, must be <b>cooked</b> in water <b>seven times</b> in order to temper its bitter taste <b>and</b> is eventually made so sweet that <b>one eats it as a dessert</b> after <b>a meal.</b> They worshipped all seven types of idolatry listed in the verse, and even after I punished them for each and every one of them, they still refused to repent from their evil ways. Instead, they remained rebellious and did not serve Me.
The Gemara considers another aspect of the character of the Jewish people. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir: For what reason was the Torah given to the Jewish people?</b> It is <b>because they are impudent,</b> and Torah study will weaken and humble them. A Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“From His right hand went a fiery law for them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2); <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> Based on their nature and character, <b>these</b> people, the Jews, are <b>fit to be given a fiery law,</b> a hard and scorching faith. <b>Some say</b> a different version of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The ways</b> and nature <b>of these</b> people, the Jews, <b>are</b> like <b>fire, as, were it not for</b> the fact that <b>the Torah was given to the Jewish people,</b> whose study and observance restrains them, <b>no nation or tongue could withstand them.</b>
<b>And this is</b> the same as <b>what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: There are three impudent ones: The Jewish people among the nations;</b> the <b>dog among animals;</b> and the <b>rooster among birds. And some say: Also</b> the <b>goat among small cattle. And some say: Also</b> the <b>caper bush among trees.</b>
§ It is taught in the mishna: If <b>one slaughtered</b> an animal on a Festival <b>in the field, he may not bring it</b> to his house <b>on a pole,</b> as this appears similar to a weekday activity. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A <b>blind person may not go out</b> on a Festival <b>with his cane, nor a shepherd with his satchel. And one may not go out on a chair</b> borne on poles by other people, <b>neither a man nor a woman.</b> All of these are considered weekday activities, the performance of which would display disrespect for the Festival.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi send</b> the following <i>halakha</i> from Eretz Yisrael: <b>There was an old man in our neighborhood who would go out</b> on a Festival <b>in his litter [<i>gelodki</i>], and they came and asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> the preeminent authority of the time, whether this was permitted. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said</b> to them: <b>If many</b> people <b>need</b> the man to come and lecture them on Torah matters, <b>it is permitted</b> to transport him to the study hall in that manner.
Similarly, <b>our Sages relied on the statement of Aḥi Shakkaya, who said: I</b> once <b>brought Rav Huna</b> on a Festival <b>from</b> the town of <b>Hinei to</b> the town of <b>Shilei and from Shilei</b> back <b>to Hinei</b> on a chair of this kind. <b>And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I</b> once <b>brought Mar Shmuel</b> on such a seat on a Festival <b>from the sun into the shade and from the shade into the sun.</b> All of these incidents indicate that it is in fact permitted to use such a chair on a Festival. The Gemara answers: These cases pose no difficulty, <b>as there, it is in accordance with the reason that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>stated: If many</b> people <b>need him, it is permitted.</b> However, one who is not needed by the public may not go out in such a chair.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Ḥama bar Adda, emissary of</b> the talmudic academies in <b>Zion,</b> who would regularly travel back and forth from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia: <b>When you go up there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>take a roundabout</b> route, i.e., do not travel by the shortest path; <b>and go to the Ladder of Tyre, and go to Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi,</b> who lives in Tyre, <b>and raise</b> this <b>dilemma before him: What do you say with regard to a chair</b> borne on poles; may one go out in such a chair on a Festival?
<b>By the time he arrived there, Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi had</b> already <b>passed away.</b> However, <b>when he went up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Rabbi Zerika</b> and <b>said to him: What do you say with regard to a chair</b> borne on poles; what is your opinion on this topic? <b>He said to him: Rabbi Ami said as follows:</b> It is permitted <b>provided that he is not carried on the shoulders,</b> on the chair. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Provided that he is not carried on the shoulders? Rav Yosef, son of Rabba, said:</b> It means <b>on poles [<i>alunkei</i>]</b> that are used to carry burdens on the shoulders of two people. This mode of transportation is highly conspicuous and has the appearance of a weekday activity, the performance of which displays disrespect for the Festival. Instead, the poles on which the chair is borne should be held in the bearers’ hands, so the seat will be closer to the ground and less noticeable.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Naḥman permit</b> his wife <b>Yalta to go out</b> on a Festival <b>on</b> a chair borne on <b>poles</b> that rested on the shoulders of the bearers? The Gemara answers: <b>Yalta is different, as she was afraid</b> of falling and therefore required this special arrangement.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ameimar and Mar Zutra would be carried</b> to their places in the study hall <b>on the shoulders</b> of their students for the public lecture delivered <b>on</b> the <b>Shabbat of the Festival.</b> They would be carried in that manner <b>due to</b> their <b>fear</b> of falling. <b>And some say</b> the reason was <b>due to the pushing of the crowd,</b> as these Sages were afraid of being crushed by the large number of people attending the lecture.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A male firstborn of cattle, sheep, or goats belonging to a Jew is sanctified from birth and must be given to a priest to be sacrificed on the altar in the Temple. If a firstborn animal acquired a physical blemish that disqualifies it from being sacrificed as an offering, it still must be given to a priest, but it may be redeemed, slaughtered, and eaten as non-sacred meat. If <b>a firstborn</b> animal <b>fell into a cistern</b> on a Festival, and there is concern that it might die there, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: An expert</b> in these matters <b>goes down</b> into the cistern <b>and examines</b> the animal.

Daf 26a

<b>If it has</b> a permanent <b>blemish,</b> owing to which it may be slaughtered and eaten, <b>he may raise it</b> from the cistern <b>and slaughter</b> it; <b>but if</b> it does <b>not</b> have a blemish, or if its blemish is temporary, <b>he may not slaughter</b> it. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Even if it has a blemish, it is prohibited to slaughter it, as <b>any</b> firstborn animal <b>whose blemish is not perceptible while it is still day,</b> i.e., on the day before the Festival, <b>is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree? If we say</b> that <b>they disagree</b> about whether or not <b>one may examine blemishes on a Festival,</b> such <b>that Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>one may examine blemishes on a Festival, and Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>one may not examine blemishes on a Festival,</b> if so, <b>let them disagree</b> with regard <b>to examining blemishes in general</b> on a Festival and not only with respect to the particular case of a firstborn that fell into a cistern.
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach the disagreement with regard to the case of <b>a firstborn that fell into a cistern,</b> as <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>because of</b> the matter of <b>the suffering of living creatures, one should employ an artifice</b> to circumvent the <i>halakha</i> <b>and raise</b> the animal from the cistern. This would be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who states elsewhere (37a) with regard to a different case that one may employ an artifice in order to rescue an animal that fell into a cistern on a Festival. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon disagree even in the case of a firstborn that fell into a cistern.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the mishna mentions the case of a firstborn that fell into a cistern in order to teach that an artifice may not be employed to raise the animal from the cistern, the phrase: <b>He may not slaughter</b> it, is inaccurate. Rather, it <b>should have</b> stated: <b>He may not raise</b> the animal <b>and slaughter</b> it. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this teaching <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where he transgressed</b> the prohibition and already <b>raised it,</b> as <b>it could enter your mind to say that he may</b> now <b>slaughter it.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even then he may not do so.
The Gemara expresses wonder at this answer: How could one think that <b>he may</b> now <b>slaughter it? Isn’t</b> the animal <b>unblemished?</b> How could one imagine that it is permitted to slaughter a firstborn that is unblemished? The Gemara answers: This teaching <b>is necessary only</b> in a case <b>where it developed a blemish</b> after it fell. The Gemara challenges this argument: <b>But</b> how could one think that he may now slaughter the animal? <b>Doesn’t</b> it fall into the category of <b><i>muktze</i>,</b> as it was not fit to be eaten on the eve of the Festival, since at that time it was still unblemished? In that case, it should remain in the category of <i>muktze</i> for the duration of the Festival.
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna is speaking of a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>developed a temporary blemish,</b> one that might eventually heal, <b>on the eve of the Festival, and now,</b> after falling, <b>it has a permanent blemish. Lest you say</b> that <b>his mind was</b> set <b>on</b> the animal as food already before the Festival due to the temporary blemish <b>and</b> therefore <b>he should</b> now be allowed to <b>slaughter it,</b> the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that since it was not fit to be eaten before the Festival, it is not considered prepared for use on the Festival. Rather, it falls into the category of <i>muktze</i> and may not be slaughtered.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an unblemished firstborn that fell into a cistern</b> on a Festival, <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: An expert</b> in these matters <b>goes down</b> into the cistern <b>and examines</b> the animal. <b>If it</b> now <b>has a</b> permanent <b>blemish</b> as a result of the fall, <b>he</b> may <b>raise</b> it from the cistern <b>and slaughter</b> it; <b>but if not,</b> then even if he proceeds to raise it, <b>he</b> may <b>not slaughter</b> it, even if afterwards it develops a blemish. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said to him:</b> The Sages of earlier generations <b>already said</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not examine blemishes on a Festival. How so?</b> If <b>a blemish came into being on the eve of a Festival, one</b> may <b>not examine it on the Festival</b> itself to see whether it is in fact of the type that permits the animal to be slaughtered. And if the <b>blemish came into being</b>

Daf 26b

<b>on</b> the <b>Festival</b> itself, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is not</b> considered to be <b>among the</b> animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival; therefore, even if it was examined by an expert, it may not be slaughtered. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>agree that if</b> the animal <b>was born with its blemish, it is</b> considered to be <b>among the</b> animals <b>prepared</b> for use on the Festival.
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> as follows: If a firstborn <b>was born with its blemish,</b> experts may <b>examine it on a Festival <i>ab initio</i>,</b> and if the blemish is found to be permanent, the animal may then be slaughtered. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him: Father would teach</b> on this matter that <b>if he transgressed and examined it,</b> it is considered <b>examined</b> after the fact, <b>and you say</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>examine it</b> even <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>
<b>Abaye said: It stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught</b> in <b>three parts,</b> which suggests that each part contains a novel <i>halakha</i>. The first section states: If a firstborn <b>developed a blemish on the eve of a Festival one</b> may <b>not examine it on</b> the <b>Festival</b> itself, from which one can learn that <b>it is</b> only <b><i>ab initio</i> that one</b> may <b>not</b> examine it; <b>but after the fact, it seems well,</b> and the examination is valid.
The second section of the <i>baraita</i> states: If <b>it developed a blemish on</b> the <b>Festival</b> itself, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival. In other words, <b>even after the fact, no,</b> if the animal was examined by an expert, it may not be slaughtered and eaten. <b>And then</b> in the third section <b>it teaches: And</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>agree that if</b> the animal <b>was born with its blemish, it is</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> for use on the Festival. The fact that the <i>baraita</i> taught this <i>halakha</i> as an independent clause indicates that <b>even <i>ab initio</i> as well,</b> the animal may be examined.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But isn’t</b> it so that <b>when Rav Oshaya came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he came and brought the</b> following <b><i>baraita</i> in his hand: Whether</b> the animal <b>developed a blemish on the eve of the Festival or it developed a blemish on</b> the <b>Festival</b> itself, <b>the Rabbis say: It is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> for use on the Festival, so that even after the fact, if the animal was examined, it may not be slaughtered and eaten. According to this, the allowance granted in the case of a firstborn that was born with its blemish can be only after the fact, as argued by Rav Naḥman, and not <i>ab initio</i>, as maintained by Rabba bar Rav Huna. Why, then, does Abaye accept the opinion of the latter and not that of the former?
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> cited earlier, which presents these <i>halakhot</i> differently, is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers: This does not pose a problem, as <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was</b> taught by <b>Adda bar Ukhmei, who</b> would often <b>confuse</b> the opinions in the text <b>and teach</b> an inaccurate version of the dispute; therefore, his version is unreliable.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The mishna is also precise</b> in its wording according to the opinion that no blemish may be examined <i>ab initio</i>. <b>As</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Even if the animal has a blemish, it is prohibited to slaughter it, since <b>any</b> firstborn animal <b>whose blemish is not perceptible on the eve of the Festival</b> while it is still day <b>is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>Whose blemish is not perceptible? If we say that its blemish is not perceptible at all,</b> it is <b>obvious. Need it be said</b> that an animal whose blemish was not perceptible at all prior to the Festival is not considered prepared for use on the Festival?
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that the animal had a perceptible blemish, but <b>it was not shown to a Sage on the eve of the Festival</b> to determine <b>whether it is a permanent blemish or a temporary blemish. In any event,</b> the mishna <b>teaches: It is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival, which indicates that it is not considered prepared even after the fact. It follows that the allowance granted in the case of a firstborn that was born with its blemish is also only after the fact, but the blemish may not be examined <i>ab initio</i>. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is so.
§ <b>Hillel raised a dilemma before Rava: Is there</b> a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i> for half of Shabbat or is there no</b> prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i> for half of Shabbat?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> an item <b>was fit</b> for eating or for some other purpose <b>at twilight</b> between Friday and Shabbat, it would then <b>be fit</b> for the entire Shabbat. And <b>if it was not fit</b> at twilight, <b>it is not fit</b> for the entire day, as anything considered <i>muktze</i> at twilight remains so throughout Shabbat. How, then, could there be a case of an item that is considered <i>muktze</i> for half of Shabbat?
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise this dilemma in a case <b>where</b> the item <b>had</b> once <b>been fit</b> for use, <b>and then became disqualified</b> on Shabbat itself for some reason, <b>and then</b> once again <b>became fit.</b> It is about such a case that Hillel asked: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rava <b>said to</b> Hillel: <b>There is</b> a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> for half of Shabbat, that is to say, once an item becomes disqualified for use on Shabbat, it retains that status for the rest of the day.
Hillel <b>raised an objection</b> from the previously cited <i>baraita</i> that taught: <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>agree that if</b> the animal <b>was born with its blemish, it is</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> before the Festival for use on the Festival. <b>But why</b> should this be? <b>Let us say</b> as follows: <b>This firstborn was fit at the outset</b> to be eaten <b>on account of its mother,</b> as had its mother been slaughtered before giving birth to the firstborn, it would have been permitted to eat them both. This being the case, when the firstborn <b>was born, it became disqualified,</b> since once a firstborn is born, it may not be eaten until it acquires a permanent blemish. And later, when <b>he showed it to a Sage, it</b> once again <b>became permitted to him.</b> This shows that although the animal had the status of <i>muktze</i> for part of the day of the Festival, it did not retain that status for the entire day.
<b>Abaye said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Safra</b> who said: Here, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where judges were sitting there,</b> observing the firstborn as it was being born, and they immediately saw that it was blemished. Therefore, the animal never lost its permitted status even for a moment.
<b>Some say</b> that Rava <b>said</b> the opposite <b>to</b> Hillel: <b>There is no</b> prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i> for half of Shabbat,</b> that is to say, even if an item becomes disqualified for use on Shabbat, once it becomes fit again, it is no longer prohibited. The Gemara responds: <b>Let us say that</b> the previously cited <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> Rava: <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>agree that if</b> the animal <b>was born with its blemish, it is</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> before the Festival for use on the Festival. <b>But wasn’t this firstborn fit</b> to be eaten <b>at the outset on account of its mother;</b> and then when <b>it was born it became disqualified;</b> and then later, when <b>he showed it to a Sage, it</b> once again <b>became permitted to him?</b> This indicates that for half of Shabbat there is no prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.
<b>Abaye said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Safra</b> who said: This proof is inconclusive, as the <i>baraita</i> may be referring to a case <b>where judges were sitting there</b> when the firstborn was born, and they immediately saw that it was blemished; therefore the animal never acquired the status of <i>muktze</i> at all.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>was eating grapes and left</b> some over <b>and took them up to the roof</b> to dry in order <b>to make them</b> into <b>raisins,</b> or if he was eating <b>figs and left</b> some over <b>and took them up to the roof</b> in order <b>to make them</b> into <b>dried figs, he</b> may <b>not eat from them</b> on Shabbat <b>unless he designates them</b> as food to be eaten <b>while it is still day.</b> Otherwise, they are prohibited as <i>muktze</i>. <b>And you</b> would <b>find the same with regard to peaches, and quinces, and all other types of fruit</b> that one left out to dry. It is prohibited to eat any of them on Shabbat due to the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.
The Gemara proceeds to clarify this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances? If they are fit</b> to be eaten, as they have already dried, <b>why does he require</b> prior <b>designation?</b> Since he placed them there in order to eat them after they dried, they should be considered food that has been designated to be eaten. And <b>if they are not fit</b> to be eaten, as they are yet not dry, even <b>if he designates them</b> the day before, <b>what of it?</b> Of what use is such designation, seeing that the fruit is still unfit to be eaten?
<b>And if you say</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where he could not ascend to the roof to examine them, and therefore <b>he did not know whether they were fit or unfit,</b> so that his designation was conditional, there is a difficulty. <b>As didn’t Rav Kahana say:</b> If fruit had been <b>set aside</b> for drying, and it <b>dried</b> and became fit for eating before Shabbat, <b>but the owner did not know about it</b> before Shabbat but only on Shabbat, the fruit <b>is permitted,</b> since he removed it from his mind only for as long as it would be unfit for eating.
<b>Rather, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the fruits <b>were fit, and</b> then <b>became disqualified, and then</b> once again <b>became fit,</b> and therefore they have the status of <i>muktze</i>? <b>And if you say</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> for half of Shabbat, <b>why do they require</b> prior <b>designation?</b> The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Rather, what</b> then do you say, that <b>there is</b> in fact a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> for half of Shabbat? In that case, <b>if he designates them</b> the day before, <b>what of it?</b> How does his designation permit that which is prohibited as <i>muktze</i>?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the fruits <b>were fit but not</b> completely <b>fit,</b> meaning <b>that there are people who eat</b> them in that state <b>and there are</b> other <b>people who do not eat</b> them. Therefore, if <b>he designated</b> them as food to be eaten, <b>he has revealed his intention</b> that he is included among those who do eat them; if <b>he did not designate</b> them as food, <b>he has not revealed his intention.</b> Therefore, no proof can be adduced from here.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the problem raised above <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>beans and lentils</b> cooked on a Festival. <b>As beans and lentils at the outset,</b> at twilight, when they are still raw and uncooked, <b>are fit to be chewed</b> as they are and are therefore not in the category of <i>muktze</i>; then, when <b>he casts them into the pot</b> to cook them, <b>they become disqualified</b> because while they are being cooked they are fit neither to be chewed raw nor to be eaten cooked.

Daf 27a

And then when <b>their cooking is finished, they</b> once again <b>become fit</b> for eating. This demonstrates that even food that had temporarily been set aside because it had become inedible does not remain prohibited for the entire day.
<b>Abaye said to him: And according to your reasoning</b> that foods are temporarily considered <i>muktze</i> while being cooked, <b>cooked dishes in general</b> present <b>a difficulty for you</b> on Shabbat as well. <b>As ordinary cooked dishes in general are</b> still <b>bubbling at twilight</b> and not yet edible, <b>and</b> yet <b>we partake of them</b> later <b>in the evening.</b> This demonstrates that although the food was considered <i>muktze</i> at the critical moment of twilight, it is not prohibited for the duration of Shabbat.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>we have no dilemma</b> with regard to a food <b>whose completion, which</b> brings it to its finished and edible form, <b>is</b> entirely <b>in the hands of a person,</b> e.g., beans and lentils. Such foods are certainly not considered as <i>muktze</i> for all of Shabbat simply because they had become temporarily unfit for eating. <b>Where we have a dilemma</b> is with regard to an item <b>whose completion is in the hands of Heaven,</b> such as figs and grapes, which dry by the heat of the sun. This dilemma remains unresolved.
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of permitting firstborn animals. <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia had a firstborn</b> animal that acquired a blemish on a Festival, and he wished to serve it to priests staying at his house. <b>He sent it to</b> be presented <b>before Rabbi Ami</b> for examination, and Rabbi Ami <b>thought</b> that he should <b>not examine it,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rabbi Zerika said to him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya:</b> The principle is that in cases of dispute between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who in this case permits examination of the firstborn. Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>then sent</b> the firstborn <b>to</b> be presented <b>before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa,</b> who likewise <b>thought</b> that he should <b>not examine it. Rabbi Yirmeya said to him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Zerika:</b> The principle is that in cases where <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon</b> disagree, the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abba said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not allow the Sages to act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? He said to him: And you, what do you have?</b> Do you have a tradition that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? Rabbi Abba <b>said to him</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said as follows:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> in this case <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> unidentified <b>person</b> in Babylonia <b>said:</b> May it be His will that <b>I merit to go up there</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> that <b>I learn</b> this <b>teaching from the mouth of its Master;</b> I will ask Rabbi Zeira himself for his opinion on this matter. <b>When he went up there</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Zeira</b> and <b>said to him:</b> Did <b>the Master say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: No,</b> that is not what I said; rather, <b>I said: It stands to reason</b> that this is so. It is reasonable to rule in accordance with Rabbi Shimon on this issue, although I do not have a definitive tradition to this effect.
Rabbi Zeira explains: Why do I think so? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it teaches in the mishna</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any</b> firstborn animal <b>whose blemish is not perceptible while it is still day is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival. <b>And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the same ruling <b>in the name of the Sages,</b> indicating that this is the majority opinion. One should therefore <b>learn from this that it stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
The Gemara asks: In the final analysis, <b>what</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? Whose opinion does the <i>halakha</i> follow? <b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear, as</b> this matter <b>hangs on great trees,</b> meaning it is the subject of a dispute among the early Sages. <b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said in the name of the holy community in Jerusalem: Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Menasya <b>and his colleagues said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Gemara wonders at the wording of this report: How could the holy community in Jerusalem have reported that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues <b>said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>Aren’t they much older than he?</b> Why, then, would they have reported a <i>halakha</i> in his name? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the holy community in Jerusalem said the following: Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues, who said that one may not examine blemishes on a Festival, <b>spoke in</b> accordance with <b>the opinion of Rabbi Meir.</b>
To which teaching of Rabbi Meir is the Gemara referring? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 28a): If <b>one slaughtered a firstborn</b> before it was shown to a Sage and deemed permitted, <b>and afterward he showed its blemish</b> to a Sage, who confirmed that it was indeed a permanent blemish that permitted the animal to be slaughtered, <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> it, as it had been established that the animal was blemished. <b>And Rabbi Meir says: Since it was slaughtered without</b> the permission <b>of an expert, it is prohibited. Apparently Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>the examination of a firstborn is not</b> as simple a process <b>as the examination of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since it involves more than a mere examination of the body of the animal. <b>The examination of a firstborn</b> must be conducted <b>when</b> the animal is <b>alive,</b> whereas <b>the examination of a <i>tereifa</i></b> may be performed even <b>after slaughtering.</b>
<b>And from this</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues inferred that <b>the examination of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> which consists merely of clarifying the facts of the animal’s physical state, may be done <b>even on a Festival.</b> On the other hand, <b>the</b> more stringent <b>examination of a firstborn,</b> which can be likened to the rendering of a judgment, a process with principles of its own, must be performed <b>on the eve of the Festival.</b>
<b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>there,</b> in that mishna, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir <b>disagree</b> about whether or not one may <b>examine blemishes</b> on a Festival? That was not their dispute; rather, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether or not there is a <b>penalty</b> for one who acted improperly. <b>As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If the blemish was <b>in the eyelids,</b> e.g., if a fissure developed there that disqualifies the animal, <b>everyone,</b> including Rabbi Meir, <b>agrees</b> that the animal <b>is prohibited, because</b> such a blemish <b>changes</b> its appearance after the slaughter. It is possible that after slaughter what was a temporary blemish will then look like a permanent one, and the animal will incorrectly be permitted retroactively.
<b>When they disagree</b> is in a case of <b>blemishes in the body,</b> e.g., if an ear had been cut off or a foreleg broken, which are prominent blemishes whose appearance does not change after death. <b>Rabbi Meir holds that we issue a decree</b> that <b>blemishes in the body</b> are prohibited <b>due to blemishes in the eye, and Rabbi Yehuda holds that we do not issue</b> such a <b>decree.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The wording of <b>the mishna</b> in tractate <i>Bekhorot</i> <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as it teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: Since it was slaughtered without</b> the permission of <b>an expert</b> who confirmed that this is a permanent blemish, <b>it is prohibited. Learn from this</b> that this is <b>a penalty</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>imposes</b> and nothing else. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is the correct understanding of the mishna.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Ami of Vardina</b> was <b>the examiner of firstborns in the household of the <i>Nasi</i>. On Festivals he would not examine</b> firstborn blemishes. <b>They came and told Rabbi Ami</b> about this. <b>He said to them: He does well not to examine</b> them. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Ami himself examine</b> firstborns for blemishes on a Festival? The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Ami would examine</b> the blemishes of firstborns, it was <b>on the day before</b> the Festival that <b>he would examine</b> them, to see whether the blemishes were permanent or temporary.

Daf 27b

<b>And on the Festival</b> itself <b>he would ask</b> only <b>how the incident occurred,</b> meaning that he would investigate the cause of the blemish, <b>as in that</b> case <b>where a certain man</b> who was a priest <b>brought a firstborn before Rava,</b> close to <b>nightfall on a Festival eve. Rava was sitting and washing</b> the hair on <b>his head. He raised his eyes and saw</b> the firstborn’s <b>blemish. He</b> then <b>said to</b> the owner of the firstborn: <b>Go now, and come</b> back <b>tomorrow.</b>
<b>When he came</b> back <b>on the following day,</b> Rava <b>said to him: How did the incident</b> that caused the blemish <b>occur?</b> The owner <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Barley</b> grains <b>were scattered on one side of a fence of thorns, while</b> the firstborn <b>was</b> standing <b>on the other side. When it wanted to eat, it stuck its head through the fence and a thorn cut its lip.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> the owner: <b>Perhaps you caused</b> the blemish by deliberately placing the barley on the other side of the fence? <b>He said to him: No.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And from where do you say that causing</b> a blemish to an offering <b>is prohibited? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to offerings: <b>“There must not be</b> any <b>blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21). <b>I have only</b> an explicit prohibition <b>that it may not have a blemish; from where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not cause</b> a blemish <b>to it by means of something else,</b> e.g., <b>that he does not bring dough or a dried fig and place it on its ear so that a dog will come and take it,</b> thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? Therefore <b>the verse states “any blemish.” It says “blemish” and it says “any blemish”;</b> the word “any” comes to teach that one may not cause a blemish.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an animal that died, one</b> may <b>not move it from its place</b> on a Festival. <b>And</b> such <b>an incident</b> once occurred <b>and they asked Rabbi Tarfon about it. And</b> on that same occasion they also asked him <b>about <i>ḥalla</i> that</b> had been separated from dough and then <b>became ritually impure</b> on a Festival. Such <i>ḥalla</i> is not fit to be eaten by anyone, nor may it be used in any other manner, e.g., as animal feed or as fuel for a fire, on that day. Rabbi Tarfon <b>entered the study hall and inquired</b> about these matters, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>said to him: One</b> may <b>not move them from their place.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>we learned the unattributed</b> mishna <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 156b) that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One</b> may <b>cut up gourds for an animal</b> on Shabbat so that it can eat them more easily, and similarly, one may cut up <b>an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass for dogs. Rabbi Yehuda says: If it was not an animal carcass</b> already <b>on the eve of Shabbat,</b> but rather it died on Shabbat itself, <b>it is prohibited.</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda distinguishes between an animal that died on Shabbat and one that died before Shabbat, it would appear that Rabbi Shimon holds that one may move an animal carcass and feed it to dogs even if it died on Shabbat. Accordingly, the mishna that prohibits moving an animal that died on a Festival seems to conflict with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion.
The Gemara rejects this argument: The mishna can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> as <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> nevertheless <b>concedes in</b> the case of <b>animals that</b> were entirely healthy at twilight but <b>died</b> on the Festival <b>that they are prohibited.</b> Since they were healthy at twilight, the owner had no intention at that point in time of feeding them to dogs, and they are therefore prohibited as <i>muktze</i>. The <i>baraita</i>, on the other hand, is referring to an animal that had been sick on the previous day; since the owner knew that it was close to death, he had in mind to feed it to his dogs after it died.
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Ameimar in the name of Rava, who said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon concedes in</b> the case of <b>animals that died</b> on the Festival without having been mortally sick the day before <b>that they are prohibited</b> on the Festival due to <i>muktze</i>; according to this opinion, it is <b>well. However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, in the name of Rava, who said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon was in disagreement even in</b> the case of <b>animals that died</b> suddenly, and he holds that <b>they are permitted, what is there to say?</b> The unattributed mishna appears to contradict this opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>Ze’iri explained it</b> as follows: The mishna is referring <b>to a sacred animal</b> that died; since it is sacred property, one may not derive benefit from it, and therefore one may not give it to dogs. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this interpretation, <b>as it teaches:</b> They asked Rabbi Tarfon <b>about it and about <i>ḥalla</i> that became ritually impure,</b> from which it may be inferred: <b>Just as <i>ḥalla</i> is sacred, so too,</b> the <b>animal</b> mentioned here is one <b>that was sacred,</b> rather than a non-sacred animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather,</b> according to this explanation, <b>the reason</b> that the animal may not be moved <b>is that</b> the animal <b>was sacred; but</b> if it was <b>a non-sacred</b> animal that died, it would be <b>permitted</b> to move it. If so, <b>this</b> works out <b>well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, in the name of Rava, who said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon was in disagreement even in</b> the case of <b>animals that died,</b> and he holds that <b>they are permitted;</b> according to this opinion, it is <b>well,</b> as one can say that the mishna, which indicates that one may move an animal that died on a Festival, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Ameimar in the name of Rava, who said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon concedes in</b> the case of <b>animals that died that they are prohibited, what is there to say?</b> The mishna is in accordance with neither Rabbi Shimon nor Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is <b>with</b> a case where the animal was <b>in danger</b> of dying the day before, and the owner had in mind to feed it to his dogs after it died, <b>and all agree</b> with regard to the ruling. Therefore, according to Rabbi Shimon, an allowance is granted to move the animal if it was a non-sacred animal and it had been in danger prior to the Festival; and if the animal was sacred, even he agrees that it is prohibited, as it may not be fed to dogs.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>not register</b> to have a portion <b>of an animal on a Festival <i>ab initio</i>,</b> since it is prohibited to divide up an animal into portions for different people, as this is similar to conducting business, a weekday activity, on a Festival. <b>But one</b> may <b>register for</b> the animal <b>on the eve of the Festival, and</b> then those who registered for the animal may <b>slaughter and divide</b> it <b>between them</b> on the Festival itself in accordance with the agreement reached the day before. The next day, each pays the slaughterer according to his portion of the animal.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>One</b> may <b>not register? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One</b> may <b>not fix</b> a sum <b>of money</b> and set a particular price for each portion <b>of an animal on a Festival <i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> should <b>one do</b> on a Festival to divide up the animal without fixing a price? <b>Rav said: He</b> should <b>bring two animals and stand them one next to the other and say:</b> Is <b>this one equal</b> in value <b>to the other one?</b> If the purchasers confirm that this is the case, then after the Festival they assess the value of the animal that is identical to the animal that had been slaughtered on the Festival, and in that way they establish the amount that each person must pay.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>A person</b> may <b>not say to another</b> on a Festival: <b>I am hereby</b> in partnership <b>with you</b> in this animal that you are about to slaughter <b>for the value of a <i>sela</i>,</b> or: <b>I am hereby</b> in partnership <b>with you for two</b> <i>sela</i>. <b>However, he</b> may <b>say to him: I am hereby</b> in partnership <b>with you for half</b> the animal, or <b>for a third or a quarter,</b> without stipulating the value of that share, and after the Festival they may determine how much each share is worth.

Daf 28a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> selling meat on a Festival who wishes to know its weight in order to determine its price may not weigh it against regular weights in the ordinary weekday manner, but he may <b>weigh</b> the <b>meat against</b> a <b>vessel or against</b> a <b>cleaver [<i>kofitz</i>]</b> and then calculate the weight of the meat by weighing the vessel or cleaver later. <b>And the Rabbis say: One</b> may <b>not look at the pans of a</b> balance <b>scale at all,</b> meaning that they may not be used for weighing in any manner or for any other purpose.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: One may not look at the pans of a scale <b>at all? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Even</b> if one has meat and he wishes <b>to protect it from mice,</b> he may not put it on a scale, since it would look as if he were weighing it. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: And this</b> ruling applies only <b>where</b> the scale <b>is hanging on the ring</b> used for balancing it. However, if the scale is hanging in such a manner that it is not fit for weighing, one may use it as he would use any other vessel.
<b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: It is prohibited for an expert butcher to weigh meat</b> on a Festival even <b>by hand</b> because he can arrive at its precise weight using this method, and so it is prohibited like weighing with a scale. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: It is prohibited for an expert butcher to weigh meat</b> on a Festival even <b>in water.</b> Butchers would calculate the weight of a slab of meat by placing it into a tub of water and measuring the amount of water that it displaces with the help of markings on the container. Since this procedure enables the butcher to determine the precise weight of the meat, it may not be performed on a Festival.
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: It is prohibited to make</b> a hole to serve as <b>a handle in meat</b> on a Festival, since this is a weekday act. <b>Ravina said: But it is permitted</b> to make such a handle <b>by hand,</b> rather than with a knife or some other implement, since this is an atypical manner of making a hole.
<b>Rav Huna said: It is permitted to make a sign on meat</b> even on a Festival, so that it not be mistaken for the meat of another person. This is <b>like that which Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> would do when he sent meat by means of a messenger to his house; he would <b>cut it into triangles</b> as a sign that the meat was his and it was fit to be eaten.
The Gemara relates an incident in connection to the basic <i>halakha</i> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, would <b>weigh</b> one <b>portion against</b> another <b>portion on a Festival</b> in order to divide the meat between them. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did they do so? This seems to be <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the mishna. As, <b>if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t he say: A person</b> may <b>weigh meat against a vessel or against a cleaver,</b> from which it may be inferred: <b>Against a vessel</b> or a cleaver, <b>yes,</b> one may do so; but <b>against anything else, no,</b> he may not. And <b>if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, didn’t they say: One</b> may <b>not look at the pans of a scale at all?</b>
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: One may weigh</b> one <b>portion against</b> another <b>portion on a Festival. Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, since we learned</b> in a mishna <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Bekhorot</i></b> (31a) <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion.
<b>As we learned</b> there: With regard to <b>consecrated animals that have become disqualified</b> because of a blemish, all <b>the benefit</b> that accrues <b>from their</b> sale belongs <b>to the</b> Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property. <b>And one</b> may <b>weigh</b> one <b>portion</b> of meat <b>against</b> another <b>portion</b> of meat <b>in</b> the case of a <b>firstborn</b> that developed a blemish. Although the meat of a firstborn may not be sold by weight in the manner of non-sacred meat, one may weigh one portion against another portion in order to determine its price. This indicates that even in a case where it is prohibited to weigh an item in the ordinary manner, one may still weigh one portion of it against another portion.
<b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps that is not so,</b> and the two cases are not similar. It is possible that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua stated</b> his opinion that one may weigh one portion against another <b>only here,</b> on a Festival, <b>where</b> the action does <b>not</b> involve a show of <b>degradation of sacred</b> items; <b>but there,</b> in the case of a firstborn, <b>where</b> the weighing involves a display of <b>degradation of sacred</b> items, perhaps he did <b>not</b> permit weighing of any kind.
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible that <b>the Rabbis stated</b> their opinion that one may weigh one portion against another <b>only there,</b> in the case of a firstborn, <b>because it does not look like a weekday activity; but here,</b> on a Festival, <b>where it looks like a weekday activity,</b> perhaps they would <b>not</b> have permitted it. It is therefore possible that even the Rabbis would prohibit this action on a Festival.
With regard to the incident involving Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that they were particular with each other</b> with regard to such matters, to the extent that they had to weigh one portion against another so that their portions would be exactly equal? <b>But wasn’t</b> there the incident of <b>the seven fish that were brought to the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and five of them were</b> later <b>found in the house</b> of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who had taken them from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi; <b>and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>was not particular</b> about this, as they treated each other like family?
<b>Rav Pappa said: Cast a person between them.</b> In other words, a third party must have been involved in the incident. How so? <b>Either</b> the two who divided the meat between themselves were <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, or</b> else they were <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and bar Kappara.</b> Although these pairs of scholars were colleagues, they were exacting with each other in monetary matters. Consequently, they weighed one portion of meat against the other to ensure that they would each receive the same amount.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>not sharpen a knife on a Festival</b> in the ordinary weekday manner. <b>However, one</b> may do so in an unusual fashion, e.g., to <b>run</b> one knife <b>over another,</b> thereby sharpening the blade.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> that one may not sharpen a knife on a Festival <b>only</b> if he does so in the typical manner, <b>with a stone</b> knife <b>sharpener, but</b> if he does so <b>with a wooden</b> knife <b>sharpener, it is permitted,</b> as this is an unusual way of sharpening knives. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>a stone</b> sharpener <b>is prohibited, we said</b> this <b>only where</b> one’s intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife, <b>but</b> if he merely means <b>to remove the</b> accumulated <b>fat</b> by scraping it off with the stone, <b>it is permitted.</b> This proves <b>by inference that with</b> a sharpener made <b>of wood, even</b> if his intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife, <b>it is permitted.</b>
<b>Some teach</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of Rav Huna’s statement, where he says: But if he uses a sharpener made <b>of wood, it is permitted. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>with a wooden</b> sharpener it <b>is permitted, we said</b> this <b>only where</b> one’s intention is <b>to remove its fat, but</b> if he does so in order <b>to sharpen it, it is prohibited.</b> This proves <b>by inference that</b> with a sharpener made <b>of stone, even</b> if he intended merely <b>to remove its fat, it is prohibited.</b>
<b>Some teach</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <b>to the mishna</b> itself, which teaches: <b>One</b> may <b>not sharpen a knife on a Festival. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> that this is prohibited <b>only</b> where one’s intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife, <b>but</b> if his aim is merely <b>to remove its fat, it is permitted.</b> This proves <b>by inference that</b> running one knife <b>over another is permitted even</b> if his intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife.
<b>And some teach</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which teaches: <b>However, one</b> may <b>run</b> one knife <b>over another. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> where one’s intention is <b>to remove its fat, but</b> if he does so <b>to sharpen it, it is prohibited.</b> This proves <b>by inference that with a sharpener, it is prohibited even to remove its fat.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that with a sharpener it is</b> entirely <b>prohibited? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This <i>tanna</i> does <b>not</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> difference <b>between a Festival and Shabbat is only</b> with regard to the preparation of <b>food,</b> as it is permitted to perform labor for the purpose of food preparation on a Festival, but not on Shabbat; <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits even</b> actions that <b>facilitate preparation of food</b> on a Festival, e.g., repairing utensils with which food is prepared on the Festival.
<b>Rava said to Rav Ḥisda: We teach in your name</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. He said to him: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that you teach in my name all outstanding matters like this.</b> In other words, Rav Ḥisda was pleased that this teaching was attributed to him, as he too agreed with it.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, said: I was</b> once <b>standing before Rava, and he was</b>

Daf 28b

<b>running a knife over the rim of a basket</b> on a Festival. <b>And I said to him:</b> Is <b>the Master doing</b> so <b>in order to sharpen it or</b> in order <b>to remove its fat? And he said to me: To remove its fat. And I</b> nevertheless <b>perceived his intention, that he did so</b> in order <b>to sharpen it.</b> He concealed this from me, however, because <b>he holds</b> that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is the <b><i>halakha</i> but a</b> public <b>ruling is not issued to that effect;</b> therefore he did not wish to permit the practice explicitly.
Similarly, <b>Abaye said: I was standing before my Master</b> and teacher, Rabba, <b>and he was running a knife over the edge of a millstone</b> on a Festival. <b>And I said to him:</b> Does <b>the Master wish to sharpen it, or</b> is he doing this in order <b>to remove its fat? And he said to me: To remove its fat. And I perceived his intention, that he did so</b> in order <b>to sharpen it, but he holds:</b> This is the <b><i>halakha</i>, but a</b> public <b>ruling is not issued to that effect.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to showing a</b> slaughtering <b>knife to a Sage on a Festival</b> so that he may examine it for nicks and imperfections that would render it unfit to be used for slaughtering? <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Bizna, permitted</b> it, <b>whereas the Rabbis prohibited</b> it, as this is somewhat similar to a weekday activity. <b>And Rav Yosef said: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a knife <b>for himself</b> in his own home <b>and</b> then <b>lend it to others,</b> who may also slaughter with it. Since the examination is not performed in public, it does not appear similar to a weekday activity.
§ <b>And Rav Yosef said:</b> With regard to <b>a knife that became blunt</b> without being nicked, <b>it is permitted to sharpen it on a Festival. And this applies</b> only if the knife still <b>cuts,</b> albeit <b>with difficulty,</b> so that when he sharpens it he is seen not as making a new utensil but merely as improving an old one. However, if the knife no longer cuts at all, it is prohibited to sharpen it.
<b>Rav Ḥisda taught, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> who taught: <b>A knife that became nicked</b> on a Festival, <b>a</b> roasting <b>skewer [<i>shappud</i>] that was crushed</b> on a Festival and its point broke off, <b>and the sweeping of</b> the coals in <b>an oven and a stove on a Festival</b> to prepare them for baking, with regard to all of these <b>we have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> difference <b>between a Festival and Shabbat is only</b> with regard to the <b>preparation of food. Rabbi Yehuda permits even</b> actions that <b>facilitate preparation of food</b> on a Festival.
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i></b> for prohibiting actions that facilitate food preparation? <b>The verse states:</b> “Save that which every person must eat, <b>that alone may be done for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), from which it may be inferred: <b>“That”</b> may be done on a Festival, <b>but not</b> actions that <b>facilitate it. And Rabbi Yehuda</b> adduces proof for his view from the fact that <b>the verse states: “For you,”</b> indicating: <b>For you, for all your needs,</b> and that which facilitates food preparation is also a need.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, is it not written “for you”?</b> What does he learn from this phrase? The Gemara answers: That <i>tanna</i> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>that</b> phrase comes to teach: <b>For you, but not for gentiles.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehuda, <b>too, isn’t it written: “That,”</b> which indicates a limitation? The Gemara explains that Rabbi Yehuda could have <b>said to you:</b> The limiting word <b>“that” is written, and</b> the expansive phrase <b>“for you,”</b> indicating all your needs, <b>is written</b> as well, <b>but</b> this is <b>not difficult</b> and no contradiction is involved. One can say that <b>here,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> actions that <b>facilitate</b> food preparation <b>that can be performed on the eve of the Festival;</b> the Torah prohibits these on a Festival. <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> actions that <b>facilitate</b> food preparation <b>that cannot be performed on the eve of the Festival.</b> The latter may be performed even on the Festival itself, as they too are part of the preparation of food, similar to cooking.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to a roasting <b>skewer that became bent, it is prohibited to repair it on a Festival.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious;</b> it is clear that one may not fix a utensil on a Festival. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a particular case: <b>Although</b> the skewer <b>can be straightened by hand</b> and no special tool is needed for this task, it is nevertheless prohibited.
<b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a skewer upon which one roasted meat, it is prohibited to move it on a Festival,</b> as it has already served its purpose on the Festival, and it is not fit for any other use. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that <b>Rav Malkiyu said: He</b> may <b>pull</b> the skewer <b>out and place it in a corner</b> so that it will not endanger anyone, as it could if it were left in the middle of the house.
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: And this</b> ruling applies only <b>where</b> the skewer <b>has an olive-bulk of meat on it;</b> in such a case he may move the skewer on account of the meat and drag it into the corner in an unusual manner. However, if it does not have an olive-bulk of meat on it, he may not move it at all. <b>Ravina said: Although it does not have</b> an olive-bulk of <b>meat on it, it is permitted to move it</b> in the regular manner and place it in a corner, <b>just as in</b> the case of <b>a thorn</b> lying <b>in the public domain.</b> For the sake of public safety, it is permitted to remove such a thorn by moving it in increments, each less than four cubits. The same applies to this skewer; since it might harm someone where it is, it may be moved to a corner.
Apropos Rav Malkiyu, to whom only a few <i>halakhot</i> are attributed, the Gemara mentions that <b>Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a skewer</b> that had been used for roasting meat but no longer has an olive-bulk of meat on it, that it may be moved to a corner; and likewise, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>maidservants,</b> that even if a woman brought one hundred maidservants into the marriage as her dowry, her husband may nevertheless compel her to perform some sort of work so that her boredom not bring her to sin (<i>Ketubot</i> 61b); <b>and</b> finally, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>follicles,</b> that if a girl has two hair follicles in her pubic region, even if there are no hairs growing from them, she is considered to have reached majority and may perform <i>ḥalitza</i>; these three <i>halakhot</i> were all stated by <b>Rav Malkiyu.</b>
However, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a forelock,</b> that a Jew who cuts the hair of a gentile must stop before he reaches his forelock at a distance of three fingerbreadths on every side, as the gentiles would grow their forelocks for idolatry, and the Jew must not appear as if he were dressing the forelock for idolatrous purposes; and likewise, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>burnt ashes,</b> that one may not place them on a wound, as it looks like a tattoo; <b>and</b> finally, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>cheese</b> made by a gentile, that it is forbidden because gentiles smooth the surface of their cheese with lard; these three <i>halakhot</i> were all stated by a different Sage named <b>Rav Malkiya.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> a different principle: The teachings mentioned above that relate to <b>a mishna or a <i>baraita</i></b> were stated by <b>Rav Malkiya,</b> whereas <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that are not related to a mishna or <i>baraita</i> were taught by <b>Rav Malkiyu. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this <b>is: The mishna is a queen</b> [<b><i>malketa</i></b>]; the comments that are referring to a mishna were made by Rav Malkiya, whose name is similar to the Aramaic term for queen. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> Rav Ḥinnana and Rav Pappa? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>maidservants.</b> According to Rav Ḥinnana, this <i>halakha</i> was stated by Rav Malkiyu, whereas Rav Pappa holds that it was taught by Rav Malkiya, since it is referring to a dispute in a mishna.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>not say to a butcher</b> on a Festival: <b>Weigh for me a dinar’s worth of meat,</b> since if he mentions a sum of money, it looks like a commercial transaction. <b>But</b> the butcher may <b>slaughter</b> an animal <b>and apportion it</b> among his customers without stipulating a price.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> should one <b>do</b> if he wishes to take part of an animal on a Festival, but is barred from mentioning its price? The Gemara answers: <b>As</b>

Daf 29a

<b>they would say in Sura:</b> Give me that cut of meat called <b>a <i>tarta</i> or half a <i>tarta</i>,</b> without naming a price. <b>In Neresh they would say</b> in reference to those same portions: <b>A part or half a part. In Pumbedita they would say: An <i>uzya</i> or half an <i>uzya</i>. In Nehar Pekod and in Mata Meḥasya they would say:</b> Give me <b>a quarter or half a quarter,</b> thereby establishing the size of the portion without mentioning its price.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>person</b> may <b>say to another</b> on a Festival: <b>Fill this vessel for me,</b> and I will return its contents or reimburse you after the Festival, <b>but</b> he may <b>not</b> ask him to fill the vessel <b>in a</b> particular <b>measure. Rabbi Yehuda says: If it was a measuring utensil, he may not fill it.</b> There was <b>an incident involving Abba Shaul ben Botnit,</b> a Sage who was also a grocer, <b>who would fill his measures on the eve of a Festival and give them to</b> his <b>customers on the Festival.</b> In this way he would know exactly how much he had given each person, without conducting any measurements on the Festival itself.
<b>Abba Shaul,</b> a Sage distinct from Abba Shaul ben Botnit, <b>says: He would do this even on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival because of the clarity of the measures,</b> i.e., in order to clarify precisely how much must be given to each customer, since the measurement is more precise once the foam of the liquid being measured has subsided. <b>And the Rabbis say: Even on a weekday</b> it is proper to <b>do so, because of the draining of the measures.</b> This method allows all the liquid to drain fully out of the seller’s measuring utensil so that the amount is exact.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>But not in a measure? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: But not with a vessel designated for measuring; however,</b> in the case of <b>a vessel that</b> can <b>be used for measuring</b> but has yet to be used for this purpose, <b>he</b> may <b>fill it.</b> According to this, <b>Rabbi Yehuda comes to</b> disagree and <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> may <b>not fill even a vessel that</b> can <b>be used for measuring.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is stringent with regard to the joy of the Festival</b> in that he prohibits the use of any sort of measuring utensil, <b>while the Rabbis are lenient. But didn’t we hear them</b> state <b>the opposite, as we learned</b> in an earlier mishna (28a) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> selling meat on a Festival may <b>weigh</b> the <b>meat against a vessel or against a cleaver, and the Rabbis say: One</b> may <b>not look at the pans of a</b> balance <b>scale at all? Apparently,</b> here, the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda is lenient, while the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis is stringent.</b> Therefore, <b>there is a contradiction between</b> the one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as well as <b>a contradiction between</b> the one statement of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara answers: With regard to the contradiction <b>between</b> the one teaching of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other teaching of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> this is <b>not difficult. There,</b> where he is lenient, he is dealing <b>with</b> a vessel <b>that cannot be used for measuring</b> on a regular basis at all, whereas <b>here,</b> he is referring to a vessel that <b>can be used for measuring,</b> and therefore he is stringent even if the vessel has not yet actually been used in this capacity.
With regard to the contradiction <b>between</b> the one statement of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it is <b>also not difficult. There, he is acting in a weekday manner,</b> and consequently they prohibit the weighing, whereas <b>here, he is not acting in a weekday manner,</b> as the vessel is not a measuring utensil, and consequently they permit him to use it. This completes the Gemara’s discussion of Shmuel’s explanation of the mishna.
The Gemara offers a second explanation of the mishna. Rava <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>But not by measure?</b> It means <b>that he</b> may <b>not mention to him the name of the measure.</b> For example, he may not say: Fill for me one <i>kav</i>, or two <i>kav</i>. <b>However, he</b> may <b>fill a vessel</b> even if it is <b>designated for measuring. And Rabbi Yehuda comes to say: He</b> may <b>not fill a vessel designated for measuring,</b> even if he does not stipulate a particular measure.
The Gemara asks: <b>Apparently, with regard to the joy of the Festival, Rabbi Yehuda is stringent, and the Rabbis are lenient. But didn’t we hear them</b> state <b>the opposite, as we learned</b> in an earlier mishna (28a) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> may <b>weigh meat against a vessel or against a cleaver, and the Rabbis</b> prohibit this and <b>say: One</b> may <b>not look at the pans of a</b> balance <b>scale at all? Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is lenient, while the Rabbis are stringent.</b> Therefore, <b>there is a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara answers: With regard to the contradiction <b>between</b> one teaching of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other teaching of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> this is <b>not difficult. There,</b> with regard to weighing meat against a vessel, he is dealing <b>with</b> a vessel <b>that is not designated for measuring,</b> and therefore he is lenient, whereas <b>here,</b> he is referring to a vessel that <b>is designated for measuring,</b> with regard to which he is stringent. With regard to the contradiction <b>between</b> one statement of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis,</b> this is <b>also not difficult. There, he is acting in a weekday manner,</b> and consequently they prohibit the weighing, whereas <b>here, he is not acting in a weekday manner, as people are accustomed to offer</b> their friends <b>wine in a measuring utensil and drink.</b> Since the use of such a vessel is not exclusive to commercial transactions, the Rabbis permitted it here as well.
§ The mishna recounted <b>an incident involving Abba Shaul ben Botnit,</b> a Sage who was also a grocer, who would fill his measures on the eve of a Festival and give them to his customers on the Festival. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He would do this even on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, in order to</b> prevent <b>dereliction</b> of Torah study in <b>the study hall.</b> Since he wanted to spend most of his day in the study hall and not have to interrupt his study to carry out measurements, he would measure for his customers at night, when it was not a time of study.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Abba Shaul ben Botnit <b>collected three hundred earthenware jugs of wine,</b> to which he thought he was not entitled <b>due to the clarity of the measures,</b> as he thought that he had unfairly profited from the foam at the top of the liquid he measured. <b>And his colleagues,</b> similarly God-fearing grocers, <b>collected three hundred earthenware jugs of oil,</b> which they thought were not rightly theirs <b>due to the draining of the measures;</b> they were concerned that because they had measured for their customers using their own vessels, they might not have drained the entire measure from their containers into the customers’ vessels. <b>And they brought</b> these jugs of wine and oil <b>to Jerusalem before the</b> Temple <b>treasurers,</b> as they did not want to benefit from possibly stolen goods.
The treasurers <b>said to them: You need not do this,</b> as all buyers take into account the foam and what is left in the sellers’ vessels and pay with this in mind. <b>They said to them:</b> Just like the buyers give up their claim to it, <b>we too do not wish</b> to benefit <b>from this,</b> even if strictly speaking it is not considered stolen property.
The treasurers <b>said to them: Since you are</b> so <b>stringent with yourselves, use</b> the wine and oil <b>for communal needs. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole and does not know from whom he stole, he</b> should <b>use</b> the stolen items <b>for communal needs,</b> thereby repaying all of the Jewish people. The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> communal needs? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> He should finance the digging of <b>cisterns, ditches, and caves,</b> for storing water for travelers.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda authorized Rabbana Ukva</b> to give a public lecture, <b>and he taught</b> the following: <b>A person</b> may <b>not measure barley and place</b> it <b>before his animal on a Festival, but he</b> may <b>cut out [<i>koder</i>]</b> a hole in the pile of grain by means of a vessel of one <b><i>kav</i> or two <i>kav</i>, and place</b> the barley <b>before his animal, and he need not be concerned</b> about the measuring this entails, as he does not transgress the prohibition against using a measuring utensil if he is not particular about measuring precisely. <b>And a baker</b> may <b>measure spices and put them in his pot, so as not to spoil his dish,</b> since if he puts in too much he will ruin the food.
<b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: A woman</b> may <b>measure flour on a Festival and put it into her dough in order to separate <i>ḥalla</i> generously,</b> because if she knows the exact amount of dough she can separate the proper amount of <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It <b>is prohibited,</b> as she can estimate the amount that must be set aside as <i>ḥalla</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> a Sage <b>of the school of Shmuel teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> stating that this <b>is permitted?</b>
<b>Abaye said: Now that</b> it is known that <b>Shmuel said</b> it <b>is prohibited and</b> a Sage <b>of the school of Shmuel taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that it <b>is permitted,</b>

Daf 29b

it is reasonable to conclude that <b>Shmuel came to teach us the practical <i>halakha</i>.</b> Knowing that a <i>baraita</i> permits the practice, Shmuel found it necessary to state that the <i>halakha</i> is otherwise.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>not</b> sift <b>flour a second time on a Festival,</b> as this involves unnecessary extra effort. <b>They said in the name of Rabbi Papeyyas and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira: One</b> may sift flour <b>a second time. However, they</b> all <b>agree that if a pebble or a wood chip fell into</b> the flour after it had been sifted the previous day, one may sift it <b>a second time</b> in order to remove the items.
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Ravina: One</b> may <b>not</b> sift <b>flour a second time on a Festival, but</b> if <b>a pebble or a wood chip fell</b> into the flour after the first sifting, <b>he</b> may <b>remove it with his hand.</b> Ravina <b>said to him: All the more so</b> is the latter procedure <b>prohibited, as it is similar to</b> the prohibited labor of <b>selecting.</b> It is therefore preferable to sift the flour with a sieve, and the unwanted items will thereby be removed.
<b>Rava bar Rav Huna the Short taught at the entrance to Neharde’a: One</b> may sift <b>flour a second time on a Festival. Rav Naḥman said to</b> the students standing before him: <b>Go out and say to Abba,</b> i.e., to Rava bar Rav Huna, as Rava is a shortened form of Rav Abba: <b>Your good has been removed and cast upon thorns,</b> meaning that your teachings are not needed. <b>Go out and see how many sieves circulate in Neharde’a,</b> as all the women already know that this is permitted.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yosef’s wife was</b> once <b>sifting flour</b> in an unusual manner <b>on the reverse</b> side <b>of a sieve. He said to her: Look, I want good-quality bread,</b> hinting that she need not invert the sieve but may sift the flour in her regular fashion. The Gemara likewise relates that <b>Rav Ashi’s wife was</b> once <b>sifting flour onto a table,</b> rather than into a bowl in the usual manner. <b>Rav Ashi said: This</b> one <b>of ours,</b> my wife, is <b>the daughter of Rami bar Ḥama, and Rami bar Ḥama is a master of</b> good <b>deeds</b> who is meticulous in his performance of mitzvot. <b>Had</b> my wife <b>not observed</b> this practice <b>in her father’s house, she would not have acted</b> in this manner. Therefore, one can learn the <i>halakha</i> in practice from her actions.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>go</b> on a Festival <b>to a grocer</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me eggs and nuts of</b> such-and-such <b>a number, as it is the manner of a homeowner to count</b> this way <b>in his</b> own <b>house.</b> Counting eggs or nuts is not considered a commercial activity, as people regularly mention the number of eggs and nuts that they need.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>go</b> on a Festival <b>to a shepherd</b> with <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to deal <b>and say to him: Give me one kid, or one lamb.</b> Similarly, one may go on a Festival <b>to a butcher</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me one foreleg</b> of an animal, <b>or one thigh.</b> Likewise, one may approach <b>one who deals in fattened</b> fowl from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me one dove or one pigeon.</b> He may also visit <b>a baker</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me one loaf or one cake [<i>geluska</i>].</b>
<b>And</b> one may go on a Festival <b>to a grocer</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me twenty eggs, or fifty nuts,</b> or <b>ten peaches, or five pomegranates, or one <i>etrog</i>, provided that he does not mention any measure.</b> In other words, he must not specify a unit of measurement, e.g., a <i>kav</i>; rather, he must state a number, which is not the usual manner of making a purchase. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> This is permitted, <b>provided that he does not mention the amount of</b> the <b>purchase,</b> meaning that he must not mention the sum of money that he is spending, but rather he must take what he needs and after the Festival they will calculate how much he owes.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who brings wine jugs from</b> one <b>place to</b> another <b>place may not bring</b> a large number of <b>them in a basket or in a tub</b> in the usual weekday manner on a Festival, as this is disrespectful of the Festival; <b>but he may bring</b> one or two barrels <b>on his shoulder or</b> carry them <b>in front of himself. Similarly, one who brings straw</b> for kindling or for feeding animals <b>may not place the tub behind him</b> while carrying it, as this is the usual weekday manner; <b>but he may transport it</b> in front of him <b>in his hand,</b> in an unusual fashion. <b>And one may begin</b> taking straw for kindling

Daf 30a

<b>from the pile of straw,</b> although he did not designate the pile for this purpose the day before; <b>but one may not</b> begin to take from <b>the wood in the</b> wood <b>storage,</b> a small yard behind the house where people store various items that they do not intend to use in the near future.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If it is impossible to modify</b> the manner in which one carries a vessel, whether due to the vessel or due to time constraints, <b>it is permitted</b> to act in the typical weekday manner.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rava instituted</b> the following <b>in</b> his city, <b>Meḥoza:</b> One <b>who</b> usually <b>carries</b> his burden <b>with difficulty</b> on a weekday <b>should</b> modify his habit on a Festival and <b>carry it on a pitchfork.</b> One <b>who</b> usually <b>carries it on a pitchfork should carry it on a carrying pole</b> held by two people on their shoulders. One <b>who carries it on a carrying pole</b> held by two people on their shoulders <b>should carry it</b> on a carrying pole <b>in his hands,</b> although he is not thereby making it easier for himself. One <b>who carries</b> burdens on a carrying pole <b>in his hands should spread a scarf [<i>sudara</i>] over it. And if it is not possible</b> to make these modifications due to time constraints, <b>it is permitted</b> to proceed in the usual manner, as <b>the Master said above: If it is impossible to modify, it is permitted.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said to Rav Ashi: The Sages said: As much as it is possible to modify</b> the weekday manner, <b>one should modify on a Festival.</b> A question was asked of Rav Ashi: <b>But don’t those women fill their jugs with water on a Festival without modifying, and we say nothing to them</b> by way of protest; why do we not instruct them to alter their usual manner?
<b>He said to him:</b> It is <b>because it is not possible</b> for them to fill their jugs any other way. <b>How should they act?</b> She <b>who</b> is accustomed to <b>filling a large jug, should</b> she instead <b>fill a small jug?</b> Won’t this mean that <b>she increases</b> her <b>walking,</b> since she has to make more than one trip to bring home more than one jug, and she will thereby perform unnecessary labor on the Festival?
If one were to suggest the opposite, <b>that one who fills a small jug should fill a large jug,</b> won’t this mean that <b>she increases</b> her <b>load?</b> Furthermore, if one were to suggest that <b>she should cover</b> the jug <b>with</b> a wooden <b>cover, sometimes</b> it <b>falls and she might come to bring it</b> by hand, in the manner of a burden. <b>Should she tie</b> the cover to the jug, the rope might <b>occasionally break, and she might come to tie it,</b> a prohibited labor. Finally, <b>should she spread a scarf over it,</b> it <b>occasionally</b> falls off and <b>becomes soaked in water, and she might come to</b> transgress the prohibition against <b>squeezing. Therefore, it is not possible</b> to make a modification, and those women may act in the regular manner.
<b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanin said to Abaye: We learned</b> in a mishna: The Rabbis decreed that <b>one may not clap, nor strike</b> a hand on his thigh, <b>nor dance</b> on a Festival, lest he come to repair musical instruments. <b>But nowadays we see that</b> women <b>do so, and</b> yet <b>we do not say anything to them.</b>
<b>He said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> how do you explain <b>that</b> which <b>Rava said: A person should not sit at the entrance</b> to an alleyway, next to <b>the side post</b> that has been placed at the edge of an alleyway in order for it to be considered a private domain, as <b>perhaps an object</b> will <b>roll</b> away <b>from him and he will come to carry it four cubits in the public domain,</b> thereby transgressing a biblical prohibition? <b>But don’t these women take their jugs, and go, and sit at the entrance to an alleyway, and we do not say anything to them?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the accepted principle is: <b>Leave</b> the <b>Jews</b> alone; <b>it is better that they be unwitting sinners and not be intentional sinners.</b> If people engage in a certain behavior that cannot be corrected, it is better not to reprove them, as they are likely to continue regardless of the reproof, and then they will be sinning intentionally. It is therefore preferable for them to be unaware that they are violating a prohibition and remain merely unwitting sinners. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to clapping and dancing, <b>leave</b> the <b>Jews</b> alone; <b>it is better that they be unwitting sinners and not be intentional sinners.</b>
The Gemara comments: There were those who understood that <b>this</b> principle <b>applies only to rabbinic</b> prohibitions <b>but</b> not to <b>Torah</b> prohibitions, with regard to which the transgressors must be reprimanded. <b>However, this is not so;</b> it is <b>no different</b> whether the prohibition is <b>by Torah</b> law <b>or</b> whether it is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>we do not say anything to them.</b> For example, on the eve of Yom Kippur, there is an obligation <b>that</b> one begin the fast while it is still day, before sunset, as <b>the extension of Yom Kippur.</b> During this time, one must observe all the <i>halakhot</i>. This mitzva of extending Yom Kippur <b>is by Torah</b> law, <b>and</b> yet people <b>eat and drink until darkness</b> falls <b>but we do not say anything to them,</b> as we know they will pay no attention.
It is taught in the mishna: <b>And one may begin</b> taking straw <b>from the pile of straw. Rav Kahana said: That is to say</b> that <b>one may begin</b> removing items <b>from a storeroom</b> on a Festival <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Although the items in this storeroom are designated for other purposes, it is not assumed that one put them out of his mind. If so, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who is not</b> of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <b>set-aside [<i>muktze</i>].</b> According to him, on Shabbat and Festivals it is not prohibited to handle items that one has removed from his mind.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the same mishna as follows: <b>But not wood in the</b> wood <b>storage.</b> If so, <b>we have come to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who is</b> of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> wood of <b>cedars and firs,</b> which are expensive and used only in the construction of important buildings, not for kindling; the wood storage is therefore considered <b><i>muktze</i> due to</b> potential <b>monetary loss.</b> With regard to an item that one removes from his mind due to the financial loss he might suffer were he to use it, but not due to any prohibition involved, <b>even Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> that it may not be handled due to the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who taught</b> the statement of Rav Kahana as referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, as follows: <b>But not wood from the</b> wood <b>storage</b> area. <b>Rav Kahana said: That is to say</b> that <b>one may not begin</b> removing items <b>from a storeroom <i>ab initio</i>.</b> If so, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who </b> maintains that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>Say the first clause</b> of the mishna, which states that <b>one may begin</b> taking <b>from the pile of straw.</b> If so, <b>we have come to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who is not</b> of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the first clause of the mishna, it is dealing <b>with straw</b> that has rotted <b>and become rancid.</b> Since it is no longer fit as animal fodder, even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that it will be used for kindling and is not <i>muktze</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t rancid straw fit for clay</b> in the making of bricks; why can one assume that it will be used as fuel? The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring to straw <b>that has thorns,</b> which cannot be kneaded into clay. It will certainly be used only for kindling.

Daf 30b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not take wood from a <i>sukka</i></b> on any Festival, not only on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, because this is considered dismantling, <b>but</b> one may take <b>from near it.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question with regard to the mishna: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different?</b> Why did the mishna teach that <b>from the <i>sukka</i></b> itself one may <b>not</b> remove wood? It is because <b>one</b> thereby <b>dismantles a tent,</b> which is a prohibited labor. But if so, if one takes wood <b>from near it, too,</b> doesn’t <b>he</b> thereby <b>dismantle a tent?</b> Why, then, does the mishna permit him to do so?
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Near it?</b> It means <b>near the walls.</b> Wood placed near the walls may be removed because it is not part of the <i>sukka</i> itself; the walls themselves may not be removed. <b>Rav Menashya said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the wood <b>is not near the walls</b> but is part of the roof of the <i>sukka</i> itself, <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught, it was</b> with regard <b>to bundles</b> of reeds that are not considered part of the roof of the <i>sukka</i>, as they have not been untied. Therefore, one may remove them.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: One may not take wood from the <i>sukka</i></b> itself <b>but</b> only <b>from the nearby</b> wood. <b>And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> one to take wood from the <i>sukka</i> as well. <b>And</b> all <b>agree,</b> even Rabbi Shimon, that with regard <b>to the <i>sukka</i></b> that was built for the <b>festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>during the Festival it is prohibited</b> to remove wood from it. <b>But if</b> at the outset <b>one stipulated</b> a condition <b>with regard to it</b> allowing him to use it for other purposes, it is <b>all according to his stipulation.</b>
The Gemara questions this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Shimon permit</b> one to take wood from the <i>sukka</i> itself? <b>But isn’t one dismantling a tent,</b> which is a prohibited labor? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Here, we are dealing with a <i>sukka</i></b> that has already <b>collapsed.</b> Therefore, the only potential concern is <i>muktze</i>, not dismantling. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he is not</b> of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a wick in oil was lit before Shabbat, and it went out on Shabbat, <b>the remainder of the oil in a lamp or in a bowl is prohibited</b> for use, as it is <i>muktze</i>. <b>And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> one to use it. Consequently, Rabbi Shimon also permits one to take wood from the <i>sukka</i>.
The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Is it comparable? There,</b> in the case of oil in a lamp, <b>a person sits and anticipates when his lamp will be extinguished.</b> It is clear to him that it will be extinguished, and he can safely assume that a certain amount of oil will remain in the lamp or the bowl. <b>Here,</b> however, can it be said that <b>a person sits and anticipates when his <i>sukka</i> will fall?</b> He cannot know ahead of time that his <i>sukka</i> will collapse.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Here, we are dealing with a <i>sukka</i></b> that is <b>not sturdy, as from yesterday,</b> the Festival eve, <b>one</b> already <b>had his mind on it.</b> He thought it might collapse, and therefore he did not remove the possibility of using its wood from his mind.
§ The above <i>baraita</i> states: <b>All agree with regard to the <i>sukka</i></b> that was built for the <b>festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, that <b>during the Festival it is prohibited</b> to remove wood from it, <b>but if one stipulated</b> a condition <b>with regard to it,</b> it is <b>all according to his condition.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And is a condition effective with</b> regard to <b>it?</b>
<b>But didn’t Rav Sheshet say in the name of Rabbi Akiva: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the wood of a <i>sukka</i></b> is <b>prohibited</b> to be used for any other use <b>all seven</b> days of the Festival? It is <b>as it is stated: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> to the Lord, seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:34). <b>And it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> in explanation of this that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that just as the name of Heaven takes effect upon the Festival peace-offering, so too, does the name of Heaven take effect upon the <i>sukka</i>? The verse states: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> to the Lord, seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:34), from which it is learned: <b>Just as the Festival</b> offering is consecrated <b>to the Lord, so too, the <i>sukka</i></b> is consecrated <b>to the Lord.</b> Since the wood of the <i>sukka</i> is compared to consecrated objects, how may one stipulate a condition with regard to it?
<b>Rav Menashya, son of Rava, said:</b> In <b>the latter clause,</b> where the stipulation is mentioned, <b>we have arrived at</b> the case of <b>a regular <i>sukka</i>,</b> a hut used throughout the year, not specifically for the Festival. With regard to such a <i>sukka</i>, one may stipulate to use the wood as he wishes; <b>but</b> as for <b>a <i>sukka</i> of mitzva,</b> used for the Festival, <b>a condition is not effective with regard to it.</b>
The Gemara asks a question from a different angle: <b>And is</b> a condition <b>not</b> effective for <b>a <i>sukka</i> of mitzva? But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: In the case of a <i>sukka</i> that <b>one roofed in accordance with its <i>halakha</i>, and decorated it with embroidered</b> clothes <b>and with patterned sheets, and hung on it nuts, almonds, peaches, pomegranates, and vines [<i>parkilei</i>], of grapes</b> and glass containers filled with <b>wine, oil, and flour, and wreaths of ears of corn</b> for decoration, <b>it is prohibited to derive benefit</b> from any of these <b>until the conclusion of the last Festival day. But if one stipulated</b> a condition <b>with regard to them</b> whereby he allows himself to use them, it is <b>all according to his condition.</b> This shows that conditions are effective even with regard to a <i>sukka</i> of mitzva.
The Gemara answers based on the opinion of <b>Abaye and Rava, who both say</b> that this is referring to a case <b>where one says: I am not removing</b> myself <b>from them throughout twilight.</b> In other words, he announces from the outset that he will not set them aside as <i>sukka</i> decorations, but rather he will use them for other purposes as well. In that case, <b>no sanctity devolves upon them</b> at all, and he may therefore use them throughout the Festival. <b>However,</b> as for the actual <b>wood of a <i>sukka</i>, sanctity devolves upon it</b> through the very construction of the <i>sukka</i>, and <b>it</b> has therefore been <b>set aside</b> from use <b>for</b> the entire <b>seven</b> days.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way is it <b>different from that which was stated</b> with regard to a different <i>halakha</i>: In the case of one who <b>separated seven <i>etrogim</i> for</b> each of <b>the seven</b> Festival <b>days,</b> one for each day, <b>Rav said: He fulfills</b> his obligation <b>through each and every one</b> of them when he recites the blessing over the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>, <b>and</b> if he so desires <b>he may eat it immediately</b> after the blessing. <b>And Rav Asi said: He fulfills</b> his obligation <b>through each one, and he may eat it the following day,</b> as it retains its sanctity for the duration of that entire day. In any case, all agree that the sanctity of each <i>etrog</i> does not extend to the following day. If so, why does the sanctity of the <i>sukka</i> extend through all seven days?
The Gemara answers: There is a difference between an <i>etrog</i> and a <i>sukka</i>. <b>There,</b> with regard to an <i>etrog</i>, the <b>nights are divided from the days,</b> as the mitzva of <i>etrog</i> applies only during the day and not at night. This means that <b>each and every day is its own mitzva,</b> and therefore an item that is sanctified for one day is not necessarily sanctified for the following day. However, <b>here,</b> with regard to a <i>sukka</i>, <b>where</b> the <b>nights are not divided from the days,</b> as the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> applies at night as well, <b>all</b> seven <b>days are considered as one long day.</b> Throughout the Festival, there is no moment during which the sanctity of <i>sukka</i> leaves the wood; it leaves only at the conclusion of the Festival.

Daf 31a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may bring wood</b> chopped from a tree the previous day <b>from</b> an unfenced <b>field,</b> but only <b>from that which has been gathered</b> into a pile before the Festival for the purpose of using it for kindling. However, scattered wood is <i>muktze</i> and may not be handled. <b>And</b> if one brings wood <b>from a <i>karpef</i></b> used for storage, he may bring <b>even from the scattered</b> wood, as it is considered a guarded courtyard rather than a field, and one does not remove even scattered items from his mind if they are stored inside such an enclosure. The mishna explains: <b>What is a <i>karpef</i>?</b> It is <b>any</b> enclosure <b>that is near a city,</b> but if it is far from a city, it is considered a field; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: Any</b> fenced place <b>into which one</b> can <b>enter</b> only <b>with a key</b> is a <i>karpef</i>, <b>even</b> if it is located at a distance from a city, provided that it is <b>within the Shabbat limit.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One may not bring wood except from</b> the wood that was <b>gathered in a <i>karpef</i>.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: And <b>from a <i>karpef</i>, even from scattered</b> wood? The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna</b> follows <b>an individual</b> opinion.
One may not rely on it, as is clear from a different source that the majority view is otherwise, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to</b> wood <b>scattered in fields that one may not bring</b> it on a Festival to one’s house for kindling, <b>nor with regard to</b> wood <b>gathered in a <i>karpef</i> that one may bring</b> it. <b>With regard to what did they disagree?</b> It is <b>with regard to scattered</b> wood <b>in a <i>karpef</i> and gathered</b> wood <b>in fields, as Beit Shammai say: He may not bring</b> it, <b>and Beit Hillel say: He may bring</b> it. Although the lenient opinion with regard to gathered wood in a field is attributed to Beit Hillel, this is only according to the minority view of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. However, most Sages disagree and say that one may not bring wood from a field at all, even according to Beit Hillel.
<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>reed leaves and vine leaves, although they are gathered</b> together <b>and placed</b> in the same spot, <b>since if a wind comes it will scatter them,</b> they <b>are</b> already <b>considered scattered and are</b> therefore <b>prohibited.</b> Given that they are likely to be scattered in the wind, one does not intend to use them. However, <b>if one placed a vessel on them the day before</b> to prevent their being scattered in the wind, <b>it seems well</b> and is permitted.
The mishna discussed the question: <b>What is a <i>karpef</i>?</b> Rabbi Yehuda states that it is any enclosure that is near a city, while in Rabbi Yosei’s opinion it is any fenced place into which one can enter only with a key, provided that it is within the Shabbat limit of a city. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is</b> the mishna <b>speaking?</b> Does Rabbi Yehuda mean to say that a <i>karpef</i> is <b>any</b> place <b>that is near a city, provided that it has a key,</b> otherwise it is not a <i>karpef</i> at all; <b>and Rabbi Yosei comes to say: Since it has a key, even</b> if it is not near a city, as long as it is <b>within the Shabbat limit</b> it is <b>also</b> considered a <i>karpef</i>? According to this understanding, Rabbi Yosei’s view is more lenient than that of Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>Or perhaps this is what</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>is saying: Any</b> enclosure <b>that is near a city</b> is a <i>karpef</i>, <b>whether it has a key or does not have a key, and Rabbi Yosei comes to say:</b> With regard to the distance, it is a <i>karpef</i> <b>even</b> if it is not near a city, provided that it is <b>within the Shabbat limit, but specifically if it has a key. However, if it does not have a key, even</b> if it is <b>near a city</b> it is <b>also not</b> considered a <i>karpef</i>. According to this understanding, the opinion of Rabbi Yosei is not necessarily the more lenient one; rather, for him the defining issue is whether or not there is a key, regardless of distance.
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear from</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Any</b> place <b>into which one enters with a key, even within the Shabbat limit,</b> and he does not say: If one enters, but rather: Any place into which one enters, it shows that the key is not the determining factor. One may <b>learn from this</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei stated two</b> conditions <b>as leniencies.</b> In other words, he is not more stringent than Rabbi Yehuda in any situation; he is lenient in all cases. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case. <b>Rav Salla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei as a leniency;</b> Rabbi Yosei should be understood in this manner, and one should rule accordingly.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not chop wood</b> on a Festival <b>neither from beams</b> intended for construction <b>nor from a beam that broke on a Festival,</b> although it no longer serves any purpose. <b>And one may not chop</b> wood on a Festival, <b>neither with an ax, nor with a saw, nor with a sickle,</b> as these are clearly craftsman’s tools used on weekdays. <b>Rather, one may</b> chop only <b>with a cleaver.</b> Using this tool differs greatly from the weekday manner in which wood is chopped.

Daf 31b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders at the wording of the mishna: <b>But didn’t you say in the first clause</b> of the mishna that <b>one may not chop</b> beams <b>at all</b> on a Festival, ostensibly due to the extra effort involved? Why, then, does the mishna later define how one may chop, and even permit the use of a cleaver? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: One may not chop</b> wood <b>from the pile of beams</b> intended for construction, <b>nor from a beam that broke on the Festival</b> itself, as it is considered <i>muktze</i>. <b>However, one may chop</b> wood <b>from a beam that broke on the eve of the Festival,</b> since it has presumably been designated as firewood.
Yet even <b>when one chops</b> such a beam, it must not be done in the weekday manner; an adjustment must be made. Therefore, <b>one may not chop</b> it <b>neither with an ax, nor with a saw, nor with a sickle, but with a cleaver.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> opinion, which is in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not chop wood, neither from the pile of beams nor from the beam that broke on the Festival</b> itself, <b>as it is not considered prepared.</b>
It is taught in the mishna that even when it is permitted to chop wood on a Festival, one may <b>not</b> do so <b>with an ax. Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelemya said in the name of Rav: They taught</b> this prohibition <b>only</b> with regard to a case where one chops <b>with its female</b> side, i.e., the broad side of the ax, as was normally done. <b>But</b> if one chops <b>with its male</b> side, i.e., the narrow side, this <b>is permitted</b> because it is an unusual manner of chopping.
The Gemara challenges: <b>It</b> is <b>obvious</b> that one may do so in this unusual fashion, as <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that it is permitted to chop <b>with a cleaver,</b> and chopping with the narrow side of an ax is similar to chopping with a cleaver. The Gemara explains: It was necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>lest you say: This applies only</b> to <b>a cleaver,</b> as it is narrow on both sides, <b>but</b> with regard to a tool that is <b>an ax</b> on one side <b>and</b> like <b>a cleaver</b> on the other, one might <b>say: Since this side,</b> that which is like an ax, <b>is prohibited, the other, side,</b> which is like a cleaver, should <b>also</b> be <b>prohibited.</b> Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the cleaver side is in fact permitted.
<b>And some teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> in relation <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rather, with a cleaver. Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelemya said in the name of Rav: They taught</b> that it is permitted to chop wood on a Festival from a beam that was broken the day before, as stated previously, when one does so <b>only with its male</b> side; <b>but</b> if he chops <b>with its female</b> side, <b>it is prohibited.</b> The Gemara challenges: This is <b>obvious.</b> Didn’t <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that one may <b>not</b> use <b>an ax?</b> The Gemara answers: It was necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>lest you say: This</b> prohibition <b>applies</b> only to <b>an ax, but</b> with regard to a utensil that is both <b>an ax and a cleaver,</b> i.e., that is broad on one side and narrow on the other, one might <b>say: Since this side,</b> the narrower one, <b>is permitted, the other,</b> broader <b>side</b> should <b>also</b> be <b>permitted.</b> Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they did not permit one side due to the other.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If there is <b>a house that is filled with produce</b> and locked on all sides, <b>and a hole formed</b> in one of its walls or its roof, <b>one may remove</b> produce <b>through the place of the hole.</b> The produce is not considered <i>muktze</i>, even though one cannot reach it without the existence of the hole. <b>Rabbi Meir says: One may even make a hole <i>ab initio</i> and take</b> produce through that opening.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders at Rabbi Meir’s statement: <b>Why</b> does he permit one to make a hole in order to remove the produce <i>ab initio</i>? <b>Isn’t</b> one who does so <b>dismantling a tent,</b> thereby performing a biblically prohibited labor? <b>Rav Naḥumi bar Adda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Here, it is referring <b>to bricks</b> placed <b>one on top of the other [<i>aveira delivni</i>]</b> but not cemented together. This is not considered a building at all. The Gemara challenges: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Naḥman say:</b> With regard to <b>these bricks remaining from a building, it is permitted to handle them on Shabbat, since they are fit to sit on;</b> however, if <b>one arranged them</b> in rows, one on top of the other, <b>he has certainly set them aside</b> from his intentions? This indicates that even bricks placed on top of one another without being cemented together are nonetheless considered <i>muktze</i>.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Rabbi Meir was referring to a Festival. <b>On a Festival they said</b> that one may do so, <b>but</b> they did <b>not</b> allow it <b>on Shabbat</b> even in such a manner, and Rav Naḥman was speaking of Shabbat. <b>This</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> explicitly in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says: One may even make a hole</b> on a Festival <b><i>ab initio</i> and remove</b> the produce from inside; <b>they said</b> this with regard to <b>a Festival, but not</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat.</b>
<b>Shmuel said:</b> In the case of <b>fastenings</b> made of knotted ropes <b>that</b> are attached <b>to the ground</b> and that serve as closures for doors of cellars and caves, <b>one may untie</b> the knot, <b>but one may not unravel</b> the rope itself into its constituent fibers <b>nor cut</b> the rope. This constitutes the prohibited labor of dismantling the cellar or cave on Shabbat. With regard to fastenings <b>that are on</b> the doors of <b>vessels,</b> e.g., cupboards, it is permitted to <b>untie, or unravel, or cut</b> them if necessary, <b>both</b> on <b>Shabbat and</b> on <b>a Festival,</b> as the prohibition against dismantling does not apply to vessels.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this from the following <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>fastenings that</b> are attached <b>to the ground,</b> which are on doors, <b>on Shabbat one may untie</b> the rope <b>but not unravel or cut</b> it. Although it is permitted to do so by Torah law, the Sages prohibited it. However, <b>on a Festival, one may untie or unravel or cut</b> it, as this is not prohibited even by rabbinic law. This appears to contradict the opinion of Shmuel, who does not differentiate between Shabbat and Festivals.
Shmuel could respond: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: One may even make a hole and remove</b> produce <b><i>ab initio</i>, whereas the Rabbis disagree with him</b> and prohibit it, <b>and I spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And do the Rabbis disagree with him with regard to</b> doors <b>sealed to the ground? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir with regard to</b> doors <b>sealed to the ground that one may untie</b> them <b>on Shabbat but not unravel or cut</b> them, <b>while on a Festival one may untie or unravel or cut</b> them?

Daf 32a

The Gemara responds: It was <b>he,</b> Shmuel, <b>who spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>fastenings that are to the ground,</b> e.g., those on doors, <b>one may untie</b> them <b>but not unravel or cut</b> them, <b>both</b> on <b>Shabbat and</b> on <b>a Festival. And</b> with regard to <b>those</b> fastenings <b>of a vessel, on Shabbat one may untie</b> them, <b>but one may not unravel or cut</b> them; <b>on a Festival one may untie, or unravel, or cut</b> them.
The Gemara challenges further: <b>You have</b> thereby <b>answered the first clause</b> of Shmuel’s statement, with regard to fastenings attached to the ground, e.g., those on doors, by finding a <i>tanna</i> who permits untying them, as does Shmuel. <b>However, the latter clause</b> is <b>difficult</b> because the <i>baraita</i> states that one may not unravel even ropes of vessels on Shabbat, whereas Shmuel permits unraveling in all cases.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> whose opinion is a minority view, <b>as he said: All vessels may be handled only in the manner of their</b> designated <b>use.</b> Therefore, the rope may not be cut, not because it is prohibited to unravel it but because one may not handle a knife for this purpose, as the designated use of the knife is cutting food rather than rope.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, why</b> discuss <b>particularly Shabbat?</b> The same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>even on a Festival,</b> as there is no distinction between Shabbat and Festivals with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of handling items. <b>And if you say</b> that there is <b>a distinction</b> according <b>to Rabbi Neḥemya between a rabbinic decree of Shabbat,</b> when a vessel may be moved only for its designated purpose, <b>and a rabbinic decree of a Festival,</b> when it may not be moved for any purpose, there is a problem. <b>Does he differentiate</b> between them in this manner?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: On a Festival <b>one may kindle</b> fire <b>with vessels, but one may not kindle</b> fire <b>with shards of vessels,</b> as they are <i>muktze</i>? <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may kindle</b> fire <b>both with vessels and with shards of vessels. And it is taught</b> in yet <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may kindle</b> fire <b>neither with vessels nor with shards of vessels.</b>
<b>And</b> this contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i> <b>is resolved</b> in the following manner: It is <b>not difficult; this</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who accepts the law of <i>muktze</i>. One may therefore kindle fire with vessels, as they are not <i>muktze</i>, but not with shards of vessels, as they are <i>muktze</i> and may not be handled. <b>This</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who does not accept the law of <i>muktze</i>. According to him, one may use shards of vessels as well. <b>This</b> one that prohibits using even vessels that are intact is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who allows vessels to be used only for their designated purpose. This indicates that Rabbi Neḥemya prohibits handling even whole vessels on Festivals as well.
The Gemara replies: These are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> who both hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya.</b> Two later <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed with each other in reporting the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya. Both agree that one may use vessels only for their designated purpose, but they disagree with regard to whether this <i>halakha</i> applies only on Shabbat or on Festivals as well.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On a Festival, <b>one may not hollow out</b> a piece of clay to form <b>a lamp</b> into which he will place oil and a wick <b>because he</b> thereby <b>creates a vessel. And</b> similarly, <b>one may not produce charcoal</b> at all <b>on a Festival</b> because this is not labor for sustenance. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may not cut the wick,</b> as this is considered mending a vessel. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one requires a wick of a particular length, <b>he may cut it</b> by burning it <b>in a fire</b> but not by cutting it with a knife.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>hollowing out a lamp is</b> considered creating <b>a vessel,</b> even if it is not fired in a furnace? <b>Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity: <b>From when is an earthenware vessel susceptible to ritual impurity?</b> It is <b>from when its work is completed,</b> i.e., when the clay has been made into the form of a vessel; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is <b>from when</b> the vessel <b>is fired in the furnace.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: From where</b> do you conclude that this is the same opinion? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Meir stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to vessels, <b>since they are fit to contain something.</b> Although they cannot hold liquids before being fired in a furnace, they can contain other items. <b>But here, for what</b> use <b>is</b> this lamp <b>fit?</b> The Gemara responds: It can be used <b>to contain</b> small <b>coins.</b>
<b>Some say</b> the following version of the discussion: <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, as we learned: <i>Ḥaraniyyot</i> pots [<i>ilpasin</i>]</b> are unfinished earthenware pots made together with their covers. The covers are removed after they are fired in a furnace. They are <b>pure</b> with regard to contracting the impurity <b>of a tent over a corpse,</b> as they do not have a receptacle. Earthenware vessels can contract impurity imparted by a corpse only if they have a hollow space that can contain something. But <i>ḥaraniyyot</i> pots are rendered <b>impure by the carrying of a <i>zav</i>,</b> even if the <i>zav</i> moved them without actually touching them, as this impurity applies to any earthenware vessels that serve some purpose.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> These vessels are <b>even pure</b> with regard to the impurity imparted by the <b>carrying of a <i>zav</i> because their labor is not completed;</b> therefore, they are not fully formed. This implies that when the pots are completed, they are considered full-fledged vessels, even before they have been fired in a furnace.
<b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps</b> it is not so, as it is possible to say that <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> in the case of <i>ḥaraniyyot</i> pots, <b>since they are fit to contain something. But here,</b> in the case of a lamp, <b>for what is</b> it <b>fit?</b> The Gemara replies: It is fit <b>to contain</b> small <b>coins.</b>
<b>The Sages taught: One may not hollow out a lamp, and one may not create <i>ḥaraniyyot</i> pots on a Festival. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel permits</b> creating <b><i>ḥaraniyyot</i> pots.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>ḥaraniyyot</i>? Rav Yehuda said:</b> They are pots <b>of a city [<i>iraniyyot</i>].</b> The Gemara again inquires: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>iraniyyot</i>? Abaye said:</b> It means <b>villagers’ bowls</b> who will use even clay vessels that have not been fully formed or fired, as they are not particular with regard to half-finished utensils.
It is taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not produce charcoal</b> on a Festival. The Gemara challenges: It is <b>obvious</b> that one may perform only labor for sustenance. <b>For what is</b> charcoal <b>fit;</b> what purpose does it have for the sake of sustenance? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: It is necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in the case of <b>handing</b> the charcoal <b>over to bathhouse attendants [<i>olyarin</i>]</b> who heat up the bathhouse <b>for that day.</b> One might have thought that since charcoal is used for the sake of washing on a Festival, producing it should be permitted.
The Gemara questions this: <b>And on that day is it permitted</b> to heat up water for washing? The Sages decreed that one may not wash in a bathhouse on a Festival, even if the water was heated up the day before, and certainly it is prohibited if the water was heated on the Festival itself. The Gemara replies: <b>As Rava said</b> with regard to a different issue, this decree does not refer to actual washing but to entering a bathhouse merely in order <b>to sweat, and</b> it was stated <b>before</b> the enactment of the <b>decree</b> against sweating in a bathhouse. <b>Here, too,</b> one can explain that the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya is referring to a case where one entered <b>to sweat, and</b> he entered at a time <b>before</b> the <b>decree</b> was enacted.
It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not cut a wick into two,</b> but Rabbi Yehuda permits cutting it by means of fire. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about cutting a wick with fire as opposed to with a knife, <b>that one may not</b> cut a wick <b>with a knife?</b>

Daf 32b

Is it because <b>he</b> thereby <b>mends a vessel?</b> If so, when one cuts it <b>in the fire, he is also preparing a vessel</b> for use. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in explanation: <b>He cuts it by fire in the mouth of two candles.</b> In other words, he does not simply cut a wick, but rather inserts a long wick into two lamps, which he subsequently lights in the middle. This indeed leads to the formation of two separate wicks, but only as a result of kindling two lamps. <b>Rav Natan bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: One may <i>moḥet</i> a wick on a Festival.</b> The term <i>moḥet</i> was unknown, and the Gemara therefore asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b><i>moḥet</i>? Rav Ḥanina bar Shelemya said in the name of Rav: To remove the dark;</b> in other words, it is permitted to remove the burnt, charcoaled section to make the lamp shine more brightly.
<b>Bar Kappara taught: Six matters were stated with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a wick</b> on a Festival, <b>three</b> of which <b>are to be stringent and three</b> of which <b>are to be lenient.</b> The three <i>halakhot</i> <b>to be stringent</b> are: <b>One may not spin</b> or twist <b>it <i>ab initio</i> on a Festival, and one may not singe it in fire</b> before lighting it so that it will burn well, <b>and one may not cut it into two.</b> The three <i>halakhot</i> <b>to be lenient</b> are: <b>One may crush it by hand,</b> as although it is prohibited to twist it into a wick, one may adjust its shape in an unusual manner; <b>and one may soak it in oil</b> so that it will later burn well; <b>and one may cut it by fire in the mouth of two candles.</b>
§ After citing one teaching in the name of Rav Natan bar Abba, the Gemara quotes a few more statements attributed to the same scholar. Since he is not mentioned often, Rav Natan’s teachings are arranged together, so that they can be remembered more easily. <b>Rav Natan bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: The wealthy</b> Jews <b>of Babylonia will descend to Gehenna</b> because they do not have compassion on others. This is illustrated by incidents <b>such as this: Shabbetai bar Marinus happened to come to Babylonia. He requested</b> their participation in <b>a business venture,</b> to lend him money and receive half the profits in return, <b>and they did not give</b> it to <b>him.</b> Furthermore, when he asked them <b>to sustain him with food, they likewise refused to sustain him.</b>
<b>He said: These</b> wealthy people are not descendants of our forefathers, <b>but they came from the mixed multitude, as it is written: “And show you compassion, and have compassion upon you,</b> and multiply you, as He has sworn to your fathers” (Deuteronomy 13:18), from which it is derived: <b>Anyone who has compassion</b> for God’s <b>creatures, it is known that he is of the descendants of Abraham, our father, and anyone who does not have compassion</b> for God’s <b>creatures, it is known that he is not of the descendants of Abraham, our father.</b> Since these wealthy Babylonians do not have compassion on people, clearly they are not descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
This is another teaching that <b>Rav Natan bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: Whoever looks to the table of others</b> for his sustenance, <b>the world is dark for him.</b> Everything looks bleak and hopeless to him, <b>for it is stated: “He wanders abroad for bread: Where is it? He knows the day of darkness is ready at his hand”</b> (Job 15:23). <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Even his life is no life,</b> as he receives no satisfaction from it.
In support of this last claim, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught:</b> There are <b>three</b> whose <b>lives are not lives, and they are as follows: One who looks to the table of others</b> for his sustenance; <b>and one whose wife rules</b> over <b>him; and one whose body is ruled by suffering. And some say: Even one who has only one robe.</b> Since he cannot wash it properly, he suffers from lice and dirt. The Gemara comments: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who did not include such a person, maintains: <b>It is possible</b> for him <b>to examine his clothes</b> and remove the lice, which would alleviate his suffering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not break earthenware</b> on a Festival. <b>And one may not cut paper in order to roast salted</b> fish <b>on it.</b> Earthenware shards or pieces of paper that have been soaked in water were placed on the metal surface or in the oven in which the fish was roasted, so that it would not be burned by the heat.
<b>And one may not sweep out</b> anything that has fallen into <b>an oven or stove</b> that interferes with the baking, such as plaster. <b>But one may press down</b> and flatten any accumulated dust and ashes at the bottom of the oven, which might prevent it from lighting properly.
<b>And one may not draw two barrels together</b> in order <b>to place a pot on them,</b> so that its contents will be cooked by a fire lit between the barrels. <b>And one may not prop a pot</b> that does not stand straight <b>with a piece of wood,</b> in order to prevent it from falling. <b>And similarly, with a door. And one may not lead an animal with a stick</b> in the public domain <b>on a Festival; and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, permits</b> it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the issue of breaking earthenware and cutting paper, the Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this prohibition? <b>Because one</b> is thereby <b>preparing a vessel</b> for use.
It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not sweep out an oven or stove. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef taught before Rav Naḥman: And if it is not possible to bake unless one sweeps it out, it is permitted.</b> The Gemara relates an incident with regard <b>to the wife of Rabbi Ḥiyya: A part of a brick fell into</b> her <b>oven on a Festival,</b> preventing her from baking. <b>Rav Ḥiyya said to her: See,</b> you should know that <b>I want good-quality bread.</b> He thereby stated that it would be impossible unless she removed the brick, making it permissible for her to do so. Similarly, <b>Rava said to his attendant: Roast for me a duck</b> in an oven, <b>and be careful not to singe</b> it. He thereby implied that the attendant may remove all impediments from the oven in order to fulfill this requirement because otherwise it would not be possible to cook without singeing.
In a related case, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Rav Aḥa from Hutzal said to us that the master,</b> Rav Ashi, allows his attendants <b>to plaster</b> the mouth of <b>the oven for him on a Festival.</b> This was done in order to ensure that the roasted or cooked dish would be fully prepared. Why does this not constitute the prohibited labor of kneading on a Festival? <b>He said to him: We rely on the bank of the Euphrates</b> River. We avoid the labor of kneading by taking sufficiently kneaded mud from the riverbank. The Gemara comments: <b>And this applies only when one wrapped</b> or made some mark on the mud <b>the day before,</b> so that it not be <i>muktze</i>. <b>Ravina said: And</b> as for kneading with <b>ashes</b> for this purpose, it is <b>permitted,</b> since the labor of kneading does not apply to ashes.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>One may not draw two barrels together</b> in order to place a pot on them. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> With regard to large <b>stones of a lavatory,</b> upon which one sits to attend to his needs, <b>it is permitted to put them together</b> in the proper manner, so that they may be used <b>on a Festival. Rabba raised an objection to Rav Naḥman:</b> Wasn’t it taught that <b>one may not draw two barrels together</b> in order <b>to place a pot on them?</b> This seems to indicate that any arrangement resembling building is prohibited. <b>He said to him: There,</b> with regard to barrels, <b>it is different, because one makes a tent.</b> It is not the drawing of the barrels close together that is prohibited. Rather, the placement of the pot over them forms a kind of covering, which is similar to building a tent.
<b>Rabba the Younger,</b> so called to distinguish him from the more famous <i>amora</i> known as Rabba, <b>said to Rav Ashi: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> then if, <b>on a Festival, one built</b> a solid <b>bench [<i>itztaba</i>],</b> without a gap below the seat, a situation in which <b>one does not make a tent, so too,</b> will you say <b>that it is permitted? He said to him:</b> The two cases are not comparable: <b>There,</b> with regard to a proper construction, such as a bench, <b>the Torah prohibited</b> erecting <b>a permanent construction,</b> but <b>the Torah did not prohibit</b> erecting <b>a temporary construction. The Sages,</b> however, <b>decreed against</b> creating <b>a temporary construction</b> on a Festival <b>due to a permanent construction.</b> However, <b>here,</b> with regard to a lavatory, <b>due to the dignity</b> of the user, <b>the Sages did not decree with regard to it.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> With regard to <b>this bonfire,</b> in which the wood is arranged in the form of a house, if one arranges it <b>from above to below it is permitted,</b> as this is not the regular manner of building. However, if one prepares it in the usual fashion, <b>from below to above, it is prohibited,</b> for this is considered building.

Daf 33a

<b>And similarly,</b> if one wishes to place <b>eggs</b> on the mouth of a hollow vessel or on a grill sitting above coals, he must first hold the vessel in his hands and put the eggs on it, and only afterward position them both on the coals. <b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>a pot</b> placed on barrels, one must hold the pot above the barrels before placing them underneath it. <b>And similarly,</b> in the case of a collapsible <b>bed,</b> whose legs and cover are separate pieces, one must first stretch the upper part, then add the legs. <b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>barrels</b> positioned one on top of the other, the upper one must be held in place first and then the others added below.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not prop a pot with a piece of wood, and similarly a door.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to a door,</b> can this <b>enter your mind?</b> Is it possible to prop a pot by means of a door? <b>Rather, say</b> and correct the wording as follows: <b>And similarly,</b> one may not prop <b>a door</b> with a piece of wood. <b>The Sages taught: One may not prop a pot with a piece of wood, and similarly a door, as wood is</b> to be used <b>only for kindling.</b> With regard to any use other than kindling, wood is considered <i>muktze</i>. <b>And Rabbi Shimon,</b> who does not accept the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>, <b>permits</b> it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And one may not lead an animal with a stick on a Festival, but Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, permits</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>who is not</b> of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>,</b> and he therefore permits one to take any stick and lead an animal with it? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> there is no issue of <i>muktze</i> here at all, for in <b>this</b> case <b>even Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> to the first <i>tanna</i> that this activity is prohibited, not due to <i>muktze</i> but <b>because</b> one who does so <b>looks like one who is going to the market [<i>ḥinga</i>]</b> in the manner of a weekday. On a Festival, one must therefore lead the animal in an unusual fashion.
§ In a case where one takes <b>a bamboo</b> branch to use as a skewer, <b>Rav Naḥman prohibits it</b> because it is <i>muktze</i>, since it was not made into a vessel the day before, <b>and Rav Sheshet permits it.</b> The Gemara elaborates: In the case <b>of a wet</b> branch, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>prohibited;</b> it is unfit for kindling and is therefore <i>muktze</i>. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is in the case <b>of a dry</b> branch. <b>The one</b> who <b>prohibits</b> handling it, Rav Naḥman, could have <b>said to you: Wood is only for kindling,</b> but it is considered <i>muktze</i> with regard to any other use. <b>And the one</b> who <b>permits</b> handling it, Rav Sheshet, could have <b>said to you:</b> Since all wood is to be used for roasting, <b>what is it to me to roast with it</b> when it is inserted into meat? <b>What is it to me to roast with its coals?</b> Just as it is permitted to burn the bamboo as coal, so it is permitted to use it as a skewer for cooking.
<b>Some say</b> a different version of the explanation of this dispute: <b>In the case of a dry</b> branch, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>permitted; when they disagree,</b> it is <b>in the case of a wet</b> one. <b>The one</b> who <b>prohibits</b> handling it does so because <b>it is not fit for kindling. And the one</b> who <b>permits</b> it could have <b>said to you: Isn’t it</b> at least <b>fit for a large fire,</b> which will dry out the branch and enable it to burn as well? The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a dry</b> one <b>is permitted</b> and <b>a wet</b> one <b>is prohibited.</b>
<b>Rava taught: A woman may not enter a storehouse of wood</b> in order <b>to take from them a firebrand,</b> a partly burnt piece of wood used for turning over the wood of the bonfire, because this piece of wood was not made into a vessel the day before and it is therefore <i>muktze</i>. <b>And a firebrand that broke may not be kindled on a Festival, for one may kindle</b> fire <b>with vessels but one may not kindle</b> fire <b>with shards of vessels,</b> and this firebrand was considered a vessel before it broke.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> in this case <b>Rava holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who is</b> of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>? But didn’t Rava say to his attendant: Roast a duck for me, and throw its innards</b> to the cat? According to Rabbi Yehuda, it is prohibited to give the innards to animals, as they were not prepared for this purpose the day before. The Gemara answers: <b>There, since</b> the innards <b>become rancid</b> when they were left, <b>from yesterday,</b> the Festival eve, <b>his mind was on them.</b> At that point in time, he already intended to give them to the cats in his house.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> On a Festival, <b>a person may remove a sliver</b> from a pile of straw or from similar material <b>that is before him, in order to clean with it</b> between <b>his teeth. And he may collect</b> straw <b>from a courtyard and kindle</b> it, <b>for anything in a courtyard is</b> considered <b>prepared</b> for all purposes. <b>The Rabbis say: He may collect</b> these materials only <b>from</b> things placed <b>before him</b> in his house, as they are certainly prepared for all uses, <b>and kindle</b> them. With regard to objects lying in his courtyard, however, as their collection takes great effort, he certainly did not have them in mind the day before, and they are therefore <i>muktze</i>.
The mishna states a different <i>halakha</i>: <b>One may not produce fire, neither from wood,</b> by rubbing one piece against another; <b>nor from stones</b> knocked against each other; <b>nor from</b> hot <b>dirt; nor from tiles</b> struck against each other; <b>nor from water</b> placed in round, glass vessels, which produces fire by focusing the rays of the sun. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may not whiten tiles</b> with a burning-hot heat in order <b>to roast upon them</b> afterward.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b>

Daf 33b

<b>Animal fodder,</b> such as straw and reed branches, <b>does not have</b> any associated prohibition <b>due to the preparing of a vessel.</b> One may therefore trim it on Shabbat and use it as one wishes.
<b>Rav Kahana raised an objection to Rav Yehuda</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may handle</b> wood of <b>a spice tree</b> on Shabbat in order <b>to smell them and to wave them before a sick person</b> to fan him. <b>And he may crush it</b> between his fingers to release its fragrance, <b>and he may smell it.</b> However, <b>he may not cut it</b> from the branch in order to produce a moist spot on the branch that will emit a strong fragrance, so as <b>to smell it; and if he did cut it, he is exempt</b> from punishment according to Torah law, <b>but it is prohibited</b> to do so. If he intends <b>to clean his teeth with it, he may not cut it, and if he did cut it, he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering</b> for transgressing a prohibited labor on Shabbat. This indicates that although some wood of a spice tree was used as animal fodder, it is nevertheless prohibited to cut it. This appears to contradict Rav Yehuda.
Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>Now,</b> even the statement <b>exempt but prohibited</b> poses <b>a difficulty to my</b> opinion, and it is not reasonable. <b>Is it required</b> to say the opposite, i.e., <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering?</b> This teaching cannot be understood at face value; <b>rather,</b> it must be understood as follows: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught,</b> it was referring to <b>hard</b> pieces of wood such as beams, with regard to which there is a concern that one might perform a prohibited labor. The Gemara questions this: And can <b>hard</b> branches <b>be crushed</b> by hand?
The Gemara replies: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following:</b> With regard to wood of a spice tree, <b>one may crush it and smell it</b> and <b>cut it and smell it. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? With regard to soft</b> pieces of wood, <b>but with regard to hard ones, one may not cut them. And if he did cut it he is exempt, but it is prohibited</b> to do so. If he intended <b>to clean his teeth with it, he may not cut it, and if he did cut it, he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>
Similarly, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may cut it and smell it, and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not cut it to smell it. Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This <b>is not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> case, when it is permitted, it is referring <b>to soft</b> wood. In <b>that</b> case, where the <i>baraita</i> prohibits it, it is referring <b>to hard</b> pieces of wood.
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects to this: With hard ones, why not?</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A person may break a barrel</b> in order <b>to eat dried figs from it, provided that he does not</b> thereby <b>intend to make a vessel,</b> and he may use the barrel afterward. Breaking off wood in order to smell it is certainly not more of a prohibited labor than breaking a barrel. <b>And furthermore,</b> it is <b>Rava bar Rav Adda and Ravin bar Rav Adda, who both say: When we were at the house of Rav Yehuda, he would break and give us many sticks</b> of wood of a spice tree, although <b>they were</b> hard enough to be <b>fit for handles of axes and hatchets.</b>
The Gemara answers: This <b>is not difficult; this</b> case is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>that</b> case follows <b>the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> On Shabbat or a Festival, <b>a person may take a sliver</b> of wood <b>from before him to clean his teeth with it, and the Rabbis say: One may take</b> a toothpick <b>only from an animal’s trough;</b> since it is fit for animal fodder, it is considered prepared for all purposes. <b>And they agree that he may not pluck it. And if he did pluck it to clean his teeth with it</b> or <b>to</b> use it as a key and <b>open a door with it,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly on Shabbat, he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> If he did so <b>intentionally on a Festival, he receives the forty</b> lashes administered to one who desecrates the Festival by performing labor. These are <b>the words of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: Both this and this,</b> whether one did so on Shabbat or a Festival, even if he plucked it by hand to use it as a key, <b>it is</b> prohibited <b>only due to a rabbinic decree.</b> Therefore, <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who states there</b> that one who plucks a toothpick on Shabbat unwittingly in order to make a vessel such as a key is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> then <b>here,</b> in the case of one who cuts a sliver of wood in order to smell it, he is <b>exempt, but it is prohibited.</b> However, <b>the Rabbis who state there,</b> in the case of plucking a toothpick, that he is <b>exempt but it is prohibited,</b> then <b>here,</b> when one cuts a sliver of wood for purposes of smelling, it is <b>permitted <i>ab initio</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Eliezer not accept this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A person may break a barrel</b> in order <b>to eat dried figs from it, provided that he does not</b> thereby <b>intend to make a vessel?</b> This shows that if one does not intend to make a vessel, it is permitted <i>ab initio</i>; whereas Rabbi Eliezer maintains that he is exempt, but it is prohibited. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ashi said: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught,</b> its lenient ruling was <b>with regard to a vessel patched with pitch [<i>mustaki</i>],</b> meaning a vessel that had previously been broken and its pieces glued together with pitch. If one breaks it for his own needs, he does not smash a complete vessel, and he is therefore not considered to have fashioned a vessel.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And one may collect</b> straw <b>from the courtyard</b> on a Festival. <b>The Sages taught: One may collect</b> materials <b>from a courtyard and kindle</b> a fire because <b>everything in a courtyard is</b> considered <b>prepared, provided he does not arrange it in piles, and Rabbi Shimon permits</b> it even in such a manner. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree;</b> what is the basis of their dispute? <b>One Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, who are stringent, <b>holds: It looks as though he is collecting for tomorrow and another day,</b> and it is therefore prohibited, so that one will not be suspected of preparing from a Festival to a weekday. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds: His pot proves his</b> intention. When onlookers see that he is using the straw for cooking, they will not suspect him of preparing for after the Festival.
§ It is taught in the mishna that <b>one may not produce</b> new <b>fire</b> on a Festival in any manner. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains: <b>Because he creates</b> something new <b>on a Festival.</b> This is similar to an act of creation, and it is therefore prohibited.
§ The mishna states that <b>one may not whiten tiles</b> by heating them, in order to roast food on them. The Gemara asks: <b>What does one</b> thereby <b>do;</b> since his intention is to prepare food, how does this differ from any other manner of roasting? <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Here we are dealing with new tiles,</b> and it is prohibited <b>because</b>

Daf 34a

<b>it is necessary to test them</b> to ensure that they do not burst when heated. If they are heated for the first time on a Festival, he will be thereby testing them, which is a prohibited labor. <b>And some say: Because it is necessary to harden them</b> by overheating them the first time to make them fit for use, which is considered preparing a vessel for use and is prohibited on a Festival.
In relation to the above, the Gemara cites the following teaching: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> If one <b>trampled</b> fowl with his foot, <b>or threw it</b> against a <b>wall, or if an animal crushed it,</b> and it is <b>twitching</b> but cannot stand; <b>if</b> the animal <b>waited,</b> i.e., remained alive, <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of the injury <b>until</b> the same <b>time</b> twenty-four hours later, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered it, it is kosher,</b> provided no other defect is found in it that would have caused it to die within twelve months, which would render it a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Antigonus: It requires examination</b> after slaughtering, to make sure it does not have a defect.
In relation to the same issue, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya inquired of Rabbi Zeira: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to slaughtering it on a Festival? Do we assume on a Festival</b> that it has <b>a flaw or not?</b> In other words, may one rely on the assumption that a typical chicken has no defect? Or perhaps, since there is concern with regard to this particular bird and it requires examination, one should refrain from slaughtering it lest it turn out to be a <i>tereifa</i>. If so, he will have performed labor for no purpose.
<b>He said to him</b> in response: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> that <b>one may not whiten tiles</b> in order to <b>roast on them. And we discussed it: What does he</b> thereby <b>do? And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Here we are dealing with new tiles,</b> and the Sages prohibited heating them <b>because</b> one first <b>needs to test them,</b> and they might crack when heated. If they were heated for the first time on a Festival and cracked, it would show that they were unfit for use, in which case heating them would have been an unnecessary labor. This indicates that one may not take a chance on a Festival with regard to something that might be flawed, and therefore a possible <i>tereifa</i> should be similarly prohibited.
<b>He said to him:</b> This is no proof; <b>we learned</b> that the reason for <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>because it is necessary to harden them</b> in order to make them into proper vessels. Therefore, there is no connection between making a vessel and conducting an examination. Consequently, there is no reason to prohibit the slaughter of such a chicken on a Festival.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is possible for several people to perform a single act of cooking on Shabbat, and all will be liable. How so? <b>One brings the fire, and one brings the wood, and one places the pot</b> on the stove, <b>and one brings the water</b> for the pot, <b>and one puts spices into</b> the food, <b>and one stirs</b> the pot; <b>they are all liable</b> for cooking. The Gemara wonders at this: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> that <b>the last one is liable and all</b> the rest <b>are exempt?</b> The Gemara responds: This <b>is not difficult. This</b> case, where all are liable, is referring to a situation <b>in which he brought fire at the outset,</b> and therefore each of them performed part of the act of cooking; <b>that</b> case, where only the last one is liable, is referring to a situation <b>in which he brought fire at the end.</b> In that case, none of the earlier people performed any aspect of cooking at all, as the labor of cooking begins only from when fire is brought.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, all of them performed an action</b> that constitutes a prohibited labor, and they are therefore partners in a prohibited act and the desecration of Shabbat. <b>But</b> the <b>one who places the pot</b> on the stove, <b>what</b> prohibited labor <b>has he performed? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Here we are dealing with a new pot, and due to whitening tiles they applied</b> the same prohibition to <b>it.</b> This means that one is not liable for cooking the food in the pot but for strengthening the pot itself, as is the case with heating tiles.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>New ovens and stoves are similar to all vessels that</b> may be <b>carried in a courtyard</b> on a Festival, as one can place items on them. <b>However, one may not anoint them with oil, nor rub them with a rag, nor cool them with cold</b> liquids to <b>harden them</b>, as all these actions are considered preparing the vessel for use, which may not be done on a Festival. <b>And if</b> one did so <b>in order to bake</b> in the oven on the Festival itself, <b>this is permitted.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: During a Festival <b>one may scald the head and the feet</b> of a slaughtered animal with hot water in order to remove the hairs from them, <b>and one may singe them in fire</b> for this purpose, <b>but one may not smear them with clay, nor earth, nor lime</b> in order to remove the hairs because this involves great effort, and it appears as though he is processing the skin. <b>And one may not shear</b> those hairs <b>with scissors,</b> as it appears as though he is performing the labor of shearing in an effort to obtain the hairs themselves.
Similarly, <b>one may not trim</b> the top of the leaves connected to <b>the vegetable with its</b> special <b>shears, but one may prepare <i>kundas</i> and <i>akaviyot</i>,</b> bitter vegetables that can be eaten only after extensive cooking, although this involves great effort. <b>And one may kindle</b> fire <b>and bake in a large baker’s oven [<i>purnei</i>], and one may heat water in an <i>antikhi</i>,</b> a kind of large urn, <b>but one may not bake in a new baker’s oven lest it break.</b> If the oven cracks when heated because it was not properly made, one will have performed unnecessary work on a Festival.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> similarly in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not blow</b> a fire <b>with bellows,</b> because this is the manner of a weekday activity, <b>but one may blow</b> a fire <b>with a tube,</b> in an unusual manner. <b>And one may not mend a skewer nor sharpen it. The Sages</b> further <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not break a reed</b> in order to make a kind of skewer upon which <b>to roast salted</b> fish, <b>but one may crack a nut</b> covered <b>with a rag, and there is no concern lest it tear,</b> for even if this occurs, no prohibited labor has been performed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And Rabbi Eliezer further stated</b> the following leniency: <b>A person may stand over</b> objects in <b>storage,</b> such as produce that he has for some reason previously set aside from use,

Daf 34b

<b>on Shabbat eve during the Sabbatical Year,</b> during which no tithes are separated, which means one may take fruit on the following day without the need for any corrective measure, <b>and say: From here,</b> from these fruits, <b>I will eat tomorrow. And the Rabbis say:</b> He may not eat <b>unless he marks</b> the pile of fruit the day before <b>and</b> explicitly <b>says: From here to there</b> I will take.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> (Ma'asrot 4:2) <b>Children who hid figs</b> for themselves in a field <b>on Shabbat eve</b> in order to eat them on Shabbat, <b>and they forgot and did not separate tithes,</b> not only are they prohibited from eating them on Shabbat, for eating on Shabbat is always considered a fixed meal that obligates the produce in tithes, but even <b>after the conclusion of Shabbat, they may not eat until they have separated tithes. And we also learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who transfers figs in his courtyard in order to</b> make them into <b>dry</b> figs, <b>his children and the members of his household may</b> in the meantime <b>partake of them</b> in <b>a casual</b> manner, <b>and they are exempt</b> from tithes. The fact that the fruit has reached his courtyard, as opposed to his house, is not enough to cause it to be liable for tithing.
Based on these two sources, <b>Rava inquired of Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>Shabbat, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in terms of <b>whether it establish</b>es an obligation <b>to tithe</b> food that has been <b><i>muktze</i></b> on Shabbat? Specifically, in the case of <b>an item whose labor has not been completed,</b> does the fact that the food is <i>muktze</i> on Shabbat give it the status of completely prepared food, or not? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And call Shabbat a delight”</b> (Isaiah 58:13), this implies that any food one eats on Shabbat is considered a delight and not a casual meal, and therefore Shabbat <b>establishes</b> an obligation to tithe, as if the food were fully completed and fit to be eaten as a fixed meal, <b>even for an item that has not</b> had its <b>labor completed? Or perhaps</b> Shabbat <b>establishes</b> an obligation to tithe <b>an item whose labor is completed,</b> but regarding <b>an item whose labor is not completed it does not establish</b> an obligation to tithe?
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Shabbat establishes</b> the obligation for tithes, <b>both</b> with regard to <b>an item whose work is completed and things whose work is not completed.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman and challenged: <b>But say</b> that the law of <b>Shabbat</b> should be <b>similar</b> to that of <b>a courtyard: Just as a courtyard establishes</b> food placed inside it as a fixed meal with regard to tithes <b>only</b> when <b>the work on an item is completed, so too, Shabbat</b> should <b>establish only an item whose work is completed</b> as liable for tithing. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: I did not say this based on my own logic, which can be countered by logic of your own. Rather, <b>we have it as an ordered teaching that Shabbat establishes both things whose work is completed and things whose work is not completed.</b>
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said: We, too, have learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer further stated</b> that <b>a person may stand over</b> objects in the <b>storage</b> area <b>on Shabbat eve during the Sabbatical Year</b> and say: I will eat from here and here. <b>The reason is that</b> it is fruit of the <b>Sabbatical Year,</b> with regard to <b>which</b> one <b>is not obligated to</b> separate <b>tithes. However, if</b> it occurred <b>in the other years of the Sabbatical</b> cycle, <b>so too,</b> you will say that it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat them without separating tithes. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Is it not because Shabbat establishes</b> them with regard to tithes, and consequently they may not be eaten until tithes have been separated?
The Gemara refutes this: This is no proof, for <b>there it is different: Since he said: From here I will eat tomorrow, he has</b> immediately <b>established for himself</b> a meal <b>with them,</b> by stating his intention to eat the food as it is. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> does the mishna mention <b>particularly Shabbat? Even</b> if one said so <b>on a weekday</b> the same should <b>also</b> apply. Since he has set them aside for his meal, they are considered finished and are liable to tithes. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> comes to <b>teach us</b> the following: One should not conclude <b>that untithed produce</b> is inherently <i>muktze</i> because one may not separate the tithes and eat it; rather, <b>it is</b> considered <b>prepared with regard to Shabbat, in that if one transgressed</b> the words of the Sages <b>and corrected it</b> by separating the tithes, <b>it is</b> considered <b>corrected.</b>

Daf 35a

The Gemara challenges: How can one say that the very decision to partake of the fruit establishes it as fixed with regard to tithes? <b>But isn’t it</b> true that even if one declared his intention to eat it the following day, it can nevertheless be assumed that <b>the remaining</b> fruit <b>is restored</b> to the pile? <b>And we have heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> explicitly <b>said: Anywhere that its leftovers are restored, it is not established</b> with regard to liability for tithes at all.
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Ma’asrot</i>: <b>One who removes olives from a vat [<i>ma’atan</i>]</b> where they are temporarily stored before being pressed <b>may dip</b> them <b>one by one in salt and eat</b> without tithing them first, since he is eating them one at a time. Although he is eating them with salt, it is not considered a fixed meal. <b>And if he dipped and placed</b> several olives <b>before him,</b> such as <b>ten,</b> they are <b>liable</b> in tithes. However, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One who eats <b>from a ritually pure vat is liable</b> to separate tithes; one who eats <b>from a ritually impure vat is exempt because he returns the surplus</b> to the vat.
<b>And we discussed it: What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause;</b> why is the issue of purity relevant to this case? <b>And Rabbi Abbahu said: The first case</b> is referring <b>to a ritually pure vat and a ritually impure person,</b> who transfers his impurity to the olives he touches. <b>He may not return</b> the olives to the vat because he would thereby render all the remaining olives ritually impure. Therefore, from the outset he takes only the amount he wishes to eat. This is enough to consider it a fixed meal, and he must tithe them.
However, <b>the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to a ritually impure vat and a person</b> who is <b>ritually impure, who may return</b> the olives to the vat, as the olives it contains are already ritually impure. He is not particular to take the exact amount he wants to eat, since he knows he may return the remaining olives, and they are therefore not considered fixed for tithes. For the purposes of this discussion, it can be seen from here that Rabbi Eliezer maintains that whenever one may restore the food, it is not considered fixed until its work is complete.
The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna also</b> deals <b>with</b> the case of <b>a ritually pure storage</b> area, containing pure food, <b>and a ritually impure person, who may not return them</b> to the vat. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>But aren’t they already returned?</b> This is not a case where a person takes all the fruit and replaces what remains after his meal; rather, he takes the amount he explicitly designated the day before, while the rest remains in place.
<b>Rather, Rav Shimi bar Ashi said:</b> The previous explanation is to be rejected, and it should be understood as follows: <b>Rabbi Eliezer, you said?</b> There is no difficulty according to his approach. <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that the separation of <b><i>teruma</i></b> itself <b>establishes</b> the work of fruit as completed, so that one may not eat it even in a casual manner without first separating the other tithes. <b>And, all the more so, Shabbat</b> itself establishes food as fixed with regard to tithes, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Fruits from which <i>teruma</i> has been separated before their work was completed, Rabbi Eliezer prohibits eating from them</b> in <b>a casual</b> manner without separating the rest of the tithes, as the <i>teruma</i> establishes the food as fixed; <b>but the Rabbis permit</b> it.
The Gemara suggests a different answer to Rava’s question as to whether Shabbat establishes an obligation to tithe food whose labor is incomplete: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution <b>from the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Even in the Sabbatical Year, when <i>teruma</i> and tithes are not separated from fruit, a declaration from the day before is not enough to render the food prepared for Shabbat, <b>unless one marks</b> the fruit he is preparing <b>and says</b> explicitly: <b>From here to there.</b> The Gemara infers from this: <b>The reason is that the eve of Shabbat</b> during <b>the Sabbatical Year is not fit for tithes; but during</b> the <b>other years of the Sabbatical</b> cycle, which <b>are fit for</b> and obligated in <b>tithes,</b> the fruits <b>are prohibited. What is the reason? Is it not because Shabbat</b> itself <b>establishes</b> them as fixed? If this is the view of the Rabbis, one may not reject it in favor of a minority opinion such as Rabbi Eliezer’s.
The Gemara refutes this: <b>No,</b> this is no proof; <b>there it is different. Since he said: From here to there I will eat tomorrow, he has</b> thereby <b>established</b> his meal, and the reason is not due to Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why discuss</b> particularly <b>Shabbat; even on a weekday as well</b> the same law applies? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> comes to <b>teach us,</b> as stated above, <b>that untithed produce</b> is not fundamentally <i>muktze</i> because it is prohibited to remove the dues and tithes on Shabbat; rather, <b>it is</b> considered <b>prepared with regard to Shabbat, in that if one transgressed</b> the words of the Sages <b>and tithed it, it is tithed.</b>
<b>And we raise a contradiction</b> from a different source, in which it is taught: <b>If one was eating from a cluster</b> of grapes, whose work is not completed, as grapes are designated for juice extraction, <b>and came in from a garden,</b> where one may eat fruit in a casual manner without separating tithes, <b>to a courtyard, Rabbi Eliezer says: He may finish</b> eating the cluster, as the courtyard itself does not establish the fruit with regard to tithes, if their work was not completed beforehand. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: He may not finish.</b> He maintains that a courtyard does establish the fruit as fixed for tithes, even if their work has not been completed.
Similarly, <b>if it grew dark on</b> Friday evening, <b>the night of Shabbat,</b> while one was eating the cluster, and eating on Shabbat is considered a fixed meal, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He may finish,</b> as not even Shabbat establishes fruit as fixed if its work was not completed. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua says: He may not finish.</b> He holds that Shabbat does indeed establish fruit as fixed for tithes even if its work has not been completed. This indicates that Rabbi Eliezer maintains that Shabbat does not establish food with regard to tithes, whereas the mishna here indicates that he agrees that the beginning of Shabbat does establish them as fixed.
The Gemara answers: <b>There, the reason is as he taught</b> explicitly that <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> It is <b>not that when Rabbi Eliezer said: He may finish,</b> he meant that <b>he may finish in the courtyard</b> itself; <b>but rather</b> he meant: <b>He may exit the courtyard and finish. And</b> similarly, it is <b>not that when Rabbi Eliezer said: He may finish,</b> he meant that <b>he may finish on Shabbat</b> itself; <b>but rather,</b> he meant that <b>he may wait until the conclusion of Shabbat and finish.</b> If so, this source does not contradict the mishna here.
With regard to the halakhic ruling in this case, <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whether</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat; or</b> with regard to the separation of <b><i>teruma</i></b> from fruit; <b>or</b> with regard to <b>a courtyard</b> into which the fruit is brought; <b>or</b> with regard to <b>a transaction; all of these</b> cases <b>establish</b> a requirement for tithes <b>only</b> for <b>items whose labor is completed.</b>
The Gemara notes that each of these details teaches a novel <i>halakha</i>. How so? <b>Shabbat</b> comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Hillel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who gathers fruits from one place to another</b> in order <b>to reap</b> them, <b>and the day sanctified upon them,</b> i.e., Shabbat commenced, <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Hillel prohibits</b> the food from the gatherer <b>himself.</b> In other words, Hillel alone prohibits eating the fruit in that case until its tithes have been separated, for he believes that the beginning of Shabbat itself causes the fruit to be considered completed. Rabbi Yoḥanan teaches that the <i>halakha</i> in this case is not in accordance with the opinion of Hillel.

Daf 35b

In addition, it was necessary for Rabbi Yoḥanan to teach the law that <b>a courtyard</b> does not establish fruit for tithes unless its work is completed, <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who was transporting figs in his courtyard to make them into dried figs, his children and the members of his household may eat from them</b> in <b>a casual</b> manner, <b>and they are exempt from tithes. And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught in that regard: Rabbi Ya’akov obligates</b> him, <b>and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, exempts</b> him.
With regard to the law that the separation of <b><i>teruma</i></b> does not establish fruit as fixed for tithes, this comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Fruits from which <i>teruma</i> had been separated before their work was completed, Rabbi Eliezer prohibits eating from them</b> in <b>a casual</b> manner, <b>and the Rabbis permit</b> it.
With regard to the statement that <b>a transaction</b> does not fix fruit for tithes, this is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who acquires figs from an <i>am ha’aretz</i> in a place where most people press</b> and dry their figs in order to make them into cakes, the work of the figs is not completed before this stage, and <b>he may</b> therefore <b>partake of them</b> in <b>a casual</b> manner. <b>And</b> when their work is completed, <b>he</b> need only <b>tithe them as doubtfully tithed produce,</b> in accordance with the law with regard to all produce bought from an uneducated person.
The Gemara comments: One can <b>learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Learn from here</b> that <b>a transaction establishes</b> produce as fixed <b>only with regard to an item whose work is completed,</b> but if its work has not been completed, even selling it does not obligate it in tithes. <b>And learn from here</b> that <b>most</b> people who are in the category of <b><i>am ha’aretz</i> separate tithes,</b> and therefore one need only separate tithes as doubtfully tithed produce, rather than definitively untithed produce. <b>And</b> one can <b>learn from here</b> another law: <b>One may tithe doubtfully tithed produce</b> purchased <b>from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, even with regard to something whose work is not completed.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in accordance with this opinion <b>to exclude that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who exchanges fruits with his friend,</b> which is considered a commercial transaction, if their intention was for <b>this one to eat and that one to eat,</b> or for <b>this one to make them into dried fruit and for that one to make them into dried fruit, this one to eat and that one to make them into dried fruit,</b> they are both <b>obligated</b> in tithes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> however, <b>says:</b> The one who took the fruits in order <b>to eat is obligated,</b> as for him their labor is completed, but the one who intended <b>to make them into dried fruit is exempt</b> and may partake of the fruit in a casual manner, as for him their work has not yet been completed. Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in opposition to the first <i>tanna</i>. He maintains that the transaction itself does not make the fruit liable to tithes unless its work has been completed.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may lower produce,</b> which had been laid out on a roof to dry, into the house <b>through a skylight on a Festival,</b> in order to prevent it from becoming ruined in the rain. Although it is a strenuous activity, it is permitted do to so on a Festival in order to prevent a financial loss; <b>however,</b> one may <b>not</b> do so <b>on Shabbat. And one may cover produce</b> inside a building <b>with cloths</b> to prevent damage <b>due to a leak</b> in the ceiling over it, <b>and similarly</b> one may cover <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil</b> for the same reason. <b>And one may place a vessel beneath a leak</b> in order to catch the water <b>on Shabbat,</b> to prevent it from dirtying the house.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses the first word of the mishna from a linguistic standpoint. <b>It was said: Rav Yehuda and Rav Natan</b> recited differing versions of the mishna’s opening word, which is in all versions a verb meaning to lower. <b>One</b> of them <b>taught <i>mashilin</i>,</b> as in the text of this mishna, <b>and</b> the other <b>one taught <i>mashḥilin</i>.</b>
<b>Mar Zutra said: The one who teaches <i>mashilin</i> is not mistaken, and the one who teaches <i>mashḥilin</i> is not mistaken,</b> as support can be found for both versions. He elaborates: <b>The one who teaches <i>mashilin</i> is not mistaken, as it is written: “For your olives will fall [<i>yishal</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:40). <i>Mashilin</i> would therefore mean: To cause to fall. <b>And he who teaches <i>mashḥilin</i> is not mistaken, as we learned</b> the following cases in a mishna that lists blemishes that invalidate an animal for sacrifice: <b>The <i>shaḥul</i> and the <i>kasul</i>.</b> The mishna explains these terms: <b><i>Shaḥul</i></b> is referring to an animal <b>whose thigh is dislocated,</b> i.e., it has slipped out of place; <b><i>kasul</i></b> is referring to an animal <b>one of whose thighs is higher than the other.</b> This shows that the root <i>sh-ḥ-l-</i> is referring to something that has slipped down from its place.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that there are other possible variations of this word as well. <b>One who teaches <i>mashirin</i> is not mistaken, and one who teaches <i>mashḥirin</i> is not mistaken, and one who teaches <i>manshirin</i> is not mistaken.</b>
He elaborates: <b>One who teaches <i>mashirin</i> is not mistaken, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: A nazirite may not wash</b> the hair of <b>his head with clay</b> as a kind of shampoo, <b>because it causes hair to fall off [<i>mashir</i>],</b> and a nazirite is prohibited to remove the hairs of his head. This shows that <i>mashir</i> indicates causing something to fall. <b>And one who teaches <i>mashḥirin</i> is</b> also <b>not mistaken, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The <i>sheḥor</i>,</b> a type of razor, <b>and a barber’s scissors, even if</b> their blades <b>are detached, are subject to ritual impurity.</b> The fact that a razor is called <i>sheḥor</i> implies that the root <i>sh-ḥ-r</i> indicates causing to fall down.
<b>And one who teaches <i>manshirin</i> is not mistaken</b> either, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One whose clothes fell down [<i>nashru</i>] into water</b> on Shabbat <b>may</b> continue to <b>walk in them</b> while they dry of their own accord, <b>and he need not be concerned</b> that people might suspect him of having washed them on Shabbat. <b>Alternatively,</b> another support can be found <b>from that which we learned</b> in the following mishna: <b>What is gleaning [<i>leket</i>],</b> which must be left for the poor as commanded in Leviticus 19:9? <b>That which falls [<i>nosher</i>] during reaping.</b> These sources show that the root <i>n-sh-r</i> means: To fall down, and <i>manshirin</i> would consequently mean: To cause to fall down.
§ The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna: <b>We learned</b> that <b>one may lower produce through a skylight on a Festival.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Up to how much</b> produce may be lowered in this manner? At what point is it considered to be too strenuous an activity to be performed on the Festival? <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>like that which we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to a different case: <b>One may clear out four or five sacks of hay or grain</b> from a room on Shabbat <b>due to visitors,</b> to clear a place for them to sit, <b>or due to suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall,</b> i.e., to make room there for more people, who would not be able to study Torah otherwise. Here too, only four or five sacks’ worth of produce may be lowered from the roof.
The Gemara raises an objection to the comparison of the two cases. <b>But perhaps there it is different, since there is</b> the matter of preventing <b>suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall</b> or of providing hospitality to guests, i.e., moving those items is permitted in order to facilitate a mitzva. <b>But here, where there is no suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall,</b> i.e., no facilitation of any mitzva, they did <b>not</b> permit one to move such a large amount. <b>Alternatively: There, this is the reasoning that four or five sacks are permitted: Because Shabbat is severe</b> in people’s eyes <b>and they will not come to belittle it; but</b> on <b>a Festival, which is</b> regarded more <b>lightly and which</b> people <b>might come to belittle,</b> one may <b>not</b> move the items <b>at all.</b>
<b>Alternatively,</b> a claim can be made <b>from the other perspective: There, this is the reasoning</b> that it is permitted to carry only four or five sacks: <b>Because there is no monetary loss</b> involved. <b>But here, where there is monetary loss</b> if the produce is not moved, one may carry <b>even a larger amount</b> than four or five sacks.

Daf 36a

The Gemara poses another question with regard to the same issue. <b>We learned elsewhere,</b> at the end of the mishna cited above concerning clearing out sacks for guests and study: <b>But</b> one <b>may not</b> clear out <b>a storeroom. And Shmuel said: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>But not a storeroom?</b> It means: <b>But one may not finish</b> clearing out <b>the entire storeroom</b> while clearing out the sacks, exposing the floor of the storeroom. The reason this is prohibited is <b>lest he come to level out depressions</b> in the dirt floor of the storeroom, which would constitute a biblically prohibited labor. <b>What would be</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>here,</b> with regard to lowering the produce from the roof on a Festival to prevent its ruin in the rain? Is it prohibited also in this case to remove all of it and thereby expose the floor of the roof?
The Gemara specifies the possible arguments: Perhaps <b>it is there, on Shabbat, that it is prohibited, because</b> punishment for Shabbat desecration is <b>severe, but</b> on <b>a Festival, which</b> has a <b>lighter</b> punishment for desecration, <b>it is acceptable. Or perhaps</b> it can be argued to the contrary: <b>There,</b> in the case of the sacks on Shabbat, even though <b>there is suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall,</b> i.e., the clearing out facilitates a mitzva, <b>you say</b> that they did <b>not</b> permit exposing the floor. <b>Here,</b> in the case of lowering produce on a Festival to prevent its ruin, <b>where there is no suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall,</b> i.e., clearing out the produce does not facilitate any mitzva, is it <b>not all the more so</b> prohibited?
The Gemara poses a further question. <b>And here we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may lower produce through a skylight on a Festival, and Rav Naḥman said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to the same roof,</b> i.e., only if the skylight is in the same roof where the produce is located, <b>but</b> to carry the produce <b>from</b> one <b>roof to</b> another <b>roof</b> in order to lower it through a skylight in the second roof is <b>not</b> permitted. This would involve too much exertion to be permitted on the Festival. <b>And</b> this ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not carry from</b> one <b>roof to</b> another <b>roof, even when</b> the two <b>roofs are on the same level</b> and there is no extra effort of lifting or lowering the produce while transporting it between the roofs.
The question arises: <b>There,</b> in the case of moving sacks on Shabbat for guests or for study, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May the sacks be moved from one roof or house to another for this purpose? Perhaps <b>all the more so</b> they may not be moved on <b>Shabbat,</b> because Shabbat is more <b>severe</b> than a Festival? <b>Or perhaps</b> it can be argued to the contrary: <b>It is here,</b> with regard to a Festival, <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to transfer from one roof to another, <b>because a Festival</b> is regarded <b>lightly</b> by people <b>and they might</b> consequently <b>come to belittle it; but</b> on <b>Shabbat, which is severe</b> in people’s eyes <b>and</b> so <b>they will not come to belittle it, it is acceptable</b> to transfer even from one house to another.
<b>Or perhaps</b> it may be argued: <b>If here,</b> in the case of clearing produce from the roof, <b>when there is</b> the issue of the <b>loss of</b> the <b>produce, you say</b> he may <b>not</b> transfer from one roof to another, then <b>there,</b> in the case of moving sacks on Shabbat for guests or study, <b>when there is no</b> issue of <b>loss of produce,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> prohibited?
The Gemara presents yet another dilemma: <b>Here,</b> with regard to bringing produce into one’s house from the roof, <b>we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is no skylight from the roof to the house, necessitating another method of moving the produce out of the rain, <b>he may not lower them by</b> means of <b>a rope through the windows, nor may he take them down by way of ladders. There,</b> with regard to moving sacks on Shabbat, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May they be moved by ropes or using a ladder? Perhaps it is only <b>here,</b> in the case of moving produce out of the rain <b>on a Festival, that</b> it is <b>prohibited,</b> because produce left on a roof <b>does not</b> entail <b>suspension of</b> a mitzva such as study in <b>the study hall; but</b> on <b>Shabbat, when there is</b> the possibility that leaving the sacks in their current location will lead to <b>suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall, it is acceptable</b> to remove them even via windows and ladders.
<b>Or perhaps</b> it can be argued to the contrary: <b>Here,</b> in the case of the produce on the roof, <b>when there is</b> the issue of the <b>loss of</b> the <b>produce, you say</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted. <b>There,</b> in the case of clearing out sacks on Shabbat, <b>where there is no</b> issue of the <b>loss of produce,</b> should it <b>not all the more so</b> be prohibited to lower them via windows and ladders? No resolution was found, so the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may cover produce</b> with cloths to prevent damage due to a leak. <b>Ulla said: And even a row of bricks</b> that might be ruined by the rain may be covered to prevent damage. Although the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna mentions produce, it is not limited to that case, but extends to any item liable to be spoiled. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> It applies only to an item like <b>produce, which is fit</b> for use on the Festival, but not to items such as bricks, which are designated for building and are not fit for use on the Festival. The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak follows</b> his line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A vessel,</b> even if it is of the type that may be handled on Shabbat, <b>may be handled</b> on Shabbat <b>only</b> if it is going to be used <b>for something that may</b> itself <b>be handled on Shabbat,</b> but not for the sake of set-aside [<i>muktze</i>] objects. Since the bricks are <i>muktze</i>, one may not handle cloths to cover the bricks.
The Gemara attempts to find a proof for this view: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may cover produce with cloths,</b> which seems to imply: <b>Produce, yes,</b> because it may be handled on the Festival, but <i>muktze</i> items such as <b>a row of bricks, no.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: This is no proof, as it is possible that <b>the same is true even</b> for <b>a row of bricks,</b> i.e., that they may be covered. But <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught in the first clause</b> of the mishna: <b>One may lower produce,</b> and there it is referring specifically to produce, as bricks may not be handled at all and surely not lowered from the roof, <b>he taught also in the latter clause: One may cover produce.</b> The example of produce was chosen to parallel the first clause in the mishna, not in order to imply exclusion of bricks.
The Gemara offers a different proof. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And similarly</b> one may cover <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil</b> due to a leak in the ceiling. This choice of examples seems to indicate that one may cover only things that are fit for use on the Festival, as opposed to objects such as bricks, which are <i>muktze</i>. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here? With</b> jugs that contain wine and oil <b>that are untithed,</b> which are not fit for Festival use and are therefore <i>muktze</i>. And the same would be true for bricks.
The Gemara goes further: <b>So, too, it is</b> in fact more <b>reasonable</b> that this is the case, <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil</b> containing <b>permitted</b> liquids, <b>didn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> already <b>teach in the first clause</b> of this part of the mishna that it is permitted to cover <b>produce?</b> What new information would be added by specifying jugs as well?
The Gemara rejects this assertion. It is possible that the mishna is referring specifically to jugs containing permitted liquids. Nevertheless, <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to add the example of <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil,</b> as <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that the Sages <b>were concerned over a substantial loss,</b> such as of produce, which can be ruined by drops of rain that leak on it. But <b>with regard to a minor loss,</b> such as drops of rain falling into a wine jug or an oil jug, <b>they were not concerned,</b> and they did not permit covering them. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that those may be covered as well.
The Gemara raises objections against Rabbi Yitzḥak’s view: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may place a vessel beneath a leak on Shabbat.</b> It is permitted, then, to bring a bucket for the purpose of containing the water leaking into the house, although that water is ostensibly not fit for drinking and is therefore <i>muktze</i>. The Gemara rejects this objection: The case in the mishna is of <b>leakage</b> of water <b>that</b> is in fact <b>fit</b> to be drunk, at least by animals, and is consequently fit for Festival use.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another objection from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may spread a mat over bricks on Shabbat</b> to protect against rain. The <i>baraita</i> explicitly permits covering bricks, which Rabbi Yitzḥak prohibited. The Gemara rejects this argument: This <i>baraita</i> is referring to bricks <b>that were left over from building</b> and are no longer designated for use in building, and <b>which are</b> consequently <b>fit for</b> use on the Festival by <b>sitting on</b> them.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another objection. It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may spread a mat over stones on Shabbat,</b> although stones are <i>muktze</i>. The Gemara responds: That <i>baraita</i> is speaking not of ordinary stones but <b>of rounded</b> [<b><i>mekurzalot</i></b>] <b>stones, which</b> are <b>fit for</b> use in personal hygiene <b>in the lavatory</b> on Shabbat, and are therefore not <i>muktze</i>.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an objection from a different source. <b>One may spread a mat over a beehive on Shabbat</b> to protect it from the elements, <b>in the sun due to the sun, and in the rain due to the rain, provided he does not have the intent to trap</b> the bees inside by covering the hive, as trapping is prohibited on Shabbat. A beehive and its bees are not fit for Shabbat use, yet it is permitted to handle a mat in order to cover the hive. The Gemara rejects this: <b>There, too,</b> the reference is to an item that is fit for Shabbat use, as it is discussing a hive <b>when there is honey</b> in it, which can be eaten on Shabbat. It is therefore permitted to handle the mat for the sake of the honey.
<b>Rav Ukva from Meishan said to Rav Ashi:</b> This explanation works out <b>well with</b> regard to <b>the summer, when there is honey,</b> but <b>in the rainy season,</b> when there is no honey in beehives, <b>what can be said?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explicitly mentioned the two phrases in the sun and in the rain. The Gemara answers: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary only for those two honeycombs</b> left in the beehive in the winter to sustain the bees. The Gemara questions this: <b>Are those two honeycombs</b> not <b><i>muktze</i>,</b> as they have clearly been left for the sake of the bees, and not to be used by humans? The Gemara replies: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>when</b> the beekeeper <b>had in mind</b> before the Festival that he was going to take them from the bees and eat <b>them</b> himself.
The Gemara raises an objection to this interpretation. <b>But if he did not have in mind</b> to take <b>them</b> for himself, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Wouldn’t it be <b>prohibited</b> to spread a mat over the hive? If so, when the <i>baraita</i> goes on to specify that sometimes it is prohibited to cover the hive, <b>rather than teaching: As long as he does not have the intent to trap</b> the bees, introducing a totally new factor into the discussion, <b>let it make a distinction within the case itself</b> by saying: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that the beehive may be covered? <b>When he had in mind</b> beforehand to take the honeycombs; <b>but</b> if <b>he did not have in mind</b> to take <b>them, it is prohibited.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Even if he had in mind</b> to take the honeycombs, so that there is no problem of the hive’s being <i>muktze</i>, it is still permitted to cover it <b>provided he does not have intent to trap</b> the bees.
The Gemara raises a further objection against this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you establish</b> and explain this <i>baraita</i>? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who,</b> in disagreement with Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>muktze</i></b> apply. But now <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Provided he does not have the intent to trap.</b> This indicates that even though the bees may be trapped in the process of covering, it is permitted if this was not his intention. If so, <b>we have come to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who, in disagreement with Rabbi Yehuda, <b>said: An unintentional act is permitted</b> even though it leads inadvertently to a prohibited result. This interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is internally conflicted, half in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda and half in accordance with Rabbi Shimon.
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that the <i>baraita</i> follows the view <b>of Rabbi Shimon</b> at all? <b>But didn’t Abaye and Rava both say: Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> that even an unintentional act is prohibited <b>in</b> a case of: <b>Cut off its head and will it not die?</b> In this case the person covering the hive with a mat inevitably traps the bees, even if he does not have intent to do so, and this act should be prohibited even by Rabbi Shimon.
Rather, <b>actually all of</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and with what</b> case <b>are we dealing here?</b> With a beehive <b>that has windows,</b> i.e., small openings, besides the main opening on top, so that some of the windows remain uncovered and covering the hive does not inevitably trap the bees. <b>And</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>you</b> should <b>not say, according to Rabbi Yehuda: Provided he does not have intent to trap</b> the bees, which would imply that the deciding factor is the intention of the one who covers them,

Daf 36b

<b>but rather say</b> the following: <b>Provided he does not make it a trap</b> as he covers it, i.e., as long as he takes care not to cover all the openings. The Gemara questions this: But it is <b>obvious</b> that it is prohibited to directly trap bees on Shabbat; why would the <i>baraita</i> mention it? The Gemara responds: It does inform us of something that is not obvious: <b>Lest you say:</b> An animal <b>whose type is</b> generally <b>trapped</b> and hunted by people for some purpose is <b>prohibited</b> to be trapped on Shabbat, whereas an animal <b>whose type is not</b> generally <b>trapped,</b> such as a bee, is <b>permitted</b> to be trapped even <i>ab initio</i>, as this is not considered to be the normal manner of hunting. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one may not in fact trap bees.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different elucidation: <b>Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the summer, and: In the rainy season?</b> No, <b>it is taught: In the sun due to the sun and in the rain due to the rain.</b> The <i>baraita</i> speaks not of the summer and the rainy season, but <b>of the</b> spring <b>days of Nisan and the</b> autumn <b>days of Tishrei, when there is</b> sometimes <b>sun and there is</b> sometimes <b>rain, and</b> when <b>there is</b> also <b>honey</b> in the hive. It is possible, then, that the <i>baraita</i> permits covering the hive during these seasons because of the honey that is in it, as initially proposed.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may place a vessel beneath a leak</b> in order to catch the water <b>on Shabbat.</b> A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the vessel became full</b> with the leaking water, <b>he may pour out</b> its contents, place the vessel back under the leak, <b>and repeat</b> the entire process if necessary, <b>and</b> he need <b>not refrain</b> from doing so.
The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye’s millhouse</b> once <b>developed a leak</b> on Shabbat. Abaye was concerned about the potential damage to the millstones, which were made partly of clay and which would become ruined from the leaking water, and he did not have enough buckets to catch all the water without emptying and refilling them. But the water was unfit for drinking and was therefore <i>muktze</i> and could not be removed. Abaye <b>came before Rabba</b> to ask him how to proceed. Rabba <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>bring your bed into</b> the millhouse, <b>so that</b> the dirty water <b>will be</b> considered <b>like a container of excrement,</b> which, despite being <i>muktze</i>, may be removed from one’s presence due to its repulsive nature, <b>and</b> then <b>remove</b> the water.
<b>Abaye sat</b> and examined the matter <b>and posed a difficulty: And may one initiate</b> a situation of <b>a container of excrement,</b> i.e., may one intentionally place any repulsive matter into a situation which will bother him and will then have to be removed, <b><i>ab initio</i>? In the meantime,</b> as he was deliberating the issue, <b>Abaye’s millhouse collapsed. He said: I had</b> this <b>coming to me for having gone against the words of my master,</b> Rabba, by not following his ruling unquestioningly.
<b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a container of excrement and a container of urine, it is permitted to remove them</b> on Shabbat <b>to a garbage heap. And when he returns</b> the container to the house <b>he must place water in it</b> first <b>and</b> then <b>return it,</b> for it is prohibited to carry these containers alone, as their foul odor makes them <i>muktze</i> due to their repulsive nature.
Some Sages at first <b>understood from</b> the wording of Shmuel’s statement that with regard to removing <b>a container of excrement on account of the vessel,</b> i.e., along with its vessel: <b>Yes,</b> this is permitted; but to remove the excrement <b>by itself,</b> without a vessel containing it: <b>No,</b> this is prohibited. The Gemara counters this conclusion with the following story: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that a certain</b> dead <b>mouse was discovered in Rav Ashi’s storeroom</b> for <b>spices</b> [<b><i>isparmekei</i></b>]. <b>Rav Ashi said to them: Take hold of it by its tail and remove it.</b> This shows that repulsive matter may be removed even directly.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any act for which one is liable due to a rabbinic decree</b> made to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <b>rest [<i>shevut</i>];</b> or if it is notable <b>because it is optional,</b> i.e., it involves an aspect of a mitzva but is not a complete mitzva; or if it is notable <b>because it is</b> a full-fledged <b>mitzva,</b> if it is prohibited <b>on Shabbat, one is liable for it on a Festival</b> as well.
<b>And these are</b> the acts prohibited by the Sages <b>as <i>shevut</i>: One may not climb a tree</b> on Shabbat, <b>nor ride on an animal, nor swim in the water, nor clap</b> his hands together, <b>nor clap</b> his hand on the <b>thigh, nor dance.</b>
<b>And the following</b> are acts that are prohibited on Shabbat and are notable <b>because they are optional,</b> i.e., which involve an aspect of a mitzva but are not complete mitzvot: <b>One may not judge, nor betroth</b> a woman, <b>nor perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> which is done in lieu of levirate marriage, <b>nor perform levirate marriage.</b>
<b>And the following</b> are prohibited on Shabbat despite the fact that they are notable <b>because of the</b> full-fledged <b>mitzva</b> involved in them: <b>One may not consecrate, nor take a valuation vow</b> (see Leviticus 27), <b>nor consecrate</b> objects for use by the priests or the Temple, <b>nor separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes</b> from produce.
The Sages <b>spoke</b> of <b>all these</b> acts being prohibited even <b>with regard to a Festival; all the more so</b> are they prohibited <b>on Shabbat.</b> The general principle is: <b>There is no</b> difference <b>between a Festival and Shabbat, except for</b> work involving preparation of <b>food alone,</b> which is permitted on a Festival but prohibited on Shabbat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the reasons for each of these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>One may not climb a tree.</b> This is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one detach</b> branches or leaves as he climbs, thereby transgressing the prohibited labor of reaping.
<b>Nor ride on an animal:</b> This is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one go beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit</b> on the animal. The Gemara asks: Can one then <b>learn from here</b> that the prohibition against venturing beyond <b>the</b> Shabbat <b>limits,</b> which applies also to Festivals, <b>is by Torah law?</b> If the prohibition with regard to the Shabbat limit were rabbinic, the Sages would not have reinforced it with the additional decree against riding an animal. It is known that this is a matter of dispute; in light of this explanation of the mishna it would be a proof that Shabbat boundaries are of Torah origin. <b>Rather,</b> give a different reason for the prohibition: It is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one cut off a branch</b> to use as a riding switch, and thereby perform the labor of reaping, which is prohibited by Torah law.
<b>Nor swim in the water:</b> This is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one make a swimmer’s barrel,</b> i.e., an improvised flotation device used to teach beginners how to swim.
<b>Nor clap</b> one’s hands together, <b>nor clap his hand on the thigh, nor dance:</b> All of these are prohibited due to <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one fashion a musical instrument</b> to accompany his clapping or dancing.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And the following</b> are acts that are prohibited on Shabbat and are notable <b>because they are optional,</b> i.e., which involve an aspect of a mitzva but are not complete mitzvot: <b>One may not judge.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t one perform</b> a full-fledged <b>mitzva</b> by acting as a judge in a court? Why is it categorized as optional rather than as a full-fledged mitzva? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to categorize it as optional, as it is speaking of a case <b>where there is</b> another person <b>who is more</b> qualified <b>than he.</b> Since the other person can judge even better, it is not considered an absolute mitzva for the first one to judge.
§ <b>Nor betroth</b> a woman: The Gemara asks: Why is this categorized as optional, indicating that it is not a full-fledged mitzva? <b>But doesn’t one perform a</b> full-fledged <b>mitzva</b> when he marries, as this enables him to fulfill the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to categorize it as optional,

Daf 37a

<b>because</b> it is dealing with a case in which <b>he</b> already <b>has a wife and children,</b> so that he has already fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply, and his betrothal of another woman is only an optional act.
§ <b>Nor perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, nor perform levirate marriage:</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t one perform a mitzva</b> through these acts? Why are they categorized as optional? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to categorize them as optional, as it is speaking of a case <b>when there is an older</b> brother. Since the general principle is that <b>the</b> preferable way to carry out the <b>mitzva is for the oldest</b> brother <b>to perform levirate marriage,</b> the performance of levirate marriage by a younger brother is classified as optional.
The Gemara clarifies the reason for the prohibition against judging, betrothing, etc., on Shabbat and Festivals: <b>And</b> in <b>all these</b> cases, <b>what is the reason</b> they may not be performed? It is <b>a decree lest one write</b> down the proceedings of these acts in a document, such as the verdict of a judgment, the document of betrothal, a document testifying to the <i>ḥalitza</i>, or a marriage contract in the case of levirate marriage.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And the following</b> are notable <b>because of the</b> full-fledged <b>mitzva</b> involved in them, yet are prohibited on Shabbat: <b>One may not consecrate, nor take a valuation vow, nor consecrate</b> objects for use by the priests or the Temple. The Gemara explains: All these cases are prohibited because of <b>a decree due to</b> their similarity to <b>commerce.</b> These acts, which all involve the transfer of ownership to the Temple treasury, resemble commerce, which is prohibited on a Festival.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not separate <i>terumot</i> and tithes.</b> The Gemara asks: Is it not <b>obvious</b> that this is so? In doing so one makes forbidden food usable, a form of repairing, which is a prohibited labor. <b>Rav Yosef taught: It is necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <b>only</b> to state that it is prohibited even to separate <i>teruma</i> in order <b>to give it to a priest on the same day.</b> One could have thought that since he is separating the produce in order to give it to a priest it should be permitted like any other preparation of food; the mishna therefore states explicitly that it is prohibited.
The Gemara comments: <b>And this applies only to produce that</b> had the status of <b>untithed produce,</b> and therefore was required to be tithed, <b>the day before</b> the Festival. <b>However, produce that became untithed now</b> on the Festival itself, <b>such as dough</b> prepared on the Festival, which becomes untithed and requires <i>ḥalla</i> to be taken from it only after the dough is made: With regard to <b>separating <i>ḥalla</i> from it, one may separate</b> the <i>ḥalla</i> <b>and give</b> it <b>to a priest</b> even on a Festival.
The Gemara asks a question. When the mishna describes <b>those</b> cases as notable <b>because they are optional,</b> is this to say that their prohibition is <b>not because</b> of a <b>rabbinic decree</b> to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <b>rest [<i>shevut</i>]?</b> Likewise, with regard to <b>those</b> cases described as notable <b>because they are mitzvot,</b> is this to say that their prohibition is <b>not because of <i>shevut</i>?</b> The mishna, by referring only to the first of its three categories as <i>shevut</i>, implies that the acts listed in the following categories do not involve <i>shevut</i>. But this is not so; as the Gemara stated above, all these acts are prohibited by rabbinic decree to enhance the character of Shabbat and the Festival as days of rest.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> They are indeed all prohibited as <i>shevut</i>. The mishna lists three types of <i>shevut</i>: Those that involve no mitzva whatsoever, those that have a mitzva aspect to them, and those that constitute a full-fledged mitzva. And the <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking</b> and arranges his list employing the style of: <b>There is no need,</b> i.e., he arranges the cases in order of increasing notability. First, <b>there is no need</b> to state, i.e., it is most obvious, that <b>plain <i>shevut</i>,</b> which involves no mitzva at all, <b>is prohibited, but even <i>shevut</i> of an optional act,</b> i.e., an act that is a minor mitzva, <b>is also prohibited. And there is no need</b> to state, i.e., it is obvious, that <b><i>shevut</i> of an optional act is prohibited, but even <i>shevut</i> of</b> a full-fledged <b>mitzva is also prohibited.</b>
§ It was taught in the mishna: The Sages <b>spoke</b> of <b>all these</b> acts being prohibited even <b>with regard to a Festival;</b> all the more so are they prohibited on Shabbat. There is no difference between a Festival and Shabbat except for work involving food. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this from an earlier mishna: <b>One may lower</b> produce from the roof into the house <b>through a skylight</b> to prevent it from being spoiled by the rain <b>on a Festival, but not on Shabbat.</b> This shows that there is another difference between a Festival and Shabbat besides food preparation: Doing a strenuous activity to prevent a loss is permitted on a Festival but prohibited on Shabbat.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> mishna here, which does not include the <i>halakha</i> of lowering produce as an example of a difference between Shabbat and a Festival, is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>that</b> previous mishna that does cite it as a difference is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>
Rav Yosef elaborates on his statement: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a cow and her calf, which may not be slaughtered on the same day because of the biblical prohibition: “You shall not kill <b>it and its offspring</b> both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <b>fell into a pit</b> on a Festival, and their owner wishes to take them out, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it and</b> then <b>slaughter it, and</b> as for <b>the second, he provides it sustenance in its place so that it will not die</b> in the pit. It is prohibited to undertake the strenuous task of raising an animal out of a pit except for the purpose of eating it on the Festival. Therefore, since one cannot slaughter both animals on the Festival, only one can be raised, while the other should be sustained in its place until after the Festival.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> however, <b>says: One may raise the first with the intent of slaughtering it and</b> then change his mind and <b>not slaughter it. Then he may go back and employ artifice</b> by deciding that he prefers to slaughter the second one, <b>and he raises the second.</b> Having raised both animals, <b>if he</b> so <b>desires he may slaughter this</b> one; <b>if he</b> so <b>desires he may slaughter that</b> one. Rav Yosef understands the argument between the two Sages as follows: Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that it is permitted to perform a strenuous activity on a Festival in order to prevent a loss, and therefore he may raise both animals, lest the one left behind die in the pit. Rabbi Eliezer, on the other hand, holds that one may not perform a strenuous activity to prevent a loss, so the second animal must be left in the pit even though it may die there. It may therefore be posited that the mishna that permits lowering produce on a Festival to prevent loss is in accordance with Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion. Rabbi Eliezer would disagree with this leniency, and the principle that there is no difference between Shabbat and a Festival other than food preparation would remain intact.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>From where</b> do you know that this analysis of these Sages’ opinions is correct? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer stated</b> his opinion that a strenuous activity to prevent monetary loss is prohibited on a Festival <b>only thus far, there</b> in the case of the animals in the pit, <b>where it is possible to sustain</b> the second animal in the pit and keep it from dying. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the produce on the roof, where there is <b>no possibility</b> of preventing the loss <b>through providing sustenance,</b> he would <b>not</b> prohibit lowering the produce to save it from loss.
<b>Alternatively,</b> one can propose an opposite argument: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua stated</b> his opinion that a strenuous activity to prevent loss is permitted <b>only thus far, there</b> in the case of the two animals, <b>because it is possible to employ artifice</b> to raise the second animal, so that an observer might assume that that he was not acting to preserve his property, but wished to eat the first animal and subsequently changed his mind. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the produce on the roof, <b>where it is not possible to employ artifice,</b> as it is clear that he is acting to salvage his produce, Rabbi Yehoshua would <b>not</b> be lenient. Therefore, Rav Yosef’s approach to resolving the contradiction has no support from this <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> This resolution of the contradiction is to be rejected in favor of the following: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case is in accordance with <b>Beit Shammai,</b> whereas <b>that</b> case follows the approach of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> On a Festival <b>one may not take out a child</b> who cannot walk, <b>nor a <i>lulav</i>, nor a Torah scroll</b> into the public domain, as none of these are required for the preparation of food, <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> it. It is certainly prohibited to carry out any item into the public domain on Shabbat, yet Beit Hillel permit it on a Festival. Therefore, it may be posited that just as Beit Hillel allow carrying out items on a Festival but not on Shabbat, so would they permit moving the produce off the roof on a Festival but not on Shabbat. According to Beit Shammai, who forbid carrying items out on a Festival and on Shabbat equally, moving the produce from the roof would also be equally prohibited, and the principle that there is no difference between Shabbat and a Festival other than food preparation would remain intact.
The Gemara at first refutes this explanation: <b>Perhaps that is not so,</b> as it is possible that <b>Beit Shammai stated</b> their opinion <b>only thus far, there</b> with regard to the prohibition against <b>transferring</b> objects from one domain to another, <b>but not</b> with regard to <b>moving</b> objects, such as produce, from place to place in the house. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>moving is not</b> performed <b>for the sake of taking out</b> to the public domain? The decree against moving items unnecessarily, i.e., not for use on Shabbat or a Festival, was enacted due to a concern that one might take objects into the public domain. Rav Pappa’s explanation that it is only Beit Shammai who would prohibit lowering the produce from the roof therefore stands.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The status of <b>animals and vessels</b> on Festivals <b>is as the feet of</b> their <b>owner,</b> meaning that one’s animals and vessels are governed by his own travel limitations on Shabbat and Festivals. In the case of <b>one who delivers his animal to his son or to a shepherd</b> before the Festival to care for it, <b>these are as the feet of the owner,</b> rather than those of the son or the shepherd.
<b>Vessels that</b> have been inherited by several brothers and have not been divided among them but are still owned jointly, if they <b>are designated for</b> the use of <b>one of the brothers in the house</b> and the other brothers have no part in them, <b>these are as his feet,</b> and they are subject to his travel limitations. <b>And</b> as for those <b>that are not designated</b> for any particular brother, <b>these are as a place where</b> they <b>may</b> all <b>go.</b> They are limited by the travel limitations of every one of the brothers, as when one brother made a joining of Shabbat boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] and the others did not.
<b>One who borrows a vessel from another on the eve of a Festival,</b> it is <b>as the feet of the borrower</b> rather than the owner, as when the Festival began the vessel established its place of rest in possession of the borrower. However, if he borrowed it <b>on the Festival</b> itself, it is <b>as the feet of the lender,</b> since at the start of the Festival its place of rest was established in the possession of its owner. <b>And similarly, a woman who borrowed spices from another</b> to put in a dish, <b>or water and salt</b> to put in <b>her dough, these</b> foods, i.e., the dish and the dough, which contain ingredients belonging to both parties, <b>are as the feet of both of them;</b> they are limited by the travel limitations of both parties. <b>Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> one from travel limitations <b>in the</b> case of <b>water, because it</b> has <b>no substance</b> in the mixture and therefore is not considered connected to the original owner.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asserts: <b>The mishna</b>

Daf 37b

is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Dosa says, and some say Abba Shaul says: One who purchases an animal from another on the eve of a Festival, even if he did not deliver it to him until the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is as the feet of the purchaser. And one who delivers his animal to a shepherd, even if he did not deliver it to him until the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is as the feet of the shepherd.</b> The mishna, on the other hand, teaches that an animal delivered to a shepherd remains as the feet of the owner, therefore apparently contradicting Rabbi Dosa.
The Gemara rejects the assertion that this is a contradiction. <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Dosa, and</b> it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it is referring <b>to</b> a town that has only <b>one shepherd.</b> In that case the owner knows with certainty beforehand that he will be delivering his animal to this shepherd over the course of the Festival, and therefore the animal’s place of rest is established as being identical to that of the shepherd. <b>There,</b> however, the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a town where there are <b>two shepherds.</b> Since the issue of which of them will receive this animal is undetermined when the Festival begins, the animal remains as the feet of its owner. The Gemara strengthens this assertion that the mishna is dealing with a case where there are two shepherds: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> in accordance with this interpretation, <b>as it teaches: To his son or to a shepherd,</b> suggesting that initially he did not know to whom he would give the animal. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is so.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> that animals given to a shepherd are as the feet of the shepherd. The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> a general principle that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> always <b>follows an unattributed</b> statement in <b>a mishna? And we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Animals and vessels are as the feet of the owner.</b> One who delivers his animal to his son or to a shepherd, it is as the feet of the owner.
The Gemara answers: <b>And did we not establish</b> that the <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Dosa is dealing with a different case than the mishna, that <b>here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> it is dealing <b>with</b> a town with <b>one shepherd,</b> whereas <b>there</b> in the mishna it is dealing <b>with</b> a town with <b>two shepherds?</b> There is consequently no contradiction between establishing the halakha both in accordance with Rabbi Dosa and in accordance with the mishna.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>two</b> people <b>who borrowed one robe in partnership</b> from a third party, <b>this</b> person in order <b>to go to the study hall with it</b> in the <b>morning and that</b> person in order <b>to enter</b> a wedding <b>feast with it</b> in the <b>evening,</b> and <b>this one made a joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] <b>for himself to the north</b> in order to reach his destination, <b>and that</b> one <b>made an <i>eiruv</i> for himself to the south</b> in order to reach his destination, <b>the one who made an <i>eiruv</i> for himself to the north may walk</b> with the robe only <b>to the north</b> as far <b>as</b> it is permitted for <b>the feet of the one who made an <i>eiruv</i> for himself to the south,</b> i.e., he may go north only as far as the other borrower may go.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>the one who made an <i>eiruv</i> for himself to the south may walk</b> with the robe <b>to the south</b> only as far <b>as</b> is permitted for the <b>feet of the one who made an <i>eiruv</i> for himself to the north,</b> as the robe is as the feet of both borrowers and may go only as far as both of them may walk. If each of them placed his <i>eiruv</i> at a distance of one thousand cubits from their house, to the north and south respectively, they may each walk, without the robe, three thousand cubits from their regular dwelling-place, one partner toward the north and the other partner toward the south. The three thousand cubits are comprised of the thousand cubits from the house to the <i>eiruv</i> plus another two thousand, the standard Shabbat limit, from the location of the <i>eiruv</i>. The one whose <i>eiruv</i> is in the north may not wear the robe farther than one thousand cubits north of his house, as he would then be going beyond the farthest extent of the other’s Shabbat limit, and vice versa for the one whose <i>eiruv</i> is in the south.
<b>And if they made</b> their respective <b>limits</b> end <b>in the center,</b> i.e., if one placed his <i>eiruv</i> two thousand cubits from the house to the south, so that the house is his farthest limit to the north, and the other placed his <i>eiruv</i> two thousand cubits to the north of the house, the house being his farthest limit to the south, <b>then each</b> of them <b>may not move</b> the robe <b>from its place</b> at all.
The Gemara records a dispute between <i>amora’im</i>. <b>It was said:</b> In the case of <b>two</b> people <b>who purchased a barrel</b> of wine <b>or an animal in partnership</b> before a Festival, in order to divide the contents of the barrel or the meat of the animal between them on the Festival itself, what is the <i>halakha</i> if the two people have different Shabbat limits? <b>Rav said:</b> The <b>barrel is permitted</b> to each of them, and each may take his portion on the Festival and transfer it within his respective Shabbat limit, which is also applicable to Festivals; <b>but</b> the <b>animal is prohibited,</b> and each portion of it may be transferred only within the limits that are shared by both purchasers. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The <b>barrel is also prohibited</b> to be transferred beyond the limits shared by both people.
The Gemara questions the opinion of Rav, who distinguished between the case of the barrel and that of the animal. <b>What does Rav hold? If he holds</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> so that after the division of the barrel it becomes clarified retroactively which portion belonged to which partner, and the Festival place of rest for each portion is established at the start of the Festival in accordance with the person who will later become its owner, then <b>even</b> the <b>animal should be permitted. And if he holds</b> that <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> so that at the start of the Festival both portions of the animal belong jointly to both of them and may therefore be transferred only within the limits shared by both people, then <b>even</b> the <b>barrel should be prohibited.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the explanation for Rav is that <b>he holds there is</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and the reason Rav was stringent in the case of the animal is that <b>an animal is different, as</b> the <b>limits absorb from each other.</b> A live animal cannot be divided into two parts for ownership; each part of its body depends on and is nourished by the other. Consequently, even if the designation of the respective portions takes place retroactively, each portion continues to draw from the other part, so that at the time of division the two portions are once again mixed together. <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> If that is your rationale, this indicates that the Sages <b>were not concerned about the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>,</b> as it is not assumed that each of them removed the portion of his partner from his mind, thereby prohibiting it from his own use, and yet <b>they were concerned about the prohibition of</b> Shabbat <b>limits.</b> Isn’t this illogical? <b>Rav was silent</b> and offered no response.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this issue? <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said:</b> In general, <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and they can therefore each transport their portions of both the barrel and the animal to their respective places. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is no</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and therefore they may not move their portions of either the barrel or the animal except within the limits shared by both of them.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Hoshaya</b> really <b>hold there is</b> retroactive <b>designation? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: If there is <b>a corpse in a house that has many entrances, all</b> the entrances <b>are ritually impure,</b> i.e., everything situated in the space of the entrance becomes impure, even in the part that lies beyond a closed door, separating it from the corpse. Since any of the entrances might be used to remove the corpse, and none are designated for that purpose, all are rendered impure. However, <b>if one of them was</b> subsequently <b>opened,</b> then the space of <b>that</b> particular entrance <b>is impure, while all the others are pure,</b> as it is assumed that that the corpse will be removed by way of the open door. Even if none of the entrances was actually open, if <b>one</b> merely <b>intended to remove</b> the corpse <b>through</b> a particular <b>one of</b> the entrances <b>or through a window that is</b> at least <b>four by four</b> handbreadths in size, this intention of his <b>saves all the</b> other <b>entrances</b> from impurity.
The details of this last <i>halakha</i> are disputed by <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>Beit Shammai say: And this</b> applies only <b>if he had this intention before the dead person died,</b> so that at the time of death it was known which entrance would be used. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It applies <b>even</b> if he had this intention only <b>after the dead person died.</b>
<b>And it is stated with regard to this</b> mishna: <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said:</b> When Beit Hillel said that the other entrances are pure even if one thought of removing the corpse via a particular entrance only after the person died, they meant only <b>to purify the entrances from that point and onward;</b> from the moment of his intention there is no more impurity in the other entrances. From this the Gemara infers: <b>From here and onward: Yes,</b> the other entrances are saved from impurity, but <b>retroactively: No.</b> Whatever was in the doorways before this intent was formulated has already contracted ritual impurity and this cannot be reversed retroactively by one’s subsequent thoughts. This indicates that the principle of retroactive designation is not accepted by Rabbi Hoshaya.
The Gemara resolves this contradiction in the following manner: <b>Reverse</b> the presentation of their opinions given above, and say: <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said: There is no</b> retroactive <b>designation, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b>
The Gemara questions this resolution: <b>And does Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation? But didn’t Rav Asi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Brothers who divided</b> property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> considered <b>purchasers</b> from each other, <b>and</b> as purchasers of land <b>they must return</b> the portions <b>to each other in the Jubilee</b> year, at which point they may redistribute the property? This demonstrates that Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold that it is retroactively established that each brother’s portion was designated for him directly upon their father’s death, but rather it is considered that all the land was joint property until the brothers traded or bought their respective portions from each other.
<b>And if you should say: When does Rabbi Yoḥanan not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation?</b> Only <b>in</b> regard to matters that are <b>Torah law,</b> but <b>he does hold</b> of retroactive designation <b>in</b> regard to matters of <b>rabbinic law,</b> such as the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat limits; this would account for the discrepancy.
<b>But does he accept</b> retroactive designation <b>in</b> matters of <b>rabbinic law? Didn’t</b> the Sage <b>Ayo teach</b> otherwise in regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of joining of Shabbat boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>]? As it was taught in a mishna: One who has heard that a rabbi will be coming to a place near his town to deliver a lesson on Shabbat, but is unsure where the lecture will take place, may place two <i>eiruvin</i> on Shabbat eve in two different directions, while stipulating that only the <i>eiruv</i> on the side where the rabbi will teach will take effect. Furthermore, if he hears that two rabbis will be coming to two different locations, he may place two <i>eiruvin</i> and stipulate that he will decide on Shabbat which rabbi he prefers, and consequently which of the two <i>eiruvin</i> will take effect.
Ayo taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagreed with this <i>halakha</i> and <b>said: A person may not make a stipulation with regard to two</b> contradictory <b>things at once,</b> and therefore if two Sages will be arriving, his condition is of no effect. <b>Rather,</b> it is true that in the first case, where he knows that a rabbi is coming but does not know from which direction, he may place two <i>eiruvin</i> and stipulate that <b>if the rabbi comes from the east his <i>eiruv</i> in the east</b> will take effect, and if the rabbi comes <b>from the west, his <i>eiruv</i> in the west</b> will take effect. <b>However,</b> in the second case, when two rabbis come to the two locations, one of them arriving <b>here and</b> the other arriving <b>there,</b> and one wants to place two <i>eiruvin</i> and decide on Shabbat which of the two lectures he will attend, this he may <b>not</b> do; that would require the identity of the functional <i>eiruv</i> to be determined retroactively, and one’s place of rest must be determined when Shabbat begins.

Daf 38a

<b>And we discussed</b> the following difficulty <b>with regard to this</b> teaching of Ayo: <b>What is different</b> about the case where two rabbis are coming to the two locations, one <b>here and</b> the other <b>there,</b> and one places two <i>eiruvin</i>, planning to decide on Shabbat which lecture he will attend? Why did Rabbi Yehuda state that this may not be done? It is because he held that <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b> But if so, in the first case <b>as well,</b> where only one rabbi comes, but the location of his lecture was not known before Shabbat, and one placed <i>eiruvin</i> in the <b>east and</b> the <b>west,</b> we should say that neither is effective because the rabbi’s location will not be known until Shabbat, and <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> in explanation: This first case is referring to a situation in which the <b>rabbi had already arrived</b> before the <i>eiruv</i> was placed, but the one placing the <i>eiruv</i> does not know the rabbi’s location. Therefore, it had already been determined which of the two <i>eiruvin</i> would be effective, although it was not yet known to him when Shabbat began. <b>Apparently,</b> then, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation</b> even in matters of rabbinic law, as he states that if the rabbi were to arrive after the <i>eiruv</i> was placed, it would not be effective retroactively.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this approach and states: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the views of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Hoshaya; it is indeed Rabbi Hoshaya, also known as Rabbi Oshaya, who accepts retroactive designation, and Rabbi Yoḥanan who rejects it. As for Rabbi Oshaya’s statement with regard to the entrances to a house that contains a corpse, the following answer may be offered: <b>And when does Rabbi Oshaya not hold</b> of the principle of retroactive <b>designation?</b> With regard to matters of <b>Torah</b> law, such as the ritual impurity of the dead. <b>But with regard to</b> matters of <b>rabbinic</b> law, such as Shabbat limits and the placement of <i>eiruvin</i>, <b>he does accept</b> this principle.
<b>Mar Zutra taught in</b> a public <b>lesson:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> with regard to retroactive designation.
<b>Shmuel said: An ox of a fattener,</b> one whose occupation is to fatten oxen in order to sell them for their meat, <b>is as the feet of all people.</b> It is as the feet of the one who acquires the animal on the Festival, even if the buyer is from another city, as the fattener’s intention when the Festival begins is that the ox belong to whoever buys it. But <b>an ox of a shepherd,</b> who raises oxen for himself but occasionally sells them to his neighbors or acquaintances, <b>is as the feet of</b> the people of <b>that city,</b> as his intention when the Festival begins is that he might sell the animal to someone in town, but not to someone from out of town.
§ The mishna states: In the case of <b>one who borrows a vessel from another on the eve of a Festival,</b> it is as the feet of the borrower. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case, as the place of rest of the vessel has already been established in the possession of the borrower. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one did not deliver</b> the vessel <b>to him until the Festival</b> itself. <b>Lest you say:</b> Since the lender <b>did not establish it in</b> the borrower’s <b>possession</b> before the Festival began, it should remain as the feet of the lender, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it is not so, but it is as the feet of the borrower.
The Gemara comments: Interpreted in this manner, the mishna <b>supports</b> a statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who borrows a vessel from another on the eve of a Festival, even if he did not give it to him until the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is as the feet of the borrower.</b>
§ It is taught in the mishna: If one borrowed <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is as the feet of the lender.</b> The Gemara again wonders: This is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case where this borrower <b>is accustomed to borrowing</b> such items <b>from</b> this lender. <b>Lest you say</b> that since it is a regular occurrence for this loan to take place, the lender <b>establishes it in his possession</b> ahead of time, and it should therefore be considered as though the object’s place of rest is established as the feet of the borrower, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it is not so, as the lender <b>certainly says</b> to himself: <b>Perhaps he will find someone else</b> this time, <b>and he will go and borrow from him.</b> Consequently, the lender does not transfer possession of the object to the borrower until the latter takes it, and it may be carried only where the lender may go.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And similarly, a woman who borrowed</b> spices <b>from another</b> to put in a dish, or water and salt to put in her dough, these are as the feet of both of them. The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Abba ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that I say a statement</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>that will be accepted</b> by my listeners in Eretz Yisrael, so that I will not be put to shame. <b>When he ascended,</b> he found <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, and Rabbi Zeira, and some say</b> he found <b>Rabbi Abbahu, Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, and</b> they <b>were sitting and saying</b> in a discussion of the mishna: <b>Why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> with regard to dough? <b>But let</b> the <b>water and salt be</b> considered <b>nullified in the dough,</b> and the status of the dough should follow its flour rather than its minor ingredients, such as water and salt. <b>Rabbi Abba said to them:</b>

Daf 38b

<b>If</b> one’s single <b><i>kav</i> of wheat became mingled with ten <i>kav</i> of another’s wheat,</b> shall <b>the latter eat</b> all eleven <i>kav</i> <b>and rejoice?</b> One does not allow his property to become nullified into someone else’s property. The same applies to water and salt in dough. The Sages <b>laughed at him. He said to them:</b> Did <b>I take your cloaks</b> from you that you are putting me to shame? <b>They again laughed at him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Oshaya said: They did well to laugh at him.</b> They were correct that the two cases are dissimilar, as they reasoned as follows: <b>What is different</b> about a case of <b>wheat</b> belonging to one person that became mingled <b>with barley</b> of another, that Rabbi Abba <b>did not say</b> this case <b>to them</b> as an example? He specifically chose an example of wheat mingling with other wheat and not that case of barley <b>because that is</b> one <b>type</b> mingled <b>with</b> something <b>that is not its</b> same <b>type.</b> The principle is: <b>A type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> a large amount of food <b>not</b> of its own <b>type becomes nullified,</b> and this principle applies even when the two foods belong to two different people. If so, the same may be said when <b>wheat</b> of one individual is mixed <b>with wheat</b> of another <b>as well. Although, according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> an item mingled with another item of the same type <b>is not nullified, according to the Rabbis</b> it <b>is certainly nullified.</b>
<b>Rav Safra said</b> to Rabbi Oshaya: <b>Moses!</b> This is a term of reverence for the leader of the generation. Have you in fact <b>spoken well</b> in defending those who scoffed at Rabbi Abba? <b>But, did</b> those Sages who scoffed <b>not hear</b> of <b>this</b> teaching <b>that Rabbi Ḥiyya of Ketosfa’a said in the name of Rav: One who removes pebbles from another’s</b> wheat <b>granary is obligated</b> to reimburse him for the loss he has caused and <b>pay him the value of wheat</b> according to the weight of those stones. The latter could have sold those pebbles along with his wheat, as there is always some refuse mixed in with the wheat that is weighed and sold along with it. Therefore, the removal of the pebbles has caused the owner of the granary a monetary loss.
<b>Apparently,</b> he must compensate him because <b>he has reduced his measure</b> of wheat. Despite the fact that the pebbles themselves are worthless, we do not say that the pebbles were nullified in the wheat and that consequently there is no loss involved in their removal. <b>Here, too,</b> in the case of one who borrows water and salt, which are not worthless, all the more so may we say that <b>one has reduced his measure,</b> and he must compensate the lender; it cannot be said that they are nullified in the dough and that they are no longer taken into account regarding the Shabbat limit.
<b>Abaye</b> objected to the comparison to the case with the pebbles in the wheat, and <b>said to</b> Rav Safra: <b>And</b> does <b>the master not differentiate between money that has claimants,</b> such as in the case of the pebbles removed from the granary in which the owner seeks compensation and therefore there is no nullification, <b>and money that does not have claimants,</b> as in the case of water and salt, where the owner lent them to the borrower and does not demand them back for now? In the latter case it is possible for these ingredients to be considered nullified.
Rav Safra <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> that one must distinguish between money that has claimants and money that does not, how would you account for <b>this</b> teaching: <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, who maintains that an item can be nullified only when mixed with an item of a different type but not of the same type, flesh of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass can be nullified in</b> a larger quantity of meat of <b>a slaughtered</b> animal. Although carcass meat generally imparts impurity, if someone touches the mixture of the two meats he does not become ritually impure, as the carcass meat is considered a different type from the slaughtered animal, and is therefore nullified. This is <b>because</b> meat from <b>a slaughtered</b> animal <b>cannot attain the status of carcass,</b> and it is therefore viewed as a different type.
The Gemara continues to cite Rav Ḥisda’s statement: However, if meat of a slaughtered animal became mingled with a larger quantity of pieces of animal carcass, the meat of the <b>slaughtered</b> animal <b>is not nullified by the carcass, as it is possible for a carcass to attain the status of a slaughtered</b> animal. This means that it can lose its ability to transmit ritual impurity, as if a carcass becomes spoiled to the extent that it is no longer edible, it loses its impure status. The fact that the carcass meat has the potential ability to attain the status of slaughtered meat renders the two meats as the same type, and according to Rabbi Yehuda the smaller amount of slaughtered meat would not be nullified in the larger amount of carcass meat. The entirety of the mixture would not be considered carcass meat, but would retain its status of intermingled carcass and slaughtered meat.
<b>Here, too,</b> will you say <b>that if</b> the carcass <b>has owners</b> other than the owner of the slaughtered meat, <b>it is not nullified</b> in the slaughtered meat? <b>And if you say:</b> Yes, <b>it is indeed so, but isn’t it taught: Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: Ownerless objects acquire residence</b> for Shabbat in their location, and anyone who finds them on Shabbat may move them two thousand cubits in all directions but not beyond that, as <b>although they have no owner, it is as though they have an owner?</b> This shows that even property that has no claimants, like the salt and water in this mishna, has its own independent Shabbat limits, which do not become nullified when mixed with items that have a different Shabbat limit.
Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Safra: <b>Are you comparing</b> a <i>halakha</i> involving <b>prohibitions,</b> i.e., ritual law, <b>to monetary</b> law? An object subject to <b>a prohibition,</b> such as a prohibited food, <b>can be nullified,</b> whereas one’s <b>money cannot be nullified.</b>
Therefore, the initial question remains: Why isn’t the small amount of salt and water in the dough, which is subject to the ritual restriction of Shabbat limits, nullified in the rest of the dough, in the manner of nullification of all other ritual prohibitions? <b>And what is the reason</b> that the water and salt are not nullified in the dough?
<b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>a decree</b> that the Sages made, <b>lest</b> a woman <b>make dough in partnership</b> with her neighbors. Indeed, in the case of the mishna, the small amount she received from her neighbor should be nullified in the dough. However, on another occasion, several friends or neighbors might decide to pool ingredients and prepare bread in partnership, in which case the bread is certainly bound by the Shabbat limits of all the parties combined. In order to prevent confusion between making dough in partnership and making it with borrowed ingredients, the Sages made a decree that the dough in both cases be subject to the same limitations.
<b>Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>Spices are made</b> in order <b>to</b> add <b>taste</b> to food, and <b>taste is not nullified,</b> even if the amount of actual substance is minute. Nullification indicates that a small amount of food may be considered insignificant and therefore null and void, but if an ingredient is added with the specific intent that its taste be noticed, there can be no nullification.

Daf 39a

<b>And Rav Ashi said</b> a different explanation as to why the spices, water, and salt are not subject to nullification: It is <b>because</b> any one of these ingredients <b>is an object whose prohibition is temporary,</b> as the prohibition against their being taken out of the Shabbat limits lapses once the Festival has passed, <b>and</b> the general principle is that <b>anything whose prohibition is temporary cannot become nullified, even</b> by one part <b>in one thousand.</b>
§ It is taught in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> one from travel limitations <b>in</b> the case of <b>water.</b> The Gemara asks: Does this mean to imply that <b>water, yes,</b> it is exempted by Rabbi Yehuda, but <b>salt, no,</b> it is not? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Water and salt are</b> both <b>nullified, whether in a dough or in a pot</b> of cooked food. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> case of the mishna, the reference is to <b>salt of Sodom,</b> which is quite coarse and does not blend in easily with the dough, and, being noticeable in the final product, is not nullified. In <b>that</b> case of the <i>baraita</i>, the reference is <b>to</b> a type of fine salt known as <b><i>isterokanit</i> salt.</b> Consequently, it is not noticeable in the final product and can be nullified.
The mishna states that according to Rabbi Yehuda water mixed into dough, and presumably into a cooked dish as well, is considered nullified. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Water and salt are nullified in dough but not in a pot, due to its sauce.</b> The pot, unlike bread, ends up with liquid in it, so the borrowed water is still recognizable. The Gemara replies: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> case of the mishna, where Rabbi Yehuda says that the water is nullified in the cooked food, is referring <b>to a thick</b> dish that has no liquid sauce. <b>That</b> case of the <i>baraita</i>, in which Rabbi Yehuda said the water is not nullified, is referring <b>to a thin</b> dish with liquid sauce.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A coal</b> that one borrowed from another on the Festival is <b>as the feet of the owner,</b> and it may be carried on the Festival to any place where its owner may walk. Since it has substance, it is associated with its owner. <b>But a flame</b> that one lit from another’s flame may be taken <b>anywhere,</b> as it has no substance. This essential difference between a coal and a flame has additional halakhic ramifications: If one uses <b>a coal of consecrated property</b> for a non-consecrated purpose, he is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, since it has substance. <b>But</b> if one uses a consecrated <b>flame,</b> although according to rabbinic law <b>one may not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, if one did benefit from it, <b>he is not</b> liable for <b>misuse,</b> since it does not have substance. Similarly, <b>one who takes out a coal</b> from a private domain <b>to the public domain</b> on Shabbat is <b>liable</b> for the prohibited labor of carrying, but one who takes out <b>a flame is exempt.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Beitza</i> 4:7): <b>Five things were stated with regard to a coal,</b> in relation to the practical halakhic differences between a coal and a flame: <b>(1) Coal is as the feet of the owner</b> with regard to its Festival resting place, <b>whereas a flame</b> may be carried <b>anywhere. (2) One</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> property consecrated to the Temple <b>with a consecrated coal, whereas</b> with regard to <b>a flame,</b> according to rabbinic law <b>one may not benefit</b> from it, <b>but he is not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> property consecrated to the Temple. <b>(3) Coal</b> used for <b>idol worship is prohibited</b> for one to benefit from it, <b>whereas</b> from <b>a flame</b> of this sort it <b>is permitted</b> to benefit. <b>(4) One who carries out a coal to the public domain is liable, whereas</b> one who carries out <b>a flame is exempt. (5) One who is prohibited by a vow</b> from deriving <b>benefit from another is prohibited from</b> using <b>his coal, but</b> he is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit <b>from his flame.</b>
With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> cited in the <i>baraita</i> above, the Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in the case of <b>a flame</b> of <b>idol worship, that</b> one is <b>permitted</b> to use it even <i>ab initio</i>, as the <i>baraita</i> uses the term permitted in that case; <b>and what is different</b> in the case of a <b>consecrated</b> flame, in <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to be used <i>ab initio</i>, as the <i>baraita</i> states: One may not benefit from it, but he is not liable for misuse? The Gemara explains: In the case of <b>idol worship, which is repulsive</b> to Jews <b>and from which</b> Jewish <b>people</b> inherently <b>maintain separation, the Sages did not decree</b> additional restrictions <b>with regard to it.</b> However, concerning <b>consecrated property, which is not repulsive and from which people do not</b> inherently <b>maintain separation,</b> in order to prevent its misuse, <b>the Sages did decree with regard to it</b> that it is prohibited to use the flame.
§ It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who carries out a coal to the public domain</b> is <b>liable, whereas</b> one who carries out <b>a flame is exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who carries out a flame of any size</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable? Rav Sheshet said:</b> The second <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one carried out</b> the flame along <b>with a wooden chip.</b> Since the flame is attached to a physical object, it is considered significant.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let it derive</b> that one is liable for carrying out in this case <b>due to</b> the <b>wooden chip,</b> and the presence of the flame is irrelevant. The Gemara responds: That <i>baraita</i> speaks of a chip <b>that does not have the</b> minimum <b>measure</b> that determines liability for carrying out, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 89b): In the case of <b>one who carries out wood</b> on Shabbat, the measure that determines liability is <b>enough</b> wood <b>to cook an egg</b> of the kind that is the <b>easiest</b> to cook, which is the egg of a chicken. Because the chip is too small to cook an egg, one is not liable for carrying it out, but one is liable for carrying out the flame attached to it.
<b>Abaye said</b> a different scenario: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where one smeared a vessel with oil, and lit a fire on it,</b> and carried out that flame. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let it derive</b> that one is liable for carrying out in this case <b>due to</b> the <b>vessel</b> itself, and the flame is irrelevant. The Gemara replies: The mishna is referring <b>to</b> a fire lit in <b>an earthenware</b> shard, not in a whole vessel.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> nevertheless, <b>let it derive</b> that one is liable for carrying <b>due to</b> the <b>earthenware</b> shard itself. The Gemara answers: It deals <b>with</b> a shard <b>that is not of</b> the minimum <b>measure</b> that determines liability for carrying out, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 82a): The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>earthenware</b> is <b>enough to place between one</b> window <b>frame and another,</b> as small shards of earthenware were sometimes placed between window frames during construction. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, if one is liable for carrying it out whenever the flame is attached to an object of substance, <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna here: <b>One who carries out a flame is exempt,</b> under <b>what circumstances</b> can this case <b>be found?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna is speaking of a case <b>where one fanned</b> the fire <b>with his hand</b> so that it spread <b>into the public domain</b> without its being attached to any vessel.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a cistern of an individual,</b> water drawn from it <b>is as the feet of the individual</b> who owns the cistern, and the water may be carried only to those places where its owner is permitted to walk. <b>And</b> water drawn from a cistern belonging jointly to all <b>the people</b> dwelling in <b>a particular town is as the feet of the people of that town. And</b> water drawn from a cistern <b>of those who come up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>from Babylonia,</b> i.e., a public cistern, is <b>as the feet of whoever fills</b> his vessel with its water; the water has no defined boundary of its own since it is made available to all.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava raised a contradiction to Rav Naḥman: We learned</b> in the mishna that the water of <b>a cistern of an individual is as the feet of the individual; and</b> Rava <b>raised a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Beitza</i> 4:8): Water drawn from <b>flowing rivers and flowing springs are as the feet of all people. Rava said: With what are we dealing here</b> in the mishna? <b>With</b> cisterns that contain <b>collected</b> water, not flowing water. <b>And it was also said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna applies only <b>to collected</b> water.
§ The mishna states: <b>And</b> water drawn from a cistern <b>of those who come up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>from Babylonia,</b> i.e., a public cistern, is <b>as the feet of whoever fills</b> his vessel with its water. <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to this issue: In the case of one who <b>filled</b> a vessel with water from a public cistern on behalf of <b>another and gave</b> the water <b>to</b> him, <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The water is <b>as the feet of the one for whom they were filled; Rav Sheshet said:</b> It is <b>as the feet of the one who filled</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>One Sage,</b> Rav Sheshet, <b>holds</b> that a public <b>cistern is ownerless,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is that one cannot take possession of ownerless property on behalf of someone else. Therefore, the water belongs to the one who drew it; it is as his feet, and this status does not change even if he subsequently gave it to anyone else. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rav Naḥman, <b>holds</b> that a public cistern <b>is</b> considered jointly owned <b>by</b> all its <b>partners,</b> namely, all of the Jewish people. Therefore, it is possible for one partner to draw water on behalf of another partner, and the drawn water immediately belongs to the person for whom it was drawn.
<b>Rava raised a challenge to Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 47b): One who says to another: <b>I am hereby</b> prohibited <b>to you</b> by force of <b><i>ḥerem</i>,</b> a kind of vow of prohibition, as objects declared as <i>ḥerem</i> are generally consecrated to the Temple, <b>the one prohibited by the vow,</b> the addressee, <b>is prohibited</b> to derive benefit from the person who made the vow or from his property, as the point of the vow was to prohibit the addressee from deriving any benefit from the one who made the vow.

Daf 39b

If he said to him: <b>You are hereby</b> prohibited <b>to me</b> by force of <b><i>ḥerem</i>, the one making the vow is</b> himself <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from the addressee or from his property. If he said to him: <b>I am hereby</b> prohibited <b>to you</b> and <b>you to me</b> by force of <i>ḥerem</i>, <b>they are both prohibited</b> to benefit <b>from one another. And they are permitted</b> to benefit from anything belonging <b>to those who come up from Babylonia,</b> i.e., public property that is not owned by any person or group, <b>but they are prohibited</b> to benefit from property that is jointly owned by the inhabitants <b>of that city,</b> as both parties have a share in such items.
That mishna provides examples: <b>And the following are items of those coming up from Babylonia,</b> i.e., publicly owned items: <b>The Temple Mount, the chambers, and the courtyards</b> on the Temple Mount, <b>and a cistern</b> situated <b>in the middle of the road. And these are</b> items jointly owned by the inhabitants <b>of that city: The street, and the synagogue, and the bathhouse.</b>
Rava, having cited the mishna in full, concludes his challenge to the opinion of Rav Naḥman: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>a cistern</b> of those who come up from Babylonia, a public cistern, <b>is</b> owned jointly <b>by partners,</b> i.e., by all Jews, <b>why</b> should it be <b>permitted</b> for the one who made the vow and the addressee to use it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 45b): Two <b>partners who took a vow</b> not to derive <b>benefit from one another are prohibited to enter</b> a joint <b>courtyard</b> in which they both have a share <b>to wash</b> themselves <b>in a cistern</b>. According to you, the same should apply to a cistern in which the two of them have a share, such as the cisterns of those who come up from Babylonia.
Rav Naḥman answered: Indeed that is the case. <b>So too,</b> they are prohibited <b>to wash</b> themselves in a cistern because when bathing one uses of all the water of the cistern, part of which belongs to the forbidden partner. <b>But</b> when the <i>baraita</i> says that a cistern of those who come up from Babylonia is permitted to both parties, <b>with what are we dealing here?</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring only <b>to filling</b> water from the cistern. This is permitted because it is considered that <b>this one fills from his</b> portion, <b>and that one fills from his</b> portion. The water that each of them draws is considered retroactively designated exclusively for him, so that the partner has no share in it at all.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rav Naḥman hold</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:7): If <b>brothers</b> divided up inherited property among themselves and subsequently joined their property again and became <b>partners, they are obligated to</b> add <b>a <i>kalbon</i>,</b> a small coin, to the obligatory half-shekel yearly Temple donation. The <i>kalbon</i> covered both the cost to the Temple of exchanging half-shekels into larger coins and the depreciation of the donated coin. Although a whole shekel given by two partners does not need to be changed into a larger coin, the Sages imposed the same <i>kalbon</i> fee on the partners as on everyone else. However, these partners <b>are exempt from</b> the <b>animal tithe,</b> in accordance with the standard <i>halakha</i> that people who own animals in partnership are exempt from the animal tithe.
The quote from the mishna continues: <b>And</b> in a situation in which the brothers are <b>liable for the animal tithe,</b> as when they have not yet divided up their inheritance, and all the deceased’s estate is therefore still considered a single unit and not a partnership, <b>they are exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that a father who contributes a single shekel for his two dependent sons does not need to add the <i>kalbon</i>.
<b>And Rav Anan said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the inherited property is no longer considered a single unit after the brothers divided it and then rejoined in a partnership <b>only when they divided kids against lambs or lambs against kids,</b> i.e., if one brother took kids and the other took a corresponding value of lambs. This kind of division is considered a commercial transaction, with one brother purchasing goats and paying for them with lambs and vice versa. Therefore, when they join their animals again as partners, it is considered an entirely new partnership.
<b>However,</b> if <b>they divided kids against kids and lambs against lambs,</b> meaning that each brother took an equal portion of each of the items they inherited, one can <b>say</b> of each brother’s portion: <b>This is his portion</b> destined to <b>reach him from the first moment,</b> from the time of the death of the deceased. If the brothers form their partnership again, the inheritance becomes a single unit again, and they are therefore obligated in the animal tithe and exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>.
<b>But Rav Naḥman said: Even if they divided kids against kids and lambs against lambs,</b> one does <b>not say</b> that <b>this is his portion</b> destined to <b>reach him from the first moment.</b> This is because Rav Naḥman does not accept the principle of retroactive designation. Consequently, the resolution proposed previously for the issue of filling water from the cistern of those who come up from Babylonia is invalid.
The Gemara retracts its previous explanation of the disagreement between Rava and Rav Naḥman: <b>Rather, everyone agrees</b> that a cistern of those who come up from Babylonia, i.e., a public cistern, <b>is an ownerless cistern, but here they disagree over</b> a different issue: <b>One who picks up a found article</b> intending to acquire it <b>on behalf of his friend.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Naḥman, <b>holds</b> that if one picks up a found object on behalf of his friend, his friend <b>acquires</b> it through this act as though he had picked it up himself. The water of the ownerless cistern is like a found object. Therefore, if one draws water on behalf of another, the latter acquires it, and consequently the water is as his feet. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Sheshet, <b>holds</b> that when one picks up a found object for another, the latter <b>does not acquire it.</b> Rather, it belongs to the one who actually picked it up, and consequently the water is as the feet of the one who draws it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who had produce in a different city</b> beyond the Shabbat limit, <b>and the residents of that city</b> where the produce was located joined the Shabbat boundaries, enabling them to reach the owner’s home on the Festival, and they wish <b>to bring him some of his produce, they may not bring</b> it <b>to him.</b> His produce is as his feet; since it is outside of his Shabbat limit, it may not be taken from its place. <b>However, if</b> the owner <b>placed an <i>eiruv</i></b> to enable travel to that city, the legal status of <b>his produce is like his</b> status with regard to the Shabbat limit. People from that city who also placed an <i>eiruv</i> may bring the produce to him, since he himself may walk to the produce and take it.

Daf 40a

With regard to <b>one who invited guests to</b> visit <b>him</b> from a town beyond his Shabbat limit, and they joined the Shabbat boundaries to enable them to reach his house, <b>they may not carry in their hands</b> back to their town any <b>portions</b> they received from him as gifts. These portions are as the feet of the host, since they belonged to him on the eve of the Festival. This is true <b>unless he transferred ownership of their portions to them on the eve of the Festival,</b> in which case the gifts may be carried wherever the recipients may walk.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>one who deposits produce with another</b> for safekeeping: In whose possession is the produce with regard to determining its place of rest over the Festival? <b>Rav said:</b> They are <b>as the feet of the one with whom they were deposited. And Shmuel said:</b> They are <b>as the feet of the</b> object’s <b>owner.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Rav and Shmuel follow their</b> usual line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If</b> one <b>brought in</b> his produce or his ox to another’s courtyard <b>with</b> his <b>permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> for any damage caused to them. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> The homeowner <b>is never liable</b> for damages, <b>unless the homeowner</b> explicitly <b>accepts upon himself</b> the responsibility <b>to watch</b> them.
<b>And Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis,</b> who disagreed with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and <b>that Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. If so, <b>let us say</b> that <b>Rav spoke</b> here <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> with the following reasoning: Just as when one gives permission to store something in his yard, that object is under his jurisdiction concerning monetary responsibility, so too, it is in his jurisdiction concerning the establishment of the Shabbat limit. <b>And Shmuel spoke</b> here <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: When a homeowner gives permission to store something in his yard, the object is not in his jurisdiction, whether with regard to monetary responsibility or with regard to the Shabbat limit.
The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I said</b> my statement in this case <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. For <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>stated</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>only there,</b> that an object brought into a courtyard is not considered in the possession of the homeowner with regard to monetary responsibility, <b>because in</b> the <b>ordinary</b> situation one who allows someone to bring items into his courtyard <b>does not accept upon himself</b> the responsibility of <b>watching</b> them. <b>But here,</b> the homeowner <b>has accepted upon himself</b> the responsibility <b>of watching</b> the produce, and consequently it is as his feet.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said: I said</b> my statement here <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>the Rabbis stated</b> their opinion <b>only there,</b> maintaining that the objects are considered in the jurisdiction of the homeowner, <b>because it is a person’s,</b> i.e., the owner’s, <b>preference that his ox</b> or other object <b>be established in the jurisdiction of the owner of the courtyard,</b> so <b>that if</b> his ox <b>does damage</b> to the homeowner’s property the owner <b>will not be liable. But here, is it a person’s preference for his produce to be in another’s jurisdiction</b> with regard to the establishment of its Shabbat limit? It is certainly inconvenient for him to have his produce out of his Shabbat limit. Consequently, the two disputes between Rav and Shmuel are not necessarily connected.
The Gemara asks concerning Rav’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>However, if</b> the owner <b>placed an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> the legal status of <b>his produce is like his</b> status. <b>And if you say</b> that deposited produce is <b>as the feet of the one with whom they were deposited,</b> even <b>if</b> the owner of the produce <b>placed an <i>eiruv</i>, what of it?</b> The produce is under the jurisdiction of the people in the other town with whom it was deposited. It should be as their feet, not as the feet of the owner. <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>the</b> Sages of the <b>school of Rav said</b> in reply to this question: The mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the keeper <b>designated a corner</b> of his house <b>for</b> the owner, thereby revealing his intention that the produce not be considered in his own jurisdiction but rather in that of the owner. Consequently, it remains as the feet of the owner.
The Gemara raises another challenge to Rav’s opinion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from the mishna: With regard to <b>one who invited guests to</b> visit <b>him, they may not carry in their hands</b> any <b>portions</b> they may have received back to their town, <b>unless he transferred ownership of their portions to them on the eve of the Festival. And if you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that deposited items are <b>as the feet of the one with whom they were deposited,</b> even <b>if he transferred ownership to them by means of another</b> person taking possession on their behalf, <b>what of it?</b> The portions are in any event deposited in the house of the host, and they should be as his feet. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too, since he transferred ownership to them by means of another</b> person, <b>it is considered as</b> a case of <b>one who designated a corner for him,</b> so that the gifts are considered in the jurisdiction of the guests and may be carried wherever they may walk.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the entire case of <b>transferring ownership is different</b> because the host’s specific intention is to transfer possession of the portions entirely to his guests. This means that the guests have certainly established the place of rest of these portions in their own jurisdiction and that the portions are as their feet.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai</b> once <b>hung meat on the bar of the door</b> of his host’s house, located outside his own town. He subsequently wondered if he was permitted to take the meat home with him, since he had made an <i>eiruv</i> enabling him to walk from his home to his host’s home. <b>He came before Rav Huna</b> to ask his opinion. Rav Huna <b>said to him: If you</b> yourself <b>hung</b> the meat, <b>go take it, but if</b> your hosts <b>hung</b> it <b>for you, you may not take it.</b>
The Gemara questions this: <b>And if he</b> himself <b>hung</b> the meat, <b>may he</b> indeed <b>take</b> it? <b>But wasn’t Rav Huna</b> a student of <b>Rav, and Rav said</b> that when an object is deposited in one’s house it is <b>as the feet of the one with whom it was deposited,</b> which in this case is the host. The Gemara responds: Here <b>it is different,</b> as Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai hung the meat on <b>the bar of the</b> host’s <b>door,</b> and this case <b>is considered similar to</b> a case of <b>one who designated a corner for him.</b> Since he was given a particular spot for the meat, it is considered his in all respects.
The Gemara raises a further objection with regard to this incident: <b>Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: And if they hung</b> the meat <b>for him, may he</b> indeed <b>not take</b> it? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say: An ox of a fattener,</b> who fattens oxen in order to sell them for meat, <b>is as the feet of all people,</b> i.e., it is as the feet of whoever buys it on the Festival. This shows that meat that is likely to be sold is not as the feet of its owner, but rather it follows the buyer, as the intention before the Festival is that it be for whoever happens to purchase it. Here too, the intention from the outset was that Rav Ḥana would take it over the course of the Festival.
Furthermore, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And if</b> the hosts <b>hung</b> the meat <b>for him, may he</b> indeed <b>not take</b> it? <b>But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> that in a town that has only one shepherd, an animal that will be given to that shepherd over the course of the Festival is as the feet of the shepherd, since it is certain that the animal will be transferred to him. Here too, since the meat was put aside for Rav Ḥana, he should be permitted to take it with him. There is a further difficulty: <b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: And if they hung</b> the meat <b>for him, may he</b> indeed <b>not take</b> it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: The status of <b>animals and vessels is as the feet of</b> their <b>owner?</b> The same should apply to meat that was hung for him; it should be as his feet.
Because of all these questions, the Gemara reinterprets the case of Rav Ḥana. <b>Rather,</b> the problem with the meat concerns a completely different matter, as the issue under consideration is not the establishment of its place of rest but the prohibition against eating meat that has been left unobserved, due to the concern that it might have been exchanged for prohibited meat. <b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai is different</b> from the average person, <b>as he is a great man and occupied with his studies, and this is what</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: If you</b> yourself <b>hung</b> it, in which case <b>you</b> noticed some recognizable <b>mark on</b> the meat <b>and your attention was not diverted from it,</b> the meat is not forbidden for having been left unobserved, and therefore you <b>may go</b> and <b>take</b> it. <b>However, if</b> the hosts <b>hung</b> it <b>for you, you</b> thereby <b>diverted your attention</b> from it, and they too did not pay careful attention to it after hanging it on your behalf. In that case, it is considered meat that has been left unobserved, <b>and you may</b> therefore <b>not take</b> it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On a Festival <b>one may not water and slaughter desert</b> animals, which graze mainly outside the town, as they are considered <i>muktze</i>. <b>However, one may water and slaughter domestic</b> animals. The mishna elaborates: <b>These are</b> considered <b>domestic</b> animals: Those <b>that sleep in the city</b> at night. <b>Desert</b> animals are those <b>that sleep in the pasture</b> and come into town only rarely.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: The mishna is coming to teach which animals are <i>muktze</i> and consequently may not be slaughtered and eaten on the Festival. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>do I</b> need the mishna <b>to say: One may water and slaughter?</b> What does watering have to do with the topic at hand? The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches us</b> a practical <b>matter incidentally: That a person should</b> first <b>water his animal and</b> only <b>afterward slaughter</b> it, <b>due to the adhesion of the skin</b> to the meat when this is not done. If one first waters the animal, it is easier to skin it after slaughtering it.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which are desert</b> animals, <b>and which are domestic ones? Desert</b> animals include <b>all those that go out</b> to pasture <b>at Passover</b> time <b>and graze in the pasture</b> day and night <b>and enter</b> the town again only <b>at the first rainfall,</b> at the start of the rainy season. <b>And these are domestic</b> animals: <b>All that go out</b> in the morning <b>and graze outside the</b> town’s <b>boundary but come and sleep within the boundary</b> at night. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Both these and those are</b> considered <b>domestic</b> animals and may be slaughtered on the Festival. <b>Rather, these are desert animals</b> that may not be slaughtered on the Festival: <b>All those that go out and graze in the pasture and do not enter the settled area, neither in the summer nor in the rainy season.</b>
The Gemara asks concerning Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion: <b>And does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in general <b>accept</b> the concept of <b><i>muktze</i>? But didn’t Rabbi Shimon, son</b> of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>inquire of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Unripe dates</b> that are placed in a basket <b>to ripen</b> until they are edible, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Yoḥai? Are they considered <i>muktze</i> or not? <b>He said to him</b> in response: <b>There is no</b> recognition of the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>muktze</i> according to Rabbi Shimon,</b>

Daf 40b

<b>except for</b> the case of <b>dried figs and raisins</b> in the midst of the drying process <b>alone. These</b> are fruits that are fit to be eaten fresh and were deliberately removed from use to allow them to undergo a drying process, during which time they are inedible; they have therefore been actively removed from one’s mind for the interim. Unripe dates, however, are unfit to be eaten fresh and become fit for eating only when they are ripe. Therefore, if one places unripe dates in a basket to ripen, they are never completely removed from his mind, not having been changed from an edible state to an inedible state, and are permitted. If so, desert animals, which are similarly never completely removed from one’s mind, should also not be considered <i>muktze</i>. Why, then, does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi indicate that they have the status of <i>muktze</i>?
The Gemara suggests several resolutions: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>these</b> desert animals <b>are also considered similar to dried figs and raisins,</b> as by sending them outside the town the owner has actively removed them from use. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the fact that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi told his son that Rabbi Shimon does not accept the <i>halakha</i> of <i>muktze</i> except for the case of dried figs and raisins does not prove anything about his own opinion; <b>he stated</b> this only <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Shimon,</b> but <b>he himself does not hold accordingly.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer: He himself, like Rabbi Shimon, did not accept the concept of <i>muktze</i>, and when he spoke in the <i>baraita</i> <b>he was speaking,</b> for the sake of argument, <b>in accordance with the words</b> of <b>the Rabbis</b> who had spoken before him, saying to them, in effect: <b>According to my</b> opinion, <b>there is no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>muktze</i></b> at all, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, and all animals may be slaughtered on the Festival. <b>But</b> even <b>according to your approach,</b> that there is a <i>halakha</i> of <i>muktze</i>, <b>agree with me, in any event,</b> that with regard to a case <b>where they go out and graze on Passover and enter again at the first rainfall, they are</b> considered <b>domestic animals</b> and should be permitted. <b>But the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> even those <b>are desert animals.</b>
