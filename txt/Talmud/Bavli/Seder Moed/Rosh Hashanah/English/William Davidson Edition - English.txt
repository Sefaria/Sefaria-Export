Rosh Hashanah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>They are four</b> days in the year that serve as the <b>New Year,</b> each for a different purpose: <b>On the first of Nisan is the New Year for kings;</b> it is from this date that the years of a king’s rule are counted. <b>And</b> the first of Nisan is also the New Year <b>for</b> the order of <b>the Festivals,</b> as it determines which is considered the first Festival of the year and which the last.
<b>On the first of Elul is the New Year for animal tithes;</b> all the animals born prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and are tithed as a single unit, whereas those born after that date belong to the next tithe year. <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The New Year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei.</b>
<b>On the first of Tishrei is the New Year for</b> counting <b>years,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara; <b>for</b> calculating <b>Sabbatical Years and Jubilee Years,</b> i.e., from the first of Tishrei there is a biblical prohibition to work the land during these years; <b>for planting,</b> for determining the years of <i>orla</i>, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden; <b>and for</b> tithing <b>vegetables,</b> as vegetables picked prior to that date cannot be tithed together with vegetables picked after that date.
<b>On the first of Shevat is the New Year for the tree;</b> the fruit of a tree that was formed prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and cannot be tithed together with fruit that was formed after that date; this ruling is <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai.</b> But <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> The New Year for trees is <b>on the fifteenth of</b> Shevat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The New Year <b>for kings; with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is it mentioned in the mishna? Why is it necessary to set a specific date to count the years of a king’s rule, rather than counting them from the day that he ascends to the throne? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>for</b> determining the validity of <b>documents.</b>
It was the common practice to date documents in accordance with the years of the king’s rule; therefore, it was important that these years begin at a fixed time, so that one knows whether a particular document was antedated or postdated, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Antedated promissory notes,</b> i.e., promissory notes dated prior to the date on which the loan actually took place, <b>are invalid</b> because a loan document creates a lien on the borrower’s property. By dating the document earlier than the loan itself, the lender has a fraudulent mortgage on the property, which can be used against any future purchaser. Therefore, the Sages ordained that an antedated promissory note does not establish a lien, even from the true date of the loan. <b>But postdated</b> promissory notes bearing a date that is later than the date when the loan actually took place <b>are valid,</b> as postdating the note presents no opportunity for defrauding a purchaser.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a king ascended</b> to the throne <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar,</b> the month preceding Nisan, <b>once the first of Nisan arrives,</b> although he reigned for only one day, <b>a year is counted toward his</b> reign; his first year of rule is completed from the first of Nisan. <b>But if he ascended</b> to the throne <b>only on the first of Nisan,</b> one <b>counts</b> an additional <b>year toward his</b> reign <b>only</b> when <b>the next Nisan arrives.</b>
<b>The Master said,</b> citing the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a king ascended</b> to the throne <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar, once the first of Nisan arrives a year is counted toward his</b> reign. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b>

Daf 2b

<b>teaches us that Nisan is the New Year for kings, and</b> it also teaches us that <b>one day in a year is considered a year;</b> although this king ruled for only one day, a full year is counted toward his reign. The Gemara asks: Consider the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if he ascended</b> to the throne <b>only on the first of Nisan, a year is not counted toward his</b> reign <b>until the next</b> first of <b>Nisan arrives.</b> Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the princes agreed to <b>appoint him</b> as king already <b>in</b> the month of <b>Adar. Lest you say</b> that since the decision to appoint him king was made already in Adar, once the first of Nisan arrives they <b>should count</b> it <b>the second year of his</b> reign, therefore the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the count begins only from when he actually began his rule.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the king <b>died in</b> the month of <b>Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him</b> to the throne <b>in</b> that same <b>Adar, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> i.e., the previous king, as his final year, <b>and to that one,</b> i.e., the new king who began his reign in Adar. If the first king <b>died in</b> the month of <b>Nisan and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in</b> that same <b>Nisan, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> the previous king, <b>and to that one,</b> the new king. But if the first king <b>died in Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in Nisan, one counts the first year to the first</b> king as his final year, <b>and the second</b> year <b>to the second</b> king as the first year of his reign.
<b>The Master said:</b> If the king <b>died in Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him</b> to the throne <b>in</b> that same <b>Adar, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> i.e., the previous king, as his final year, <b>and to that one,</b> i.e., the new king, as the first year of his reign. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one year cannot be counted toward two</b> kings, and so the entire year should be counted only toward the previous king, the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the years of two kings can overlap and be counted in a single year.
The Gemara cites the next phrase of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the first king <b>died in Nisan and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in</b> that same <b>Nisan, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> the previous king, <b>and to that one,</b> the new king. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>when we say</b> that <b>one day in a year is considered</b> a full <b>year,</b> this only applies when the day is <b>at the end of the year,</b> i.e., since his reign will continue in the coming year the day is considered like a whole year, <b>but</b> if the day is <b>at the beginning of the year we should not say</b> that the beginning of Nisan is counted as another year for the previous king; therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that there is no such a distinction.
It was further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: But if the first king <b>died in Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in Nisan, one counts the first</b> year <b>to the first</b> king as his final year, <b>and the second</b> year <b>to the second king</b> as the first year of his reign. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the princes decided to <b>appoint him</b> as king <b>in Adar, and he is</b> also <b>a king, son of</b> the previous <b>king,</b> so that his succession to the throne is automatic. <b>Lest you say</b> that by the time the first of Nisan arrives, <b>two years should be counted toward his</b> reign, <b>it</b> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one counts only from Nisan, when he actually succeeded his father to the throne.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one counts</b> the years of kings’ reigns <b>only from Nisan? As it is stated: “And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month,</b> that he began to build the house of the Lord” (I Kings 6:1). This verse <b>juxtaposes the reign of Solomon to the exodus from Egypt: Just as</b> one counts the years since <b>the exodus from Egypt from Nisan,</b> when the Jewish people left Egypt, <b>so too,</b> one counts the years of <b>Solomon’s reign from Nisan.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we count</b> the years from <b>the exodus from Egypt themselves from Nisan? Perhaps we count</b> them <b>from Tishrei.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month”</b> (Numbers 33:38), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke</b> to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3). <b>From the fact that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of</b> the month of <b>Av,</b> which is the fifth month, <b>it calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Shevat, it</b> also <b>calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” the implication is</b> that the <b>New Year</b> does <b>not</b> begin in <b>Tishrei.</b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Tishrei, Av and the following Shevat would not be in the same year because the year would have changed in Tishrei.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Granted,</b> in <b>this</b> case of Aaron’s death it is <b>explicitly stated that</b> the year is counted <b>from the exodus from Egypt,</b> as it states: “In the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt.” <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> other incident of Moses’ oration, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the year is counted <b>from the exodus from Egypt? Perhaps</b> it is forty years <b>since the establishment of the Tabernacle</b> in the wilderness.
The Gemara answers: <b>In accordance with</b> what <b>Rav Pappa said</b> in a different context, that the meaning of one instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year”</b> may be inferred from another instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year” by way of a verbal analogy, here too,</b> the meaning of one instance of the expression <b>“the fortieth year”</b> may be inferred from another instance of the expression <b>“the fortieth year” by way of a verbal analogy: Just as here,</b> with regard to Aaron’s death, the count is <b>from the exodus from Egypt, so too, here,</b> with regard to Moses’ oration, although this is not stated explicitly, the count is <b>from the exodus from Egypt.</b>
The Gemara raises another question: Even if this serves as proof that these two events both took place in the fortieth year from the exodus from Egypt, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that the incident of</b> Aaron’s death in <b>Av</b> took place <b>first? Perhaps the incident of</b> Moses’ oration in <b>Shevat</b> took place <b>first,</b> in which case it is possible that the years from the Exodus are counted not from Nisan, but from Tishrei.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> that Moses delivered his oration <b>“after he had slain Sihon”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:4), <b>and when Aaron died Sihon was still alive, as it is written:</b>

Daf 3a

<b>“And when the Canaanite, the king of Arad,</b> who dwelt in the South, <b>heard</b> tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel” (Numbers 21:1). <b>What report did he hear? He heard that Aaron had died, and that the clouds of glory had withdrawn</b> from the Jewish people, <b>and he thought</b> that <b>he had been granted permission to wage war against the Jewish people. And this is as it is written: “And all the congregation saw that [<i>ki</i>] Aaron was dead,</b> and they wept for Aaron thirty days, all the house of Israel” (Numbers 20:29).
About this, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Do not read</b> the verse as: <b>“And they saw [<i>vayiru</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>“And they were seen [<i>vayeira’u</i>]”</b> by others, because the cover of the clouds of glory had been removed from them. <b>And</b> the next word, “that [<i>ki</i>],” should be understood as meaning because, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said:</b> The word <b><i>ki</i> is used</b> in the Bible <b>in four senses: If, perhaps, but, and because.</b> Therefore, the verse should be understood as follows: And all the congregation was seen, i.e., revealed, because Aaron had died. This shows that at the time of Aaron’s death Sihon was still alive; perforce, Moses’ oration, which was delivered after he had slain Sihon, must have occurred later.
The Gemara raises an objection against this proof: <b>Is it comparable? There,</b> the verse is speaking of <b>Canaan,</b> king of Arad, whereas <b>here,</b> the verse is speaking of <b>Sihon.</b> What proof, then, can be brought from the one with regard to the other? The Gemara explains: A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: All three names are referring to the same person: <b>He is Sihon,</b> and <b>he is Arad,</b> and <b>he is</b> also <b>Canaan.</b> He was called <b>Sihon because he was similar</b> in his wildness <b>to a foal [<i>seyyaḥ</i>] in the desert;</b> and he was called <b>Canaan after his kingdom,</b> as he ruled over the Canaanite people; <b>and what was his</b> real <b>name? Arad was his name. Some say</b> an alternative explanation: He was called <b>Arad because he was similar to a wild ass [<i>arod</i>] in the desert;</b> and he was called <b>Canaan after his kingdom; and what was his</b> real <b>name? Sihon was his name.</b>
The Gemara raises another question: Granted, when counting the years from the exodus from Egypt, Av and the following Shevat are both part of the same year, but it has not been established that the counting of years from the Exodus is specifically from Nisan. <b>Say</b> that the <b>New Year</b> for this purpose <b>is</b> in the following month, the month of <b>Iyyar.</b>
The Gemara rejects this proposal: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was established”</b> (Exodus 40:17), <b>and it is written: “And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month,</b> on the twentieth day of the month, <b>that the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle of the testimony”</b> (Numbers 10:11). It may be argued as follows: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of Nisan,</b> which is the first month, <b>it calls it “the second year,” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Iyyar,</b> which is the second month, <b>it</b> also <b>calls it “the second year,” by inference, Rosh HaShana is not</b> at the beginning of <b>Iyyar.</b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Iyyar, Nisan and the following Iyyar would not occur in the same year, as the year would have changed in Iyyar.
The Gemara asks further: <b>And say</b> that the <b>New Year</b> for this purpose <b>is</b> in the third month, the month of <b>Sivan.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “In the third month, after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt,</b> the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai” (Exodus 19:1). <b>And if it is so</b> that the New Year is the beginning of Sivan, the verse <b>should have</b> said: <b>In the third month, in the second year after</b> the children of Israel <b>had gone out</b> of the land of Egypt, as a new year had started.
The Gemara continues: <b>But</b> perhaps one could <b>say</b> that the New Year for counting the Exodus is in the fourth month, the month of <b>Tammuz; or say</b> that it is in the fifth month, the month of <b>Av; or say</b> that it is in the twelfth month, the month of <b>Adar.</b> There is no clear refutation that these months are not the New Year.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It is <b>from here</b> that it is derived that the years of a king’s rule are counted from Nisan, as it is stated: <b>“And he began to build in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign”</b> (II Chronicles 3:2). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the words <b>“the second”? Doesn’t it</b> mean <b>second to the month from which</b> Solomon’s <b>reign is counted?</b> This is clear proof that the years of a king’s rule are counted from the first month, i.e., the month of Nisan.
<b>Ravina strongly objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the words “the second” are referring to <b>the second</b> day <b>of the month?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so, it should have explicitly stated: “On the second of the month,”</b> as that is the formulation usually used in the Bible to refer to a specific day of the month.
The Gemara raises another objection: Why not <b>say</b> that the words “the second” are referring to the second day <b>of the week?</b> This argument is rejected for two reasons: <b>First, we have not found the second</b> day <b>of the week</b> ever being <b>written;</b> nowhere does the Bible give the day of the week on which a particular event transpired. <b>And further,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes the second</b> instance of the word <b>“second” to the first</b> instance of the word <b>“second”: Just as the first “second”</b> is referring to <b>a month, so too, the latter “second”</b> is referring to <b>a month.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one counts</b> the years of <b>kings’</b> reigns <b>only from</b> the month of <b>Nisan? As it is stated: “And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,</b> in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord” (I Kings 6:1). <b>And it is written: “And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord,</b> and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month” (Numbers 33:38). <b>And it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,</b> on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3).
<b>And it is written: “After he had slain Sihon,</b> the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon” (Deuteronomy 1:4). <b>And it says: “And when the Canaanite,</b> the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, <b>heard”</b> (Numbers 33:40). <b>And it says: “And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead,</b> and they wept for Aaron thirty days” (Numbers 20:29). <b>And it says: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year,</b> on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was established” (Exodus 40:17).
<b>And it says: “And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month,</b> on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the Tabernacle of the testimony” (Numbers 10:11). <b>And it says: “In the third month, after the children of Israel had gone out</b> of the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai” (Exodus 19:1). <b>And it says: “And he began to build</b> in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign” (II Chronicles 3:2). This list of verses summarizes Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said: They taught</b> that the years of a king’s rule are counted from the first of Nisan <b>only with regard to the</b> Jewish <b>kings of Israel, but</b> the years of <b>the kings of the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world are counted from Tishrei, as it is stated: “The words of Nehemiah, son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Kislev, in the twentieth year,</b> as I was in Shushan the capital” (Nehemiah 1:1). <b>And it is written: “And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes</b> the king, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king” (Nehemiah 2:1).
<b>From</b> the fact <b>that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of</b> the month of <b>Kislev it calls it the twentieth year, and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Nisan it</b> also <b>calls it the twentieth year, by inference,</b> the <b>New Year</b> for gentile kings <b>does not</b> begin in <b>Nisan.</b> Were it the case that the New Year did begin in Nisan, Kislev and the following Nisan would not occur in the same year.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Granted,</b> in <b>this</b> second verse <b>it is explicitly stated</b> that the count relates to the years <b>of Artaxerxes. But</b> as for <b>that</b> first verse, <b>from where</b> is it known that the count relates to the years <b>of Artaxerxes? Perhaps</b>

Daf 3b

<b>it</b> follows some <b>other count. Rav Pappa said:</b> The meaning of the first instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year”</b> may be inferred from the second instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year” by way of a verbal analogy: Just as there</b> the reference is to the twentieth year <b>of Artaxerxes, so too, here</b> the reference is to the twentieth year <b>of Artaxerxes.</b>
The Gemara raises another question: Even though those two events took place in the same year, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that the incident</b> that occurred <b>in Kislev took place first? Perhaps the incident</b> that occurred <b>in Nisan took place first,</b> in which case it is possible that even the years of gentile kings are counted from Nisan.
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The words that Hanani told Nehemiah in</b> the month of <b>Kislev, Nehemiah told the king in</b> the month of <b>Nisan.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>The words that Hanani said to</b> Nehemiah <b>in Kislev</b> are <b>as it is stated: “The words of Nehemiah, son of Hachaliah: And it came to pass in the month Kislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the capital, that Hanani, one of my brothers, came out of Judah, he and certain men; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said to me: The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province suffer much hardship and insult; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire”</b> (Nehemiah 1:1–3).
<b>Nehemiah told these</b> words <b>to the king in Nisan, as it is stated: “And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence. And the king said to me: Why is your face sad, seeing that you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of the heart. Then I was very much afraid, and I said to the king: Let the king live forever: Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of the tombs of my ancestors, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?”</b> (Nehemiah 2:1–3).
<b>“Then the king said to me: For what do you ask? So I prayed to the God of heaven. And I said to the king: If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judea, to the city of the graves of my ancestors, that I may rebuild it. And the king said to me, the consort also sitting by him: For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time”</b> (Nehemiah 2:4–6).
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> against the rule established by Rav Ḥisda that the years of gentile kings are counted from Tishrei from the verse that states: <b>“On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king”</b> (Haggai 1:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“In the seventh month, in the second year, on the twenty-first day of the month,</b> the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai, saying” (Haggai 2:1). <b>And if it were so</b> that the years of gentile kings are counted from Tishrei, <b>what</b> the verse <b>needed</b> to state is: <b>In the seventh month in the third year,</b> as a new year had already started for him.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in answer to this objection: <b>Cyrus was a virtuous king,</b> and <b>consequently</b> Haggai <b>counted</b> the years <b>of his</b> reign <b>like</b> those of <b>the kings of Israel,</b> i.e., from Nisan.
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> explanation for two reasons: <b>One</b> objection is <b>that if</b> this is <b>so, the verses contradict each other, as it is written: “And this house was finished on the third of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king”</b> (Ezra 6:15), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At that same time in the following year Ezra went up from Babylonia together with his</b> company of <b>exiles. And it is written</b> in the Bible: <b>“And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king”</b> (Ezra 7:8). <b>And if it were so</b> that this king’s years were counted like those of the kings of Israel, <b>what</b> the verse <b>needed</b> to state is: Which was in <b>the eighth year</b> of the king.
<b>And further,</b> a second objection: <b>Are</b> Rav Yosef’s objection and Rabbi Abbahu’s resolution <b>comparable? There,</b> Rabbi Abbahu speaks of <b>Cyrus,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> the verses speak of <b>Darius,</b> and it was never said about Darius that he was a virtuous king. The Gemara explains: This is not difficult, as the Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: All three names are referring to the same person: <b>He is Cyrus; he is Darius;</b> and <b>he is</b> also <b>Artaxerxes.</b> He was called <b>Cyrus [<i>Koresh</i>] because he was a virtuous [<i>kasher</i>] king;</b> he was called <b>Artaxerxes after his kingdom,</b> i.e., this was his royal title; <b>and what was his</b> real <b>name? Darius was his name.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>In any case, it is difficult,</b> as in one place his years are counted from Nisan, whereas in another place they are counted from Tishrei. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as it can be explained as follows: <b>Here,</b> where his years are counted from Nisan like the kings of Israel, it speaks of him <b>before he became corrupt,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> where his years are counted from Tishrei, it speaks of him <b>after he became corrupt.</b>
<b>Rav Kahana strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Did he</b> really <b>become corrupt</b> after Ezra went to Eretz Yisrael? <b>But isn’t it written:</b>

Daf 4a

<b>“And that which they need, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail”</b> (Ezra 6:9)? Doesn’t Cyrus’ contribution to the Temple demonstrate his fear of Heaven? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>My teacher,</b> a refutation can be brought <b>from your</b> own <b>burden,</b> from the text you yourself cited, as the next verse continues: <b>“That they may sacrifice offerings of sweet savor to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons”</b> (Ezra 6:10). This shows that Cyrus did this solely for his own benefit, so that the Jews would sacrifice offerings and pray for him and his sons.
The Gemara asks: <b>And one who acts in this manner, is</b> he <b>not</b> acting in <b>exemplary</b> fashion? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one gives charity, saying: I give <b>this <i>sela</i> for charity in order that my children may live, or:</b> I give it <b>in order that through it I may merit life in the World-to-Come, he is</b> still considered <b>a full-fledged righteous person?</b> If so, what was wrong with the king bringing offerings so that the Jews would pray for his life and the life of his children?
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the case of one who makes his charity conditional yet is considered to be righteous, it is referring <b>to a Jew.</b> This is because even if his condition is not fulfilled, he will not complain to God. However, <b>there,</b> where Cyrus was not given credit for his good deed because it was conditional, it is referring <b>to gentiles.</b> A gentile may come to regret his actions and complain to God if his condition is not fulfilled.
<b>And if you wish, say: From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Cyrus <b>became corrupt? As it is written</b> with regard to the building of the Temple that he issued the following command: “Let the house be built…<b>with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber, and let the expense be paid out of the king’s house”</b> (Ezra 6:4). <b>Why did he do it</b> in <b>this</b> manner and command that the Temple be built with a row of timber? <b>He thought: If the Jews rebel against me, I will burn</b> their Temple <b>with fire,</b> and it will be more flammable because of the wood.
The Gemara raises a question: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Solomon did not do this</b> very same thing when he built the first Temple? <b>Isn’t it written:</b> “And he built the inner court, <b>three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams”</b> (I Kings 6:36)? The Gemara answers: <b>Solomon placed</b> the wood <b>above</b> the stone foundation, so that even if the Temple were burned, the stone foundation would remain, <b>whereas</b> Cyrus <b>placed</b> it <b>below,</b> so that if he were to set fire to the Temple, the whole structure would collapse. Also, <b>Solomon sunk</b> the wood <b>into the building</b> in order to make it less flammable, whereas Cyrus <b>did not sink it into the building.</b> Furthermore, <b>Solomon plastered</b> the wood over <b>with plaster</b> to prevent it from catching fire, <b>whereas</b> Cyrus <b>did not plaster</b> the wood over <b>with plaster.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> who said: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Cyrus <b>became corrupt? From here,</b> as it is written: <b>“And the king said to me, the consort [<i>shegal</i>] also sitting by him:</b> For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a time” (Nehemiah 2:6). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b><i>shegal</i></b> in the verse? <b>Rabba bar Lima said in the name of Rav:</b> It means <b>a she-dog</b> that sat next to him, which he used for sexual relations.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> there is a contradiction from <b>that which is written</b> about Belshazzar: <b>“But you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you, and your lords, your consorts [<i>shegal</i>] and your concubines, have drunk wine in them”</b> (Daniel 5:23). <b>If <i>shegal</i></b> means <b>a she-dog, does a she-dog drink wine?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult, as</b> perhaps <b>they trained it to drink</b> wine.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> there is a contradiction from that <b>which is written: “Kings’ daughters are among your favorites; upon your right hand stands a consort [<i>shegal</i>] in gold of Ophir”</b> (Psalms 45:10). <b>Now, if <i>shegal</i> is a she-dog, what is the prophet heralding for the Jewish people?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> the prophet <b>is saying: In reward for the Torah being as precious to the Jews as a she-dog is to gentiles, you merited the gold of Ophir.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say: Actually,</b> the word <b><i>shegal</i></b> in all these other contexts means <b>consort, but Rabba bar Lima had a tradition</b> that in connection with Cyrus the word <i>shegal</i> means she-dog. <b>And why was it called a consort [<i>shegal</i>]?</b> It is <b>because</b> the dog <b>was as precious to him as a consort; or else, because he set</b> the dog next to him <b>in place of a consort.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say: From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Cyrus <b>became corrupt?</b> It is <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Up to a hundred talents of silver, and up to a hundred measures of wheat, and up to a hundred <i>bat</i> of wine, and up to a hundred <i>bat</i> of oil, and salt without prescribed limit”</b> (Ezra 7:22). <b>Initially</b> he gave <b>without</b> setting <b>a limit, but now</b> he introduced <b>a limit.</b>
This is rejected: <b>But perhaps initially he did not know what limit</b> to set, as he was not familiar with the daily needs of the Temple, and afterward, when the matter became clarified, he set an appropriate limit. <b>Rather, it is clear as we initially answered</b> that the evidence that Cyrus became corrupt is based on his relationship with his consort rather than on his donations to the Temple.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the first of Nisan is also the New Year <b>for</b> the order of <b>the Festivals.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> the New Year for the <b>Festivals</b> really <b>on the first of Nisan?</b> Isn’t <b>it on the fifteenth of Nisan,</b> the first day of the festival of Passover? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> What the mishna means is that <b>the Festival that</b> occurs <b>in</b> the month of Nisan <b>is the New Year for Festivals.</b>
The Gemara comments: This ruling makes <b>a practical difference to one who makes a vow,</b> in order <b>to determine when he is liable for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay. And</b> the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whether one makes a vow</b> to bring an offering to the Temple, <b>or consecrates</b> an item to the Temple, <b>or makes a valuation,</b> promising to pay the value of a particular person to the Temple treasury, <b>once three Festivals have passed</b> from that day and he has not yet fulfilled his promise, <b>he transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> as stated in the verse: “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay paying it” (Deuteronomy 23:22).
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One transgresses the prohibition against delaying not when any three Festivals have passed, but when <b>three Festivals</b> have passed <b>in their</b> proper <b>order,</b> i.e., Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, and <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>with Passover first. And, so too, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai would say: The Festivals</b> that must pass before a person is liable for violating the prohibition against delaying <b>are sometimes three, sometimes four,</b> and <b>sometimes five. How so? If one made his vow before Passover</b> they are <b>three,</b> as he may delay bringing his offering until the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>; if he made his vow <b>before <i>Shavuot</i></b> they are <b>five,</b> as the counting of three Festivals begins only from the next Passover; and if he made his vow <b>before the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, they are <b>four.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>those who are liable for</b> vows of <b>monetary</b> payment, <b>or for</b> vows of <b>valuations,</b> or <b>for dedications, or for consecrations, sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, burnt-offerings, peace-offerings,</b> vows of <b>charity, tithes, firstborn</b> offerings, animal <b>tithes, or the Paschal offering,</b>

Daf 4b

or for <b>gleanings, forgotten sheaves, or</b> produce of the <b>corner</b> of the field, three obligatory agricultural gifts that must be given to the poor, <b>once three Festivals have passed they transgress</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> These <b>three Festivals must be in their</b> proper <b>order, with the festival of Passover first.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says: Once</b> even <b>one Festival has passed, one transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Once two Festivals have passed, one transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Once the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> has passed, one transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay.</b>
The Gemara proceeds to explain the various opinions: <b>What is the rationale of the first <i>tanna</i>? Since</b> the entire chapter (Deuteronomy, chapter 16) <b>has just concluded</b> a discussion of the three pilgrimage Festivals, <b>why,</b> after stating: “Three times a year shall all your males appear before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 16:16), <b>do I</b> need the Torah to <b>write again: “On the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>;</b> and they shall not appear before the Lord empty-handed” (Deuteronomy 16:16)? Rather, <b>learn from here</b> that the verse comes to teach with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>You shall not delay,</b> that one does not transgress the prohibition unless these three Festivals have passed.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon,</b> who said that one does not transgress the prohibition against delaying unless these three Festivals have passed in order, <b>says</b> in explanation of his opinion: <b>It was not necessary</b> for the verse <b>to say</b> again <b>“on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,” of which the</b> immediately preceding <b>text was speaking. Why,</b> then, <b>is it stated?</b> It is <b>to teach that this must be the last one,</b> i.e., that the three Festivals must pass in order, so that <i>Sukkot</i> is the last of the three.
<b>And Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying as soon as one Festival has passed, <b>what is the rationale</b> for his opinion? It is <b>as it is written:</b> “But to the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, there shall you seek Him, at his dwelling, <b>and there shall you come: And there you shall bring</b> your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your gift offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and your flocks” (Deuteronomy 12:5–6). This teaches that one transgresses the prohibition if he fails to bring the offerings for which he is liable as soon as the time has arrived that “there shall you come,” i.e., by the first Festival.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who say that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only after three Festivals have passed, how do they understand this verse? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>this</b> verse teaches that there is <b>a positive mitzva</b> to bring one’s vow-offerings on the first Festival; however, if one did not bring them, he has not transgressed the prohibition against delaying, although he has failed to perform the positive mitzva.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> counter this argument? The Gemara answers: He would say that <b>since the Merciful One tells one to bring</b> the offering at that time <b>and he did not bring</b> it, <b>automatically he is liable for</b> transgressing the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> as he has missed the time set by the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> who said that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying once two Festivals have passed, <b>what is the rationale</b> for his opinion? The Gemara explains: It is <b>as it is written: “These things you shall do to the Lord in your appointed times,</b> besides your vows, and your gift offerings, for your burnt-offerings, and for your meal-offerings, and for your drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings” (Numbers 29:39). According to this verse, the time set for the bringing of vows is at the “appointed times,” and <b>the minimum</b> number <b>of appointed times</b> in the plural <b>is two.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> understand this verse? The Gemara explains: They say that the term “appointed times” is needed <b>for</b> the teaching of <b>Rabbi Yona, as Rabbi Yona said: All the Festivals are equated with each other,</b> insofar as all the goats brought as sin-offerings on the Festivals <b>atone for the impurity of the Temple and its sacred objects,</b> just like the goat brought as a sin-offering on the New Moon.
The Gemara asks further: <b>And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that once the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> has passed one immediately transgresses the prohibition against delaying, <b>what is the rationale</b> for his opinion? The Gemara explains: It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: It was not necessary for</b> the verse <b>to mention “the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:16), <b>of which the</b> immediately preceding <b>text was speaking.</b> If so, <b>why is it stated?</b> It is <b>to say that this</b> Festival is what <b>causes</b> one to be considered late in fulfilling his vow, since by the end of the Festival he must bring all of his current vows to the Temple, whether he took his vow shortly before <i>Sukkot</i> or much earlier.
<b>And Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, what do they expound</b> from <b>this</b> verse: <b>“On the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>They require</b> this verse <b>for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rabbi Elazar</b> said that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said, as Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the <i>Shavuot</i></b> offering <b>has redress all seven</b> days, i.e., that if one failed to bring the Festival peace-offering on the Festival itself, he has six more days to bring it? <b>The verse states: “On the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,”</b> thereby <b>equating the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> to the festival of Passover. Just as the festival of Passover has redress all seven</b> days, as Passover is seven days long, <b>so too, the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> has redress all seven</b> days, during the week following the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>draw an analogy</b> from the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,</b> which is also mentioned in close proximity to it, and say: <b>Just as below,</b> on <i>Sukkot</i>, the offering may be brought for <b>eight</b> days, <b>so too, here,</b> on <i>Shavuot</i>, it should be possible to bring the offering for <b>eight</b> days. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This is not so, as even on <i>Sukkot</i> the Festival peace-offering may be brought only for seven days, as <b>the eighth</b> day <b>is</b> a separate <b>Festival in and of itself.</b>
The Gemara raises a question: But <b>can’t you say that we say</b> that <b>the Eighth</b> Day of Assembly <b>is a Festival in and of itself</b> only <b>with regard to <i>peh</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>beit</i>,</b> an acronym that stands for six unique aspects to the Eighth Day of Assembly. <b>But with regard to the matter of redress</b> for failing to bring a Festival peace-offering, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the Eighth Day of Assembly is still a day of <b>redress for the first day</b> of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If one did not bring</b> his <b>Festival peace-offering on the first day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>he may</b> still <b>bring</b> the <b>Festival peace-offering during all of the Festival and</b> even on <b>the last day of the Festival,</b> as the Eighth Day of Assembly is regarded as part of <i>Sukkot</i> for this purpose. If so, perhaps the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> can be compared to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> such that the Festival peace-offering of <i>Shavuot</i> may also be brought for eight days.
The Gemara answers: It is preferable to equate <i>Shavuot</i> to Passover and not to <i>Sukkot</i> due to the general principle: <b>If you grasped many, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped few, you grasped something.</b> That is to say, in a case of doubt, choose the smaller number, as it is included within the larger number.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write the festival of <i>Sukkot</i></b> in this verse? The Gemara explains: It is <b>to draw an analogy</b> from <i>Sukkot</i> <b>to the festival of Passover</b> with regard to a different issue:

Daf 5a

<b>Just as the festival of Passover requires remaining</b> overnight in Jerusalem, and only on the following day may one return home, <b>so too, the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> requires remaining overnight</b> in Jerusalem before returning home.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to Passover, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>As it is written</b> about the Paschal offering: “And you shall roast and eat it in the place which the Lord your God shall choose; <b>and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7).
The Gemara asks: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>and Rabbi Shimon,</b> who learn from the verse: “On the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:16), that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only after three Festivals have passed, <b>from where do they</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the <i>Shavuot</i></b> offering <b>has redress</b> for seven days?
The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> that <b>which Rabba bar Shmuel taught, as Rabba bar Shmuel taught: The Torah states to count</b> the <b>days,</b> as it is stated: “A month of days” (Numbers 11:20), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> a new <b>month</b> with offerings. <b>And</b> the Torah also said to <b>count</b> the <b>days</b> from Passover, as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> with offerings. <b>Just as the</b> new <b>month is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one day, <b>so too, <i>Shavuot</i> is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one full week, as it is stated: “Seven complete weeks shall there be” (Leviticus 23:15).
The Gemara asks: But if so, <b>say</b> that the <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> offering may be redressed for only <b>one day,</b> as <i>Shavuot</i> is determined by a count of fifty days from Passover. How, then, is it known that the <i>Shavuot</i> offering has seven days for redress? <b>Rava said: Is that to say</b> that <b>we count</b> only <b>days until <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> but <b>we do not</b> also <b>count weeks? But didn’t the Master say:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to count</b> fifty <b>days, and</b> it is also <b>a mitzva to count</b> seven <b>weeks,</b> which teaches that the Festival peace-offering brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> may be sacrificed for an entire week. <b>And further, it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“The festival of weeks [<i>Shavuot</i>],”</b> which teaches that it is a Festival that is established through a count of weeks.
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> that one becomes liable for transgressing the prohibition against delaying if he delays bringing the Paschal lamb. The Gemara expresses its astonishment about this ruling: <b>But is the Paschal lamb fit to be sacrificed on the</b> other <b>Festivals? The Paschal lamb has a fixed time</b> to be brought, on the fourteenth of Nisan; <b>if one sacrificed it</b> then, <b>he has sacrificed it, but if he did not sacrifice it</b> then, <b>it is excluded</b> forever from any use.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: The Paschal lamb is cited</b> here <b>for no reason [<i>kedi</i>];</b> that is to say, the prohibition against delaying is not relevant to the Paschal lamb, and the latter was mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> only because firstborn offerings, animal tithes, and the Paschal lamb are often grouped together.
<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> a different explanation: <b>What is</b> meant here by <b>a Paschal lamb?</b> It is <b>the peace-offering</b> that is brought <b>in place of a Paschal lamb.</b> If a lamb that had been set aside to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering was lost, and its owner took another lamb and sacrificed that as his Paschal lamb, and afterward the first animal was found, it must now be brought as a peace-offering. This offering is subject to all the <i>halakhot</i> of the prohibition against delaying.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the <b>peace-offerings</b> listed earlier, and it is still redundant. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>peace-offerings brought in place of a Paschal lamb, and it</b> also <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>peace-offerings brought independently.</b> The reason for this repetition is that <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since</b> the peace-offerings <b>are brought in place of a Paschal lamb,</b>

Daf 5b

<b>they are considered like the Paschal lamb</b> itself, and so one transgresses the prohibition against delaying as soon as one Festival has passed. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, as even this type of peace-offering is treated like the other offerings, and there is no liability until three Festivals have passed.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters derived</b> that all the offerings and vows listed above in the <i>baraita</i> are subject to the prohibition against delaying? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“When you shall vow a vow</b> to the Lord your God, you shall not delay paying it; for the Lord your God will surely require it from you, and it would be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). From the words “when you shall vow a vow,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a vow-</b>offering, where one says: I undertake to bring an offering, thereby assuming personal responsibility to bring an offering, no matter what happens to any particular animal. But as for the case of <b>a gift-offering,</b> one says: I undertake to bring this animal as an offering. He assumes responsibility only to bring that particular animal, without assuming a general responsibility to bring an offering. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this, too, is included in the prohibition against delaying?
The Gemara now analyzes the words of Deuteronomy 23:22 cited above and looks at each component. <b>It is stated here: “Vow,” and it is stated elsewhere: “But if</b> the sacrifice of his offering be <b>a vow or a gift-offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:16). <b>Just as there a gift-offering is</b> together <b>with</b> the vow and is governed by the same <i>halakha</i>, <b>so too, here, a gift-offering is</b> together with the vow and is governed by the same <i>halakha</i>.
The verse continues: <b>“To the Lord your God.” This</b> is referring to various types of consecrations that are allocated to Temple maintenance: <b>Assessments, valuations, dedications, and consecrations. “You shall not delay paying it”</b> teaches that one violates the prohibition against delaying if he is late in paying <b>it, but not</b> if he is late in paying <b>its substitute,</b> as will be explained below. <b>“For</b> the Lord your God <b>will surely require it</b> from you” comes to include all other things that one is required to bring; <b>these are sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.</b>
The words in the verse: “For <b>the Lord your God”</b> are an apparently superfluous phrase that in fact comes to include additional things in the prohibition; <b>these are</b> vows of <b>charity, and tithes, and firstborn</b> offerings. <b>“From you”; this</b> comes to include other items that one gives of one’s own for the sake of a mitzva, i.e., <b>gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and</b> produce of the <b>corner</b> of the field. <b>“And it would be sin in you”;</b> this teaches that the sin of delaying would be in you, <b>but there would be no sin in your offering,</b> i.e., the offering is not disqualified due to the delay.
The Gemara clarifies certain points in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said,</b> citing the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not delay paying it”</b> teaches that one violates the prohibition if he is late in paying <b>it,</b> i.e., the original offering, <b>but not</b> if he is late in paying <b>its substitute,</b> i.e., an animal that substituted for his offering. The Gemara asks: <b>A substitute for what</b> offering? <b>If</b> you say that the <i>baraita</i> is speaking of <b>a substitute for a burnt-offering or a peace-offering,</b> i.e., if an animal was set aside to serve as a burnt-offering or a peace-offering and it was lost, and a substitute was set aside in its place, and then the original animal was found and sacrificed, in that case the substitute <b>is sacrificed</b> just like the first, and so it is certainly subject to the prohibition against delaying.
<b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a substitute for a sin-offering,</b> i.e., if an animal was set aside as a sin-offering and it was lost, and a substitute was set aside in its place, and then the original animal was found and sacrificed, in that case the substitute <b>is left to die,</b> as it has become disqualified and can no longer be sacrificed on the altar. This being the case, there is no reason to say that it is subject to the prohibition against delaying. <b>Rather, what</b> is the <b>substitute</b> referred to in the <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>the substitute for a thanks-offering.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a thanks-offering that became mixed up with its substitute,</b> i.e., one substituted an animal for one designated as a thanks-offering, in which case both animals are considered consecrated, and then the original animal and its substitute became mixed up with each other, <b>and one of them died, there is no remedy for the other one,</b> and so it must be left to graze until it becomes blemished.
The Gemara explains: <b>What could he have done</b> with the remaining animal? If you say <b>that he may sacrifice it and sacrifice the bread with it,</b> i.e., the forty loaves of bread that are brought as a meal-offering together with the animal component of the thanks-offering, <b>perhaps this</b> animal <b>is</b> not the one that had originally been set aside but rather <b>the substitute,</b> and the rule is that the substitute is sacrificed like the thanks-offering itself, but without bread. If you say <b>that he should sacrifice it without bread, perhaps it is the</b> original <b>thanks-offering,</b> which must be brought with bread. This, then, is the substitute that the <i>baraita</i> says is not subject to the prohibition against delaying.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But since</b> the animal <b>is not fit to be sacrificed, why do I</b> need a special <b>verse to exclude it</b> from the prohibition against delaying? In any case it cannot be sacrificed on the altar, and so there is no need to state that it is not included in the prohibition.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: Actually,</b> you can say that the verse comes <b>to exclude the substitute for a burnt-offering or a peace-offering. And here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where two Festivals</b> already <b>passed</b> from the time that one had consecrated the original animal but did not bring it to the altar, <b>and it became blemished, and he redeemed it by</b> replacing it with <b>another</b> animal, as required. <b>And</b> then <b>another Festival passed</b> and he did not yet bring the substitute to the altar. In that case, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> this second animal <b>comes in place of the first</b> one, as it was consecrated as a substitute for it, <b>it</b> should be <b>considered as one for which three Festivals have</b> already <b>passed;</b> therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, the three Festivals are counted from the time of the replacement animal’s consecration.
The Gemara asks: This answers the question of which substitute the <i>baraita</i> is referring to according to the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>but</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: Once</b> even <b>the first Festival has passed one transgresses</b> the mitzva: <b>You shall not delay, what is there to say</b> here? <b>Rava said: Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the original animal <b>became blemished during the Festival, and one redeemed it</b> by replacing it with another animal, <b>and the Festival passed</b> without that animal being sacrificed. In that case, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> this second animal <b>comes in place of the first</b> one, and the first one had already been consecrated before the Festival, <b>it</b> should be <b>considered as one for which an entire Festival has</b> already <b>passed,</b> so that he transgresses the prohibition against delaying; therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. Rather, an entire Festival must pass for the replacement animal.
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And it would be sin in you,”</b> which teaches that the sin of delaying would be sin in you, <b>but there would be no sin in your offering,</b> i.e., the offering would not become disqualified due to the delay. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it from here that this is learned?</b> But <b>isn’t it derived</b> from the statement <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> that one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that a firstborn</b> animal <b>after its</b> first <b>year passed,</b> during which time it was not sacrificed, <b>should be like consecrated things that have become disqualified</b> due to a blemish, <b>and</b> so <b>it is disqualified</b> from being brought to the altar.
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,</b> in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborns of your herds, and of your flocks”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23), thereby <b>juxtaposing a firstborn</b> animal <b>to the tithe</b> of grain. <b>Just as tithe is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from one year to the next,</b> as it is explicitly stated that tithes may be eaten until the end of three years, <b>so too, a firstborn</b> animal <b>is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from one year to the next,</b> despite the delay in being brought to the altar. Therefore, there is another source for the <i>halakha</i> that the offering itself does not become disqualified even if it is brought late.
The Gemara answers: The first derivation cited <b>was necessary.</b> Had this <i>halakha</i> been learned only from the case of a firstborn animal, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the offering is not disqualified <b>applies</b> only to <b>a firstborn, which is not for appeasement,</b> i.e., it does not come to atone for any sin, not even for the neglect of a positive mitzva, but is merely a gift for the priest. <b>But</b> as for other <b>consecrated</b> animals, <b>which appease,</b> their role being to atone for the sins of their owners, one might <b>say</b> that <b>they do not appease</b> when brought late. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, the other offerings are also not disqualified when brought late.
The Gemara asks further: <b>But still,</b> it may be argued that this derivation is unnecessary,

Daf 6a

as this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> that <b>which ben Azzai</b> said, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai says:</b> The verse states: “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offering be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers <b>it,</b> it shall be <i>piggul</i>” (Leviticus 7:18).
For <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state</b> the word “it”? <b>Since</b> elsewhere <b>it states:</b> “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, <b>you shall not delay paying it;</b> for the Lord your God will surely require it from you, and it would be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22), <b>I might have interpreted</b> from this verse that <b>even one who is late</b> in paying <b>his vow</b> is included in: <b>It shall not be accepted.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “it.” It,</b> an offering disqualified by improper intention [<i>piggul</i>], <b>is</b> included in the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted,” but</b> the animal of <b>one who is late</b> in paying <b>his vow is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b>
The Gemara rejects what was said above; <b>rather,</b> the explanation of the verse is as follows. The phrase: “And it would be <b>sin in you”</b> comes to teach that there would be a sin in you, <b>but</b> there would <b>not</b> be <b>a sin in your wife.</b>
It was necessary to say that the lateness is not imputed to the other members of one’s household for the following reason: <b>It might enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> who said: <b>A person’s wife dies only because</b> others <b>demand of him money and he does not have</b> means with which to pay, <b>as it is stated</b> about one who commits himself to guarantee a loan: <b>“If you have nothing with which to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?”</b> (Proverbs 22:27). The verse warns one who takes a loan that incurring debt may result in one losing the very sheets that he sleeps on to his creditor. The Gemara understands this homiletically: Why should you cause God to take away your wife, i.e., she who shares your bed, so that she dies? Consequently, you might <b>say that</b> one’s <b>wife also dies for this transgression</b> of the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> in that one fails to fulfill his commitment. Therefore, <b>the verse teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, this sin is imputed to him alone.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That which is gone out of your lips you shall keep and do; as you have vowed as a gift to the Lord your God, which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). <b>“That which is gone out of your lips”; this is a positive mitzva. “You shall keep”; this is a prohibition,</b> as the phrase “you shall keep” is a warning to keep oneself from sinning. <b>“And do”;</b> this is <b>an admonition to the court to make you</b> fulfill your vow. <b>“As you have vowed”; this</b> is referring to <b>a vow-offering. “To the Lord your God”; this</b> is referring to <b>sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings,</b> teaching that one must keep his word and bring them. “As a <b>gift”;</b> this is understood <b>in its literal sense</b> to be referring to a gift-offering. <b>“Which you have promised”; this</b> is referring to <b>objects consecrated for Temple maintenance. “With your mouth”; this</b> is referring to vows of <b>charity,</b> to which one commits himself with his mouth.
The Gemara clarifies the details mentioned in this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: “That which is gone out of your lips”; this is a positive mitzva. Why do I</b> need this derivation? <b>Isn’t</b> the positive mitzva <b>derived</b> from the verse: <b>“And there you shall come; and there you shall bring</b> your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the offering of your hand, and your vows, and your gift-offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:5–6)? The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“You shall keep”; this is a prohibition. Why do I</b> need this derivation; <b>this is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“You shall not delay paying it”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:22).
<b>“And do”;</b> this is <b>a warning to the court to make you</b> fulfill your vow. <b>Why do I</b> need this derivation? This rule <b>is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“He shall offer it”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He shall offer it,”</b> which <b>teaches that he must be forced</b> to bring his offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that he may be forced to bring his offering even <b>against his will.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In accordance with his will”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). <b>How so? The</b> court <b>coerces him until he says: I want to</b> bring the offering. Now, since all of these <i>halakhot</i> are already known from other sources, what is the point of this repetition?
The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> set of verses is referring to a case <b>where one said</b> that he vowed to bring an offering <b>but did not</b> yet <b>set aside</b> a specific animal for his vow, and <b>one</b> set of verses is referring to a case <b>where he set aside</b> a specific animal for his vow <b>but did not</b> yet <b>sacrifice</b> it on the altar.
<b>And it is necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in both cases, <b>as had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only about the <i>halakha</i> of the case where <b>one said</b> that he vowed to bring an offering <b>but did not</b> yet <b>set aside</b> a specific animal for his vow, one might have said that only in this case has he transgressed <b>because he did not keep his word; however, if he set aside</b> a specific animal for his vow <b>but did not</b> yet <b>sacrifice</b> it on the altar, one might <b>say</b> that <b>anywhere that it is, it is in the treasure house of the Merciful One,</b> as the world and everything in it belongs to God, and therefore it makes no difference if he delays in bringing it to the Temple. Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> to teach that even when one has set aside a specific animal he transgresses the prohibition.
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only about the case where <b>one set aside</b> a specific animal for his vow <b>but did not</b> yet <b>sacrifice</b> it on the altar, one might have said that only in this case has he transgressed <b>because he is keeping</b> the animal <b>for himself. But if he said</b> that he vowed to bring an offering <b>but did not</b> yet <b>set aside</b> a specific animal for his vow, one might <b>say</b> that his mere <b>speech is nothing,</b> and there is no transgression provided he has not actually set aside an animal. Therefore, <b>it</b> is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in both cases.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>How can you say</b> that the Gemara is dealing with a case <b>where one</b> merely <b>said</b> that he vowed to bring an offering <b>but did not</b> yet <b>set aside</b> a specific animal? <b>Isn’t a gift-offering mentioned</b> in the verse, <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>What is a vow-</b>offering? It is an offering brought by <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt-offering.</b> And <b>what is a gift-offering?</b> It is an offering brought by <b>one who says,</b> concerning a particular animal: <b>I undertake</b> to bring <b>this</b> animal as <b>a burnt-offering.</b>
<b>And what is the difference between a vow-</b>offering <b>and a gift-offering?</b> With regard to <b>vow-</b>offerings, if the animal <b>died or was stolen,</b> the one who took the vow <b>is obligated</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b> He undertook to bring a burnt-offering without specifying the animal, and therefore until he brings that offering he is not absolved of his obligation. With regard to <b>a gift-offering,</b> however, if the animal <b>died or was stolen, he is not obligated</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it</b> because he undertook to bring a specific animal, and that is no longer possible. In the case of a gift-offering, then, a specific animal must have already been set aside as an offering.
<b>Rava said: You</b> can <b>find</b> a case of a gift-offering where a specific animal has not yet been set aside; <b>for example, where one said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt-offering on the condition that</b> after I set an animal aside in fulfillment of my vow, <b>I will not be liable to replace it</b> should the animal die or be stolen.
§ The <i>baraita</i> stated: <b>“With your mouth”; this</b> is referring to vows of <b>charity. Rava said:</b> In the case of vows of <b>charity, one is liable immediately</b> if he is late in distributing the charity that he had promised to give. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>that poor people</b> to whom the charity may be given <b>exist</b> in all places, and so the charity can be distributed to them immediately, unlike an offering, which must be brought to the Temple.
The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that charity must be given to the poor without delay. The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>since</b> the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to vows of charity <b>is written in the passage dealing with offerings,</b> perhaps one does not transgress the prohibition against delaying <b>until three Festivals have passed, as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>offerings,</b> therefore Rava <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, <b>there,</b> with regard to the offerings, <b>the Merciful One made</b> the timing of the transgression <b>dependent upon the</b> time of the <b>Festivals,</b> when one must go on pilgrimage to the Temple. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to charity vows, this is <b>not</b> so <b>because poor people</b> who are ready to accept charity <b>are found</b> in all places.
<b>Rava said:</b> Although, according to most opinions one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only after three Festivals have elapsed, <b>once</b> even <b>one Festival has passed</b> and he has not sacrificed the offerings that he vowed to bring, <b>he</b> immediately <b>violates a positive mitzva.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Papeyyas testified about</b> the <b>offspring of peace-offerings.</b> They said <b>that</b> if the mother animal was consecrated before it conceived or during its pregnancy, the offspring, too, <b>must be sacrificed as a peace-offering. Rabbi Papeyyas said: I testify that we</b> once <b>had a cow that was sacrificed as a peace-offering, and we ate it on Passover [<i>beFesaḥ</i>], and we ate its offspring as a peace-offering on the Festival [<i>beḤag</i>],</b> i.e., on <i>Sukkot</i>.
The Gemara clarifies the details of this story: <b>Granted, on Passover</b> itself Rabbi Papeyyas and his family <b>did not sacrifice</b> the offspring, as one can <b>say</b> that the animal <b>was lacking</b> the requisite time, i.e., it was less than eight days old, and it is prohibited to sacrifice such a young animal. <b>But how could they delay</b> and not sacrifice the offspring <b>on <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> the first Festival after Passover, if, according to Rava, <b>they</b> would <b>violate a positive mitzva</b> as soon as the first Festival passed?
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: For example,</b> this occurs

Daf 6b

in a case <b>where</b> the offspring <b>was sick on <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> and therefore it could be brought to the altar only on the next Festival. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> an alternative explanation: <b>What is</b> the statement: <b>And we ate its offspring as a peace-offering on the Festival,</b> coming to <b>teach?</b> This is not referring to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, which is the usual meaning of the term the Festival; rather, it is referring to <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>.</b> Therefore, there is no difficulty here whatsoever.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rav Zevid, say to this? He argues that <b>anywhere that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> a <i>halakha</i> concerning Passover using the term <b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, he</b> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <i>Shavuot</i> using the term <b><i>Atzaret</i></b>, not the term <i>Ḥag</i>. In such a context, the term <i>Ḥag</i> is reserved exclusively for <i>Sukkot</i>.
<b>Rava said: Once three Festivals have passed, every day he transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>both a firstborn</b> animal <b>and all consecrated animals, once a year has passed without</b> three <b>Festivals</b>, or <b>three Festivals have passed without a year</b> elapsing, the owner <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay.</b>
The Gemara first expresses its astonishment at the question itself: <b>What is this objection?</b> What is the comparison between this ruling and the statement of Rava? <b>Rav Kahana said: He who raises an objection</b> here <b>raises a valid objection,</b> and this is the way the question should be understood. <b>Since the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is looking for prohibitions</b> to add, and he shows that the prohibition applies in additional cases, then if Rava is correct, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that once three Festivals have passed <b>he transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay, every single day.</b>
<b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rava, explain the <i>baraita</i>? He understands that <b>the <i>tanna</i> is</b> trying <b>to establish</b> the action only <b>as subject to a prohibition,</b> i.e., he merely wishes to set the parameters of the prohibition; but once the action is established as prohibited, <b>he is not looking for additional prohibitions.</b>
The Gemara proceeds to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> i.e., the <i>baraita</i> cited above, which stated: In the case of <b>both a firstborn</b> animal <b>and all consecrated animals, once a year has passed,</b> even if three <b>Festivals</b> have <b>not</b> passed, or once three <b>Festivals have passed,</b> even if a whole <b>year</b> has <b>not</b> passed, the owner <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay. Granted,</b> it is possible to have three <b>Festivals without a year; you find it</b> because three Festivals can pass in half a year, between Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>But a year without</b> three <b>Festivals,</b> under <b>what circumstances</b> can <b>you find</b> this case? How can a year pass without three Festivals also passing?
The Gemara clarifies the question: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who is of</b> the opinion that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only if the three Festivals have passed <b>in their</b> proper <b>order. You</b> can <b>find</b> a year without three Festivals in their proper order, e.g., if one made his vow shortly before <i>Shavuot</i>, in which case the year will end before <i>Shavuot</i> the following year, but three Festivals in order will not have elapsed until <i>Sukkot</i> of the third year. <b>But according to the one who is not</b> of the opinion that the three Festivals must be <b>in their</b> proper <b>order,</b> under <b>what circumstances</b> can <b>you find</b> this case of a year without three Festivals?
The Gemara clarifies again: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>you find</b> a year without three Festivals <b>in a leap year, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of houses of walled cities, with regard to which an owner is given only one year to redeem his home if he sells it, after which it becomes the permanent possession of the purchaser, the verse states: “And if it be not redeemed within the space of <b>a full year”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). How is the year determined? <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One counts 365 days like the number of the days in a solar</b> year, and not the usual lunar year, which is why it is called a full year.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say: One counts twelve months from day to day,</b> from the date of the sale until that same date twelve months later, <b>and if it is a leap year</b> with an added month, <b>the leap</b> month is <b>for</b> the seller’s benefit, i.e., he has thirteen months to redeem his house. <b>You</b> can <b>find</b> a year without three Festivals <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. How so? It is possible in a case <b>where one consecrated</b> the animal <b>after the festival of Passover, so that once he reaches the end of the second</b> month of <b>Adar</b> in a leap year, <b>the year is completed,</b> but <b>the Festivals are not</b> yet <b>completed,</b> as the third Festival is still to come. <b>But according to the Sages,</b> under <b>what circumstances</b> can <b>you find</b> this case of a year without three Festivals?
The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Shemaya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Shavuot</i> sometimes</b> occurs on <b>the fifth</b> of Sivan, <b>sometimes</b> on <b>the sixth</b> of Sivan, <b>and sometimes</b> on <b>the seventh. How so?</b> If <b>both</b> the months of Nisan and Iyyar <b>are full</b> months of thirty days each, the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, which is celebrated fifty days after the second day of Passover, occurs on the <b>fifth</b> of Sivan; if <b>both</b> months <b>are short,</b> with twenty-nine days each, it occurs on the <b>seventh</b> of Sivan; and if <b>one</b> of them <b>is full and the other is short,</b> it occurs on <b>the sixth</b> of Sivan. According to this opinion, if both months were full and the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> occurred on the fifth day of Sivan, and one made his vow on the day after <i>Shavuot</i>, i.e., the sixth of Sivan, and in the following year both months were short, so that the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> occurred on the seventh of Sivan, a whole year would have passed without three Festivals.
The Gemara comments: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>disagrees with Rav Shemaya</b> and says that a year has a fixed number of days? <b>It is <i>Aḥerim</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: The difference between <i>Shavuot</i></b> of one year and <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> of the following year, and similarly, <b>between Rosh HaShana</b> of one year and <b>Rosh HaShana</b> of the following year, <b>is only four days</b> of the week. There are 354 days in a lunar year, which are divided into twelve alternating months, six months that are thirty days long and six months that are twenty-nine days long. Therefore, every year is fifty weeks and four days long. <b>And if it were a leap year,</b> in which case the year is comprised of 383 days, or fifty-four weeks and five days, there is a difference of <b>five</b> days between them.
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira asks:</b> In the case of <b>an heir, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of: <b>You shall not delay?</b> That is to say, does an heir transgress the prohibition against delaying a vow taken by his father? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Is it that <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“When you shall vow a vow</b> to the Lord your God, you shall not delay paying it” (Deuteronomy 23:22), <b>and this</b> one, the heir, <b>did not make a vow? Or perhaps</b> the essence of the mitzva is as it says: <b>“And there you shall come; and there you shall bring</b> your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices” (Deuteronomy 12:5–6), <b>and this</b> one, the heir, <b>is obligated</b> to come and bring his father’s offerings.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to this, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that says: The verse states: “For the Lord your God will surely require it <b>from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:22), which is interpreted to mean: <b>To the exclusion of an heir.</b> This teaches that an heir does not transgress the prohibition against delaying a vow taken by his father.
The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> phrase <b>“from you” is necessary</b> to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, namely, that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying even for <b>gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and the</b> produce of the <b>corner</b> of his field. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥiyya derived two <i>halakhot</i> from this word. <b>He read into</b> the verse: <b>“You [<i>imakh</i>],”</b> which he expounded as coming to include gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the produce of the corner of the field in the prohibition, <b>and he read into</b> the verse: <b>“From you [<i>me’imakh</i>],”</b> with the extra letter <i>mem</i> coming to exclude an heir.
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira asks</b> another question on this topic: In the case of <b>a woman</b> who made a vow, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Do we say</b> that since <b>she is not obligated to appear</b> in the Temple on the pilgrimage Festivals, as this obligation is a positive, time-bound mitzva, from which women are exempt, she also does not transgress if she is late in bringing her offering? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>she is</b> obligated <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival, she should also be obligated in some of the other mitzvot connected to the day?
<b>Abaye said to him: Derive this from</b> the fact that <b>she is</b> also obligated <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>And did Abaye</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that a woman is obligated to rejoice on a Festival? <b>But didn’t Abaye say:</b> As for <b>a woman, her husband must make her joyful</b> on a Festival? This means that the obligation falls not on the woman, but upon her husband. The Gemara answers: Abaye <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Zeira.</b> Rabbi Zeira holds that women are bound by a positive mitzva to rejoice on a Festival. Since, according to Rabbi Zeira’s opinion, they are obligated in the mitzva of rejoicing on a Festival, they are also subject to the prohibition: You shall not delay.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>a firstborn</b> animal, <b>from when does one</b> begin to <b>count a year</b> with regard to the prohibition against delaying? <b>Abaye said:</b> One counts <b>from the time it is born. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> One counts <b>from the time it is fit for appeasement,</b> i.e., from its eighth day, when it is fit to be brought as an offering, as explicitly stated in the Torah (see Leviticus 22:27).
The Gemara comments: The two Sages <b>do not disagree. This</b> one, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, who said that one counts from the time that the animal is fit for appeasement, is speaking <b>about an unblemished</b> firstborn, which must be brought to the altar for sacrifice.

Daf 7a

<b>That</b> one, Abaye, who said that one counts from the time that the animal is born, is speaking <b>about a blemished</b> animal. Since it was already fit to be slaughtered from the day of its birth, if one does not give it to the priest within a year of that day he transgresses the prohibition against delaying.
The Gemara asks: <b>Can an animal with a blemish</b> really <b>be eaten</b> immediately on the day that it is born? Isn’t there a requirement to wait eight days before slaughtering it, in order to ascertain that the animal is viable and was not born prematurely? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where one is certain</b> of when the animal was conceived and <b>that its months</b> of gestation <b>have been completed,</b> so that it may be presumed to be viable.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that expands upon what was taught in the mishna: <b>On the first of Nisan is the New Year for</b> counting <b>the months</b> of the year, <b>and for leap years, and for collection of</b> the <b>shekels</b> that had been collected in Adar and used to purchase animals for communal offerings and other needs of the Temple; <b>and some say</b> that it is <b>also</b> the New Year <b>for the renting of houses.</b>
<b>From where do we</b> derive that the first of Nisan is the New Year <b>for months? As it is written: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a household…And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month:</b> And the whole assembly of the congregation <b>shall slaughter it</b> toward evening” (Exodus 12:2–6). <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Observe the month of ripening</b> and keep Passover to the Lord your God; for in the month of ripening the Lord your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night” (Deuteronomy 16:1). <b>Which is the month in which there is a ripening</b> of grain? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Nisan, and it is called the first</b> month of the year.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> that it is the month of <b>Iyyar.</b> The Gemara answers: A month of <b>ripening is required, and</b> in Iyyar <b>there is no</b> ripening, as the grain has already ripened. The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> that it is the month of <b>Adar,</b> the month in which some of the grain begins to ripen. The Gemara answers: The month in which <b>most of the ripening</b> takes place <b>is required, and this is not</b> the case in Adar, as most of the grain ripens during the next month, the month of Nisan. The Gemara asks: But <b>is most of the ripening written</b> in the verse? The verse merely speaks of the month of ripening, and since there is some ripening in Adar, it is possible that this is the first month.
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is derived that Nisan is the first of the months <b>from here.</b> The verse states: <b>“Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land”</b> (Leviticus 23:39). <b>Which is the month in which there is a gathering</b> of the grain of the field before the rains begin? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Tishrei, and it is called the seventh</b> month. Therefore, Nisan is the first month of the year.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> that verse is referring to the month of <b>Marḥeshvan, and what is</b> meant by <b>seventh?</b> It is the <b>seventh</b> month <b>from</b> the month of <b>Iyyar.</b> The Gemara rejects this possibility: A month of <b>gathering is required, and</b> in Marḥeshvan <b>there is no</b> gathering, as the crops have already been gathered in, and the fields have already begun to be plowed to prepare them for the next year’s planting. The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> that it is the month of <b>Elul,</b> the month in which the gathering of the grain from the fields begins, <b>and what is</b> meant by <b>seventh?</b> It is the <b>seventh</b> month <b>from</b> the month of <b>Adar.</b> The Gemara answers: The month in which <b>most of the gathering</b> takes place <b>is required, and this is not</b> the case in Elul, as most of the gathering is done in Tishrei. The Gemara asks: But <b>is most of the gathering written</b> in the verse?
<b>Rather, Ravina said: This matter we did not learn from the Torah of Moses, our teacher;</b> rather, <b>we learned it from the texts of the tradition,</b> i.e., the Prophets and Writings: <b>“On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shevat”</b> (Zechariah 1:7). If Shevat is the eleventh month, Nisan must be the first month. <b>Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> It is derived <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“So Esther was taken to the king Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month of Tevet”</b> (Esther 2:16).
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “On the fourth day of the ninth month, in Kislev”</b> (Zechariah 7:1). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> It is derived <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And the scribes of the king were called at that time in the third month, that is the month of Sivan”</b> (Esther 8:9). <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “He cast <i>pur</i>, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar”</b> (Esther 3:7). <b>And if you wish, say</b> that it is derived <b>from here: “In the first month, that is, the month of Nisan”</b> (Esther 3:7).
The Gemara asks: <b>And all of</b> the others, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>they did not say</b> that it is derived <b>from here,</b> the last verse mentioned, which is explicitly referring to Nisan as the first month? The Gemara answers: It is because one could <b>perhaps</b> have said: <b>What is</b> meant here by <b>first?</b> It means <b>the first</b> in relation <b>to its matter,</b> i.e., the months of the decree, and so it cannot be proven from here that Nisan is the first of the months of the year.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why didn’t <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna list the first of Nisan as the New Year for months, as did the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>He is dealing with</b> matters connected to <b>years,</b> but <b>he is not dealing with</b> matters connected to <b>months.</b>
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> on the first of Nisan is the New Year <b>for leap years.</b> The Gemara asks: Do <b>we</b> really <b>count leap years from Nisan? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The court <b>may not declare a leap year before Rosh HaShana, and if</b> they did <b>declare</b> a leap year before Rosh HaShana, the declaration is not valid and <b>it is not</b> considered <b>a leap year. But due to pressing circumstances,</b> e.g., religious persecution, <b>it may be declared immediately after Rosh HaShana.</b> At that time, the Sages may declare that the coming year will be a leap year in accordance with their calculations. <b>Even so,</b> the additional month <b>added</b> to the <b>leap year can be only</b> a second <b>Adar.</b> In what sense, then, is Nisan the New Year for leap years?
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What is</b> meant here by <b>leap years?</b> It means <b>the end of the leap year.</b> Once the month of Nisan has arrived, the previous year can no longer be declared a leap year, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>They,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Papeyyas, <b>testified that</b> the court <b>may declare a leap year all</b> through the month of <b>Adar, as there were</b> Sages <b>who said:</b> A year may be declared a leap year only <b>until Purim,</b> and if the decision to declare a leap year was not made before Purim, the year can no longer be declared a leap year.
The Gemara explains the dispute: <b>What is the rationale of the one who said</b> that a leap year can be declared only <b>until Purim?</b> It is <b>since the Master said: One asks</b> about <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover thirty days before Passover.</b> Immediately following Purim, on the fifteenth of Adar, people already began to immerse themselves in the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover, which occurs on the fifteenth of Nisan. Were the court to declare a leap year after Purim, the festival of Passover would then be delayed for another month. In that case, there is concern that people <b>will come to demean</b> the prohibition against <b>leavened bread</b> and not observe Passover on its new date in the proper manner.
<b>And the other</b> Sages, Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Papeyyas, who are not concerned about this, what do they say? They say that people <b>know that a leap year is dependent on the calculation, and they</b> will <b>assume that the Sages did not complete the calculation until now,</b> after Purim. Since this is a matter of common knowledge, there is no concern that declaring a leap year at that late time will lead to a disregard of the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why didn’t <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna include the first of Nisan as the New Year for leap years? The Gemara answers: <b>He is dealing with</b> years <b>that begin</b> on the first of Nisan, but <b>he is not dealing with</b> years <b>that end</b> on that date. With regard to leap years, the first of Nisan is the end not a beginning.
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the first of Nisan is the New Year <b>for collection of</b> the <b>shekels</b> that had been collected in Adar and were used to purchase animals for communal offerings and other needs of the Temple. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Yoshiya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “This is the burnt-offering of each month in its month throughout the months [<i>leḥodshei</i>] of the year”</b> (Numbers 28:14). The seemingly superfluous term: “Throughout the months [<i>leḥodshei</i>] of the year,” should be understood as follows: <b>The Torah is saying</b> here: <b>Renew [<i>ḥaddesh</i>]</b> the year <b>and bring an offering from the new collection</b> of the shekels. <b>And it is derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Nisan, as it is written</b> with regard to Nisan: <b>“It shall be the first month of the year to you”</b> (Exodus 12:2).
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and a different instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Tishrei, as it is written</b> with regard to Tishrei: <b>“From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The Gemara answers: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which “months”</b> are mentioned, as the verse states: “Throughout the months of the year,” <b>from</b> another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which months</b> are mentioned, as the verse states: “It shall be the first month of the year to you.” <b>And one does not derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which months</b> are mentioned <b>from</b> an instance of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which “months”</b> are not mentioned, as the verse states: “From the beginning of the year.”
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>communal offerings that are brought on the first of Nisan,</b> there is <b>a mitzva to bring</b> them <b>from the new</b> contribution of shekels collected for that year. However, <b>if one brought</b> them <b>from the old</b> contribution, i.e., from last year’s shekels, <b>he has fulfilled</b> the obligation with regard to the offerings, <b>but he lacks the mitzva</b> of bringing them from the new shekels.
The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>communal offerings that are brought on the first of Nisan,</b> there is <b>a mitzva to bring</b> them <b>from the new</b> contribution of shekels. However, <b>if one brought</b> them <b>from the old</b> contribution, <b>he has fulfilled</b> the obligation with regard to the sacrifices, <b>but he lacks the mitzva</b> of bringing them from the new shekels. <b>If</b> a private <b>individual volunteered</b> to bring the communal offerings <b>from his own</b> property, <b>they are fit</b> for the altar, <b>provided that he transfers them over to the community.</b>
The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that one may donate of his own property to the community, provided that he transfers it to the community in the proper manner. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we should be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b>

Daf 7b

<b>he will not transfer them over to the public without reservation,</b> and in his heart he will hold on to them as his own, therefore the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a matter of concern.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why didn’t <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna count the first of Nisan as the New Year for shekels? The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna lists only definite New Years. <b>Since it is taught: If one brought</b> them from the old contribution, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>he could not state</b> this New Year as <b>a definite</b> rule, and so he did not teach it.
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And some say</b> that the first of Nisan is <b>also</b> the New Year <b>for</b> the <b>renting of houses. The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one rents out a house to another</b> person <b>for a year, he counts twelve months from day to day. But if he said</b> that he was renting it <b>for this year,</b> then <b>even if</b> the agreement <b>was made only on the first of Adar, once the first of Nisan arrived</b> one month later, <b>it is counted as a year,</b> and the rental contract comes to end.
The Gemara comments: <b>Even according to the one who said</b> that <b>one day in a year is considered a year, it is different here,</b> with regard to rental <i>halakhot</i>, <b>as a person does not take the trouble to rent a house for less than thirty days.</b> Therefore, if one rented a house after the first of Adar, the remaining days of Adar are not considered a full year.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the first of <b>Tishrei</b> is the New Year for the renting of houses, and so if one rents a house for a year in the summer the year would come to an end in Tishrei? The Gemara answers: <b>A person who rents a house without specification</b> intends to <b>rent</b> it <b>for all of the rainy season,</b> until Nisan, when the rainy season comes to a close.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why didn’t <b>the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> and the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna include the first of Nisan as the New Year for the renting of houses? They hold that <b>even in Nisan it is common</b> that the sky becomes <b>covered with clouds</b> and rain falls. Therefore, one who rents a house does not have in mind to rent it only until the first of Nisan, as presumably he does not want to find himself in a situation where he is homeless when it is still raining.
§ The mishna states: <b>On the first of Elul is the New Year for animal tithes.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Who is</b> the author of the opinion cited in this mishna? <b>It is Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Meir says: On the first of Elul is the New Year for animal tithes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Festivals,</b> i.e., that the first of Nisan is the New Year for Festivals, <b>who is</b> the author of the opinion cited in the mishna? <b>It is Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only if the three Festivals have passed in their proper order, with Passover first. <b>Say the last clause</b> of the mishna, which states that <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The New Year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei.</b> Can it be that <b>the first clause and the last clause</b> follow the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, while the middle clause</b> relating to animal tithes follows the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The entire mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he takes</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> the opinions of different <b><i>tanna’im</i>. With regard to the Festivals, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, while with regard to animal tithes he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> how are there <b>four</b> New Years? If the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that the first of Elul is the New Year for animal tithes, <b>there are five</b> New Years: The first of Nisan, the fifteenth of Nisan, the first of Elul, the first of Tishrei, and the fifteenth of Shevat. <b>Rava said: There are</b> only <b>four</b> New Years <b>according to each opinion:</b> There are <b>four according to Rabbi Meir,</b> who <b>removes</b> the New Year for <b>Festivals,</b> as according to him there is no fixed time from which to begin counting the Festivals. <b>According to Rabbi Shimon’s</b> opinion as well there are <b>four</b> New Years, for he <b>removes</b> the New Year for <b>animal tithes,</b> as according to him it is on the first of Tishrei, which is already listed.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> an alternative answer: The mishna is to be understood as follows: There are <b>four months in which there are several New Years,</b> since in Nisan, according to Rabbi Meir, there are two New Years: For kings on the first and for Festivals on the fifteenth.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>The sixteenth of Nisan is the New Year for the <i>omer</i></b> offering, as from this date onward it is permitted to eat from the new crop of grain. <b>The sixth of Sivan is the New Year for the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, as from this day onward it is permitted to sacrifice meal-offerings in the Temple from the new grain. If so, <b>according to Rava, let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that there are <b>six</b> New Years, including the sixteenth of Nisan and the sixth of Sivan, and <b>according to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak let it teach</b> that there are <b>five</b> New Years, since Sivan is a month in which there is a New Year.
<b>Rav Pappa said: When</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>counts</b> New Years, he counts only <b>those that begin in the evening; those that do not begin in the evening he does not count.</b> Since the New Years associated with the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves do not begin in the evening but only from the time that they are sacrificed, he does not include them.
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is</b> the New Year for <b>Festivals, which does not begin in the evening,</b> as the prohibition against delaying is not transgressed in the evening, when the Festival begins, but only in the morning, after the daily offering has been brought and one is able to bring the vowed animal to the altar, <b>and</b> nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> <b>counts</b> it. The Gemara answers: <b>Since he had to bring</b> his vow by the Festival, <b>he stands liable from the beginning</b> of the Festival for transgressing the prohibition against delaying.
The Gemara asks further: <b>But there is</b> the New Year for <b>the Jubilee, which does not begin in the evening</b> but from the time of the <i>shofar</i> blast on Yom Kippur during the day, <b>and</b> nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> <b>counts</b> it. The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who said</b> that <b>the Jubilee Year begins on Rosh HaShana,</b> and the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> merely completes the release of the slaves. Therefore, the New Year for the Jubilee is included.
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said</b> a different explanation for why the New Year for the <i>omer</i> offering and the New Year for the two loaves are not mentioned in the mishna: <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>counts</b> New Years, he counts only <b>those that do not depend upon an action; those that depend upon an action,</b> e.g., the offering of the <i>omer</i> or the two loaves, <b>he does not count.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is</b> the New Year for <b>the Festivals, which depends upon an action,</b> i.e., the sacrifice of the daily offering, since no offering may be brought before the daily offering, <b>and</b> nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> <b>counts</b> it. The Gemara answers: This is not so, as the transgression of the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> does not depend upon anything else; rather, it <b>begins on its own</b> as soon as the Festival begins.

Daf 8a

The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> the New Year for <b>the Jubilee</b> depends upon a certain action, i.e., sounding the <i>shofar</i>, and nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> counts it. The Gemara answers: The mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who said that the Jubilee Year begins on Rosh HaShana, even without the <i>shofar</i> blast.
The Gemara presents an alternative answer as to why the <i>tanna</i> did not include all the other New Years. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> said that <b>there are four New Years that fall on four New Moons.</b> However, there are also other New Years that do not fall on New Moons.
The Gemara raises a question: Does Rav Ashi count the first of Shevat as one of the New Years; but <b>the first of Shevat is</b> a New Year only according to <b>Beit Shammai,</b> and by the time of Rav Ashi, the <i>halakha</i> was known to be in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel? The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> Rav Ashi <b>is saying:</b> There are <b>three</b> New Years that <b>all agree</b> occur on the first of the month, <b>and the first of Shevat is</b> subject to <b>a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The New Year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar, <b>expounded the same verse</b> in different ways. <b>As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“The flocks are clothed in the meadows, and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing”</b> (Psalms 65:14). <b>Rabbi Meir holds: When are the flocks clothed in the meadows,</b> i.e., when do the rams impregnate the ewes and thereby clothe them? It is <b>at the time when the valleys are wrapped in grain,</b> i.e., when they are covered in grain. <b>And when are the valleys wrapped in grain?</b> It is <b>in Adar.</b> Therefore, the sheep <b>conceive in Adar and give birth</b> five months later <b>in Av,</b> and so it is fitting that <b>their New Year</b> is on the first of <b>Elul,</b> as most of the year’s lambs have been born by then.
<b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: When are the flocks clothed in the meadows? At the time that</b> the stalks of grain <b>“shout for joy, and also sing.” When do the stalks break out in song,</b> i.e., when are they full, so that they rustle in the wind and create the whispering sounds of song? It is <b>in Nisan.</b> Therefore, the sheep <b>conceive in Nisan and give birth in Elul,</b> and so it is fitting that <b>their New Year</b> is <b>on</b> the first of <b>Tishrei.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Meir, <b>as well, isn’t it written: “They shout for joy, they also sing”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring to <b>late</b> sheep, which were conceived after the usual time, <b>in Nisan.</b> The Gemara asks: According to <b>the other</b> opinion of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon <b>as well, isn’t it written: “And the valleys wrapped in grain,”</b> which is in Adar? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring to <b>early</b> sheep, <b>which were conceived</b> in <b>Adar.</b>
The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the verse can be understood <b>as it is written: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows” at the time when “the valleys are wrapped in grain.” But there are also</b> some that do not conceive until as late as when <b>“they shout for joy, they also sing.” But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, it should have been</b> written <b>in the reverse</b> order: <b>“The flocks are clothed in the meadows” at the time when “they shout for joy, they also sing,” but there are also</b> some that conceive earlier, <b>when “the valleys are wrapped in grain.”</b> If so, according to them, the words in the verse were not written in their proper order.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the dispute must be explained as follows: <b>Everyone</b> is of the opinion <b>that “the flocks are clothed in the meadows,”</b> i.e., the sheep conceive, primarily <b>at the time when “the valleys are wrapped in grain,” in</b> the month of <b>Adar. But here they disagree about</b> the meaning of <b>the</b> following <b>verse: “You shall tithe a tithe</b> from all the increase of your seed that the field brings forth year by year. And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds, and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always” (Deuteronomy 14:22–23). <b>The verse speaks</b> here <b>about two tithes, one</b> being <b>the animal tithe and the other the grain tithe.</b>
They disagree about the following: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the verse <b>juxtaposes the animal tithe to the grain tithe. Just as the grain tithe is set aside close to</b> the grain’s <b>completion,</b> after it dries out in the field, <b>so too, the animal tithe is set aside close to its completion,</b> after the animals are born. Just as the grain is completed in Elul and is set aside the following month, which is Tishrei, so too, the animals are born in Av and therefore must be set aside in the following month, which is Elul. On the other hand, <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold:</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes the animal tithe to the grain tithe. Just as</b> in the case of <b>the grain tithe, its New Year is in Tishrei, so too,</b> in the case of <b>the animal tithe, its New Year is in Tishrei.</b>
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>On the first of Tishrei is the New Year for</b> counting <b>years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to which <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is stated <b>for</b> determining the validity of <b>documents, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Antedated promissory notes,</b> which bear a date that is earlier than the date when the loan actually took place, <b>are invalid. But postdated promissory notes,</b> which bear a date that is later than the date when the loan actually took place, <b>are valid.</b> Therefore, it is essential to know the date on which the new year begins in order to determine whether or not a particular promissory note is valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: <b>On the first of Nisan is the New Year for kings; and we say</b> about this: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>And Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>for</b> determining the validity of <b>documents.</b> Therefore, the new year for documents begins in Nisan and not in Tishrei.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> where the document is dated according to the reign of <b>the Jewish kings,</b> the year begins in Nisan; and <b>there,</b> where the document is dated to the reign of <b>the</b> gentile <b>kings of the nations of the world,</b> the year begins in Tishrei.
The Gemara asks: <b>But that which Rav Ḥisda said</b> in explanation of the mishna, that <b>they taught</b> that the New Year for kings is in Nisan <b>only with regard to the Jewish kings, but as for the</b> gentile <b>kings of the nations of the world we count from Tishrei,</b> did <b>Rav Ḥisda come to teach us</b> what was already taught in <b>the mishna</b> itself?
The Gemara answers: <b>No, Rav Ḥisda came to teach us</b> the meaning of certain biblical <b>verses,</b> i.e., that they should not be understood as was suggested at the beginning of this chapter but as teaching that the New Year for gentile kings is in Tishrei.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda teaches</b> the mishna <b>as</b> did <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> and he maintains that when it says that the first of Tishrei is the New Year for years, it is not referring to documents, <b>as Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The first of Tishrei is the New Year for years <b>with regard to</b> calculating the <b>cycles</b> of the sun and the moon. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: The world was created in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei,</b> and all the calculations with regard to the sun and the moon are based on when they were created.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> When the mishna says that the first of Tishrei is the New Year for years, it is <b>with regard to judgment,</b> as on that day God judges the world for the whole year, <b>as it is written:</b> “A land that the Lord your God cares for; the eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it, <b>from the beginning of the year until the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12); <b>from the beginning of the year judgment is passed as to what will happen at the end</b> of the year.
The Gemara raises a question: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the day of judgment is in <b>Tishrei? As it is written: “Blow a <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, at the covered time for our Festival day”</b> (Psalms 81:4). <b>Which is the Festival day</b>

Daf 8b

<b>on which the moon is covered,</b> i.e., hidden? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Rosh HaShana,</b> which is the only Festival that occurs at the beginning of a month, when the moon cannot be seen. <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5), implying that this is the day of judgment.
With regard to this same verse, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”; this teaches that the heavenly court does not assemble for judgment until the earthly court has sanctified the month,</b> once the Sanhedrin has declared that day as Rosh HaShana.
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel.”</b> From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this is the day of judgment <b>for the Jewish people; from where</b> do I derive that it is also the day of judgment <b>for the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A judgment for the God of Jacob,”</b> Who rules over the entire world. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A statute for Israel”? This teaches that the Jewish people enter for judgment first.</b>
The Gemara notes: This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said:</b> When <b>a king and a community</b> are brought before God for judgment, the <b>king is brought in for judgment first, as it is stated:</b> “And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night, that He make <b>the judgment of His servant and the judgment of His people</b> Israel at all times” (I Kings 8:59). This verse is from King Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple, and he is referring to himself a servant of God.
<b>What is the reason</b> that the king is brought in first? <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is <b>not proper conduct for the king to stand outside</b> and wait for the trial of his subjects to come to an end. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the king is brought in first so that he may be judged <b>before</b> God’s <b>anger intensifies</b> due to the sins of the community, and he may thereby be saved from overly harsh judgment.
§ The mishna teaches: The first of Tishrei is also the New Year <b>for</b> calculating <b>Sabbatical Years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land”</b> (Leviticus 25:4), <b>and</b> we <b>learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Tishrei, as it is written: “From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The latter verse is referring to the year that begins at the onset of the rainy season, i.e., Tishrei.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let us learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and conclude that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Nisan, as it is written: “It shall be the first month of the year to you”</b> (Exodus 12:2), and there the reference is to Nisan. The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse about the Sabbatical Year, where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it, from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse in Deuteronomy above, where <b>months</b> are also <b>not</b> mentioned <b>with it. And</b> they <b>do not derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse where <b>months are</b> mentioned <b>with it,</b> i.e., “It shall be the first month of the year for you.”
§ The mishna teaches: The first of Tishrei is also the New Year <b>for Jubilee Years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> the New Year for <b>Jubilee Years on the first of Tishrei?</b> Isn’t the New Year for <b>Jubilee Years on the tenth of Tishrei,</b> Yom Kippur? <b>As it is written:</b> “Then shall you cause the <i>shofar</i> to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, <b>on Yom Kippur shall you sound the <i>shofar</i></b> throughout all your land. And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a Jubilee for you” (Leviticus 25:9–10).
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year”? Since it is stated</b> that the <i>shofar</i> is blown <b>“on Yom Kippur,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the year <b>is sanctified only from Yom Kippur and onward. Therefore, the verse states: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year,” which teaches that</b> the year <b>is sanctified from its beginning onward,</b> from the first of Tishrei, when the year begins.
<b>From here, Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, said: From Rosh HaShana until Yom Kippur</b> of the Jubilee Year, Hebrew <b>slaves were not released to their homes</b> because the <i>shofar</i> had not yet been sounded. <b>And they were</b> also <b>not enslaved to their masters,</b> as the Jubilee Year had already begun. <b>Rather, they would eat, drink, and rejoice, and</b> they would wear <b>their crowns on their heads</b> like free people. <b>Once Yom Kippur arrived, the court</b> would <b>sound the <i>shofar</i>, slaves</b> would be <b>released to their houses, and fields</b> that were sold would be <b>returned to their</b> original <b>owners.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, how do they interpret the verse: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year”? The Gemara answers: They derive from here that <b>you sanctify years, but you do not sanctify months.</b> According to this opinion, the court is commanded to sanctify the Jubilee Year with a proclamation: This year is sanctified; but it is not commanded to sanctify the months with a similar proclamation.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “It shall be a Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:11)? <b>Since it is stated: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>just as</b> the Jubilee Year <b>is sanctified from its beginning onward, so too, it is sanctified at its end onward,</b> i.e., it remains sanctified until Yom Kippur of the fifty-first year. <b>And do not wonder</b> why one might think this, <b>as don’t we</b> regularly <b>add from the profane to the sacred,</b> extending a sacred time period by adding to it both before and after from a profane time period? <b>Therefore, the verse states: “It shall be a Jubilee Year, the fiftieth year,”</b> to teach that <b>you sanctify the fiftieth year, but you do not sanctify the fifty-first year,</b> even partially.

Daf 9a

<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who do not require an additional verse to derive that the Jubilee Year does not extend until Yom Kippur of the fifty-first year, derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verse: <b>You count the fiftieth year</b> as the Jubilee Year alone, <b>but you do not count the fiftieth year</b> as the Jubilee Year <b>and</b> also as the <b>first</b> year of the next Sabbatical cycle. This <i>halakha</i> comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>the fiftieth year is counted for here and for there,</b> both as the Jubilee Year and also as the first year of the next Sabbatical cycle. Lest someone think that that is the case, <b>therefore, the verse teaches us that</b> this is <b>not</b> so; rather, the fiftieth year is the Jubilee Year, and the following year is the first year of the next Sabbatical cycle.
§ Apropos of the discussion of extending the Jubilee year, the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the principle <b>that</b> one <b>extends</b> a sanctified time period by <b>adding from the profane to the sacred</b> at both ends?
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“In plowing and in harvest you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21). <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is unnecessary to state</b> this <b>about plowing and harvesting during the Sabbatical Year, as it is already stated:</b> “But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land, a Shabbat for the Lord; <b>you shall neither sow your field,</b> nor prune your vineyard” (Leviticus 25:4). <b>Rather,</b> the verse: “In plowing and in harvest you shall rest,” is referring to <b>plowing in the year preceding the Sabbatical Year going into the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., plowing in the sixth year that will benefit the crops growing in the Sabbatical Year, <b>and</b> about <b>harvesting of the Sabbatical Year going into the year that follows the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., harvesting grain that grew in the Sabbatical Year in the eighth year. This teaches that there is a requirement to add extra time to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year, and not work the land both before and after.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that the verse: “In plowing and in harvest you shall rest,” is not referring to the prohibition against farming the land before and after the Sabbatical Year as Rabbi Akiva explains. He explains that the reason that the verse mentions these two particular forms of labor is to teach that <b>just as</b> the type of <b>plowing</b> that is prohibited during the Sabbatical Year <b>is</b> an otherwise <b>voluntary</b> act, as plowing is never required by the Torah, <b>so too,</b> the <b>harvesting</b> that is prohibited during that year <b>is</b> only <b>voluntary</b> harvesting. This comes <b>to exclude the harvesting of the <i>omer</i></b> from the prohibition, <b>as it is a mitzva.</b> The barley for the <i>omer</i> must be harvested on the sixteenth of Nisan. Consequently, it is permitted to harvest the <i>omer</i> even during the Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>from where does Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive this principle <b>that</b> one <b>extends</b> a sacred time period by <b>adding from the profane to the sacred</b> both before and after? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, in reference to Yom Kippur: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth of the month</b> in the evening” (Leviticus 23:32). One <b>might</b> have thought that one must begin to fast the entire day <b>on the ninth</b> of the month. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “In the evening.”</b> But <b>if</b> it is so that Yom Kippur begins <b>in the evening,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that one need only begin to fast <b>from when it is dark,</b> after nightfall, when the tenth day of the month begins. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “On the ninth.” How so;</b> how is this to be accomplished? <b>One begins to fast</b> on the ninth of the month <b>while it is still day. This teaches that one</b> extends a sacred time period by <b>adding</b> at the beginning <b>from the profane to the sacred.</b>
From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this addition is made <b>at the beginning</b> of Yom Kippur. But <b>from where</b> do I derive that a similar addition is made <b>at the end of</b> Yom Kippur? <b>The verse states: “From evening to evening</b> shall you rest on your Shabbat” (Leviticus 23:32), which teaches that just as Yom Kippur is extended at the beginning, so too, it is extended at the end.
From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that an extension is added to <b>Yom Kippur. From where</b> is it derived that one must also extend <b>Shabbat? The verse states: “You shall rest [<i>tishbetu</i>],”</b> which is referring to Yom Kippur but alludes to Shabbat. <b>From where</b> do I know that the same applies to <b>Festivals? The verse states: “Your Shabbat [<i>shabbatkhem</i>],”</b> your day of rest. <b>How so? Wherever there is</b> a mitzva of <b>resting,</b> be it Shabbat or a Festival, <b>one adds from the profane to the sacred,</b> extending the sacred time at both ends.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who learns that one adds from the profane to the sacred from the verse dealing with the Sabbatical Year, <b>what does he do with</b> this verse: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth</b> of the month in the evening”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for</b> that <b>which was taught by Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti, as Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth</b> of the month.” <b>Is the fasting on the ninth? But isn’t the fasting on</b> Yom Kippur on <b>the tenth</b> of Tishrei? <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to teach you: Whoever eats and drinks on the ninth,</b> thereby preparing himself for the fast on the next day, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit

Daf 9b

<b>as though he fasted on</b> both the <b>ninth and the tenth.</b>
§ The Gemara continues with the topic of the Jubilee Year. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a Jubilee for you” (Leviticus 25:10). The words <b>“it shall be a Jubilee”</b> come to teach that <b>although they did not release</b> property to its original owners, and <b>although they did not sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, it is nevertheless a Jubilee Year, and the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee year apply. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>although they did not send</b> free the slaves it is also still a Jubilee Year. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “It shall be,”</b> this being a term of limitation. This teaches that at least one of the essential <i>halakhot</i> of the year must be observed, and if not, it is not a Jubilee Year. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: “It shall be a Jubilee</b> for you”; <b>although they did not release</b> property to its original owners, and <b>although they did not send</b> free the slaves, it is nevertheless a Jubilee Year. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>although they did not sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, it is also still a Jubilee Year. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “It shall be.”</b> Some act must be performed. In this case, the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded, otherwise it is not a Jubilee Year.
Rabbi Yosei explains his position: <b>Since one verse includes</b> situations where the Jubilee is in force, <b>and another verse excludes</b> such situations, <b>for what</b> reason <b>do I say</b> that <b>it is a Jubilee Year although they did not send</b> free the slaves, <b>but it is a Jubilee Year only if they sounded</b> the <i>shofar</i>? This is <b>since it is possible that there would be no sending</b> free of slaves, as perhaps no one has any slaves to release, <b>but it is impossible that there would be no sounding of the <i>shofar</i>,</b> as a <i>shofar</i> can always be found. Therefore, it must be that it is the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> that is the indispensable criterion for the Jubilee Year.
<b>Alternatively: This,</b> sounding the <i>shofar</i>, <b>is given over to the court,</b> which is obligated to blow it. <b>But that,</b> setting the slaves free, <b>is not given over to the court</b> but to each individual slave owner. It stands to reason that the indispensable criterion is one that is in the hands of the court and not in the hands of individuals.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the need for Rabbi Yosei to add: <b>Alternatively?</b> Why is his first explanation insufficient? The Gemara answers: It is necessary, <b>as, if you say</b> that <b>it is impossible that there should not be</b> at least <b>one</b> slave owner <b>at the end of the world,</b> and therefore it is inconceivable that there will ever be a time when there are <b>no</b> slaves that are <b>set free,</b> you can nevertheless say that <b>this,</b> sounding the <i>shofar</i>, <b>is given over to the court, but that,</b> setting the slaves free, <b>is not given over to the court.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> this is clear <b>according to Rabbi Yosei, as he has stated his reasoning. But according to Rabbi Yehuda, what is the reason</b> that the indispensable criterion for the Jubilee Year is sending free the slaves? The Gemara explains: <b>The verse states: “And you shall proclaim liberty [<i>deror</i>] throughout all the land</b> to all its inhabitants,” and immediately afterward it says: “It shall be a Jubilee for you.” <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>a verse may be expounded in reference to the</b> immediately <b>preceding clause, but not in reference to the clause before that.</b> Therefore, the exclusion implied by the words “it shall be,” is referring to what is stated in the immediately preceding clause: “And you shall proclaim liberty throughout all the land,” i.e., the emancipation of slaves. It is not referring to what is stated in the clause before that: “On Yom Kippur shall you sound the <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land.”
The Gemara asks: It is clear that <b>according to everyone</b> the term <b>“<i>deror</i>”</b> is a word <b>meaning liberty. From where</b> may this <b>be inferred?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word <b><i>deror</i> is</b> a term <b>meaning only liberty. Rabbi Yehuda said: What is the meaning of the word <i>deror</i>?</b> It is <b>like a man who dwells [<i>medayyer</i>] in any dwelling [<i>dayyara</i>] and moves merchandise around the entire country,</b> i.e., he can live and do business wherever he wants.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, but the Rabbis say:</b> All <b>three of them are indispensable for</b> the Jubilee Year: Releasing property, sounding the <i>shofar</i>, and liberating the slaves. <b>They hold</b> that <b>a verse may be interpreted in reference to the</b> immediately <b>preceding clause, in reference to the clause before that, and</b> it may also be interpreted <b>in reference to the clause following it,</b> as all of these <i>halakhot</i> are mentioned in this section, and the exclusion implied by the words “it shall be” applies to all of them.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written “Jubilee</b> Year,” which is a term of inclusion that should counter the exclusionary function of the words: “It shall be”? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> term “Jubilee Year” comes to teach that the mitzva of the Jubilee applies <b>even outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it written: “Throughout the land,”</b> implying that it applies only in Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> term, “throughout the land,” comes to teach that <b>when liberation applies in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>it applies outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael as well, and <b>when</b> liberation <b>does not apply in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>it does not apply outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael either.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the New Year <b>for planting.</b> It determines the years of <i>orla</i>, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “Three years</b> shall it be <b>prohibited [<i>arelim</i>]</b> to you; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“And in the fourth year</b> all its fruit will be sacred for giving praise to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24). <b>And</b> it is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Tishrei, as it is written</b> with regard to Tishrei: <b>“From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12).
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us derive</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Nisan, as it is written</b> with regard to Nisan: <b>“It shall be the first month of the year to you”</b> (Exodus 12:2). The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> as it appears in the verse about the <i>orla</i>, where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it, from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> as it appears in the verse in Deuteronomy above, where <b>months are</b> also <b>not</b> mentioned <b>with it. And</b> they <b>do not derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> as it appears in the verse where <b>months are</b> mentioned <b>with it,</b> i.e., “It shall be the first month of the year for you.”
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one plants</b> a tree, or <b>layers</b> a vine shoot into the ground so that it may take root, <b>or grafts</b> a branch onto a tree <b>on the eve of the Sabbatical Year thirty days before Rosh HaShana,</b> as soon as Rosh HaShana arrives, <b>a year is counted for him.</b> The thirty days count as a full year with regard to the prohibition of <i>orla</i>, <b>and it is permitted to preserve</b> the plant <b>during the Sabbatical Year,</b> as this is not considered new growth. However, if one performed these actions <b>less than thirty days before Rosh HaShana,</b> then when Rosh HaShana arrives, <b>a year is not counted for him</b> for <i>orla</i>, <b>and it is prohibited to preserve</b> the new growth <b>during the Sabbatical Year.</b>

Daf 10a

<b>And</b> if the planting, layering, or grafting took place more than thirty days before Rosh HaShana, <b>the fruit of this planting is prohibited until the fifteenth of Shevat</b> of the fourth year since the tree’s planting, even though the three years were already completed the previous Rosh HaShana. This principle applies <b>both for <i>orla</i> during</b> the year of <b><i>orla</i>,</b> when it is prohibited to eat the fruit, <b>and for fourth-year produce during</b> the year of <b>fourth-year produce,</b> which must be eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed before it is eaten outside Jerusalem.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that the prohibitions of <i>orla</i> and fourth-year produce extend past Tishrei until the fifteenth of Shevat? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and</b> some <b>determined</b> that <b>it</b> was stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Yannai: The verse states:</b> “Three years shall it be as prohibited to you; it shall not be eaten. <b>And in the fourth year</b> all its fruit shall be sacred for praise-giving to the Lord. <b>And in the fifth year</b> shall you eat of its fruit, that it may yield to you its increase; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:23–25).
The <i>baraita</i> explains: The repetition of the word “and,” indicated by the conjunctive <i>vav</i> that joins these verses, teaches that <b>there are times that</b> the tree is already <b>in its fourth</b> year <b>and yet</b> the fruit <b>is forbidden as <i>orla</i>,</b> from the verses “three years…and in the fourth year”; <b>and there are times that</b> the tree is already <b>in its fifth</b> year <b>and yet</b> the fruit <b>is forbidden as fourth-year produce,</b> from the verses “in the fourth year…and in the fifth year.”
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, didn’t Rabbi Meir say</b> that even <b>one day in a year is considered a year? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b>bullock [<i>par</i>] mentioned in the Torah without specification</b> is referring to a bullock that <b>is twenty-four months and one day old,</b> as although it is known by tradition that a bullock is three years old, once it is one day into its third year, it is already considered three years old; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The term bullock is referring to an animal that is <b>twenty-four months and thirty days old. As Rabbi Meir would say: Wherever a calf [<i>egel</i>] is stated in the Torah without specification,</b> the reference is to a calf that is <b>one year old; a young ox [<i>ben bakar</i>]</b> is referring to a cow that is <b>two years old;</b> and <b>a bullock</b> is referring to a cow that is <b>three years old.</b> Since the <i>baraita</i> dealing with planting requires that the tree be planted thirty days before Rosh HaShana, rather than one day, it would seem that it is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it can be explained as follows. <b>When Rabbi Meir said</b> that <b>one day in a year is considered</b> a full <b>year,</b> this is only when the day is <b>at the end of the year;</b> since the count of a new year is about to begin, the day is considered like a whole year. <b>But</b> if the day is <b>at the beginning of the year,</b> that one day is <b>not</b> considered like a whole year.
Against this claim <b>Rava said: But</b> can we <b>not</b> invoke an <b><i>a fortiori</i> argument</b> to prove just the opposite? <b>Whereas</b> in the case of <b>a menstruating woman, where the beginning of the day is not counted</b> as a full day <b>at the end</b> of her seven-day period of ritual impurity and instead she must wait until the end of the seventh day and immerse in a ritual bath only in the evening, yet nevertheless <b>the end of the day is counted</b> as a full day <b>at the beginning</b> of her ritually impure period, since if she experienced bleeding shortly before sunset that day is considered as the first day of her seven-day period of impurity; if so, in the case of <b>a year, where one day is counted</b> as a full year <b>at the end</b> of the year,

Daf 10b

<b>is it not right that one day should count</b> as a full year <b>at the beginning</b> of the year?
<b>Rather, what</b> opinion does it follow? If the <i>baraita</i> was not taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, does it follow the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that only thirty days are considered like a year? If so, then <b>thirty</b> days <b>and</b> another <b>thirty days are required:</b> Thirty days for the planting to take root, and another thirty days to count as a year. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may not plant, layer, or graft</b> trees on the <b>eve of the Sabbatical Year less than thirty days before Rosh HaShana, and if one planted, layered, or grafted, he must uproot</b> it, as the planting will take root only in the seventh year; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Yehuda says: Any grafting that does not take root within three days will never take root. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: Two weeks</b> are needed for the planting to take root.
<b>And</b> on this topic <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: According to the statement of the one who says thirty</b> days, this means that <b>it requires thirty</b> days for the planting to take root <b>and</b> another <b>thirty</b> days to count as a year. <b>And according to the statement of the one who says three days,</b> this means that <b>it requires thirty-three days. And according to the statement of the one who says two weeks,</b> this means that <b>it requires two weeks</b> for the planting to take root <b>and</b> another <b>thirty days</b> to count as a year. And <b>if</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that only three days are needed for the planting to take root, <b>it</b> still <b>requires three</b> days for the planting to take root <b>and thirty</b> days to count as a year. If so, the <i>baraita</i> cannot be understood even in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be understood as follows: The <i>baraita</i> was <b>actually</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and when it says thirty</b> days, it is referring to the time needed for the planting <b>to take root.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, it requires thirty-one</b> days; thirty days for the planting to take root and one more day to count as a year. The Gemara answers: This is theoretically correct, but <b>he holds</b> that <b>the thirtieth day is counted for here and for there,</b> i.e., it counts as both the thirtieth day for taking root and as a day that is counted as a year.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar, who disagree about how much time must pass to count as a year, <b>expounded the same verse.</b> As the verse states: <b>“And it came to pass in the one and six hundredth year, in the first month on the first day of the month,</b> that the waters were dried up from off the earth” (Genesis 8:13). <b>Rabbi Meir holds: From the fact that it was</b> only <b>one day into the year,</b> as it was still the first day of the first month, <b>and</b> yet <b>it is called the</b> six hundred and first <b>year, learn from here</b> that <b>one day in a year is</b> already <b>considered a year.</b>
<b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Elazar, expounds the verse as follows. <b>If it had written: In the six hundred and first year,</b> it would be <b>as you said.</b> However, <b>now that it is written: “In the one and six hundredth year,"</b> I can say that the word <b>“year” relates to “six hundredth,”</b> thereby teaching that it is still considered the six hundredth year. And <b>what is</b> meant by <b>“one”?</b> That it is <b>the beginning of one</b> year, but not that the first day counts as a year.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Elazar, what is the rationale</b> for his opinion? From where does he learn that thirty days are counted as a year? <b>As it is written: “In the first month on the first day of the month.” Since it was</b> only <b>one day into the month, and</b> yet <b>it is called a month, learn from here</b> that <b>one day in a month is</b> already <b>considered a month. And since one day in a month is</b> already considered <b>a month,</b> likewise <b>thirty days in a year are</b> already <b>considered a year, as a month</b> is calculated according <b>to its unit, and a year</b> is calculated according <b>to its unit.</b> If one unit by which a month is calculated, i.e., a day, counts as a full month, so too, one unit by which a year is calculated, i.e., a month, counts as a full year.
§ The Gemara comments: <b>By inference, both of them,</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar, <b>hold</b> that <b>the world was created in Nisan</b> and that the years are counted from that month, as, if the world were created in Tishrei and the count started then, the first day of the first month of the six hundred and first year would already have been six months into the year for the purpose of counting years.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed about this point: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: In Tishrei the world was created; in Tishrei the Patriarchs were born; in Tishrei the Patriarchs died; on Passover Isaac was born; on Rosh HaShana Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered</b> by God and conceived; <b>on Rosh HaShana Joseph came out from prison;</b>

Daf 11a

<b>on Rosh HaShana our forefathers’ slavery in Egypt ceased; in Nisan</b> the Jewish people <b>were redeemed</b> from Egypt; and <b>in Tishrei in the future</b> the Jewish people <b>will be redeemed</b> in the final redemption with the coming of the Messiah.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> disagrees and <b>says: In Nisan the world was created; in Nisan the Patriarchs were born; in Nisan the Patriarchs died; on Passover Isaac was born; on Rosh HaShana Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered</b> by God and conceived sons; <b>on Rosh HaShana Joseph came out from prison; on Rosh HaShana our forefathers’ slavery in Egypt ceased; in Nisan</b> the Jewish people <b>were redeemed</b> from Egypt; <b>and in Nisan in the future</b> the Jewish people <b>will be redeemed</b> in the final redemption.
The Gemara explains these matters in detail: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the world was created in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei? As it is stated: “And God said: Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind”</b> (Genesis 1:11). <b>Which is the month in which the earth brings forth grass and the trees are full of</b> ripe <b>fruit? You must say</b> that <b>this is Tishrei.</b> And a further proof that the world was created in Tishrei is that when the world was first created, it needed rain so that the plants would grow, <b>and the period</b> beginning with Tishrei <b>is a time of rain, and rain fell and</b> the plants <b>grew, as it is stated: “But there went up a mist from the earth,</b> and watered the whole face of the ground” (Genesis 2:6).
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the world was created in</b> the month of <b>Nisan? As it is stated: “And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed</b> after its kind, <b>and tree yielding fruit”</b> (Genesis 1:12). <b>Which is the month in which the earth is full of grass and the trees</b> begin to <b>bring forth fruit? You must say</b> that <b>this is Nisan.</b> And further proof that the world was created in Nisan is that when the world was first created, the animals had to breed in order to fill the world, <b>and the period</b> beginning with Nisan <b>is a time when cattle, and beasts, and birds mate with one another, as it is stated: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows,</b> and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” (Psalms 65:14).
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Eliezer, <b>isn’t it written: “And tree yielding fruit,”</b> indicating that the world was created at a time when the trees were just beginning to form their fruit? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written as a blessing for</b> future <b>generations,</b> that then too they will form their fruit.
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>isn’t it written: “Fruit tree,”</b> indicating that the world was created in a season when the trees were already filled with their fruit? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse may be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: All</b> the <b>acts of Creation</b> were created <b>with their</b> full <b>stature,</b> immediately fit to bear fruit; <b>they were created with their</b> full mental <b>capacities; they were created with their</b> full <b>form. As it is stated: “And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their host”</b> (Genesis 2:1). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“their host [<i>tzeva’am</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as <b>their form [<i>tzivyonam</i>],</b> which implies that the trees were created filled with ripe fruit.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that in Tishrei the Patriarchs were born? As it is stated: “And all the men of Israel assembled themselves before King Solomon at the feast in the month of the mighty [<i>eitanim</i>],</b> which is the seventh month” (I Kings 8:2), i.e., Tishrei. What is the meaning of the phrase: The month of the mighty? It is <b>the month in which the mighty ones of the world,</b> i.e., the Patriarchs, <b>were born.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that</b> the term <b><i>eitan</i> denotes mighty? As it is written: “Strong [<i>eitan</i>] is Your dwelling place,</b> and You put Your nest in a rock” (Numbers 24:21). <b>And it says: “Hear, O mountains, the Lord’s controversy, and you strong [<i>eitanim</i>] foundations of the earth”</b> (Micah 6:2), which is a call to the Patriarchs. <b>And it says: “The voice of my beloved; behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills”</b> (Song of Songs 2:8): <b>“Leaping upon the mountains”</b> means that the redemption will arrive early <b>in the merit of the Patriarchs,</b> who are called mountains, and <b>“skipping upon the hills”</b> means that it will come <b>in the merit of the Matriarchs.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that in Nisan the Patriarchs were born? As it is stated: “And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv”</b> (I Kings 6:1). This means <b>in the month in which the radiant ones [<i>zivtanei</i>] of the world,</b> the Patriarchs, <b>were born.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>isn’t it written: “In the month of the mighty,”</b> which indicates that the Patriarchs were born in Tishrei? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it means <b>that</b> the month <b>is mighty in mitzvot,</b> due to the many Festivals that occur in Tishrei.
The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Eliezer, <b>isn’t it written: “In the month of Ziv”?</b> The Gemara answers: Ziv is not an allusion to the Patriarchs. Rather, it means that Nisan is the month <b>in which there is radiance [<i>ziv</i>] for the trees. As Rav Yehuda said: One who goes out during the days of Nisan and sees trees that are blossoming recites: Blessed…Who has withheld nothing from His world and has created in it beautiful creatures and beautiful trees for human beings to enjoy.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>The one who said</b> that <b>in Nisan</b> the Patriarchs <b>were born</b> also holds that <b>in Nisan they died. The one who says</b> that <b>in Tishrei they were born</b> also holds that <b>in Tishrei they died, as it is stated</b> about Moses on the day of his death: <b>“And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “today,”</b> since it is clear that Moses was speaking on that day, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “today”?</b> It is to teach that Moses was speaking precisely, as if to say: <b>Today my days and years are</b> exactly <b>filled</b> and completed. This comes <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and fills the years of the righteous from day to day</b> and <b>from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill”</b> (Exodus 23:26). Similarly, the Patriarchs merited that their years be fulfilled to the day, and so they died on the same date they were born.
It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Passover Isaac was born.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written</b> that the angel who informed Sarah that she would bear a son told Abraham: <b>“At the appointed time [<i>mo’ed</i>] I will return to you,</b> at this season, and Sarah shall have a son” (Genesis 18:14). This is understood to mean: At the time of the next Festival [<i>mo’ed</i>]. <b>When did</b> the angel say this? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>on Passover and he said to him</b> that Sarah would have a son <b>on <i>Shavuot</i>, can</b> a woman <b>give birth after</b> only <b>fifty days? Rather,</b> say <b>that it was <i>Shavuot</i> and he said</b> that she would give birth on the Festival that occurs <b>in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei,</b> i.e., <i>Sukkot</i>. But <b>still, can she give birth after</b> only <b>five months? Rather,</b> you must say <b>that it was <i>Sukkot</i>, and he spoke about</b> the Festival that occurs <b>in</b> the month of <b>Nisan,</b> i.e., Passover.
The Gemara asks further: But <b>still, can</b> a woman <b>give birth after</b> only <b>six months?</b> The Gemara answers: A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>That year was a leap year,</b> in which an additional month of Adar was added before Nisan, and a woman can indeed give birth after seven months. The Gemara raises another question: <b>Ultimately, if one deducts</b> Sarah’s <b>days of ritual impurity,</b> as when the angel spoke Sarah had not yet conceived, and there is a tradition that on that day she began menstruating, as is alluded to in the verse: “After I am grown old, shall I have pleasure” (Genesis 18:12), <b>there are less</b> than seven months.
<b>Mar Zutra said: Even according to the one who said</b> that if a woman <b>gives birth</b> to a viable baby <b>in</b> her <b>ninth</b> month, <b>she cannot give birth prematurely,</b> and if she does not complete nine full months’ gestation the baby will not survive, nevertheless, <b>if</b> a woman <b>gives birth in</b> her <b>seventh</b> month, <b>she may give birth early,</b> before the seventh month is complete. <b>As it is stated</b> about the birth of Samuel: <b>“And it came to pass after cycles of days</b> that Hannah conceived and bore a son” (I Samuel 1:20), which is understood as follows: <b>The minimum of “cycles,”</b> seasons of three months, <b>is two, and the minimum of “days” is two.</b> Consequently, it is possible for a woman to give birth after a pregnancy of six months and two days.
It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Rosh HaShana, Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were revisited</b> by God and conceived children. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>revisiting [<i>pekida</i>]</b> and another instance of the term <b>revisiting,</b> and by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>remembering [<i>zekhira</i>]</b> and another instance of the word <b>remembering. It is written about Rachel: “And God remembered Rachel”</b> (Genesis 30:22), <b>and it is written about Hannah: “And the Lord remembered her”</b> (I Samuel 1:19). <b>And</b> the meaning of these instances of the term <b>remembering</b> is <b>derived</b> from another instance of the term <b>remembering, with regard to Rosh HaShana, as it is written: “A solemn rest, memorial proclaimed with the blast</b> of a <i>shofar</i>” (Leviticus 23:24). From here it is derived that Rachel and Hannah were remembered by God on Rosh HaShana.
And the meaning of one instance of the term <b>revisiting</b> is derived from another instance of the term <b>revisiting.</b> It is written about Hannah: “And the Lord revisited Hannah” (I Samuel 2:21), and it is written about Sarah: “And the Lord revisited Sarah” (Genesis 21:1). From here it is derived that just as Hannah was revisited on Rosh HaShana, so too, Sarah was revisited on Rosh HaShana.
It was further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Rosh HaShana Joseph came out of prison.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “Sound a <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, at the covered time of our Festival day. For this is a statute for Israel,</b> a judgment of the God of Jacob” (Psalms 81:4–5). This is a reference to Rosh HaShana, the only Festival that occurs at the time of the New Moon, when the moon is covered and cannot be seen.

Daf 11b

And immediately afterward it is written: <b>“This He ordained in Joseph for testimony, when he went out</b> over the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:6), implying that Joseph’s release from prison took place on Rosh HaShana.
It was also taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Rosh HaShana our forefathers’ slavery in Egypt ceased.</b> From where is this known? <b>It is written here: “And I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:6); <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to Joseph: <b>“I removed his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7). From here it is derived by verbal analogy between the two instances of the word “burden” that just as Joseph was released from prison in Tishrei, so too, the slavery of our forefathers in Egypt ended in Tishrei.
It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In Nisan</b> our forefathers <b>were redeemed</b> from Egypt, <b>as it is</b> explicitly stated in the Torah. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In Tishrei in the future</b> the Jewish people <b>will be redeemed</b> in the final redemption. <b>This is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b><i>shofar</i></b> and another instance of the word <b><i>shofar</i>. It is written here,</b> with regard to Rosh HaShana: <b>“Sound a <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon”</b> (Psalms 81:4), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to the final redemption: “And it shall come to pass <b>on that day, that a great <i>shofar</i> shall be blown”</b> (Isaiah 27:13).
It was also taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: In Nisan</b> our forefathers <b>were redeemed</b> from Egypt; <b>and in Nisan in the future</b> the Jewish people <b>will be redeemed</b> in the final redemption. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the final redemption will be in Nisan? <b>The verse states: “It is a night of watching</b> for the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt; this is the Lord’s night of watching, for all the children of Israel throughout their generations” (Exodus 12:42). This teaches that the night of Passover is <b>a night that has been continuously watched,</b> i.e., set aside for the purpose of redemption, <b>from the six days of Creation,</b> and it will continue to be so until the final redemption.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Eliezer, understand this verse? He derives from it that this is <b>a night that is continuously watched</b> and protected <b>from demons,</b> meaning that demons have no power on the first night of Passover.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>follow their</b> lines of <b>reasoning,</b> as they disagreed about this same issue in another context as well. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month,</b> on that day were all the fountains of the great deep broken open, and the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: That day was the seventeenth of Iyyar,</b> the second month of the year counting from Nisan, which is <b>the day that the constellation of <i>Kima</i> sets during the day and</b> the season that <b>the springs diminish</b> with the increased heat. <b>But because</b> the people of the generation of the flood <b>changed their actions</b> for the worse, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, changed for them the acts of Creation, and</b> instead of <i>Kima</i> setting, <b>He caused the constellation of <i>Kima</i> to rise during the day and He removed two stars from <i>Kima</i>, and</b> in this way <b>He brought a flood to the world.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> disagrees and <b>says: That day was the seventeenth of Marḥeshvan,</b> the second month counting from Tishrei, which is <b>the day that the constellation of <i>Kima</i> rises during the day and</b> the season that <b>the springs increase.</b>

Daf 12a

<b>But because</b> the people <b>changed their actions</b> for the worse, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, changed for them the acts of Creation and He caused the constellation of <i>Kima</i> to rise during the day, and He removed two stars</b> from it <b>and He brought a flood to the world.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who holds that the flood began in the month of Iyyar, <b>this is as it is written:</b> “In the <b>second</b> month,” which is referring to the month of Iyyar, the second month from Nisan. <b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that the flood began in the month of Marḥeshvan, <b>what is</b> the meaning of “the <b>second</b> month”? The Gemara answers: It means <b>second to</b> the month that includes the day of <b>judgment,</b> which is the month of Tishrei.
The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who holds that the flood began in the month of Iyyar, <b>this is</b> what it means that <b>He changed</b> the acts of Creation with a flood, as rain does not usually fall in Iyyar. <b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that the flood began in Marḥeshvan, <b>what did He change?</b>
The Gemara answers: Even according to Rabbi Eliezer a change was made, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said: They sinned with boiling</b> heat, <b>and they were punished with boiling</b> heat; <b>they sinned with the boiling</b> heat <b>of the sin</b> of forbidden sexual relations, <b>and they were punished with the boiling</b> heat of scalding waters. This is derived from a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the flood: <b>“And the waters abated”</b> (Genesis 8:1), <b>and it is written elsewhere,</b> with regard to King Ahasuerus: <b>“And the heated</b> anger <b>of the king abated”</b> (Esther 7:10), which implies that the word “abated” means cooled. This indicates that at first the waters of the flood had been scalding hot.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish Sages count</b> the years <b>from</b> Creation and <b>the flood in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> from Tishrei, and they calculate <b>the cycles</b> of the sun and the moon <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> from Nisan. <b>The sages of the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world,</b> on the other hand, <b>count both</b> the years <b>from</b> Creation and <b>the flood in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> from Nisan.
§ The mishna taught: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the new year <b>for vegetables.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The first of Tishrei is the new year <b>for vegetables, and for tithes, and for vows.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term: <b>For vegetables?</b> It means <b>for</b> the <b>vegetable tithe,</b> i.e., one may not take <i>teruma</i> or tithes from vegetables picked before Rosh HaShana in order to fulfill the obligation for vegetables picked after Rosh HaShana.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>this is the same as</b> the meaning of the term <b>for tithes,</b> and yet the <i>baraita</i> distinguishes between them. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> first about a tithe that is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, i.e., the vegetable tithe, that its new year is the first of Tishrei, <b>and</b> then <b>it teaches</b> about a tithe that is <b>by Torah</b> law, i.e., the tithe of grain, wine, and oil, that its new year is also the first of Tishrei.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that which is <b>by Torah</b> law <b>in the first clause.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to vegetable tithes <b>was dear to him, he mentioned it first.</b> He taught first about the tithe that is by rabbinic decree, as it involves a greater novelty, and afterward he taught about the tithe that is by Torah law. The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, who mentioned only vegetables but not tithes, what is his reasoning? The Gemara explains: <b>He taught</b> vegetable tithes, which are <b>by rabbinic decree, and</b> from which one may infer <b>all the more so</b> that the first of Tishrei is the new year for the tithe of grain, wine, and oil, which is by Torah law.
The Gemara raises a question about the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: Tithe,</b> in the singular. Why teach tithes in the plural? The Gemara answers: He uses this formulation to include <b>both</b> the <b>animal tithe and</b> the <b>grain tithe.</b> The Gemara asks further: <b>But let him teach: Vegetable,</b> in the singular. Why teach: Vegetables, in the plural? The Gemara answers: He means to include <b>two categories of vegetables, as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a</b> type of <b>vegetable that is</b> usually <b>made into bundles</b> before being sold, the time of tithing is <b>from when it is bundled; and</b> with regard to a type of vegetable <b>that is not</b> usually <b>made into</b> such <b>bundles,</b> the time of tithing is <b>from when one fills a vessel</b> with it.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one picked vegetables on the eve of Rosh HaShana before the sun had set,</b> so that they belong to the previous year, <b>and</b> then <b>he returned and he picked</b> more vegetables

Daf 12b

<b>after sunset,</b> so that they belong to the new year, <b>one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithe from the one to the other, as one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithe from the new</b> crop <b>for the old nor from the old</b> crop <b>for the new. If it was the second</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>going into the third</b> year, the <i>halakha</i> is: From what he picked in <b>the second</b> year he must set aside <b>first tithe,</b> which he gives to a Levite, <b>and second tithe,</b> which he eats in Jerusalem; from what he picked in <b>the third</b> year, he must set aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe,</b> which he gives to one who is needy.
<b>From where are these matters</b> derived that during the third year one must set aside poor man’s tithe and not second tithe? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> The verse states: <b>“When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your produce in the third year, which is the year of the tithe”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). This is referring to <b>a year when there is only one</b> of the two <b>tithes</b> that had been given in the previous years. <b>How so?</b> One sets aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe,</b> which is explicitly mentioned in that section, <b>and second tithe is nullified</b> that year.
<b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is not</b> like this, <b>but</b> in fact <b>even first tithe is nullified</b> during the third year and only one tithe is set aside, i.e., the poor man’s tithe. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them: When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance”</b> (Numbers 18:26). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> the first tithe that is given to the Levites <b>to an inheritance</b> of land: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>an inheritance there is no interruption,</b> as by Torah law a landed inheritance cannot be sold in perpetuity, but rather it passes from one generation to the next without interruption, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>first tithe</b> that is given to the Levites <b>there is no interruption,</b> but rather it is taken every year.
The same <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“When you have made an end of tithing</b> all the tithes of your produce in the third year, which is the year of the tithe.” This is referring to <b>the year when there is only one</b> of the two <b>tithes</b> that had been given in the previous years. <b>How so?</b> One sets aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe, and second tithe is canceled.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that even first tithe is canceled</b> during the third year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the Levite,</b> because he has no part or inheritance with you, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, <b>shall come,</b> and shall eat and be satisfied” (Deuteronomy 14:29). <b>Whenever</b> the Levite <b>comes, give him;</b> every year you must give the Levite his tithe. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: One need not</b> learn this from here but from another source, as <b>it says: “Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them: When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance.” The verse juxtaposes</b> the first tithe <b>to an inheritance</b> of land: <b>Just as</b> with regard to a landed <b>inheritance there is no interruption, so too,</b> with regard to <b>first tithe there is no interruption.</b>
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the new year <b>for vows. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> who is <b>prohibited by a vow</b> from <b>deriving benefit from another for a year counts twelve months from day to day,</b> from the day that the vow was taken. This applies whether one took a vow not to derive any benefit from another for a year, or he was the subject of someone else’s vow prohibiting him from deriving any benefit from that individual’s property for a year. <b>But if,</b> when he took the vow, <b>he said: For this year,</b> then <b>even if he took</b> the vow <b>only on the twenty-ninth of Elul, once the first day of Tishrei,</b> the following month, <b>has arrived, it is counted as a year,</b> and he is permitted to derive benefit from the other.
The Gemara comments: This is true <b>even according to the one who said</b> that <b>one day in a year is not considered a year,</b> since in the case of a vow the person <b>accepted upon himself to suffer affliction, and he has</b> already achieved his goal and <b>suffered affliction,</b> and so he has fulfilled his vow.
The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> that a year with regard to vows ends in <b>Nisan.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>with regard to vows, follow the</b> ordinary <b>language of people.</b> The meaning of a vow is understood in accordance with the way that the words are used in common speech, and when people speak of a year, they ordinarily count it from the beginning of Tishrei.
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:3): From when is produce obligated in tithes? <b>Fenugreek</b> is obligated <b>from</b> the time <b>when it sprouts. Grain and olives</b> are obligated <b>from</b> the time <b>when they have reached one-third</b> of their growth.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>From</b> the time <b>when it sprouts?</b> Fenugreek begins to sprout almost immediately after it is planted. The Gemara answers: It means <b>from</b> the time <b>when it sprouts for seed,</b> i.e., from the time that its seeds are sufficiently developed to sprout into another crop.
It was taught in the mishna: <b>Grain and olives</b> are obligated in tithes <b>from</b> the time <b>when they have reached one-third</b> of their growth. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that the years of produce follow the first third of their growth? <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and</b> some <b>determined</b> that this statement was said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The verse states: “At the end of every seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:10). <b>What is the purpose of the Sabbatical Year</b> being mentioned <b>with the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>?</b> The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is already <b>the eighth</b> year.
<b>Rather,</b> it comes <b>to tell you</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year continue to apply on <i>Sukkot</i> of the following year, as <b>you must treat all produce that reached one-third</b> of its growth <b>in the Sabbatical Year before Rosh HaShana with the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year,</b> even if it fully grows and is able to be used only <b>in the eighth</b> year.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi:</b>

Daf 13a

<b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring to produce that <b>did not grow at all</b> during the seventh year, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year <b>continue to apply until the festival of <i>Sukkot</i></b> of the eighth year.
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And the festival of gathering, which is at the end of the year,</b> when you have gathered in your labors out of the field” (Exodus 23:16). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“gathering”? If we say</b> that it means: <b>A Festival that comes at the time of gathering</b> the crops, <b>isn’t it</b> already <b>written: “When you have gathered</b> in your labors”? There is no need to repeat this a second time.
<b>Rather, what is</b> meant here by <b>“gathering”?</b> It means <b>harvesting. And the Sages have</b> an accepted <b>tradition that any grain that</b> reaches full growth so that it <b>is harvested on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>is known</b> to <b>have reached one-third</b> of its growth <b>before Rosh HaShana, and</b> the Torah <b>calls</b> that period of the year until <i>Sukkot</i> <b>“at the end of the year,”</b> thereby indicating that it is still subject to the <i>halakhot</i> governing the previous year.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And are the Sages</b> able to <b>discern</b> precisely <b>between</b> produce that reached <b>one-third</b> of its growth <b>and</b> produce that reached <b>less than one-third</b> of its growth? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Do I not</b> always <b>tell you that you must not take yourself out</b> of the bounds of <b>the <i>halakha</i>? All the measures of the Sages are like this;</b> they are precise and exact.
For example, <b>one who immerses himself in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water is rendered pure, but <b>in forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> the tiny amount of <b>a <i>kortov</i>,</b> he <b>cannot immerse</b> and become pure <b>in them.</b> Similarly, <b>an egg-bulk</b> of impure food <b>can render</b> other <b>food ritually impure,</b> but <b>an egg-bulk less</b> even the tiny amount of <b>a sesame</b> seed <b>does not render food ritually impure.</b>
So too, a piece of cloth <b>three by three</b> handbreadths in size <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading,</b> but a piece of cloth <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>less one hair [<i>nima</i>] is not susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya then said: What I said is nothing,</b> and my question had no basis, as it can be demonstrated that the Sages know how to determine that produce has reached one-third of its growth. <b>As Rav Kahana was</b> once <b>asked by the</b> other <b>colleagues</b> of the academy as follows: With regard to <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>that the Jewish people brought when they</b> first <b>entered Eretz Yisrael</b> in the days of Joshua, <b>from where did they bring it? If you say</b> that this <i>omer</i> offering was brought from grain <b>that grew in the possession of a gentile,</b> there is a difficulty, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “You shall bring an <i>omer</i> of the first fruits of <b>your harvest</b> to the priest” (Leviticus 23:13), from which it can be derived that it must be your harvest, grown in the possession of a Jew, <b>and not the harvest of a gentile.</b>
The Gemara first questions the assumption of Rav Kahana’s colleagues: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the Jewish people actually <b>brought</b> an <i>omer</i> offering that year? <b>Perhaps they did not offer</b> it at all. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And they did eat of the produce of the land on the next day after Passover”</b> (Joshua 5:11), which teaches: Only <b>on the next day after Passover did they eat</b> from the new grain, but <b>initially they did not eat</b> from it. Why? It is <b>because they</b> first <b>brought the <i>omer</i></b> offering on the sixteenth of Nisan as is required, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward did they eat</b> from the new grain. Therefore the question remains: <b>From where did they bring</b> the <i>omer</i> offering?
Rav Kahana <b>said to them: Anything that</b> came into the possession of a Jew and <b>did not reach one-third</b> of its growth <b>in the possession of a gentile</b> is fit to be harvested for the sake of the <i>omer</i> offering.
Rabbi Yirmeya concludes his proof: But there, too, one might ask: <b>Perhaps</b> the grain <b>had</b> in fact already <b>reached</b> one-third of its growth, <b>but they could not discern</b> with certainty between grain that had reached one-third of its growth and grain that had not. <b>Rather,</b> you must say that <b>they were able to discern</b> with certainty. <b>Here, too,</b> you can say that the Sages <b>can discern</b> with certainty between produce that has reached one-third of its growth before Rosh HaShana and produce that has not.
The Gemara asks: This is not absolute proof, <b>as perhaps</b> the Jewish people brought the <i>omer</i> offering from grain that <b>did not grow at all</b> before they conquered the land, and the distinction was evident to all. <b>But where</b> produce <b>reached one quarter</b> of its growth, the Sages <b>cannot discern</b> with certainty the difference <b>between one-third and less than one-third.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the</b> first <b>month”</b> (Joshua 4:19). <b>And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say <b>that</b> the grain <b>had not grown at all</b> before the Jewish people entered the land, <b>could it have reached full growth in</b> just <b>five days?</b>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Rather, what</b> can one say? <b>That</b> the grain <b>had reached one quarter or one-sixth [<i>danka</i>]</b> of its growth before the Jewish people conquered the land? This too is difficult, as one can <b>still</b> ask: <b>Could</b> the grain <b>have reached full growth in</b> just <b>five days? Rather, what have you to say?</b> One could say that with regard to Eretz Yisrael <b>it is written: “The land of the deer”</b> (Daniel 11:41), implying that the grain of Eretz Yisrael ripens with the swiftness of a deer. <b>Here, too,</b> one can say that <b>“the land of the deer” is written</b> with regard to Eretz Yisrael and applies to the ripening of the grain, so that it can ripen in just a few days.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanina strongly objects to</b> the proof brought from the verse in Exodus cited above, which refers to <i>Sukkot</i> as the festival of gathering: <b>How can you say</b> that <b>this “gathering” means harvesting? But isn’t it written:</b> “You shall observe the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> seven days, <b>after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), <b>and the Master said</b> about this: <b>The verse speaks</b> here <b>of the waste of the threshing floor and the winepress,</b> which is used to make the roof of the <i>sukka</i>. If so, the gathering mentioned with regard to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is referring not to harvesting but to gathering straw from the threshing floor.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> about this: <b>This matter was in our hands,</b> i.e., I thought that we had solid proof that the years for produce follow the first third of its growth, <b>but Rabbi Ḥanina came and cast an axe upon it,</b> cutting it down, as Rabbi Ḥanina’s objection has totally nullified the proof.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that the years for produce follow the first third of its growth? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it shall bring forth fruit for the three years”</b> (Leviticus 25:21);

Daf 13b

<b>do not read</b> it as <b>“for three [<i>lishelosh</i>]” but</b> as: <b>For one-third [<i>lishelish</i>].</b> And learn from here that the year for tithes is determined by the date on which the produce reaches one-third of its growth.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the phrase <b>is necessary for</b> the meaning of the verse <b>itself,</b> to teach that the sixth year will be blessed so that it yields three years’ worth of produce. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written in another verse: “And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old produce until the ninth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:22), so that the latter verse teaches about the three years’ worth of produce, and the first verse is available to derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one-third growth.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there: Rice, millet, poppy, and sesame that took root before Rosh HaShana are tithed in accordance with the outgoing</b> year, meaning that second tithe is set aside in the first, second, fourth, and fifth years of the Sabbatical cycle, and poor man’s tithe is set aside in the third and sixth years, <b>and they are permitted</b> even if the following year is <b>a Sabbatical Year. If</b> they did <b>not</b> take root before Rosh HaShana, <b>they are prohibited</b> if it is <b>the Sabbatical Year, and</b> in ordinary years <b>they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b>
<b>Rabba said:</b> Say that <b>the Sages said</b> that the tithe year of <b>a tree follows</b> the time of <b>the formation</b> of its fruit, that of <b>grain and olives follows</b> the time that they reach <b>one-third</b> of their growth, and that of <b>vegetables follows</b> the time of their <b>picking.</b> The question may therefore be raised: With regard to <b>these</b> crops, i.e., rice, millet, poppy, and sesame, <b>to what did the Sages equate them?</b> Their tithe year is determined neither by their formation, nor by the time when they reach one-third of their growth, nor by their picking.
<b>Rabba then said:</b> The reason for their uniqueness with regard to tithing is that <b>since</b> these crops do not ripen all at once, but rather, <b>they ripen</b> and are gathered <b>little by little</b> over an extended period of time, if their year were to follow the time of their picking, people might set aside tithes from that which was picked before Rosh HaShana for that which was picked after Rosh HaShana. Therefore, <b>the Sages</b> decreed that their tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of their <b>taking root,</b> which is the same for the entire field.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> Why should they have made such a decree? There is a better alternative: <b>Let one pile</b> the entire stock onto <b>his threshing floor, into</b> the middle of <b>it,</b> mix the stock together well, and then set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and</b> consequently <b>it will turn out that he has set aside <i>teruma</i></b> and tithes <b>from the new</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the new</b> crop <b>in it,</b> and <b>from the old</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the old</b> crop <b>in it.</b>
Abaye continued: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri:</b> If the <b>cowpea</b> plant <b>was planted for seed,</b> not to be eaten as a vegetable but for the seeds, the beans themselves, either for eating or planting, and <b>some took</b> root already before Rosh HaShana, while some took root only after Rosh <b>HaShana, one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> or tithes from this for that, as one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> or tithes from the new</b> crop <b>for the old or from the old</b> crop <b>for the new.</b>
<b>How,</b> then, <b>should one act</b> so that he not err and set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes incorrectly? <b>He should pile</b> the entire stock onto <b>his threshing floor, into</b> the middle of <b>it,</b> mix the stock together well, and then set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and</b> consequently <b>it will turn out that he has set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the new</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the new</b> crop <b>in it, and from the old</b> crop in the mixture <b>for the old</b> crop <b>in it.</b> Why not do the same for rice, millet, poppy, and sesame?
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>You are speaking of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri?</b> You cannot raise an objection from what he says, as <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri holds</b> that <b>there is mixing.</b> He assumes that the old and new were thoroughly mixed, so that the <i>teruma</i> and tithes set aside from the mixture have the same proportions of old and new crops as did the original crops.
<b>But the Sages hold</b> that <b>there is no mixing;</b> they do not assume that the old and new became thoroughly and evenly mixed. Therefore, piling the entire stock, mixing it together, and then setting aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes will not ensure that they are set aside correctly.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar that he said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri. Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this: And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But didn’t Shmuel say: There is no mixing for anything except for wine, oil,</b> and other liquids? In the case of liquids he holds that everything is entirely mixed together, but not in the case of solids. How, then, could he have ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Zeira <b>forgot that which Shmuel said: In all</b> cases, the tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of <b>the full ripening of the produce.</b> Therefore, all of the cowpea seeds may be tithed together, whether the plants from which they grew took root before or after Rosh HaShana. This is not due to Rabbi Shimon Shezuri’s rationale that there is mixing, but because all of the beans reach full ripening at the same time, and consequently, they are all considered produce of the incoming year.

Daf 14a

The Gemara comments: It is <b>necessary</b> to state all three statements of Shmuel in order to clarify his position, <b>as had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, I would have said</b> that this is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he holds</b> that <b>there is mixing</b> even with regard to solids. Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> the second statement, that <b>there is no mixing for anything</b> except wine, oil, and other liquids.
<b>And had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only that <b>there is no mixing for anything</b> except liquids, <b>I would have said</b> that <b>he holds like the Sages</b> with regard to tithes, that the mixture of cowpeas cannot be tithed together. Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.</b>
<b>And had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> statements, <b>I would have said</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Zeira that it is <b>difficult</b> to reconcile one statement <b>of Shmuel with</b> another statement <b>of Shmuel.</b> Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that <b>in all</b> cases, the tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of <b>the full ripening of the produce,</b> and it is for this reason that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.
<b>And had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only that <b>in all</b> cases the tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of <b>the full ripening of the produce, I would have said</b> that this applies <b>even</b> to <b>grain and olives.</b> Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri with regard to his dispute</b> with the Sages, i.e., with regard to beans, but with regard to grain and olives the tithe year follows the time that they reach one-third of their growth.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let him teach us</b> only <b>these two</b> statements, that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri and that in all cases the tithe year follows the full ripening of the fruit, which would suffice to clarify Shmuel’s position. <b>Why do I</b> need to be told that <b>there is no mixing for anything?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> comes to <b>teach us</b> not that there is no mixing for solids, but <b>that there is mixing for wine, oil,</b> and other liquids.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> The verse states: <b>“After you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the grain that is brought to the <b>threshing floor and</b> the wine that is brought to the <b>winepress are special in that they grow on the outgoing year’s water,</b> i.e., the moisture in the ground from the previous winter’s rain, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>they are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year, so too, anything that grows on the outgoing year’s water is tithed in accordance with the outgoing year.</b> This comes to <b>exclude vegetables, which grow on the incoming year’s water,</b> as their growth cycle is short and they are nurtured by the rain that falls while they are growing. Consequently, <b>they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This is the way the verse should be expounded: <b>“After you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”;</b> this teaches us that <b>just as</b> the grain that is brought to the <b>threshing floor and</b> the wine that is brought to the <b>winepress are special in that they grow on most water,</b> i.e., rainfall is sufficient and they do not require irrigation, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>they are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year, so too, anything that grows on most water is tithed in accordance with the outgoing year.</b> This comes to <b>exclude vegetables, which grow on all water,</b> i.e., they require irrigation as well. Consequently, they <b>are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>seedless onions and cowpeas, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Seedless onions,</b> which are cultivated for their greens and not for their bulbs or seeds, <b>and</b> the <b>cowpea</b> plant, which was planted to be eaten as a vegetable, <b>from which one withheld water for thirty days before Rosh HaShana,</b> so that their green portions stopped growing and they began to grow for seed, <b>are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year, and they are permitted</b> if the new year is <b>the Sabbatical Year. And if not, they are prohibited</b> if it is <b>the Sabbatical Year, and</b> in ordinary years <b>they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> depends not on the species of plant but on whether the crop is in fact nurtured by the previous year’s water or the new year’s water, and this mishna is taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.
§ The mishna taught: <b>On the first of Shevat is the new year for trees,</b> according to the statement of Beit Shammai. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the new year for trees was set on this date? <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The reason is <b>since</b> by that time <b>most of the year’s rains have</b> already <b>fallen, and most of the season,</b> i.e., winter, <b>is yet to come,</b> as it continues until the spring equinox, which usually occurs in Nisan.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This is what he said: Even though most of the</b> winter <b>season is yet to come,</b> nevertheless, <b>since most of</b> the <b>year’s rains have</b> already <b>fallen,</b> it is considered the end of the previous year of rain, and anything that grows from then on is considered produce of the next year.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was once <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva, who picked an <i>etrog</i> on the first of Shevat and set aside two tithes.</b> This occurred in the second or the fifth year of the Sabbatical cycle. In the second and fifth years one sets aside second tithe, whereas in the third and sixth years one sets aside poor man’s tithe. Rabbi Akiva set aside both second tithe and poor man’s tithe because he was in doubt about the <i>halakha</i>.

Daf 14b

<b>One</b> tithe was <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that the new year for trees is on the first of Shevat, in which case it was already the third or sixth year, when one must set aside poor man’s tithe; <b>and one</b> tithe was <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel</b> that the new year for trees is on the fifteenth of Shevat, so it was still the second or fifth year, when one must set aside second tithe.
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: He did not act</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. Rather, he acted</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: The <b><i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>is like</b> an ordinary <b>tree in three ways and like a vegetable in one way.</b> How so? <b>It is like</b> an ordinary <b>tree in three ways: With regard to <i>orla</i>,</b> that the fruit of the first three years after the tree is planted is forbidden; <b>with regard to fourth-year produce,</b> that the fruit that grows in the fourth year after the tree is planted must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there or else it must be redeemed; <b>and with regard to the Sabbatical Year,</b> that the year is determined by the time of the formation of its fruit. <b>And</b> the <i>etrog</i> is like <b>a vegetable in one way,</b> which is <b>that its tithe</b> year follows <b>the time of the picking</b> of its fruit; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Gamliel.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The <i>etrog</i> is like</b> fruit of <b>a tree with regard to all matters,</b> and so its tithe year also follows the time of the formation of its fruit. Since Rabbi Akiva was in doubt whether the <i>halakha</i> is ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamliel or Rabbi Eliezer, he set aside two tithes in order to follow both of their opinions.
The Gemara questions Rabbi Akiva’s conduct: <b>But do we adopt the</b> respective <b>stringencies of two</b> authorities who disagree on a series of issues? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel, but one who wishes to act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai may do so,</b> and one who wishes to act <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel may do so.</b> If he adopts both <b>the leniencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the leniencies of Beit Hillel,</b> he is <b>a wicked person.</b> And if he adopts both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> one should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b> If so, why did Rabbi Akiva follow two contradictory stringencies?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> wished to act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, but he <b>was in doubt about his tradition and did not know whether Beit Hillel said</b> that the new year for trees is <b>on the first of Shevat or</b> whether they <b>said</b> that it is <b>on the fifteenth of Shevat,</b> and so he set aside two tithes in order to conform with both possibilities.
The Gemara further clarifies the <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: He did not act</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel; rather, he acted</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The Gemara asks: Seeing that he did this <b>on the first of Shevat,</b> it would seem that <b>he acted in accordance with</b> the practice of <b>Beit Shammai.</b> According to Beit Hillel, both the formation of the fruit and its picking took place in the same year, as the new year does not begin until the fifteenth of Shevat, and so there would have been no need to set aside two tithes.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥananya</b> who said: <b>Here we are dealing with an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>whose fruit was formed prior to the fifteenth of the other,</b> previous, <b>Shevat,</b> in the second year, and it was picked on the first of the following Shevat, in the third year. According to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer that the tithe year of an <i>etrog</i> follows the time of the formation of its fruit, the fruit was obligated in second tithe, whereas according to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel that the tithe year of an <i>etrog</i> follows the time of its picking, it was obligated in poor man’s tithe, and so Rabbi Akiva set aside two tithes. <b>And by right it</b> should have taught that <b>even</b> if the fruit had been picked <b>earlier,</b> any time after the fifteenth of the previous Shevat, <b>but the incident that took place, took place in this way,</b> that the fruit was picked on the first of Shevat.
<b>Ravina said: Combine</b> the two statements <b>and teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>It was not on the first of Shevat</b> that Rabbi Akiva picked the fruit, <b>but on the fifteenth of Shevat, and he did not act</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices</b> of <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, but rather, he acted</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices</b> of <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer,</b> both in accordance with the practice of Beit Hillel.
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Now that Rabban Gamliel has said</b> that <b>the tithe</b> year <b>of an <i>etrog</i></b> follows <b>the time of the picking</b> of its fruit, <b>like a vegetable, its new year</b> for tithing <b>is Tishrei,</b> like other vegetables.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If <b>one picked</b> the fruit of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>on the eve of the fifteenth of Shevat before the sun had set, and</b> then <b>he picked more</b> fruit <b>after sunset, one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the one for the other, as one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the new</b> crop <b>for the old or from the old</b> crop <b>for the new.</b> If he did this when it <b>was the third</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>going into the fourth</b> year, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: From what he picked in <b>the third</b> year he must set aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe,</b> and from what he picked in <b>the fourth year</b> he must set aside <b>first tithe and second tithe.</b>

Daf 15a

The Gemara clarifies this ruling: <b>Whom did you hear that</b> said the tithe year of an <i>etrog</i> <b>follows</b> the time of the <b>picking</b> of its fruit? It was <b>Rabban Gamliel. And</b> yet this <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that the new year for tithing an <i>etrog</i> is the fifteenth of <b>Shevat,</b> against the opinion of Rabba bar Rav Huna, who says that according to Rabban Gamliel it is the first of Tishrei.
<b>Rather, if this was said, it was said as follows: Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Even though Rabban Gamliel said</b> that the tithe year of <b>an <i>etrog</i> follows</b> the time of the <b>picking</b> of its fruit, <b>like a vegetable, its new year is</b> in <b>Shevat,</b> like a tree.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to one who picked vegetables on the eve of Rosh HaShana, such <b>that it teaches</b> the case when <b>it was the second</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>going into the third</b> year, <b>and what is different here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> dealing with one who was picking the fruit of an <i>etrog</i> tree on the eve of the fifteenth of Shevat, such <b>that it teaches</b> the case when <b>it was the third</b> year <b>going into the fourth</b> year? Why is the same example not brought in both cases?
The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us a matter in passing, that it is damaging</b> for an <b><i>etrog</i></b> when the tree <b>is handled, and since everyone handles it in the Sabbatical Year,</b> as all the orchards are declared ownerless and everyone is permitted to enter and pick produce, the tree <b>does not bear fruit</b> that is fit for eating <b>for</b> another <b>three years.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan inquired of Rabbi Yannai:</b> With regard to <b>an <i>etrog</i>, when is its new year?</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him:</b> It is in <b>Shevat.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked again: Are you referring to <b>the lunar month of Shevat or</b> to <b>the Shevat</b> of the solar <b>season,</b> which begins thirty days after the winter solstice, but on a different date each year? Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him:</b> I am referring to <b>the lunar month</b> of Shevat.
<b>Rava inquired of Rav Naḥman, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who inquired <b>of Rabbi Yannai: If it was a leap year, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the new year for trees then move to the First Adar, which is the penultimate month in a leap year? <b>He said to him: Follow the majority of years.</b> Even in a leap year the new year for trees is in Shevat.
<b>Rabba said: An <i>etrog</i> from the sixth</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year is exempt from tithes,</b> like the produce of the Sabbatical Year, <b>and is</b> also <b>exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination</b> of Sabbatical Year produce from one’s house after produce of that particular species is no longer found in the field. <b>A Sabbatical Year</b> <i>etrog</i> <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the eighth</b> year <b>is exempt from tithes but is subject to</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination</b> of Sabbatical Year produce from one’s house.
<b>Abaye said to him: Granted,</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> the <i>halakha</i> follows the more <b>stringent</b> approach, as it follows the time of the formation of the fruit, which was in the Sabbatical Year, and therefore the <i>etrog</i> is subject to the mitzva of elimination. But in <b>the first clause,</b> which states that the <i>etrog</i> <b>is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination, why</b> is this so? It must be <b>that we say</b> to <b>follow</b> the time of <b>the formation</b> of the fruit, which was in the sixth year. But <b>if so, it should be subject to tithes.</b>
Rabba <b>said to him: Everyone’s hand is touching it,</b> as all are permitted to enter the orchards and touch all the fruit, and so the etrog is regarded as ownerless, <b>and</b> yet <b>you</b> wish to <b>say that it should be subject to tithes?</b> Even if it is not exempt as fruit of the Sabbatical Year, it is exempt from tithes because it is now ownerless.
<b>Rav Hamnuna</b> argued and <b>said:</b> An <i>etrog</i> <b>from the sixth</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year is always</b> and for all purposes considered <b>sixth-year</b> produce. <b>And</b> an <i>etrog</i> <b>from the Sabbatical Year that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the eighth</b> year <b>is always</b> and for all purposes considered produce of the <b>Sabbatical Year.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Shimon: An <i>etrog</i> from the sixth</b> year <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year is exempt from tithes, and it is</b> also <b>exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination</b> of Sabbatical Year produce from one’s house, <b>as there is nothing that is subject to tithes unless it</b> both <b>grew at</b> a time of <b>obligation</b> in tithes <b>and was</b> also <b>picked</b> at a time of <b>obligation.</b> Likewise, an <i>etrog</i> <b>from the Sabbatical Year that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the eighth</b> year <b>is exempt from tithes, and it is</b> also <b>exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination, as nothing is subject to</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination unless it</b> both <b>grew in the Sabbatical Year and was</b> also <b>picked in the Sabbatical Year.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>The first clause</b> of this <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty</b> with regard <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna,</b> who says that a sixth-year <i>etrog</i> that was picked in the Sabbatical Year is subject to tithes. And <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty</b> with regard <b>to</b> the opinions of <b>both Rabba and Rav Hamnuna,</b> as they both say that a Sabbatical-Year <i>etrog</i> that was picked in the eighth year is subject to the mitzva of elimination.
The Gemara answers: The matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Avtolemos testified in the name of five Elders: An <i>etrog</i> follows</b> the time of <b>its picking in</b> the matter of <b>tithes. But our Sages voted in Usha and said</b> that an <i>etrog</i> <b>follows</b> the time of <b>its picking, both in</b> the matter of <b>tithes and in</b> the matter of <b>the Sabbatical Year.</b>
The Gemara raises a question about this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who mentioned anything about the Sabbatical Year?</b> The subject of the discussion was tithes.

Daf 15b

The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following:</b> Avtolemos testified in the name of five Elders: <b>An <i>etrog</i> follows</b> the time of <b>its picking in</b> the matter of <b>tithes and</b> it follows the time of <b>the formation</b> of its fruit <b>in</b> the matter of <b>the Sabbatical Year. But our Sages voted in Usha</b> and decided that an <i>etrog</i> <b>follows</b> the time of <b>its picking, both</b> in the matter of <b>tithes and in</b> the matter of <b>the Sabbatical Year.</b>
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> of Eretz Yisrael discussed this issue: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say: An <i>etrog</i> from the sixth</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year is always</b> and for all purposes considered as <b>sixth-year</b> produce. <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A sixth-year <i>etrog</i> that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year,</b> although at the beginning of the Sabbatical Year it was only the size of <b>an olive-bulk and</b> during the Sabbatical Year <b>it grew to the size of a loaf</b> of bread, is considered sixth-year produce that is subject to tithing, and if one eats it without tithing, <b>he is liable for</b> eating <b>untithed produce.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A tree whose fruits were formed before the fifteenth of Shevat is tithed in accordance with the previous year,</b> and if the fruits were formed <b>after the fifteenth of Shevat</b> it <b>is tithed in accordance with the coming year. Rabbi Neḥemya said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a tree that produces two broods,</b> two crops, <b>in a</b> single <b>year.</b>
The Gemara interrupts with a question about the wording of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> to say <b>two broods?</b> Animals produce broods, but trees do not. <b>Rather, say: Like two broods,</b> i.e., two seasons’ worth of crops.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>trees that produce</b> only <b>one brood</b> of fruit, <b>for example, palm</b> trees, <b>and olive</b> trees, <b>and carob</b> trees, which yield fruit only once a year, <b>although their fruit took form before the fifteenth of Shevat, they are tithed in accordance with the coming year,</b> since they follow the time of their fruit’s picking. According to Rabbi Neḥemya, most fruit will be tithed according to the time that the fruit is picked, since only a minority of fruit trees produce two crops a year.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The people were accustomed</b> to act <b>with regard to carobs in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> that their tithe year follows the time of the fruit’s picking.
<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mishna that teaches: In the case of <b>white fig</b> trees, the <b>Sabbatical Year for them</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of eating and elimination is in the <b>second</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle, <b>due to</b> the fact that their fruit <b>grows for three years,</b> and so the fruit that ripens in the second year of the Sabbatical cycle had already taken form in the previous Sabbatical Year. This indicates that the tithe follows the time of the formation of the fruit and not the time of picking.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>was silent</b> and did not respond, as though he had no answer. <b>Rabbi Abba the priest said to Rabbi Yosei the priest: Why was</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>silent? He should have said to</b> Reish Lakish as follows: <b>I am speaking to you of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, and you say to me</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>
Rabbi Yosei the priest answered: He could not have made this argument, <b>because</b> Reish Lakish <b>would</b> then <b>have said to him: Do you abandon</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who constitute the majority, <b>and act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who expresses a sole dissenting opinion?
Rabbi Abba the priest asked further: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>should have said to him: I am speaking to you</b> only about how the people <b>practice</b> and that their custom follows the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya, <b>and you say to me</b> that it is a <b>prohibition?</b> Rabbi Yosei the priest answered: He could not have said this, <b>because</b> Reish Lakish <b>would</b> then <b>have said to him: Where there is a prohibition,</b> even <b>if they were accustomed to act</b> in a particular manner, <b>would we leave them</b> to continue?
Rabbi Abba the priest asked further: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>should have said to</b> Reish Lakish as follows: <b>I am speaking to you about the tithe of carobs, which is</b> only by <b>rabbinic</b> decree, as by Torah law all fruits apart from grapes and olives are exempt from tithing, <b>and you speak to me</b> about <b>the Sabbatical Year,</b> which is <b>by Torah law?</b> This being an irrefutable argument, the Gemara once again clarifies this matter.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Abba the priest said: I wonder whether Reish Lakish</b> actually <b>raised this original objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, since it has such a clear refutation. The Gemara asks: <b>Whether he asked it? But he did ask it,</b> as is reported in the story. <b>Rather, say:</b> I wonder <b>if Rabbi Yoḥanan accepted</b> this question and was silent because he had nothing to answer, <b>or he did not accept it</b> but nevertheless remained silent because he thought the question was not worthy of an answer.

Daf 16a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>At four times</b> of the year <b>the world is judged: On Passover</b> judgment is passed <b>concerning grain; on <i>Shavuot</i> concerning fruits</b> that grow on <b>a tree; on Rosh HaShana all creatures pass before Him like sheep [<i>benei maron</i>], as it is stated: “He Who fashions their hearts alike, Who considers all their deeds”</b> (Psalms 33:15); <b>and on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>they are judged concerning water,</b> i.e., the rainfall of the coming year.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that on Passover judgment is passed concerning grain. The Gemara asks: <b>Which grain</b> is judged on Passover? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>the grain that is</b> presently <b>standing</b> in the fields ready to be reaped between Passover and <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>when was judgment passed with regard to all those events [<i>harpatkei</i>]</b> that already happened to the grain while it was growing in the winter? <b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to the <b>grain that will be sown</b> over the coming year.
The Gemara asks further: <b>Is this to say that</b> only <b>one judgment is passed</b> concerning a particular crop, and no more? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>grain suffers an incident or accident before Passover, it was judged in the past,</b> the previous Passover; if this occurs <b>after Passover, it was judged</b> this Passover <b>for the future.</b> And similarly, if <b>a person suffered an incident or accident before Yom Kippur, he was judged in the past,</b> the previous Rosh HaShana; if this occurred <b>after Yom Kippur, he was judged</b> this Rosh HaShana <b>for the future.</b>
<b>Rava said: Learn from here</b> that <b>two judgments are passed</b> concerning each crop, one covering the period between the time it is sown and Passover and another covering the period between Passover and the time it is harvested. <b>Abaye said: Therefore, if a person sees that</b> his <b>slow-growing crops,</b> those that are sown at the beginning of the winter but ripen only in the spring or summer, <b>are doing well, he should quickly sow fast-growing crops,</b> such as barley, which can be sown at the end of the winter and still ripen before Passover, <b>as before it is brought to judgment</b> on the next Passover <b>it will already have</b> successfully <b>grown,</b> since he knows that this year’s crops were judged for a favorable yield.
The Gemara raises a question about the mishna: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All are judged on Rosh HaShana, and their sentence is sealed on Yom Kippur;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: All are judged on Rosh HaShana, and their sentence is sealed each in its</b> own <b>time: On Passover</b> the sentence is sealed <b>concerning grain; on <i>Shavuot</i> concerning fruits</b> that grow on <b>a tree; on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>they are judged concerning water; and mankind is judged on Rosh HaShana, and the sentence is sealed on Yom Kippur.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: A person is judged every day,</b> and not just once a year, <b>as it is stated: “You visit him every morning”</b> (Job 7:18), meaning that every morning an accounting is made and a judgment is passed. <b>Rabbi Natan says: A person is judged every hour, as it is stated: “You try him every moment”</b> (Job 7:18).
<b>And lest you say</b> that <b>actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and when the mishna is taught,</b> it is taught with regard to <b>the sentence,</b> and not the judgments, which are all passed on Rosh HaShana, <b>if so,</b> it is <b>difficult</b> with regard to <b>mankind,</b> as the mishna should have stated that the sentence is sealed on Yom Kippur.
<b>Rava said: The <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>from the school of Rabbi Yishmael, as</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>from the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: At four times</b> of the year <b>the world is judged: On Passover concerning grain; on <i>Shavuot</i> concerning fruits</b> that grow on <b>a tree; on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>they are judged concerning water; and mankind is judged on Rosh HaShana and the sentence is sealed on Yom Kippur. And when the mishna is taught,</b> it is taught with regard to <b>the beginning of the judgment</b> process, i.e., the judgment of mankind is initially passed on Rosh HaShana.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei?</b> The Gemara is astonished by this question: Why ask about his reason? <b>He stated his reason,</b> the verse that states: <b>“You visit him every morning.”</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This is what we are saying:</b> If Rabbi Yosei relies on this verse, <b>what is the reason that he did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that a person is judged every hour? And if you say that he holds that the verse “You try him every moment” cannot serve as proof, because <b>trying merely</b> indicates <b>examination</b> and not actual judgment, then in the same way <b>visiting merely</b> indicates <b>examination.</b> If so, there is no clear proof from this verse.
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said: Rabbi Yosei’s reason is from here,</b> another verse, which states: <b>“To make the judgment of His servant and the judgment of His people Israel at all times, as each day may require”</b> (I Kings 8:59), which indicates that the entire world is judged every day.
§ About this verse <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> When <b>a king and a community</b> are brought before God for judgment, <b>the king is brought in for judgment first, as it is stated: “To make the judgment of His servant,”</b> and afterward: <b>“And the judgment of His people Israel.” What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is <b>not proper conduct for the king to stand outside</b> and wait for the trial of his subjects to come to an end. And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that the king is brought in first so that he may be judged <b>before</b> God’s <b>anger intensifies</b> due to the sins of the community, and consequently he may be saved from overly harsh judgment.
<b>Rav Yosef said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we pray nowadays</b> on a daily basis <b>for the sick and afflicted?</b> The Gemara repeats the question: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that one is judged every day, and so there is reason to pray every day in order to affect the outcome of his judgment. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>actually,</b> normative practice is even <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one is judged only once a year, but <b>also in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak. As Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Crying</b> out to God <b>is beneficial for a person both before</b> his <b>sentence</b> has been issued <b>and after</b> his <b>sentence</b> has been issued.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Akiva: For what</b> reason did <b>the Torah say: Bring the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>on</b> the second day of <b>Passover?</b> It is <b>because Passover is the time of grain,</b> the beginning of the grain harvest season, and therefore <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Bring the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>before Me on Passover so that the grain in the fields will be blessed for you. And for what</b> reason did <b>the Torah say: Bring</b> the offering of <b>the two loaves</b> from the new wheat <b>on <i>Shavuot</i>?</b> It is <b>because <i>Shavuot</i> is the time of</b> the <b>fruits</b> that grow on <b>a tree,</b> when it begins to ripen, and therefore <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Bring</b> the offering of <b>the two loaves before Me on <i>Shavuot</i> so that the fruits</b> that grow on <b>a tree will be blessed for you.</b>
<b>And for what</b> reason did <b>the Torah say: Pour water</b> onto the altar in the Temple <b>on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Pour water before Me on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>so that the rains of the year,</b> which begin to fall after <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>will be blessed for you. And recite before Me on Rosh HaShana</b> verses that mention <b>Kingships, Remembrances, and <i>Shofarot</i>: Kingships so that you will crown Me as King over you; Remembrances so that your remembrance will rise before Me for good; and with what</b> will the remembrance rise? It will rise <b>with the <i>shofar</i>.</b>
Similarly, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Why does one sound</b> a blast <b>with a <i>shofar</i></b> made <b>from a ram’s</b> horn on Rosh HaShana? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Sound</b> a blast <b>before Me with a <i>shofar</i></b> made <b>from a ram’s</b> horn, <b>so that I will remember for you the binding of Isaac, son of Abraham,</b> in whose stead a ram was sacrificed, <b>and I will ascribe it to you as if you had bound yourselves before Me.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Why does one sound</b> [<b><i>tokin</i></b>] a blast <b>on Rosh HaShana?</b> The Gemara is astonished by the question: <b>Why do we sound</b> a blast? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the verse: <b>“Sound [<i>tiku</i>]</b> a <i>shofar</i>” (Psalms 81:4). <b>Rather,</b> the question is: <b>Why does one sound</b> a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> in addition to a long continuous <i>shofar</i> blast [<i>tekia</i>]? The Gemara is still surprised by the question: <b>Sound a <i>terua</i>? The Merciful One states:</b> “In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, <b>a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak asked about the common practice in Jewish communities, which is not explicitly stated in the Torah: <b>Why does one sound</b> a long, continuous <i>shofar</i> <b>blast [<i>tekia</i>] and</b> then a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> while the congregation is still <b>sitting</b> before the silent prayer,

Daf 16b

<b>and</b> then <b>sound</b> again <b>a <i>tekia</i> and a <i>terua</i> while they are standing</b> in the <i>Amida</i> prayer? He answers: <b>In order to confuse the Satan,</b> for this double blowing of the <i>shofar</i> demonstrates Israel’s love for the mitzva, and this will confuse Satan when he brings his accusations against Israel before the heavenly court, and the Jewish people will receive a favorable judgment.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said,</b> playing on the double meaning of the word <i>meri’in</i>, which can mean either sound a <i>terua</i> or cause misfortune: <b>Any year during which,</b> due to some mishap, <b>the <i>shofar</i> was not sounded at its beginning will suffer evil</b> and misfortune <b>at its end. What is the reason? Because Satan was not confused,</b> and he was able to put forward his accusations, so that the Jewish people would be punished.
§ The Gemara brings a series of statements in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak, all of which relate to judgment: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Any year that is poor [<i>rasha</i>]</b> and troubled <b>at its beginning will be made rich at its end, for it is stated: “From the beginning [<i>mereishit</i>] of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The word <b><i>meireishit</i> is written</b> defectively, without an <i>alef</i>, so that it may also be understood in the sense of <i>rashut</i>, poverty. The verse continues: <b>“And until the end [<i>aḥarit</i>]</b> of the year,” which means <b>that the end</b> of the year <b>will have</b> expectations of good things <b>in the end [<i>aḥarit</i>].</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A man is judged only according to his deeds at the time</b> of his judgment, and not according to his future deeds, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Ishmael: <b>“For God has heard the voice of the lad where he is”</b> (Genesis 21:17). Although Ishmael and his descendants would act wickedly in the future, his prayer was heard and answered because he was innocent at the time.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Three matters evoke a person’s sins,</b> and <b>they are:</b> Endangering oneself by sitting next to <b>an inclined wall</b> that is about to collapse; <b>expecting prayer</b> to be accepted, as that leads to an assessment of one’s status and merit; <b>and passing a case against another</b> to Heaven, <b>for Rabbi Avin said: Anyone who passes a case against another</b> to God <b>is punished first.</b> Praying for God to pass judgment on another causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of the other, <b>as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My anger be upon you;</b> I have given my maid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; let the Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5), <b>and it is written</b> afterward: <b>“And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her”</b> (Genesis 23:2). Sarah called upon Heaven to pass judgment between her and her husband, and therefore she was punished and died first.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person’s sentence is torn up on</b> account of <b>four</b> types of <b>actions. These are:</b> Giving <b>charity, crying out</b> in prayer, <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, and a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better. An allusion may be found in Scripture for all of them: Giving <b>charity, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2); <b>crying out</b> in prayer, <b>as it is written: “Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distresses”</b> (Psalms 107:28); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, as it is written:</b> “As for <b>Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be”</b> (Genesis 17:15), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And I will bless her, and I will also give you a son from her”</b> (Genesis 17:16); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better, <b>as it is written: “And God saw their deeds”</b> (Jonah 3:10), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And God repented of the evil, which He had said He would do to them, and He did not do</b> it” (Jonah 3:10).
<b>And some say: Also, a change of</b> one’s <b>place</b> of residence cancels an evil judgment, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord said to Abram: Go you out of your county”</b> (Genesis 12:1), <b>and afterward</b> it is written: <b>“And I will make of you a great nation”</b> (Genesis 12: 2). The Gemara explains: <b>And the other</b> one, i.e., Rabbi Yitzḥak, who does not include a change of residence in his list, holds that in the case of Abram, <b>it was the merit</b> and sanctity <b>of Eretz Yisrael that helped him</b> become the father of a great nation.
The Gemara cites two more statements in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak, relating to the Festivals: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is obligated to</b> go out and <b>greet his teacher on a Festival, as it is stated</b> that the husband of the Shunamite woman asked, when she was readying herself to go to the prophet: <b>“Why will you go to him today; it is neither the New Moon nor Shabbat”</b> (II Kings 4:23). <b>By inference,</b> we learn <b>that on the New Moon and on Shabbat,</b> which in this context means a Festival that is a day of rest, <b>she was required to go.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is obligated to purify himself on a Festival, as it is stated: “And their carcasses you shall not touch;</b> they are impure to you” (Leviticus 11:8). This verse is referring to the Festivals, as taught in the following <i>baraita</i>.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And their carcass you shall not touch.”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> ordinary <b>Jews are prohibited from touching an animal carcass.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). It is derived from here that <b>the sons of Aaron are prohibited</b> from defiling themselves, but <b>the children of Israel,</b> i.e., non-priests, <b>are not prohibited</b> from doing so.
<b>But are</b> these <b>matters not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>If,</b> with regard to <b>severe impurity,</b> i.e., contact with a human corpse, <b>priests are prohibited</b> from defiling themselves, while ordinary <b>Israelites are not prohibited</b> from doing so, in the case of <b>light impurity,</b> e.g., touching an animal carcass, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that Israelites be permitted to defile themselves? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And their carcass you shall not touch?”</b> It means that <b>on a Festival</b> all are obligated to purify themselves.
§ The Gemara goes back to discuss the Day of Judgment. <b>Rabbi Kruspedai said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three books are opened on Rosh HaShana</b> before the Holy One, Blessed be He: <b>One of wholly wicked</b> people, <b>and one of wholly righteous</b> people, <b>and one of middling</b> people whose good and bad deeds are equally balanced. <b>Wholly righteous</b> people <b>are immediately written and sealed for life; wholly wicked</b> people <b>are immediately written and sealed for death;</b> and <b>middling</b> people <b>are left</b> with their judgment <b>suspended from Rosh HaShana until Yom Kippur,</b> their fate remaining undecided. If <b>they merit,</b> through the good deeds and mitzvot that they perform during this period, <b>they are written for life;</b> if <b>they do not</b> so <b>merit, they are written for death.</b>
<b>Rabbi Avin said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, but not be written with the righteous”</b> (Psalms 69:29). <b>“Let them be blotted out of the book”; this is the book of wholly wicked</b> people, who are blotted out from the world. <b>“Of the living”; this is the book of</b> wholly <b>righteous</b> people. <b>“But not be written with the righteous”; this is the book of middling</b> people, who are written in a separate book, not with the righteous.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This matter is derived <b>from here: “And if not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your book which you have written”</b> (Exodus 32:32). <b>“Blot me, I pray You”; this is the book of</b> wholly <b>wicked</b> people, who are blotted out from the world. <b>“Out of Your book”; this is the book of</b> wholly <b>righteous</b> people, which is special and attributed to God Himself. <b>“Which You have written”; this is the book of middling</b> people.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say: There will be three groups</b> of people <b>on the</b> great <b>Day of Judgment</b> at the end of days: <b>One of wholly righteous</b> people, <b>one of wholly wicked</b> people, <b>and one of middling</b> people. Wholly <b>righteous</b> people <b>will immediately be written and sealed for eternal life. Wholly wicked</b> people <b>will immediately be written and sealed for Gehenna, as it is stated: “And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall wake, some to eternal life and some to shame and everlasting contempt”</b> (Daniel 12:2). <b>Middling</b> people <b>will descend to Gehenna</b> to be cleansed and to achieve atonement for their sins,

Daf 17a

<b>and they will cry out</b> in their pain <b>and</b> eventually <b>ascend</b> from there, <b>as it is stated: “And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried; they shall call on My name, and I will answer them”</b> (Zechariah 13:9). This is referring to the members of the third group, who require refinement and cleansing. <b>And about them, Hannah said: “The Lord kills, and gives life; he brings down to the grave, and brings up”</b> (I Samuel 2:6).
<b>Beit Hillel say:</b> He Who is <b>“and abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6) <b>tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness,</b> so that middling people should not have to pass through Gehenna. <b>And about them, David said: “I love the Lord, Who hears my voice</b> and my supplications” (Psalms 116:1). <b>And about them, David said the entire passage: “I was brought low [<i>daloti</i>] and He saved me”</b> (Psalms 116:6). Although they are poor [<i>dalim</i>] in mitzvot, God saves them.
<b>The rebellious Jews</b> who have sinned <b>with their bodies and</b> also <b>the rebellious</b> people <b>of the nations of the world</b> who have sinned <b>with their bodies descend to Gehenna and are judged there for twelve months. After twelve months, their bodies are consumed, their souls are burned, and a wind scatters them under the soles of the feet of the righteous, as it is stated: “And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet”</b> (Malachi 3:21).
<b>But the heretics; and the informers; and the apostates [<i>apikorsim</i>];</b> and those <b>who denied the Torah; and</b> those who <b>denied the resurrection of the dead; and</b> those who <b>separated from the ways of</b> the Jewish <b>community</b> and refused to share the suffering; <b>and</b> those <b>who cast their fear over the land of the living; and</b> those who <b>sinned and caused the masses to sin, for example, Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and his company;</b> all of these people <b>descend to Gehenna and are judged there for generations and generations, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against Me;</b> for their worm shall not die; neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” (Isaiah 66:24).
<b>Gehenna will terminate, but they</b> still <b>will not terminate, as it is stated: “And their form shall wear away the netherworld, so that there be no dwelling for Him”</b> (Psalms 49:15); that is to say, Gehenna itself will be worn away before their punishment has come to an end. <b>And why</b> are they punished <b>so severely? Because they stretched out their hands against</b> God’s <b>dwelling,</b> the Temple, and everything else that is sanctified, <b>as it is stated: “So that there be no dwelling [<i>zevul</i>] for Him.” Dwelling [<i>zevul</i>] is referring</b> here <b>only to the Temple, as it is stated: “I have built You a house for dwelling [<i>zevul</i>] in”</b> (I Kings 8:13). <b>And about them Hannah said: “The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken in pieces”</b> (I Samuel 2:10).
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avin said: And their faces</b> on the Day of Judgment <b>will be</b> black and sooty <b>like the bottom of a pot. And Rava said: And they shall include the most handsome,</b> i.e., upstanding, <b>of the people of Meḥoza,</b> as Rava thought that even the most upstanding people of the city of Meḥoza were wicked, <b>and they shall be called the people of Gehenna.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> above: It stated that <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> He Who is <b>“and abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6) <b>tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness,</b> so that middling people will not have to pass through Gehenna. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And I will bring the third part through the fire”</b> (Zechariah 13:9), implying that there is a third group, which is sent to Gehenna temporarily? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the verse is referring to <b>the rebellious Jews</b> who have sinned <b>with their bodies.</b>
The Gemara asks: Can the verse be referring to <b>the rebellious Jews</b> who have sinned <b>with their bodies? But didn’t you say that they have no rectification?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>When do they have no rectification? When</b> in addition to their having sinned with their bodies, the <b>majority</b> of their actions are <b>sins.</b> But <b>here,</b> the verse is referring to people for whom <b>half</b> of their actions are <b>sins and half</b> are <b>meritorious deeds, and</b> those sins <b>include the sin of the rebellious Jews</b> who sin <b>with their bodies. It is not sufficient that they not be</b> subject to the verse: <b>“And I will bring the third part through the fire.” However, if</b> their sins and meritorious deeds are equally balanced, and they did <b>not</b> sin with their bodies, He Who is <b>“abundant in kindness” tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness. And about them, David said: “I love the Lord, Who hears</b> my voice and my supplications” (Psalms 116:1).
<b>Rava interpreted</b> the verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I love the Lord, Who hears</b> my voice and my supplications”? <b>The Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, when</b> do I know that <b>I am loved by You? When You hear the voice of my supplications,</b> as the verse states: <b>“I was brought low [<i>daloti</i>], and He saved me”</b> (Psalms 116:6). <b>Although I am poor [<i>dala</i>] in mitzvot,</b> nevertheless <b>it is fitting to save me.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>The rebellious Jews</b> who have sinned <b>with their bodies, who are they? Rav said:</b> This is referring to <b>the skull that did not</b> ever <b>don phylacteries.</b> The Gemara asks further: <b>The rebellious</b> ones <b>of the nations of the world</b> who sin <b>with their bodies,</b> who are they? <b>Rav said:</b> They are those who engage <b>in the sin,</b> i.e., forbidden sexual relations.
<b>And those who cast their fear over the land of the living,</b> who are they? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: This is referring to</b> a communal <b>leader [<i>parnas</i>] who casts excessive fear on the community not for the sake of Heaven. Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: Any</b> community <b>leader who casts excessive fear on the community not for the sake of Heaven will</b> be punished and <b>not see any Torah scholar among his sons, as it is stated: “Men do therefore fear him; he sees not any who are wise of heart”</b> (Job 37:24). One who brings others to fear him will not merit having wise-hearted people in his family.
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> He who is <b>“and abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6) <b>tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness,</b> so that middling people will not have to pass through Gehenna. The Gemara asks: <b>How does He do</b> this? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He pushes down</b> on the side of the merits, tipping the scale in their favor, <b>as it is stated: “He will again have compassion upon us; He will push down our iniquities”</b> (Micah 7:19). <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: He bears,</b> i.e., raises, the side of the sins, <b>as it is stated: “He bears [<i>noseh</i>] sin and forgives transgression”</b> (Micah 7:18).
A Sage <b>from the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He overlooks</b> each and every <b>first</b> transgression, <b>and that is the attribute</b> of mercy, that God forgives one’s first sin, and therefore He tips the scale in favor of the merits. <b>Rava said: But</b> that <b>sin itself,</b> which God overlooks, <b>is not</b> completely <b>erased; if</b> the individual’s actions are still <b>mostly sins,</b> God <b>counts</b> the overlooked sin <b>with them</b> and metes out punishment accordingly.
<b>Rava</b> understood this verse differently and <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>whoever forgoes his reckonings</b> with others for injustices done to him, the heavenly court in turn <b>forgoes</b> punishment <b>for all his sins, as it is stated: “He bears sin and forgives transgression”</b> (Micah 7:18). <b>Whose sins does He bear?</b> The sins <b>of one who forgoes his reckonings</b> with others for injustices committed against him.
It is related that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, became sick,</b> and <b>Rav Pappa went into</b> his home to <b>inquire about his</b> well-being. <b>He saw that the world was growing weak for</b> Rav Huna, i.e., he was dying. Rav Pappa <b>said to</b> his attendants: <b>Prepare his provisions [<i>zavdata</i>],</b> i.e., his shrouds. <b>In the end,</b> Rav Huna <b>recovered. Rav Pappa was embarrassed to</b> go and <b>see him,</b> as it seemed as if he had decreed Rav Huna’s death. Rav Huna’s friends <b>said to him: What did you see</b> when you were lying there suspended between life and death? <b>He said to them: Yes, it was so,</b> I was truly close to dying, <b>but the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> the heavenly court: <b>Since he does not stand on his rights,</b> i.e., he is ready to waive what is due him, <b>you</b> too <b>should not be exacting</b> with him in his judgment, <b>as it is stated: “He bears [<i>noseh</i>] sin and forgives transgression.” Whose sins does He bear?</b> The sins <b>of one who forgoes his reckonings</b> with others for injustices committed against him.
That same verse continues: “He bears sins and forgives transgression <b>for the remnant of His inheritance”</b> (Micah 7:18). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ḥanina said:</b> This is like the <b>fat tail that has a thorn in it,</b> i.e., something good that contains something bad. God forgives and pardons only <b>“for the remnant of His inheritance,” but not for all His inheritance.</b>

Daf 17b

That is to say, God forgives sins only <b>for one who regards himself as a remainder,</b> i.e., of only secondary importance.
§ <b>Rav Huna raised a contradiction</b> between the two halves of a verse. <b>It is written: “The Lord is righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>] in all His ways”</b> (Psalms 145:17), indicating that God acts in accordance with the attribute of strict justice [<i>tzedek</i>], <b>and</b> then <b>it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And kind [<i>ḥasid</i>] in all His works,”</b> implying that He acts with grace and loving-kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>], going beyond the letter of the law. Rav Huna explained: <b>Initially,</b> at the time of judgment, <b>He is righteous, but in the end,</b> at the time of punishment, <b>He is gracious.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar raised a</b> similar <b>contradiction: It is written: “But to you, O Lord, belongs kindness”</b> (Psalms 62:13), implying that God acts beyond the letter of the law, <b>and</b> then <b>it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“For You render to a man according to his deeds,”</b> implying that He rewards and punishes measure for measure. Rabbi Elazar answered: <b>Initially,</b> at the time of judgment: <b>“For You render to a man according to his deeds”; but in the end,</b> at the time of punishment: <b>“But to You, O Lord, belongs kindness.”</b>
<b>Ilfai, and some say</b> it was the Sage <b>Ilfa,</b> also <b>raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in the list of God’s attributes: <b>“And abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6), <b>and it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And truth,”</b> which implies the attribute of justice. He answered: <b>Initially,</b> at the time of judgment: <b>“And truth,”</b> i.e., God employs strict justice, <b>but in the end,</b> when He sees that the world cannot survive on judgment based only on truth and justice: <b>“And abundant in kindness,”</b> i.e., He is merciful.
§ The verse states: <b>“And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed”</b> (Exodus 34:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Were it not</b> explicitly <b>written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this,</b> as it would be insulting to God’s honor. The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wrapped Himself</b> in a prayer shawl <b>like a prayer leader and showed Moses</b> the structure of the <b>order of</b> the <b>prayer. He said to him: Whenever the Jewish people sin, let them act before Me in accordance with this order.</b> Let the prayer leader wrap himself in a prayer shawl and publicly recite the thirteen attributes of mercy, <b>and I will forgive them.</b>
The verse continues: <b>“The Lord, the Lord,”</b> and it should be understood as follows: <b>I am He before a person sins, and I am He after a person sins and performs repentance,</b> as God does not recall for him his first sins, since He is always <b>“God, merciful and gracious”</b> (Exodus 34:6).
<b>Rav Yehuda said: A covenant was made with the thirteen attributes that they will not return empty-handed,</b> meaning that if one mentions them, he will certainly be answered, <b>as it is stated</b> in this regard: <b>“Behold, I make a covenant”</b> (Exodus 34:10).
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Great is repentance, for it tears up the sentence</b> issued <b>against a person, as it is stated: “Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear over their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and they will return, and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10), implying that if indeed they return and repent, they will be healed from all their sins.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But perhaps</b> this was said <b>before the sentence</b> was issued, but after one’s sentence has been decreed repentance no longer helps. Abaye <b>said to him: It is written</b> here: “And they will return <b>and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10). <b>What requires healing?</b> An illness does. Consequently, <b>you must say</b> that the reference here is to <b>a sentence</b> that has already been issued, and even so, after repentance, they will be healed.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one repents in the meantime,</b> between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, <b>he is forgiven;</b> if <b>he does not repent in the meantime,</b> then <b>even if he</b> later <b>brings</b> as offerings <b>all the rams of Nebaioth in the world,</b> which are of the best quality, <b>they do not forgive him</b> in the Heavenly court. This implies that once one’s sentence has been decreed, even repentance cannot alter it. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where repentance is effective only before the sentence on Yom Kippur, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to repentance <b>of an individual; there,</b> where forgiveness is granted even after a sentence is issued, it is referring to <b>communal</b> repentance.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “A land which the Lord your God cares for; <b>the eyes of the Lord your God are</b> always <b>upon it”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). God’s constant providence over Eretz Yisrael is <b>sometimes for</b> the <b>good</b> and <b>sometimes for</b> the <b>bad. Sometimes for</b> the <b>good; how so? If the Jews were wholly wicked on Rosh HaShana, so that</b> only <b>a meager</b> amount of <b>rain was decreed for them</b> for the year, but <b>in the end they repented,</b> what can be done? <b>To add</b> rain <b>is impossible, as the decree was already issued. Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, causes</b> those sparse rains <b>to fall at the</b> appropriate <b>times on land that needs it,</b> e.g., fields, vineyards, and gardens, <b>all according to</b> requirements of <b>the land,</b> and those rains are just as effective as a lot of rain.
<b>Sometimes for bad; how so? If the Jewish people were wholly righteous on Rosh HaShana, so that much rain was decreed for them</b> for that year, but <b>in the end they regressed</b> and sinned, what can be done? <b>To reduce</b> the amount of rain <b>is impossible, as the decree was already issued. Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, causes</b> the rain <b>to fall not at the</b> appropriate <b>time,</b> and <b>on land that does not need it,</b> e.g., forests and deserts, and the ample rain is no more beneficial than meager rain.
The Gemara asks: When it is <b>for good, however, let Him tear up their sentence and add</b> to the rain that had originally been decreed for them. Since the <i>baraita</i> explains that God does not do so, it implies that an evil sentence cannot be rescinded, even if the entire community fully repents. The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, because it is possible</b> to achieve the same result <b>in this</b> manner, by causing the rain to fall at the proper time and in the proper place, without rescinding the original sentence.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different <i>baraita</i>: The psalm states: <b>“They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these saw the works of the Lord,</b> and His wonders in the deep” (Psalms 107:23–24). The psalm continues: <b>“For He commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves thereof…They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,</b> and are at their wits’ end” (Psalms 107:25–27). It continues further: <b>“Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble,</b> and He brings them out of their distresses” (Psalms 107:28). And finally, <b>“Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercy,</b> and for His wonderful works to the children of men” (Psalms 107:31).
<b>Markers were inserted here</b> before each one of verses 23 through 28. These markers, which are the letter <i>nun</i> inverted, <b>are similar</b> in meaning <b>to the</b> words <b>but and only in the Torah,</b> to tell us that just as the Torah’s words are precise and cannot be changed, so too, these people cannot have their sentence changed. This <b>tells you</b> that if <b>they cried out before the sentence</b> was issued, <b>they are answered,</b> but if <b>they cried out</b> only <b>after the sentence</b> was issued, <b>they are not answered.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, for <b>those</b> who go down to the sea in ships <b>are also considered like individuals.</b> Even if there are many such people, they do not constitute an entire community but only a small defined group within it.
The Gemara continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Beloreya the convert</b> once <b>asked Rabban Gamliel: It is written in your Torah:</b> “The great, mighty, and awesome God <b>who favors no one”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6: 26). How can this contradiction be resolved?
<b>Rabbi Yosei the priest joined</b> the conversation with <b>her and said: I will tell you a parable. To what is this matter comparable? To a person who lent his friend one hundred</b> dinars <b>and fixed a time</b> for repayment of the loan <b>before the king, and</b> the borrower <b>took an oath by the life of the king</b> that he would repay the money. <b>The time arrived, and he did not repay</b> the loan. The delinquent borrower <b>came to appease the king</b> for not fulfilling the oath that he had sworn by the life of the king, <b>and</b> the king <b>said to him:</b> For <b>my insult I forgive you,</b> but <b>you must</b> still <b>go and appease your friend. Here also</b> the same is true: <b>Here,</b> the verse that states: “The Lord shall show favor to you,” is referring to <b>sins</b> committed <b>between man and God,</b> which God will forgive; <b>there,</b> the verse that states: “God favors no one,” is referring to <b>sins</b> committed <b>between a person and another,</b> which God will not forgive until the offender appeases the one he hurt.
This is how the contradiction had at first been resolved, <b>until Rabbi Akiva came and taught</b> as follows:

Daf 18a

<b>Here</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>before</b> one’s <b>sentence</b> is issued, when God shows favor and forgives; and <b>there</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>after</b> the <b>sentence</b> has been issued, when He no longer forgives. This implies that after a sentence has been issued, there is no possibility of repentance, which seems to contradict the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too</b> it is referring to <b>an individual,</b> but a community is granted forgiveness even after its sentence has been issued.
§ The question of whether or not <b>an individual’s sentence</b> can be rescinded <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Two</b> people <b>take to</b> their <b>beds, and their illness is the same, or two</b> people <b>ascend to the tribunal [<i>gardom</i>] for judgment, and their</b> potential <b>sentence is the same;</b> but <b>this</b> one <b>comes down</b> from his bed, <b>while that</b> one <b>does not come down from his bed, and this</b> one <b>is saved</b> from death, <b>while that</b> one <b>is not saved.</b>
<b>For what</b> reason <b>did this</b> one recover and <b>come down</b> from his bed, <b>while that</b> one <b>did not</b> recover and <b>come down from his bed;</b> and why <b>was this one saved</b> from death, <b>while that one was not saved?</b> The difference between them is that <b>this</b> one <b>prayed and was answered, while that</b> one <b>prayed, but was not answered. And for what</b> reason <b>was this</b> one <b>answered and that</b> one <b>not answered? This</b> one <b>prayed a prayer</b> with his <b>whole</b> heart and consequently <b>was answered, while that</b> one <b>did not pray a prayer</b> with his <b>whole</b> heart and therefore <b>was not answered.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Not so; rather, <b>here</b> he prayed <b>before</b> his heavenly <b>sentence</b> was issued, and so he was answered, whereas <b>there</b> the other one prayed <b>after</b> his heavenly <b>sentence</b> was issued, and therefore he was not answered. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> disagreed and <b>said: Crying out</b> to God <b>is effective for a person, both before</b> his <b>sentence</b> has been issued <b>and</b> also <b>after</b> his <b>sentence</b> has been issued, as even after his sentence has been issued, it can still be rescinded if he repents.
The Gemara asks: <b>Can a sentence of a community</b> really <b>be torn up</b> because they have repented? <b>But one verse says:</b> “O Jerusalem, <b>wash your heart from wickedness,</b> that you may be saved” (Jeremiah 4:14), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet the stain of your iniquity is before Me,</b> says the Lord God” (Jeremiah 2:22). <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>here</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>before the sentence,</b> when the heart can still be washed with repentance, whereas <b>there</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>after the sentence,</b> when washing no longer helps, as the sentence cannot be canceled?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> both <b>this</b> verse <b>and that</b> verse refer to the time <b>after the sentence</b> has been decreed, <b>and</b> still it is <b>not difficult: Here</b> the verse is referring to <b>a sentence accompanied by an oath</b> taken by God not to cancel the sentence, whereas <b>there</b> the verse is referring to <b>a sentence that is not accompanied by</b> God’s <b>oath</b> not to cancel the sentence, and so the sentence can in fact be canceled through repentance.
This is <b>like</b> what <b>Rav Shmuel bar Ami</b> said, <b>as Rav Shmuel bar Ami</b> said, <b>and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a sentence accompanied by</b> God’s <b>oath</b> not to cancel it <b>cannot be torn up</b> or canceled? <b>As it is stated: “And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house will not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever”</b> (I Samuel 3:14).
With regard to this verse <b>Rava said: With sacrifice or offering</b> the sin of Eli’s house <b>is not atoned, but it can be atoned through Torah</b> study. <b>Abaye said: With sacrifice or offering</b> the sin of Eli’s house <b>is not atoned, but it is atoned through Torah</b> study <b>and</b> the performance of <b>acts of kindness.</b> It is related that <b>Rabba and Abaye came from the house of Eli,</b> which was subject to the curse that most of its members would die young. <b>Rabba, who engaged</b> almost exclusively <b>in Torah</b> study, <b>lived for forty years,</b> whereas <b>Abaye, who engaged in</b> both <b>Torah</b> study <b>and in</b> the performance of <b>acts of kindness lived for sixty years.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was a certain family in Jerusalem whose members used to die at the age of eighteen,</b> and they did not know why. <b>They came and told Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> about their situation. <b>He said to them: Perhaps you</b> are descended <b>from the family of Eli, as it is written about them: “And all the increase of your house shall die young men”</b> (I Samuel 2:33). If indeed this is so, the remedy is as follows: <b>Go and engage in Torah</b> study, in the merit of which <b>you will live. They went and engaged in Torah</b> study <b>and lived. And</b> people <b>would call that family</b> afterward <b>by the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> in his honor.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the sentence of a community is never sealed [<i>neḥtam</i>]?</b> The Gemara immediately asks: <b>Is never sealed? But isn’t it written: “Yet the stain [<i>nikhtam</i>] of your iniquity is before Me”</b> (Jeremiah 2:22), which implies that the sentence of a community is indeed sealed. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the question was as follows: From where is it known with regard to the sentence of a community that <b>although it is sealed, it can</b> still <b>be torn up? As it is stated: “As is the Lord our God whenever we call out to Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7). This implies that there is always a way to draw close to God.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him when He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that there are times when He is not near and does not answer. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> the verse is referring to <b>an individual,</b> to whom God is near only at certain times; <b>here</b> the verse is referring to <b>a community,</b> to which God is close whenever the people call out to Him.
§ The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>an individual, when</b> is God near to him? <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: These are the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur.</b> The Gemara asks further: The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass about ten days after that the Lord smote Nabal, and he died”</b> (I Samuel 25:38). These <b>ten days, what are they doing here,</b> i.e., why was there a delay of ten days before Nabal died? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: They correspond to the ten meals that Nabal gave the servants of David</b> who came to visit him, as out of politeness he allowed David’s ten servants to eat, and therefore his punishment was delayed for ten days. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: These are the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur,</b> during which everyone is given one last opportunity to repent for the sins he committed over the course of the previous year.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>On Rosh HaShana all creatures pass before Him like <i>benei maron</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b><i>benei maron</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here</b> in Babylonia <b>they interpreted it</b> to mean: <b>Like a flock of sheep [<i>kivnei imarna</i>]. Reish Lakish</b> disagreed and <b>said: Like the ascent of Beit Maron,</b> which was very steep; one standing at the summit could discern all those climbing the mountain with a single look. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said</b> another opinion: <b>Like the soldiers of the house of</b> King <b>David,</b> who could be surveyed with a single glance.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And they are all scanned in a single scan. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, learn</b> this in the <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He who fashions their hearts alike, who considers all their deeds”</b> (Psalms 33:15). <b>What is this</b> verse <b>saying? If we say this is what it is saying: That He created everyone and unites</b> all <b>their hearts together,</b> there is a difficulty, <b>since don’t we see that it is not so,</b> as the hearts of people are not united and are not similar to one another? <b>Rather, is this not what it is saying: The Creator sees their hearts together and considers all their deeds</b> with a single scan?
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>In six months</b> of the year <b>the messengers go out</b> from the court in Jerusalem to report throughout Eretz Yisrael and the Diaspora which day was established as the New Moon, the thirtieth or the thirty-first day since the previous New Moon. They go out <b>in</b> the month of <b>Nisan, due to Passover,</b> so that people will know on which day to celebrate it; <b>in</b> the month of <b>Av, due to the fast</b> of the Ninth of Av; <b>in Elul, due to Rosh HaShana,</b> which begins thirty days after the New Moon of Elul; <b>in Tishrei, due to the</b> need to establish the <b>correct</b> dates on which to celebrate <b>the Festivals</b> of Tishrei, i.e., Yom Kippur and <i>Sukkot</i>; <b>in Kislev, due to Hanukkah; and in Adar, due to Purim.</b>
<b>And when the Temple was standing,</b> messengers <b>would also go out in</b> the month of <b>Iyyar due to small Passover,</b> i.e., second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, which occurs on the fourteenth of Iyyar. This holiday allowed those who were ritually impure or on a distant journey on the fourteenth of Nisan, and therefore incapable of bringing the Paschal lamb at that time, to bring their Paschal lamb a month later.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if they go out for the month of Av due to the fast, <b>let them go out also</b> in the months of <b>Tammuz and Tevet,</b> as they too contain public fast days.

Daf 18b

<b>As Rav Ḥana bar Bizna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Thus said the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall become times of joy and gladness,</b> and cheerful seasons, <b>to the house of Judah”</b> (Zechariah 8:19). <b>It calls them</b> days of <b>“fast” and it calls them</b> “times of <b>joy and gladness.”</b> How so? <b>When there is peace</b> in the world, <b>they will be</b> times of <b>joy and gladness,</b> on which eulogies and fasting are forbidden; but when <b>there is no peace,</b> they are days of <b>fasting.</b> In a time when there is no peace, why are messengers not sent out also for the fourth and tenth months, so that people can know when to observe the fasts?
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>this is what it is saying: When there is peace</b> in the world and the Temple is standing, these days <b>will be</b> times of <b>joy and gladness;</b> when <b>there is persecution</b> and troubles for the Jewish people, they are days of <b>fasting;</b> and when <b>there is no persecution but</b> still <b>no peace,</b> neither particular troubles nor consolation for Israel, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If people <b>wish, they fast,</b> and if <b>they wish, they do not fast.</b> Since there is no absolute obligation to fast, messengers are not sent out for these months.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the Ninth of Av</b> should <b>also</b> be like the other fast days, that sometimes it is observed and sometimes not, depending upon the wishes of the community at the time. Why does the mishna state that messengers go out for the month of Av? <b>Rav Pappa said: The Ninth of Av is different, since the calamities</b> that occurred on that day <b>were multiplied. As the Master said: On the Ninth of Av the Temple was destroyed,</b> both <b>the first</b> one <b>and the second</b> one; on this day the city of <b>Beitar was captured;</b> and on this day <b>the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>was plowed</b> over by the enemies of the Jewish people, as a sign that it would never be rebuilt. Consequently, the fast of the Ninth of Av is obligatory, and not optional like the other fasts. Messengers are consequently sent out so that people will know when to fast.
§ The Sages disagreed about the fasts alluded to in the words of the prophet, as <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Rabbi Akiva would expound four verses, but I would not expound</b> the texts <b>as he did.</b> One of the disputes relates to the fasts mentioned by Zechariah. Rabbi Akiva would expound the verse as follows: <b>“The fast of the fourth,” this is the ninth of Tammuz, on which the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>was breached, as it is stated: “And in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. Then the city was breached”</b> (Jeremiah 52:6–7). <b>And why does</b> the prophet <b>call it</b> the fast of the <b>fourth?</b> Because it is in Tammuz, <b>the fourth of the months</b> when counting from Nisan.
<b>“The fast of the fifth,” this is the Ninth of Av, on which the Temple of our Lord was burnt. And why does he call it</b> the fast of the <b>fifth?</b> Because it falls in the <b>fifth of the months. “The fast of the seventh,” this is the third of Tishrei, on which Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, was killed. And who killed him? Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, killed him</b> (see II Kings 25:25; Jeremiah, chapter 41). The Sages established a fast to commemorate Gedaliah’s death <b>to teach you that the death of the righteous is equivalent to the burning of the Temple of our Lord. And why did</b> the prophet <b>call it</b> the fast of the <b>seventh?</b> Because Tishrei is the <b>seventh of the months.</b>
<b>“The fast of the tenth,” This is the tenth of Tevet, on which the king of Babylonia laid siege to Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, write the name of the day, of this same day: The king of Babylonia has laid siege to Jerusalem on this very day”</b> (Ezekiel 24:1–2). <b>And why did he call it</b> the fast of the <b>tenth?</b> Because it is in Tevet, which is <b>the tenth of the months. Wouldn’t it have been fitting to write</b> this fast <b>first,</b> as the series of events began with the laying of the siege. <b>Why was</b> it <b>written here</b> at the end of the list? This was done <b>in order to list the months in</b> their <b>proper</b> order, as the prophet began with the fourth month and ended with the tenth month. This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva.
Rabbi Shimon disagreed and said: <b>I do not say this, but rather</b> I expound the verse as follows: <b>“The fast of the tenth,” this is the fifth of Tevet, on which the report reached the Diaspora that the city had been smitten, as it is stated: “And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying: The city is smitten”</b> (Ezekiel 33:21); <b>and they made the day of the report</b> of the destruction <b>like the day of the</b> actual <b>burning</b> and decreed a fast on that day.
And Rabbi Shimon added: <b>And my statement seems</b> more convincing <b>than his statement, as I say about the first</b> fast mentioned by the prophet that it marks the event that took place <b>first, and about the last</b> fast that it marks the event that took place <b>last.</b> According to Rabbi Shimon, the fasts are listed in accordance with the chronological order of the events. <b>But he,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>says about the first</b> fast mentioned by the prophet that it marks the event that took place <b>last, and about the last</b> fast mentioned that it marks the event that took place <b>first, only that he lists</b> the fasts <b>in the order of the months, whereas I list</b> them also <b>in the order of the calamities</b> that they mark.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the Sages disagreed about the following matter: <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina</b> both <b>say: <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>,</b> a listing of days on which fasting and eulogizing are forbidden, <b>has been nullified,</b> as in the present period of exile there is no reason to celebrate the joyous events that these days commemorate. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> has not been nullified.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina say</b> that <b><i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> has been nullified. This is what</b> the prophet <b>is saying: At a time when there is peace</b> in the world, the dates listed <b>will be</b> times of <b>joy and gladness,</b> on which eulogies and fasting are forbidden; but when <b>there is no peace,</b> they are days of <b>fasting. And those</b> days mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> <b>are also like these</b> days of fasting, that is to say, the days of joy listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> are also nullified when there is no peace.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say</b> that <b><i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> has not been nullified,</b> and they reason as follows: <b>It was those</b> fast days mentioned in the Bible <b>that the Merciful One makes contingent on the building of the Temple, but these</b> festive days listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> <b>remain as they were</b> and have not been nullified.
<b>Rav Kahana raised an objection</b> against Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was an incident and</b> the Sages <b>decreed a fast on Hanukkah in Lod, and Rabbi Eliezer went down</b> on that day <b>and bathed</b> in the bathhouse <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua went down and cut</b> his hair to show that they did not accept the fast. Furthermore, these two Sages <b>said to</b> the others: <b>Go out and fast</b> another fast as an act of penitence <b>for what you have</b> already <b>fasted,</b> as the days of Hanukkah are days of joy, on which fasting is forbidden. Hanukkah is one of the Festivals listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>. Even after the destruction of the Temple Hanukkah is celebrated, demonstrating that <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> has not been nullified.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Hanukkah is different, as there is the mitzva</b> of lighting candles, and so, unlike the other days listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>, the festival of Hanukkah was not nullified. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> What is this argument? <b>Let</b> Hanukkah <b>itself be nullified, and let its mitzva</b> of lighting candles <b>be nullified</b> with it.
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef</b> retracted his previous explanation and <b>said: Hanukkah is different, as its miracle is well known,</b> and it has become so widely accepted by all the Jewish people that it would be inappropriate to nullify it.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection:</b> It is stated in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>: <b>On the third of Tishrei the</b> ordinance requiring the <b>mention</b> of God’s name <b>in</b> legal <b>documents was abolished,</b> and on that day fasting is forbidden. <b>For the kingdom of Greece had issued a decree</b> against the Jews <b>forbidding them to mention the name of Heaven on their lips. When the Hasmonean kingdom became strong and defeated</b> the Greeks, <b>they instituted that people should mention the name of Heaven even in their</b> legal <b>documents. And therefore they would write: In year such and such of Yoḥanan the High Priest of the God Most High.</b>
<b>And when the Sages heard about this they said: Tomorrow this one,</b> the borrower, <b>will repay his debt,</b> the lender will no longer need to save the loan document, <b>the document will be cast on a dunghill,</b> and the name of Heaven written there will come to disgrace. <b>And</b> so <b>they annulled</b> the ordinance to mention God’s name in documents, <b>and they made that day into a Festival. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b><i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> has been nullified,</b> can you say that <b>the first</b> prohibitions against fasting <b>they annulled, and</b> then <b>later</b> ones <b>were added?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is referring to a time <b>when the Temple was standing</b> and all the days listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> were in force. From time to time new days of commemoration were added. When the <i>amora’im</i> stated that <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> was nullified they were referring to the time after the destruction of the Temple.

Daf 19a

The Gemara raises a difficulty: But if this was at the time that the Temple was standing, <b>derive</b> the prohibition against fasting on the third of Tishrei from the fact that <b>it is the day that Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, was killed.</b> During the time of the Temple the biblical fast days were celebrated as days of joy. <b>Rav said: It was only necessary</b> to include the third of Tishrei in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> <b>in order to prohibit</b> fasting on <b>the preceding</b> day as well. Fasting was forbidden not only on the actual days listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>, but also on the preceding day and the following day.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: With regard to the prohibition against fasting on <b>the preceding day,</b> the second of Tishrei, <b>also derive it because it is</b> the <b>day after</b> the <b>New Moon,</b> and fasting is forbidden not only on festive days, but also on the preceding day and the following day. The Gemara rejects this argument: The <b>New Moon is by Torah law,</b> and festive days that are <b>by Torah law do not require reinforcement.</b> Therefore no decree was ever enacted prohibiting fasting on the days before and after.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These days that are written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> are</b> days on which fasting is <b>prohibited,</b> as are <b>both</b> the day <b>before them and</b> the day <b>after them.</b> With regard to <b><i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals,</b> fasting on <b>them is forbidden,</b> but on the day <b>before them and</b> the day <b>after them</b> fasting <b>is permitted. What is the difference between this</b> class of days <b>and that</b> class of days? <b>These</b> days, <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals, <b>are</b> by <b>Torah law, and Torah laws do not need reinforcement,</b> and therefore even if a fast day were decreed on the day before or after them, the Festival itself would not be nullified; whereas <b>those</b> days mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> <b>are</b> by <b>rabbinic law, and rabbinic laws need reinforcement,</b> and therefore fasting is prohibited even on the day before and the day after.
The Gemara raises yet another difficulty: The prohibition against fasting on the second of Tishrei, <b>derive it</b> from the fact that <b>it is the day before the day that Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, was killed,</b> and since in Temple times the fast of Gedaliah was celebrated as a festive day, fasting should also be prohibited on the preceding day. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The fast of <b>Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, is</b> derived from <b>the texts of the tradition,</b> i.e., Prophets and Writings, <b>and</b> as <b>the texts of the tradition are</b> treated <b>like Torah statements</b> for this purpose, they too do not need reinforcement.
<b>Rav Tovi bar Mattana raised an objection</b> against the opinion that <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> was nullified, from that which is written in it: <b>On the twenty-eighth of</b> Adar the <b>good tidings came to the Jews that they should not turn away from the Torah,</b> and on that day fasting is forbidden. And this is explained: <b>For the wicked kingdom issued a decree against Israel that they should not occupy themselves with Torah</b> study, <b>and that they should not circumcise their sons, and that they should desecrate Shabbat. What did Yehuda ben Shammua and his colleagues do? They went and took advice from</b> a certain <b>matron [<i>matronita</i>] whom all the prominent men of Rome would visit regularly,</b> thinking that she would know how to annul the decree.
<b>She said to them</b> as follows: <b>Come and cry out [<i>hafgginu</i>] at night</b> in the streets and markets. <b>They went and cried out at night, saying: O Heavens! Are we</b> Jews <b>not your brothers; are we not children of one father; are we not children of one mother? How are we different from every</b> other <b>nation and tongue that you issue</b> such <b>harsh decrees against us? And</b> indeed the decrees <b>were annulled, and</b> the Sages <b>made that day a festive day. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b><i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> has been nullified,</b> can you say that <b>the first</b> prohibitions against fasting <b>they annulled, and</b> then <b>later</b> ones <b>were added?</b>
<b>And if you say that here too</b> it is referring to <b>the time when the Temple was standing,</b> there is a difficulty, <b>as Yehuda ben Shammua was a student of Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Meir was after</b> the destruction of the Temple. And proof that Rabbi Yehuda ben Shammua was a student of Rabbi Meir may be brought, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>glass vessels that had holes</b> in them, which afterward <b>were filled in with lead,</b> the Sages dispute whether the utensil is considered a whole utensil, which can become ritually impure, or whether it is considered a broken utensil, which does not. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Yehuda ben Shammua</b> declares that it <b>becomes impure, in the name of Rabbi Meir;</b>

Daf 19b

<b>whereas the Sages declare it pure.</b> According to them, it is still considered a broken utensil. Rabbi Meir himself lived after the destruction of the Second Temple. The festive day commemorating the annulling of the decree of Rome was instituted as a result of an incident involving his student, Rabbi Yehuda ben Shammua. From this, it is clear that <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> had not yet been nullified.
The Gemara answers: The question whether or not <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> has been nullified is the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These days, which are written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>, both when the Temple is standing and when the Temple is not standing, are</b> days on which fasting is <b>prohibited;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: When the Temple is standing,</b> these days <b>are prohibited</b> for fasting <b>because</b> these days <b>are</b> a source of <b>joy for</b> Israel. But when <b>the Temple is not standing,</b> these days <b>are permitted</b> for fasting <b>because these</b> days <b>are</b> a source of <b>mourning for them.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that these days <b>were nullified, and the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>they were not nullified.</b> The Gemara asks: This <b>is difficult,</b> as one <b><i>halakha</i></b> contradicts <b>the</b> other <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> it is referring to <b>Hanukkah and Purim.</b> These Festival days were never nullified, and Hanukkah is listed among the Festivals of <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>. <b>There,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is referring to <b>the rest of the days</b> listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>, all of which were nullified.
§ The mishna taught: Messengers go out to inform about the sanctification of the New Moon <b>in Elul, due to Rosh HaShana, and in Tishrei, due to the</b> need to establish the <b>correct</b> dates on which to celebrate <b>the Festivals</b> of Tishrei. The Gemara asks: <b>Once</b> the messengers <b>have gone out in</b> the month of <b>Elul</b> to inform the people when the New Moon was declared, <b>why do they</b> need to go out again <b>in Tishrei,</b> as the New Moon of Tishrei always falls on the thirtieth day after the New Moon of Elul?
<b>And if you say</b> that messengers must go out for Tishrei as well, as <b>perhaps the</b> court <b>added</b> another day to the month of <b>Elul,</b> so that Rosh HaShana occurs on the thirty-first day after the New Moon of Elul, there is a difficulty. <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Kahana say</b> that <b>Rav said: From the days of Ezra and onward, we have never found that</b> the month of <b>Elul</b> had <b>an additional</b> day. Consequently, it is simple to calculate the days on which the Festivals of Tishrei occur, and there should be no need to send out messengers in Tishrei.
The Gemara answers: When we say: <b>We have not</b> found that the month of Elul ever had an additional day, this does not mean that Elul cannot have an additional day, but only that it never happened <b>because it was not necessary</b> to add a day. <b>But</b> if it had been <b>necessary, they would</b> have added <b>an additional</b> day. Since it is possible that the month of Elul could have had another day added, there is reason to send out messengers for the month of Tishrei, so that all will know when to celebrate the Festivals.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if Elul has an additional day <b>Rosh HaShana will be ruined,</b> because people will celebrate it thirty days after the New Moon of Elul, when its real date is on the thirty-first day. The Gemara answers: <b>Better that Rosh HaShana be ruined, and all the Festivals,</b> i.e., Yom Kippur, <i>Sukkot</i>, and the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>not be ruined.</b>
The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> Messengers go out <b>in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei due to the</b> need to establish the <b>correct</b> dates on which to celebrate <b>the Festivals</b> of Tishrei. The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <b>conclude from here</b> that this is the correct understanding.
§ The mishna taught: Messengers go out <b>in Kislev, due to Hanukkah, and in Adar, due to Purim. Whereas, it is not taught: If the year was a leap year,</b> with an additional month of Adar, the messengers <b>go out also in the second Adar due to Purim,</b> which is celebrated in the second Adar. This indicates that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: If the year was a leap year,</b> the messengers <b>go out also in the second Adar, due to Purim.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about this.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the author of this mishna, <b>holds</b> that <b>all the mitzvot observed in the second</b> Adar, i.e., the special Torah readings and the mitzvot of Purim, <b>are</b> also <b>observed in the first</b> Adar. If they were observed in the first Adar and not in the second, the people have fulfilled their obligation. Therefore, there is no need to send messengers in the second Adar. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>all the mitzvot observed in the second</b> Adar <b>are not observed in the first.</b> It is therefore necessary to send messengers in the second Adar, so that people will know when to keep the mitzvot of Adar.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No, everyone agrees that the mitzvot observed in the second</b> Adar <b>are not observed on the first, and here they disagree about</b> the length of the additional month in the <b>leap year, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How long is</b> the additional month in <b>a leap year? Thirty days. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A month.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and since the additional month does not have a fixed number of days, it is necessary to send messengers also for the second Adar, so that people will know when to celebrate Purim. However, according to the first <i>tanna</i>, since the first Adar is always a fixed length, there is no need to send messengers.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about thirty days?</b> It is different <b>because</b> people can count thirty days and <b>know</b> when the month ends and when Purim occurs. <b>A month also,</b> people <b>know</b> the length of it. The term month implies that it is a month of twenty-nine days, and based on that they know when to celebrate Purim. <b>Rav Pappa said: The one who said</b> that <b>a month</b> is added does not mean necessarily a month of twenty-nine days. Rather, <b>if</b> the judges of the court <b>wish,</b> they add <b>a month</b> of twenty-nine days; and <b>if it wishes,</b> they add <b>thirty</b> days. Therefore, it is necessary to send messengers also for the second Adar.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi testified in the name of the holy community of Jerusalem about the two</b> months of <b>Adar, that they are sanctified on the day that</b> could have been added to make them <b>a full</b> month, i.e., the thirtieth day after the previous New Moon. That is to say, the thirtieth day after the New Moon of the first Adar is always the New Moon of the second Adar, and thirty days after the New Moon of the second Adar is always the New Moon of Nisan.
The Gemara comments: <b>That is to say</b> that <b>they make</b> the two months of Adar <b>short</b> months, of twenty-nine days, but <b>they do not make them full</b> months, of thirty days. This is <b>to the exclusion of what Rav Naḥman bar Ḥisda taught,</b> as Rav Naḥman bar Ḥisda taught: <b>Rabbi Simai testified in the name of Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi about two</b> months of <b>Adar</b> in a leap year, <b>that if</b> the members of the court <b>wish to make them both full, they may do</b> so; and if they wish to make them both <b>short, they may do</b> so; and if they wish to <b>make one full and one short, they may do</b> so. <b>And this is what they would do in the Diaspora,</b> when they did not know which day was established as the New Moon. <b>And in the name of our teacher,</b> Rav, <b>they said:</b> The two months of Adar are <b>always</b> observed, <b>one full and one short, unless it is known to you that</b> the <b>New Moon was fixed in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> i.e., the first Adar is also short.
A ruling <b>was sent</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>to Mar Ukva,</b> the Exilarch in Babylonia: <b>The Adar that</b> immediately <b>precedes Nisan is always short,</b> both in a regular year and in a leap year. But the first Adar in a leap year, which does not immediately precede Nisan, is sometimes full.
<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection</b> from what was taught in a mishna: Witnesses who saw the new moon <b>may desecrate Shabbat for</b> the fixing of the New Moon of <b>two months, for</b> the month of <b>Nisan and for</b> the month of <b>Tishrei,</b> due to the important Festivals that occur in them. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the Adar immediately preceding Nisan is <b>sometimes full and sometimes short, due to that</b> reason the witnesses <b>may desecrate</b> Shabbat, as if the witnesses come on the thirtieth, the month will be made short and that day will be declared the New Moon; otherwise, the month will be made full and the next day will be declared the New Moon.

Daf 20a

<b>But if you say</b> that the Adar immediately preceding Nisan is <b>always short, why should they desecrate</b> Shabbat? The court can calculate the time of the New Moon without witnesses. The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the New Moon <b>on the basis of</b> the testimony of witnesses who actually <b>saw</b> the new moon and not rely on calculations or established practices.
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: We, too, learn</b> in a mishna: Witnesses who saw the new moon <b>may desecrate Shabbat</b> to establish the New Moon for <b>two months, for</b> the month of <b>Nisan and for</b> the month of <b>Tishrei. Granted, if you say</b> that the Adar immediately preceding Nisan is <b>always short, due to that</b> reason the witnesses <b>may desecrate</b> Shabbat, <b>because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month <b>on the basis of</b> the testimony of witnesses who actually <b>saw</b> the new moon.
<b>But if you say</b> that the Adar immediately preceding Nisan <b>is sometimes full</b> and <b>sometimes short,</b> and there is no regularity to it, <b>why should</b> the witnesses <b>desecrate</b> Shabbat? Have the court <b>add</b> an extra day to the month <b>now,</b> since it can decide whether the thirtieth day or the thirty-first day is the beginning of the new month, <b>and</b> let the members of the court <b>sanctify the next day</b> as the New Moon.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If the thirtieth</b> of Adar <b>falls on Shabbat, this</b> is <b>indeed</b> what is done. The witnesses are not permitted to desecrate Shabbat. Rather, the month is made full and the next day is sanctified as the New Moon. <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case where the <b>thirty-first</b> of Adar <b>falls on Shabbat,</b> and so the sanctification of the New Moon cannot be pushed off to the next day, as a month cannot be longer than thirty days. In that case, the witnesses may desecrate Shabbat <b>because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month based <b>on</b> testimony of witnesses who actually <b>saw</b> the new moon.
<b>Rav Kahana raised an objection</b> from the continuation of the mishna, which teaches: <b>When the Temple was standing,</b> the witnesses <b>would desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>for</b> establishing the New Moon <b>even</b> for <b>all</b> the months, <b>in order to rectify the offering</b> of the New Moon, i.e., ensure that it is at the proper time.
<b>From</b> the fact that the reason that the witnesses are permitted to desecrate Shabbat for <b>all</b> the other months is <b>not because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month based <b>on</b> testimony of witnesses who <b>saw</b> the new moon, the implication is that with regard to <b>Nisan and Tishrei as well,</b> the witnesses are permitted to desecrate Shabbat for another reason and <b>not because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month based <b>on</b> the testimony of witnesses who <b>saw</b> the new moon.
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that Adar <b>is sometimes full and sometimes short, due to that</b> reason the witnesses <b>may desecrate</b> Shabbat. <b>But if you say</b> that Adar <b>is always short, why should they desecrate</b> Shabbat? The court knows in advance when will be the New Moon of Nisan. The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation</b> to the proof brought by Rav Naḥman.
§ It is related that <b>when Ulla came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> This year <b>they added</b> an extra day to the month of <b>Elul. Ulla</b> continued and <b>said: Do our Babylonian colleagues understand what benefit we did for them?</b> We pushed off Rosh HaShana for a day, so that the Festival would not occur adjacent to Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>benefit</b> in having a weekday between Shabbat and a Festival? <b>Ulla said: Due to the vegetables</b> that would not be picked for two days and those picked beforehand that would no longer be fresh. <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: Due to the dead</b> who would not be buried for two days and consequently would begin to decompose.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two concerns? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in the case where <b>Yom Kippur occurs</b> directly <b>after Shabbat.</b> According to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the dead</b> that would go unburied for two days, the court <b>adds</b> an extra day to Elul so that Yom Kippur will not occur on Sunday. <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the vegetables</b> that would not be fresh, there is no need to add an extra day to Elul. <b>When would he require</b> the vegetables? Only <b>in the evening</b> following Yom Kippur; and if Yom Kippur falls on Sunday, he can go out <b>in the evening</b> after the fast <b>and bring</b> fresh vegetables.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the reason is <b>due to vegetables,</b> the court <b>should</b> still <b>make</b> Elul <b>full due to the dead,</b> as this is also an important consideration. <b>Rather,</b> the practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to the case where <b>the Festival</b> of Rosh HaShana <b>occurs adjacent to Shabbat, either before it or after it.</b> According to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the vegetables</b> that would wither, the court <b>adds</b> an extra day to Elul. <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the dead</b> that would go unburied, there is no reason to make Elul full, because on a Festival <b>it is possible</b> to arrange that the dead be buried <b>by gentiles.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the dead,</b> the court <b>should</b> still <b>add</b> an extra day to Elul <b>due to the vegetables.</b> The Gemara answers: According to him this is not an important consideration, <b>because it is possible</b> to soak the withered vegetables <b>in hot water</b> and thereby restore their freshness.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is different</b> about those who live in Babylonia and those who live in Eretz Yisrael? Why did Ulla specifically say that adding an extra day to Elul was beneficial <b>to us,</b> in Babylonia; it was beneficial <b>to them as well.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>For us</b> in Babylonia the weather <b>is</b> very <b>hot,</b> and so vegetables wither and corpses decompose quickly. But <b>for them</b> in Eretz Yisrael, the weather <b>is not</b> as <b>hot,</b> and vegetables and corpses can be kept for two days.
§ It was taught above that for various reasons a month can have an extra day added, even if the new moon was seen on the night before the thirtieth. The Gemara challenges this assumption: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that just as</b> the court <b>adds</b> an extra month to <b>a year for</b> some pressing communal <b>need, so too,</b> the court <b>adds</b> an extra day to <b>a month for</b> some similar <b>need.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months”</b> (Exodus 12:2). This teaches that when there is a moon <b>like this, see</b> it <b>and sanctify</b> the month. When the new moon is seen, the month must be sanctified without delay.
<b>Rava said: This</b> is <b>not difficult: Here</b> it is speaking of <b>adding</b> an extra day to the month, although the new moon was seen on the thirtieth, which is permitted; whereas <b>there</b> it is speaking of <b>sanctifying</b> the month on the thirtieth, although the new moon was not yet seen, which is prohibited. <b>And this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that just as</b> the court <b>adds to a year or a month for</b> some pressing communal <b>need, so too, a month can be sanctified</b> early on the thirtieth even without seeing the new moon. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months,”</b> which teaches: Only when the moon appears <b>like this, see</b> it <b>and sanctify</b> the month, but not before.
The Gemara comments that this is <b>like that which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> The court <b>may intimidate witnesses</b> through rigorous and confusing examination, so that they will give inadmissible testimony <b>about the</b> new <b>moon that was seen at its</b> due <b>time,</b> the thirtieth of the month. This is so that the court <b>can add</b> an extra day to <b>it,</b> and the New Moon will be sanctified on the thirty-first day. <b>But</b> the court <b>may not intimidate witnesses</b> into giving testimony <b>about the new moon that was not seen on its</b> due <b>time, in order to sanctify</b> the New Moon early, on the thirtieth.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yehuda Nesia,</b> who was the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin, <b>send</b> a message <b>to Rabbi Ami: Be aware that all the days of Rabbi Yoḥanan he would teach us</b> that <b>witnesses may be intimidated</b> into giving testimony <b>about the</b> new <b>moon that was not seen in its</b> due <b>time.</b> This was done <b>in order that</b> the new month <b>may be sanctified</b> early, already on the thirtieth. <b>Although</b> the witnesses <b>did not see</b> the moon, <b>they may say: We saw it.</b>
<b>Abaye said: This</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> ruling <b>is referring to Nisan and Tishrei,</b> which may be sanctified early in order to set the Festivals that occur in those months; <b>that</b> ruling is referring to <b>the other months,</b> which may not be sanctified early, even for some other pressing need.
<b>Rava said: That which Rabba bar Shmuel taught,</b> that the court may not lengthen or shorten the months for reason of communal need, follows the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: The</b> difference <b>between</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> of one year and the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> of the following year, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>between Rosh HaShana</b> of one year and <b>Rosh HaShana</b> of the following year, <b>is only four days</b> of the week. There are 354 days in a lunar year, which are divided into twelve alternating months, six months that are thirty days long and six months that are twenty-nine days long. Therefore, every year is fifty weeks and four days long. <b>And if it was a leap year,</b> in which case the year is comprised of 383 days, or fifty-four weeks and five days, there is a difference of <b>five</b> days between them.
<b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> in <b>the opposite</b> manner: The court <b>may intimidate the witnesses</b> into giving testimony <b>about the new moon that was not seen in its</b> due <b>time in order that</b> the new month <b>may be sanctified</b> early, already on the thirtieth. <b>But</b> the court <b>may not intimidate witnesses</b> so that they do not give acceptable testimony <b>about the</b> new <b>moon that was seen in its</b> due <b>time,</b> in order <b>to add</b> an extra day to the old month, so that the New Moon is sanctified on the thirty-first.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for Rav Dimi’s opinion? Intimidating witnesses into testifying about something that they did not see is worse than intimidating them to withhold testimony about something that they did see.

Daf 20b

In <b>this</b> case, where the witnesses withhold testimony about what they saw and the New Moon is pushed off to the next day, it <b>looks like a lie,</b> as the moon might have been seen by others as well, and people will wonder why the New Moon was not sanctified the previous day. In <b>that</b> case, where the witnesses testify about something that they did not see and the New Moon is a day early, it <b>does not look like a lie,</b> as everybody knows that it is possible that only a few people saw the new moon.
§ <b>Shmuel said: I am able to fix</b> the calendar <b>for the entire Diaspora</b> without witnesses. Shmuel was an expert on the movement of the celestial bodies and on the principles governing leap years and additional days added to months.
<b>Abba, the father of Rabbi Simlai, said to Shmuel: Does the Master know</b> the meaning of <b>this statement, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> dealing with <b>the secret of addition,</b> which discusses calendric calculations: Differentiate between when <b>the <i>molad</i> occurred before midday and</b> when <b>the <i>molad</i> occurred after midday? He said to him: No,</b> I do not know what this means. <b>He said to him: Since the Master does not know this, there are</b> probably <b>other matters that the Master does not know,</b> and therefore you must not establish a calendar, relying upon calculations that were made based on faulty or insufficient knowledge.
As for the meaning of this obscure <i>baraita</i>, <b>when Rabbi Zeira went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he sent</b> back a letter to his colleagues in Babylonia: In order for a day to be sanctified as the New Moon, <b>it is necessary that</b> both <b>the night and the day be of the new</b> month. That is to say, the <i>molad</i> must occur before the beginning of the night.
<b>And this is what Abba, the father of Rabbi Simlai, said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means as follows: <b>They calculate the <i>molad</i>;</b> if <b>the <i>molad</i> occurred before midday,</b> so that there are at least six more hours left of the day, <b>it is known that</b> the moon <b>will be visible close to sunset.</b> If, however, <b>the <i>molad</i> did not occur before midday,</b> so that there are fewer than six hours left of the day, <b>it is known that</b> the moon <b>will not be visible close to sunset.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical difference</b> that this statement makes? In any case, the court is dependent upon the testimony of witnesses. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This information is used <b>to refute the witnesses,</b> as if the witnesses claim that they saw the new moon at a time when it was not visible according to the calculations, they are clearly false witnesses.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> For <b>twenty-four hours the moon is covered,</b> i.e., not visible. This occurs between the last sighting of the old moon and the first sighting of the new moon. <b>For us,</b> in Babylonia, it is not visible for <b>six</b> hours <b>of the old</b> moon <b>and eighteen</b> hours <b>of the new; for them,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, it is not visible for <b>six</b> hours <b>of the new</b> moon <b>and eighteen</b> hours <b>of the old.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical difference</b> that this statement makes? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is used <b>to refute the witnesses,</b> as if they testify that they saw two moons, the old and the new, within a single twenty-four hour period, they are certainly false witnesses.
§ <b>The Master said</b> above: In order for a day to be sanctified as the New Moon, <b>it is necessary that</b> both <b>the night and the day be of the new</b> moon. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The verse states: <b>“From evening to evening</b> shall you celebrate your Shabbat” (Leviticus 23:32). This teaches that the day follows the night for all the calculations pertaining to the Festivals and New Moons.
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> It is derived from the verse that states: “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, <b>until the twenty-first day of the month at the evening”</b> (Exodus 12:18). This teaches that the Festival terminates at the end of the day, and a new day begins in the evening.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two derivations? <b>Abaye said:</b> There is no practical difference between them. <b>The interpretation of the meaning</b> of the verse <b>is</b> the difference <b>between them.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> There is a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the hours before <b>midnight.</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who derives the <i>halakha</i> from the verse: “From evening to evening,” the previous day ends at nightfall. Therefore, if the new moon was seen only at the beginning of the night of the thirtieth, the thirtieth is not sanctified as the New Moon. However, according to Reish Lakish, who derives the <i>halakha</i> from the verse with regard to Passover: “Until the twenty-first day of the month at the evening,” the moon may be sanctified if it was seen before midnight. Eating unleavened bread on Passover is an obligation only on the first night until midnight. After that time, it is optional. The verse states: “You shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at the evening,” implying that it is not obligatory but optional to eat unleavened bread. Since the optional time of eating unleavened bread begins at midnight, after the conclusion of the obligatory time, the conclusion of that time is also at midnight on the twenty-first day. This implies that there is a concept of a day beginning at midnight. Accordingly, if the new moon was seen at the beginning of the night of the thirtieth, the thirtieth can still be sanctified as the New Moon.
§ With regard to the extra Festival day that is observed in the Diaspora, <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: Any</b> time that an extra Festival day is observed out of <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to the calendar, <b>we cast it forward,</b> i.e., it is observed on the following day and not on the preceding day. <b>That is to say,</b> owing to the uncertainty <b>we observe</b> <i>Sukkot</i> in the Diaspora on <b>the fifteenth and the sixteenth</b> of Tishrei, but <b>not</b> on <b>the fourteenth.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>observe</b> it <b>also on the fourteenth,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> both the month of <b>Av and</b> the month of <b>Elul were made short?</b> In that case, the day that is considered the fourteenth of Tishrei in the Diaspora would actually be the fifteenth of Tishrei, and therefore it should also be observed as <i>Sukkot</i>.

Daf 21a

The Gemara answers: It is a rare occurrence that <b>two</b> consecutive <b>months are made short,</b> and this <b>would generate publicity,</b> so that everyone would know about it.
§ It was related that <b>Levi</b> once <b>arrived in Babylonia on</b> what was observed there as <b>the eleventh of Tishrei. He said: How tasty is the dish of the Babylonians on the great day</b> of Yom Kippur, as they are observing Yom Kippur <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael. The month of Elul had been declared full in Eretz Yisrael, and according to the calendar there, it was only the tenth of Tishrei. <b>They said to him: Testify</b> that today is Yom Kippur and we shall observe it. <b>He said to them: I</b> myself <b>did not hear the court</b> proclaim: <b>It is sanctified.</b> Although I know that the month had been declared full, since I did not personally hear the proclamation, I cannot offer direct testimony such that you should change your calculations.
It was further related that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> used to <b>proclaim: Anywhere that can be reached</b> by the <b>messengers</b> who go out <b>in Nisan</b> in time to inform the people when to observe Passover, <b>but cannot be reached by the messengers</b> sent out <b>in Tishrei, let them</b> also <b>observe</b> the festival of Passover <b>for two days.</b> The messengers did not travel on Rosh HaShana or Yom Kippur, and therefore they could travel three days further in Nisan than in Tishrei. The Sages instituted that two days must be observed in <b>Nisan as</b> a rabbinic <b>decree due to Tishrei,</b> for if they observe Passover for only one day, they will come to observe <i>Sukkot</i> for one day as well, and this they are not permitted to do.
It was reported that <b>Rabbi Aivu bar Naggarei and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba,</b> two disciples of Rabbi Yoḥanan, once <b>arrived in a certain place that could be reached by the messengers</b> who go out <b>in Nisan, but could not be reached by the messengers</b> who go out <b>in Tishrei. And</b> they saw that the locals <b>observed</b> only <b>one day</b> of Passover. <b>They said nothing to them</b> to correct their practice. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan heard</b> this <b>and he became angry</b> with Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Ḥiyya, for they had failed to rebuke the people who were acting contrary to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explicit ruling. <b>He said to them: Did I not say to you</b> that <b>anywhere that can be reached by the messengers</b> sent out <b>in Nisan but not by those</b> sent out <b>in Tishrei must observe two days</b> of Passover, for the Sages instituted a rabbinic <b>decree in Nisan due to Tishrei?</b>
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rava would regularly sit in</b> observance of <b>the fast</b> of Yom Kippur <b>for two days,</b> in case Elul had been declared a thirty-day month and Yom Kippur should be observed on what was observed in Babylonia as the eleventh of Tishrei. <b>It once happened in accordance with his</b> opinion. Elul had been declared a thirty-day month, and he was the only one who observed Yom Kippur on the correct day.
It was related that <b>Rav Naḥman had</b> once <b>fasted the entire</b> day of <b>Yom Kippur</b> as usual. <b>In the evening,</b> toward the end of his fast, <b>a certain man came</b> and <b>said to him: Tomorrow is the great day,</b> Yom Kippur, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, and it is therefore necessary to fast tomorrow.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to him: From where do you</b> come? <b>He said to him: From</b> a place called <b>Damihareya. He said to him,</b> playing on the name of his place: <b>Blood will be his end,</b> meaning Rav Naḥman’s own end. Due to this information, Rav Naḥman would have to fast two successive days, and thereby suffer greatly, as if his blood were being shed. <b>He read</b> the verse <b>about him: “Our pursuers were swifter</b> than vultures in the sky” (Lamentations 4:19), for had this messenger arrived just a little bit later, they would have eaten and drunk in the meantime.
§ <b>Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> this instruction <b>to Rava: When you see that,</b> according to your calculations, <b>the season of Tevet,</b> i.e., winter, will <b>extend to the sixteenth of Nisan,</b> and the spring equinox will occur after the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>add</b> an extra month <b>to that year,</b> making it a leap year. <b>And do not worry</b> about finding an additional reason to justify making it a leap year, <b>as it is written: “Observe the month of spring”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:1). That is to say, <b>see to it that the spring of the season,</b> i.e., the spring equinox, <b>is in the new part of Nisan,</b> i.e., the first half, before Passover.
It was related that <b>Rav Naḥman said to those setting out to sea</b> before Nisan: Since <b>you will not know the determination of the</b> first day of the new <b>month,</b> this is what you should do: <b>When you see that the moon sets at daybreak,</b> i.e., that it is visible all night from sundown to sunrise, know that it is the middle of the month of Nisan and <b>burn</b> your <b>leaven.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>When does</b> the moon <b>set</b> at daybreak? <b>On the fifteenth</b> of the month. <b>But on the fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>we burn</b> leaven. The Gemara answers: <b>For</b> those out at sea, <b>to whom the world is revealed,</b> to whom the horizon is wide open and clearly visible, the moon <b>completes</b> its course at sunrise already <b>on the fourteenth</b> of the month. They can therefore rely on this sign to establish the date of Passover and the time for burning leaven.

Daf 21b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Only <b>for</b> the sake of <b>two months may</b> witnesses who saw the new moon <b>desecrate Shabbat,</b> should that be necessary in order for them to offer testimony before the court: <b>For</b> the month of <b>Nisan and for</b> the month of <b>Tishrei, for in these</b> months <b>messengers are sent out to Syria, and by them,</b> i.e., these months, the dates of <b>the</b> major <b>Festivals are set:</b> Yom Kippur, <i>Sukkot</i>, Passover, and <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>And when the Temple was standing,</b> the witnesses <b>desecrated</b> Shabbat <b>for</b> the fixing of the New Moon of <b>all</b> the months, <b>due to</b> the imperative of <b>fixing</b> the proper <b>offering</b> of the New Moon at the correct time.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that messengers were sent out for two months. The Gemara asks: <b>For</b> only <b>two months and no more? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the previous mishna, which teaches: <b>For six months</b> of the year <b>messengers go out,</b> not only for two months.
<b>Abaye said: This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: For all</b> the other months <b>the messengers go out</b> already <b>in the evening,</b> if the new moon was clearly seen and if it is certain that the court will proclaim the day as the New Moon. But <b>for Nisan and for Tishrei</b> the messengers do not go out <b>until they hear from the court</b> that the day is declared as the New Moon, by saying: It is <b>sanctified,</b> so that they can offer proper testimony. The court convenes only during the daytime.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For all</b> the other months the messengers <b>go out</b> already <b>in the evening,</b> but <b>for</b> the month of <b>Nisan and for</b> the month of <b>Tishrei</b> they do not go out <b>until they have heard the court</b> formally proclaim the day as the New Moon, by saying: It is <b>sanctified.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the witnesses who saw the new moon <b>may desecrate Shabbat</b> in order to testify before the court? <b>The verse states: “These are the Festivals of the Lord,</b> sacred gatherings, <b>which you shall declare in their seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:4), thereby emphasizing that the Festivals must be set at their proper times. To ensure that they occur at the proper times, it is even permitted to desecrate Shabbat.
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that just as</b> Shabbat <b>may be desecrated</b> by the witnesses <b>so that</b> the months <b>may be sanctified</b> at the proper time, <b>so too,</b> Shabbat <b>may be desecrated</b> by the messengers who go to inform the people in Eretz Yisrael and the Diaspora which day was sanctified as the New Moon, <b>so that</b> the Festivals <b>may be observed</b> at the proper time. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Which you shall declare,”</b> from which is derived that <b>for the declaration</b> of the New Moon <b>you may desecrate</b> Shabbat, <b>but you may not desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>for the observance</b> of the Festivals in their proper time.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And when the Temple was standing,</b> the witnesses <b>desecrated</b> Shabbat <b>for</b> the fixing of the New Moon of <b>all</b> the months, <b>due to</b> the imperative of <b>fixing</b> the proper <b>offering</b> of the New Moon at the correct time. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first, they would desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>for all</b> of the months. <b>When the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> the Sages: <b>Is there</b> now some <b>offering</b> due, for which it is necessary to desecrate Shabbat? Consequently, <b>they instituted that</b> the witnesses <b>may desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>only for</b> the months of <b>Nisan and Tishrei.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Whether</b> the new moon <b>was seen clearly [<i>ba’alil</i>]</b> by everyone <b>or whether it was not clearly seen, one may desecrate Shabbat</b> in order to testify before the court. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If</b> the moon <b>was clearly seen, they may not desecrate Shabbat for it,</b> since other witnesses, located nearer to the court, will certainly testify. If these distant witnesses go to court to testify, they will desecrate Shabbat unnecessarily.
There was once <b>an incident where more than forty pairs</b> of witnesses <b>were passing</b> through on their way to Jerusalem to testify about the new moon, <b>and Rabbi Akiva detained them in Lod,</b> telling them that there was no need for them to desecrate Shabbat for this purpose. <b>Rabban Gamliel sent</b> a message <b>to him: If you detain the many</b> people who wish to testify about the new moon, <b>you will cause them to stumble in the future.</b> They will say: Why should we go, seeing that our testimony is unnecessary? At some point they will be needed, and no witnesses will come to the court.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that the term <b><i>alil</i></b> denotes that the new moon is clearly <b>revealed? Rabbi Abbahu said: The verse states: “The words of the Lord are pure words; silver refined in the clear sight [<i>ba’alil</i>] of the earth, purified seven times”</b> (Psalms 12:7).
The aforementioned verse states: “The words of the Lord are pure words…purified seven times [<i>shivatayim</i>].” <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed about a matter relating to this verse: <b>One</b> of them <b>said: Fifty gates of understanding were created in the world, and all of them were given to Moses, except for one</b> gate, for it is stated: “The words of the Lord are purified <i>shivatayim</i>,” which he understands to mean seven times seven, i.e., forty-nine, and <b>it is stated: “And You have made him a little less than God”</b> (Psalms 8:6). God created fifty gates of understanding, but He made man a little lower than God, giving him only forty-nine of them.
<b>“Kohelet sought to find out words of delight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10), which indicates that he sought to find the fiftieth gate but failed to do so. <b>Kohelet,</b> King Solomon, <b>sought to be like Moses,</b> but <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said to him: “And that which was written uprightly, even words of truth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10). This is referring to the words of the Torah; and what is written there? <b>“And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,</b> whom the Lord knew face-to-face” (Deuteronomy 34:10).
<b>And</b> the other <b>one said: Among the prophets there has not arisen one</b> like Moses, but <b>among the kings, one did arise,</b> Solomon, who was as wise as Moses. <b>How do I uphold</b> the words <b>“Kohelet sought to find words of delight”? Kohelet,</b> King Solomon, <b>sought to issue judgments of the heart,</b> based solely on his intuition, <b>without witnesses and without warning.</b> But <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said to him: “And that which was written uprightly, even words of truth.”</b> Which words is this referring to? <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses,</b> or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death” (Deuteronomy 17:6). Punishment can be administered only based on the testimony of two witnesses.

Daf 22a

§ It was taught in the mishna: There was once <b>an incident where more than forty pairs</b> of witnesses <b>were passing</b> through on their way to Jerusalem to testify about the new moon, <b>and Rabbi Akiva detained them</b> in Lod, telling them that there was no need for them to desecrate Shabbat for this purpose. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Heaven forbid that Rabbi Akiva detained them,</b> for he would certainly not have made such an error. <b>Rather,</b> it was <b>that Zefer, the head of</b> the city of <b>Geder, detained them. And Rabban Gamliel sent and they removed him from his high</b> office because he had acted inappropriately.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a father and his son saw the new</b> moon, <b>they should</b> both <b>go</b> to the court in Jerusalem. It is <b>not that</b> they can <b>join together</b> to give testimony, for close relatives are disqualified from testifying together, <b>but</b> they both go <b>so that if one of them is disqualified, the second may join together with another</b> witness to testify about the new moon. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A father and his son and all</b> their <b>relatives are fit</b> to combine together as witnesses <b>for testimony</b> to determine the start of <b>the month.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> There was <b>an incident with Toviyya the doctor. When he saw the</b> new <b>moon in Jerusalem, he and his son and his freed slave</b> all went to testify. <b>The priests accepted him and his son</b> as witnesses <b>and disqualified his slave,</b> for they ruled stringently that the month may be sanctified only on the basis of the testimony of those of Jewish lineage. <b>And when they came before the court, they accepted him and his slave</b> as witnesses <b>and disqualified his son,</b> due to the familial relationship.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Levi said: What is the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi Shimon’s</b> opinion permitting relatives to jointly testify about the new moon, despite the fact that relatives are generally disqualified from testifying together? It is <b>as it is written: “And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying: This month shall be to you</b> the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you” (Exodus 12:1–2). The words “to you” come to teach that <b>this testimony</b> concerning the new moon <b>will be valid</b> even when it is given <b>by you</b> two, i.e., Moses and Aaron, who are brothers and could not ordinarily testify together.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Shimon and prohibit relatives from testifying together about the new moon, how do they understand this verse? The Gemara answers: They interpret the verse as follows: <b>This testimony is given over to you</b> and others like you. That is to say, the months are to be established by the most outstanding authorities of each generation.
§ The mishna taught: <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> There was <b>an incident with Toviyya the doctor.</b> When he saw the new moon in Jerusalem, he and his son and his freed slave all went to testify. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Relatives are permitted to testify together about the new moon. <b>Rav Huna said to Rav Ḥanan bar Rava:</b> But <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> whose position is usually accepted over those of his colleagues, ruled otherwise, <b>and</b> also, there was <b>an incident</b> in which the court actually ruled against Rabbi Shimon, <b>and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b>
Rav Ḥanan bar Rava <b>said to him: But many times I said before Rav</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> on this matter, <b>and never did he say anything to me</b> to indicate that he disagreed. Rav Huna <b>said to him: How did you teach</b> the mishna? Rav Ḥanan bar Rava <b>said to him:</b> With <b>the opposite</b> attributions, that is say, the position that is attributed in the mishna to Rabbi Yosei, I would teach in the name of Rabbi Shimon. Rav Huna <b>said to him: Due to that</b> reason, <b>he never said anything to you,</b> for according to your version you ruled correctly. <b>Tavi, son of Mari Tavi, said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The following are unfit</b> to give testimony, as they are considered thieves and robbers: <b>One who plays with dice [<i>kubbiyya</i>]</b> or other games of chance for money; <b>and those who lend</b> money <b>with interest; and those who race pigeons</b> and place wagers on the outcome; and <b>merchants</b> who deal in produce of <b>the Sabbatical Year,</b> which may be eaten, but may not be an object of commerce; <b>and slaves. This is the principle: Any testimony for which a woman is unfit, these too are unfit.</b> Although in certain cases a woman’s testimony is accepted, e.g., to testify to the death of someone’s husband, in the majority of cases her testimony is not valid.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>This</b> implies that any testimony <b>for which a woman is fit, these too are fit. Rav Ashi said: That is to say,</b> one who is regarded as <b>a robber by rabbinic law,</b> i.e., one who illegally came into possession of money but did not actually steal it from another, is like those mentioned in the mishna. Although they are generally unfit to give testimony, <b>they are fit</b> to give <b>testimony</b> to enable <b>a woman</b> to remarry.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who saw the</b> new <b>moon but is unable to go</b> to Jerusalem by foot because he is sick or has difficulty walking, others <b>may bring him on a donkey or even in a bed,</b> even on Shabbat if necessary. <b>And if</b> the witnesses are concerned that bandits may be <b>lying in wait for them</b> along the road, <b>they may take clubs</b> or other weapons <b>in their hands,</b> even on Shabbat.
<b>And if it was a long journey</b> to Jerusalem, <b>they may take sustenance with them,</b> although it is ordinarily prohibited to carry on Shabbat, <b>since for</b> a distance of <b>a walk of a night and a day,</b> the witnesses <b>may desecrate Shabbat and go out to</b> give <b>testimony</b> to determine the start of <b>the month.</b> This is <b>as it is stated: “These are the Festivals of the Lord,</b> sacred gatherings, <b>which you shall declare in their seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:4). This teaches that, in all cases, the Festivals must be fixed at their proper times, even if it entails the transgression of Torah prohibitions.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>If</b> the members of the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem <b>are not familiar with that</b> one who saw the new moon, i.e., that he is a valid witness, the members of his local court of twenty-three <b>send another with him to testify</b> about <b>him.</b> The mishna adds: <b>Initially,</b> the court <b>would accept testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month from any person,</b> as all are presumed to be qualified witnesses, absent any disqualifying factors. However, <b>when the Boethusians,</b> a sect whose members had their own opinions with regard to the establishment of the Festivals, <b>corrupted</b> the process by sending false witnesses to testify about the new moon, the Sages <b>instituted that they would accept</b> this testimony <b>only from those</b> men <b>familiar</b> to the Sanhedrin as valid witnesses.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement in the mishna that <b>another</b> would be sent along to testify with regard to the qualification of the witness to the new moon? If it means that <b>one</b> other individual would be sent,

Daf 22b

<b>but is one</b> witness <b>deemed credible? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident in</b> which one potential witness <b>came</b> to testify, <b>and his witnesses</b> were <b>with him,</b> as they came <b>to testify about him?</b> The use of the plural indicates that two witnesses are required to establish someone as a valid eyewitness. <b>Rav Pappa said: What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Another?</b> It means <b>another pair</b> of witnesses.
The Gemara comments: <b>This too stands to reason, for if you do not say so,</b> then the opening statement of the mishna: <b>If</b> the members of the Great Sanhedrin <b>are not familiar with that</b> one, is problematic. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>That</b> one? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to <b>that one</b> witness, <b>is one</b> witness <b>deemed credible?</b> The word: <b>Judgment, is written with regard to</b> the establishment of the New Moon and Rosh HaShana: “For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Israel” (Psalms 81:5), and judgments require two witnesses. <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>That</b> one? <b>That pair</b> of witnesses. <b>So too</b> here, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Another? Another pair</b> of witnesses.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is one</b> witness <b>not deemed credible</b> to testify about the eyewitness who saw the new moon? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Nehorai, who went with the witness to testify about him on Shabbat in Usha?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Nehorai offered his testimony alone.
The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation of this incident: In fact, two witnesses are necessary, and in the case of <b>Rabbi Nehorai there was another witness with him. And</b> the fact <b>that he was not mentioned is due to the honor of Rabbi Nehorai,</b> so as not to indicate that the other was his equal. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> In the incident involving <b>Rabbi Nehorai, there was</b> already <b>another witness</b> waiting <b>in Usha and Rabbi Nehorai went to join him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this incident at all? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that in a case of <b>uncertainty one does not desecrate Shabbat,</b> i.e., perhaps the witness in Usha would not be present that day, which would mean that Rabbi Nehorai desecrated Shabbat for no reason. Therefore, the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that for the important purpose of the New Moon, Shabbat may be desecrated even in a doubtful case.
§ <b>When Ulla came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: They sanctified the</b> New <b>Moon</b> on a certain date <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael. Although Ulla was the only witness, his testimony was accepted. <b>Rav Kahana said: It is not necessary to say</b> that <b>Ulla, who is a great man, is deemed credible</b> with regard to such testimony. <b>Rather, even an ordinary person is deemed credible</b> in this case, and there is no need for two witnesses. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? With regard to <b>any matter that is likely to be revealed, people do not lie about it.</b> The Gemara comments that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one</b> person <b>comes from the</b> other <b>end of the world and says: The court sanctified the</b> new <b>month, he is deemed credible.</b> There is no need for two witnesses.
The mishna taught: <b>Initially, they would accept testimony</b> to determine the start of the <b>month from any person,</b> and this continued until the Boethusians began to corrupt the process. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that describes the decisive incident: <b>What</b> was the manner of <b>the corruption</b> in which <b>the Boethusians engaged? Once, the Boethusians tried to mislead the Sages</b> with regard to the day of the new moon. <b>They hired two people for four hundred dinars</b> to testify falsely that they had seen the new moon on the thirtieth day of the month. <b>One</b> of them was <b>from our own,</b> i.e., a member of the Pharisees and the Sages of Israel, <b>and</b> the other was <b>one of theirs.</b>
When they went in to testify, <b>their</b> witness <b>submitted his testimony</b> that he had seen the new moon, <b>and</b> then he <b>left.</b> When <b>our</b> witness came to testify, <b>they said to him,</b> in the customary manner: <b>Say how you saw the moon. He said to them: I was ascending in Ma’ale Adumim and I saw that</b> the new moon <b>was crouched between two rocks. Its head was like</b> that <b>of a calf, its ears were like</b> those <b>of a kid, its horns were like</b> those <b>of a deer, and its tail was lying between its thighs. And I looked at it and was frightened and I fell backward. And if you do not believe me</b> that this is what I saw, there are <b>two hundred dinars wrapped in my cloak</b> that were paid to me to deliver this testimony.
Realizing that the testimony of the first witness was also false, the Sages <b>said to him: Who persuaded you to</b> act in <b>this</b> manner? <b>He said to them: I heard that the Boethusians were seeking to mislead the Sages,</b> and <b>I said</b> to myself: <b>I will go</b> and hire myself out to give false testimony, <b>and I will inform</b> the Sages of the truth, <b>lest unworthy people come and mislead the Sages.</b>
The Sages <b>said to him: The two hundred dinars</b> that you received from the Boethusians <b>are given to you as a gift.</b> Although you did not carry out your mission, the court is authorized to declare the money ownerless and award it to you. <b>And the one who hired you shall be stretched out on the post</b> for flogging. <b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>instituted that they would accept</b> testimony about the new moon <b>only from those</b> men <b>who were familiar</b> to the Great Sanhedrin as qualified witnesses.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Initially,</b> after the court sanctified the new month <b>they would light torches</b> on the mountaintops, from one peak to another, to signal to the community in Babylonia that the month had been sanctified. <b>After the Samaritans [<i>Kutim</i>] corrupted</b> and ruined this method by lighting torches at the wrong times to confuse the Jews, the Sages <b>instituted that messengers should go out</b> to the Diaspora and inform them of the start of the month.
The mishna asks: <b>How would they light</b> the <b>torches</b> during that earlier period? <b>They would bring</b> items that burn well, e.g., <b>long poles of cedar, reeds, pinewood, and beaten flax, and tie</b> them together <b>with a string. And</b> someone would then <b>ascend to the top of the mountain and light</b> the torch <b>on fire with them, and wave it back and forth and up and down, until he would see his colleague doing likewise on the top of the second mountain.</b> In this manner he would know that the next messenger had received the message and passed it on. <b>And similarly,</b> the second torchbearer would wait for a signal from the one <b>on the top of the third mountain,</b> and so on. In this manner the message would reach the Diaspora.
<b>And from which</b> mountains <b>would they light the torches?</b> They would transmit the message <b>from the Mount of Olives</b> in Jerusalem <b>to Sartava, and from Sartava to Gerofina, and from Gerofina to Ḥavran, and from Ḥavran to Beit Baltin. And from Beit Baltin they would not move</b> to light torches in any other predetermined location. <b>Rather,</b> the one who was appointed for this task <b>would wave</b> the torch <b>back and forth and up and down, until he would see the entire Diaspora before him</b> alight <b>like</b> one large <b>bonfire,</b> as they would light torches to continue transmitting the message from place to place all the way to the farthest reaches of the Diaspora.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that they would light torches [<i>masi’in</i>]. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that</b> the term <b><i>masi’in</i> is an expression of burning? As it is written: “<i>Vayisa’em</i> David and his men”</b> (II Samuel 5:21), <b>and we translate</b> the verse as: <b>And David</b> and his men <b>burned them.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Torches were lit only for</b> a new <b>month whose</b> moon <b>was seen at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> i.e., on the thirtieth day of the outgoing month, <b>to sanctify</b> the upcoming New Moon on that date and declare the previous month as containing twenty-nine days. In this case, the thirtieth day would be declared the first day of the following month. <b>And when would they light</b> the torches? It was <b>on the eve of its additional day,</b> the one that would have been added had it been a full, thirty-day month, i.e., on the eve of the thirty-first day of the outgoing month.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that for</b> the conclusion of <b>a deficient</b> month of twenty-nine days <b>one performs</b> the sequence of lighting torches, but <b>for a full</b> month <b>one does not perform</b> it? <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that was instituted <b>due to</b> the case of <b>a New Moon</b> following <b>a deficient,</b> twenty-nine-day month <b>that occurs on Shabbat eve.</b> In that case, <b>when do they perform</b> the lighting? <b>At the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> as it is prohibited to light a fire on Friday night. The reason for the decree is <b>that if you say that one performs</b> the lighting of torches <b>for a full,</b> thirty-day month <b>as well,</b> people might <b>come</b>

Daf 23a

<b>to err.</b> They will be unsure how to interpret the lighting of the torches, as <b>they will say:</b> Perhaps <b>this</b> month <b>is deficient,</b> i.e., of twenty-nine days, <b>and</b> the reason <b>that</b> the torch sequence <b>was not performed yesterday,</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>is due to</b> the fact that <b>it was impossible</b> to do so on Shabbat. <b>Or perhaps it is</b> a <b>full,</b> thirty-day month, <b>and they are performing</b> the sequence <b>at its</b> proper <b>time.</b> Therefore, the Sages instituted that the torches should be lit only after deficient months, and the absence of this signal means that the month was a full one.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let them perform</b> the ceremony <b>both for a full,</b> thirty-day month <b>and for a deficient</b> one, <b>and when the New Moon occurs on Shabbat eve,</b> in which case they would have to light the torches after Shabbat, let them <b>not perform</b> it <b>at all. And since</b> the torches <b>are not lit</b> this month <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat, and one</b> normally performs the sequence <b>for a full month,</b> people <b>will know that</b> the month <b>is deficient.</b> In this manner, it should be possible to light the torches for all the months, with this one exception.
The Gemara answers: <b>Even so,</b> people might <b>come to err,</b> as <b>they will say: This</b> month <b>is</b> indeed <b>full, and</b> the reason <b>that they are not performing</b> the ceremony <b>is</b> that <b>they were</b> subject to <b>circumstances beyond their control.</b> Therefore, there might still be confusion as to the date of the New Moon that month.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let them perform</b> the ceremony of torches only <b>for a full,</b> thirty-day month, <b>and not perform it for a deficient</b> month <b>at all,</b> in which case there will never be room for error. <b>Abaye said:</b> This cannot be done, <b>because</b> this would lead to <b>a two-day suspension of work for the people,</b> as it was customary to refrain from certain types of work on the New Moon. After a full month there will always be a suspension of work for two days, as the people must abstain from work on the thirtieth of the month in case it is declared the New Moon. However, if the torches are lit for a deficient month, then at least in that case people could return to work the following day. Therefore, the Sages instituted that the torches are lit only for a deficient month.
§ The mishna taught: <b>How would they light</b> the <b>torches? They would bring long poles [<i>kelonsot</i>]</b> of cedar and other materials that burn well, tie them all together, and set them on fire. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>there are four types of cedar: Cedar, <i>katrom</i>, pinewood, and cypress.</b> With regard to the identification of the tree called <b><i>katrom</i>, Rav said:</b> This is the <b><i>addera</i></b> tree. In <b>the school of Rabbi Sheila, they say:</b> This is the <b><i>mavliga</i></b> tree. <b>And some say</b> it is the <b><i>gulmish</i></b> tree.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this opinion of Rav Yehuda <b>disagrees with</b> that of <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna. As Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>they say in the school of Rav: There are ten species of cedar, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree and myrtle and the pine tree; I will set in the desert cypress, the plane tree, and the larch together”</b> (Isaiah 41:19). The seven species mentioned in this verse are all types of cedars. The Gemara proceeds to identify these trees by their Aramaic names: <b>Cedar is <i>arza</i>, acacia is <i>tornita</i>, myrtle is <i>asa</i>, pine tree is <i>afarsema</i>, cypress is <i>berata</i>, maple is <i>shaga</i>,</b> and <b>box tree is <i>shorivna</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: Even if we count all the names in the verse, <b>these are</b> only <b>seven,</b> not ten. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Israel to Babylonia, <b>he said: They added to them</b> three more types of cedar: <b>Terebinth, oak,</b> and <b>coral wood.</b> The Gemara identifies them: <b>Terebinth</b> is the tree called <b><i>butmei</i>, oak is <i>balutei</i>,</b> and <b>coral wood is <i>kasita</i>. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the additional three types are: <b>Bay tree, plane tree,</b> and <b>coral wood.</b> And their Aramaic names are as follows: <b>Bay tree</b> is <b><i>arei</i>, plane</b> is <b><i>dulvei</i>,</b> and <b>coral wood</b> is <b><i>kasita</i>.</b>
§ Apropos coral, the Gemara cites a relevant verse: <b>“Neither shall a <i>tzi adir</i> be able to cross it”</b> (Isaiah 33:21), i.e., it will not be able to traverse the river that will issue forth from the Temple in the future. What is this <i>tzi adir</i>? <b>Rav said: This is a great ship [<i>burnei</i>]</b> used to collect coral from the sea.
The Gemara explains: <b>How do they perform</b> this collection of coral? <b>They bring six thousand men</b> to work <b>for twelve months</b> of <b>the year, and some say</b> they bring <b>twelve thousand men for six months</b> of <b>the year. And they load</b> the ship <b>with sand until it sinks</b> to the bottom of the sea. <b>A diver descends and ties flax ropes around the coral and ties</b> the other ends of the ropes <b>to the boat. And</b> then <b>they take the sand and cast it overboard,</b> and the boat rises once again to the surface. <b>And as it rises, it uproots and brings</b> the coral with it.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this coral is so precious that <b>it is exchanged for twice its weight in silver.</b> The Gemara further notes: <b>There are three ports</b> in those places. <b>Two</b> belong <b>to the Romans [<i>Armai</i>], and one</b> belongs <b>to the Persians.</b> In the one belonging <b>to the Romans, they raise up coral,</b> whereas in the one belonging <b>to the Persians, they raise up pearls. And</b> the Persian ports <b>are called royal ports.</b>
With regard to the aforementioned verse, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Each and every acacia tree that the gentiles took from Jerusalem will be returned to</b> the city <b>by the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree</b> and myrtle and the oil tree; I will set in the desert cypress, the plane tree and the larch together” (Isaiah 41:19). <b>And</b> the term <b>wilderness</b> is referring to <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Zion is become a wilderness,</b> Jerusalem a desolation” (Isaiah 64:9).
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> also <b>said: Anyone who studies Torah but does not teach it</b> to others <b>is likened to a myrtle in the wilderness.</b> The myrtle has a pleasant fragrance, but there is nobody to enjoy it in the wilderness. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this statement: <b>Anyone who studies Torah and teaches it</b> to others <b>in a place where there are no</b> other <b>Torah scholars is likened to a myrtle in the wilderness, which is</b> especially <b>precious</b> and thoroughly enjoyed by those who find it.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> further <b>said: Woe to the nations</b> of the world, <b>as they have no remedy</b> for the sins they committed against the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron”</b> (Isaiah 60:17). For all things there is a remedy, as one can always exchange them for an item of equivalent or greater value. However, <b>for Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues,</b> whom the nations put to death, <b>what can one bring</b> to atone for their sin? <b>And with regard to them it is stated: And I will hold</b> them <b>as innocent, but for their blood I will not hold</b> them <b>innocent</b> (see Joel 4:21).
§ The mishna states: <b>And from</b> which mountains <b>would they light</b> the <b>torches?</b> From the Mount of Olives to Sartava, and from Sartava to Gerofina, and from Gerofina to Ḥavran, and from Ḥavran to Beit Baltin. <b>And from Beit Baltin</b> they would not light torches in any other pre-established places. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this place called <b>Beit Baltin? Rav said:</b>

Daf 23b

<b>This is</b> the town called <b>Biram.</b>
§ The mishna taught: He would wave the torch back and forth and up and down, until he would see the entire Diaspora before him alight like one large bonfire. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning in this context of the term <b>Diaspora,</b> which certainly cannot be referring to the entire Diaspora across the world? <b>Rav Yosef said: This</b> is referring to the city of <b>Pumbedita</b> in Babylonia. The Gemara further asks. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>Like</b> one large <b>bonfire?</b> It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Each and every</b> individual would <b>take a torch in his hand and ascend to the top of his roof</b> and light it. In this manner, the entire city would present the appearance of a large bonfire.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> Torches were <b>also</b> lit at <b>Ḥarim, and Kayar and Geder, and its neighboring places. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the places added by Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>are located between</b> the places mentioned in the mishna, whereas <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>they are located on the other side of Eretz Yisrael,</b> on the side nearer Babylonia. <b>The Sage</b> in the mishna <b>enumerates</b> the places found <b>on one side</b> of Eretz Yisrael, <b>whereas the Sage</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>enumerates</b> the places found <b>on the other side.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Between each and every one</b> of the stations <b>there was</b> a distance of <b>eight parasangs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How many</b> parasangs <b>are these</b> in total? <b>Thirty-two</b> parasangs. The Gemara further asks: <b>Isn’t</b> the distance from the Mount of Olives to Beit Baltin <b>now</b> much <b>greater</b> than thirty-two parasangs? <b>Abaye said:</b> The direct <b>routes have become blocked,</b> and therefore people nowadays must use indirect routes, making the journey much longer.
The Gemara provides a source for this claim. <b>As it is written: “Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns,</b> and make a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths” (Hosea 2:8). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is derived <b>from here, as it is written: “He has made my paths crooked”</b> (Lamentations 3:9), which indicates that over the course of the exile the routes have become longer.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There was a large courtyard in Jerusalem, which was called Beit Ya’zek. And there all the witnesses</b> coming to testify about the new moon would <b>gather, and the court</b> of seventy-one judges would <b>examine them there. And they</b> would <b>prepare great feasts for them, so that they would be</b> willing and <b>accustomed to coming</b> and submitting their testimony.
<b>Initially,</b> when witnesses would arrive on Shabbat from a distant place, <b>they would not move from there all day,</b> as they had left their Shabbat limit, and it was consequently prohibited for them to walk more than four cubits in any direction once they had completed their mission. Concerned that this limitation would discourage witnesses from coming, <b>Rabban Gamliel the Elder instituted that</b> the witnesses <b>be</b> permitted to <b>walk two thousand cubits in each direction.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>And not only these</b> witnesses are granted two thousand cubits from their new place, <b>but</b> this applies <b>also</b> to <b>a midwife who comes to deliver</b> a child, <b>and one who comes to rescue</b> Jews <b>from a fire, from</b> an invasion of gentile <b>troops, from</b> a flooding <b>river, or from</b> the <b>collapse</b> of a building. All <b>these are</b> considered <b>like the inhabitants of the city</b> where they arrive, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they have two thousand cubits in each direction.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the correct reading of the mishna? Did <b>we learn: Beit Ya’zek, or</b> did <b>we learn: Beit Yazek?</b> The Gemara explains the difference between these two versions. <b>Did we learn: Beit Ya’zek,</b> which is <b>an lofty term,</b> indicating that it was a fine place where the witnesses had a pleasant experience, <b>as it is written: “And he dug it [<i>vaye’azzekehu</i>] and cleared it of stones”</b> (Isaiah 5:2), which shows that the root <i>a-z-k</i> denotes improvement? <b>Or perhaps we learned: Beit Yazek,</b> which <b>is a term of distress,</b> reflecting the fact that the witnesses who arrived there on Shabbat were not permitted to move from there all day, <b>as it is written: “And he was bound with chains [<i>bazikim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 40:1).
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: <b>They would prepare great feasts for them there, so that they would be accustomed to come</b> and submit their testimony. This indicates that the witnesses were made welcome, in accordance with the name Beit Ya’zek. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Perhaps they performed two</b> practices <b>for them,</b> i.e., they provided feasts but they also restricted their movement. Therefore, there is no proof from the mishna for this version of the name.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How do they examine the witnesses</b> who come to testify about the new moon? They deal with them in order, as <b>the pair</b> of witnesses <b>that arrives first they examine first. They bring in the greater of</b> the two witnesses, <b>and they say to him: Say how you saw the moon.</b> Was it <b>in front of the sun or behind the sun? To its north or to its south? How high was</b> the moon over the horizon, <b>and in which direction did it tilt? And how wide was</b> it? <b>If,</b> for example, <b>he said</b> that he saw the moon <b>in front of the sun, he has not said anything</b> of substance, as this is impossible and therefore he is either mistaken or lying.
<b>And after</b> they finish hearing the first witness’s testimony, <b>they would bring in the second witness and examine him</b> in a similar manner. <b>If their statements match, their testimony is accepted</b> and the court sanctifies the New Moon. <b>And</b> the court then <b>asks all the other pairs</b> of witnesses certain <b>general matters,</b> without probing into all the details. They do this <b>not</b> because <b>they require</b> the additional testimony, <b>but so that</b> the witnesses <b>should not leave disappointed,</b> and <b>so that the witnesses should be accustomed to coming</b> to testify, and will not hesitate to come the next time, when they might be needed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>In front of the sun is</b> the same as <b>to its north,</b> and <b>behind the sun is</b> the same as <b>to its south.</b> Why would the court ask the witnesses both sets of questions? <b>Abaye said:</b> The first question does not refer to the moon’s position relative to the sun, but to <b>the concave side</b> of the moon, whether it was <b>before the sun,</b> pointing toward it, <b>or behind the sun,</b> pointing away from it. <b>If he said</b> that it was <b>before the sun, he has said nothing.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Dominion and fear are with Him, He makes peace in His high places”</b> (Job 25:2)? It means that <b>the sun has never seen the concave</b> side <b>of the</b> new <b>moon, nor</b> has it ever seen <b>the concave</b> side <b>of a rainbow,</b> both of which always face away from the sun. It has never seen <b>the concave</b> side <b>of the moon, as</b> the moon would be <b>distressed</b> by a sense of inadequacy if its concave side faced the sun. Therefore the sun sees only the full roundness of its convex side. In this way He makes peace in His high places between the sun and the moon. Furthermore, the sun has never seen <b>the concave</b> side <b>of a rainbow, so that the worshippers of the sun not say,</b> as though the sun is a god,

Daf 24a

that the sun <b>is shooting arrows</b> at those who deny its divinity, using the rainbow as its bow. The concave side of the rainbow always faces away from the sun, so that it does not look like a bow held by the sun.
§ The mishna taught that the examination of the witnesses included the following questions: <b>How high was</b> the moon over the horizon, <b>and in which</b> direction <b>did it tilt? It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: If the witness testifies that he saw the moon <b>to the north</b> of the sun, <b>his statement is valid.</b> However, if he says that he saw it <b>to its south, he has not said anything</b> of significance, as this is impossible. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t the opposite taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: If he testifies that he saw the moon <b>to the south</b> of the sun, <b>his statement is valid.</b> However, if he says he saw it <b>to its north, he has not said anything.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i> mentioned above, it is referring <b>to the summer,</b> when the moon is to the south of the sun; <b>there,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i> mentioned above, it is referring <b>to the rainy season,</b> when the moon is to the north of the sun.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw the moon <b>two plow handles high</b> above the horizon, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> says it was <b>three</b> plow handles high, <b>their testimony is valid,</b> as a small discrepancy of this kind is reasonable. However, if <b>one says</b> that he saw the moon <b>three</b> plow handles above the horizon, <b>and the</b> other <b>one says</b> it was <b>five</b> plow handles high, <b>their testimony is void,</b> as that discrepancy is unacceptable. <b>However,</b> this does not mean that the witnesses themselves are disqualified, as either of them may <b>join with another testimony,</b> i.e., he may combine his account with that of another witness who testifies likewise.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that if the witnesses say: We did not actually see the moon, but <b>we saw it</b> reflected <b>in the water,</b> or <b>we saw it</b> reflected <b>in</b> a glass <b>lantern,</b> or <b>we saw it through</b> thin <b>clouds, they</b> may <b>not testify about it,</b> as only a direct sighting of the moon is acceptable. If they say: We saw <b>half of</b> the moon’s reflection <b>in the water,</b> or we saw <b>half of it through the clouds,</b> or we saw <b>half of it in a lantern, they</b> still may <b>not testify about it.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Now,</b> if when one sees <b>the entire</b> moon in this manner, <b>you said</b> that this is <b>not</b> valid testimony, <b>is it necessary</b> to teach that one may not testify when he sees only <b>half of it? Rather, this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the witnesses saw <b>half of</b> the moon’s reflection <b>in water</b> and <b>half of it</b> directly <b>in the sky,</b> or <b>half of it through the clouds</b> and <b>half of it in the sky,</b> or <b>half of it in a lantern</b> and <b>half of it in the sky,</b> although they saw half of the moon directly, <b>they</b> may <b>not testify</b> about it until they see the entire moon in the sky.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that if the witnesses say: One moment <b>we saw</b> the new moon, <b>but we did not see it again, they</b> may <b>not testify about it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Must they go on watching it to such</b> an extent, i.e., why should they have to see it for a long period of time?
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the witnesses say: <b>We saw</b> the moon <b>on our own</b> accord, i.e., by chance, without looking for it, <b>and</b> then <b>we returned to look for it on purpose,</b> to deliver precise testimony about it, <b>but we did not see it</b> again, <b>they</b> may <b>not testify about it. What is the reason?</b> Because one can <b>say</b> that the first time it was <b>merely a small round</b> white <b>cloud that they saw,</b> which they mistook for the moon, and that is why when they looked for it again they could not find it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After the witnesses have been examined and their testimony accepted, <b>the head of the court says:</b> It is <b>sanctified. And all the people respond after him:</b> It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified. Whether</b> the moon <b>was seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> on the thirtieth day of the previous month, <b>or whether</b> it <b>was not seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> in which case witnesses are not necessary to establish the following day as the New Moon, the court <b>sanctifies it</b> and formally proclaims the day as the New Moon.
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If</b> the new moon <b>was not seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon on the following day, <b>as</b> the celestial court in <b>Heaven has already sanctified it,</b> precluding the need for the additional sanctification by the earthly court.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>the head of the court</b> says: It is sanctified. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the court must sanctify the New Moon, derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And Moses declared</b> to the children of Israel <b>the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44). <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the head of the court says:</b> It is <b>sanctified,</b> as it is evident from the verse that Moses, whose status was equivalent to that of the head of the Great Sanhedrin, declared the appointed times of the Festivals and New Moons in a formal manner.
§ The mishna further teaches that after the head of the court says: It is sanctified, <b>all the people respond after him:</b> It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the verse states: “Which you shall proclaim them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations” (Leviticus 23:2). Instead of <i>otam</i>, <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>You [<i>atem</i>],</b> as though the verse stated: Which you shall proclaim, you. This superfluous word you teaches that the month must be proclaimed not only by the head of the court, but also by you, the people. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it is derived from the phrase: <b>“These are [<i>hem</i>] My appointed seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:2). The term <i>hem</i> can also mean: They, which indicates that <b>they,</b> the people, <b>should</b> likewise <b>say</b> and announce <b>My appointed seasons.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the people to declare: It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified, twice?</b> The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>that it is written: “Sacred convocations”</b> (Leviticus 23:2) in the plural, which indicates that they must announce it twice.
§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If</b> the new moon <b>was not seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon on the following day. The Gemara cites other opinions in this regard: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sage <b>Palaimo says:</b> If the new moon was seen <b>at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon, as the new moon appeared as expected and there is no need for any special sanctification. However, if the new moon was seen <b>not at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court must <b>sanctify</b> the New Moon.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: In either case,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon formally, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), from which it is derived: <b>You</b> must formally <b>sanctify years</b> in court, <b>but you do not</b> have to formally <b>sanctify months,</b> as they are sanctified automatically by Heaven. Rather, it is enough merely to announce to the public that a certain day was established as the New Moon. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok,</b> that if the new moon was seen at its anticipated time, the court sanctifies the new month; however, if it was not seen at its anticipated time, they do not sanctify it.
<b>Abaye said: We, too, learn</b> in a mishna: If <b>the court and all of the Jewish people saw</b> the new moon, and <b>the witnesses were interrogated, but</b> the court <b>did not manage to say: Sanctified, before nightfall,</b> the previous month <b>is</b> rendered <b>a full,</b> thirty-day month. This indicates that <b>full, yes;</b> i.e., in this case, it is necessary to extend the previous month. However, <b>sanctified, no;</b> there is no need to formally sanctify the month, as the New Moon does not occur on its anticipated date in this case.
The Gemara rejects this argument: There is no proof from here, as <b>it was necessary for</b> the mishna to mention that the month is rendered <b>a full,</b> thirty-day month. The reason is that it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the court and the entire Jewish people saw</b> the new moon, <b>it has become public</b> knowledge <b>and</b> therefore there is <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> render the previous month a <b>full,</b> thirty-day month. Consequently, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even in this case the previous month must be extended. Nevertheless, it is still possible that the New Moon must be formally sanctified on the following day.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabban Gamliel had</b> a diagram of the different <b>forms of the moon</b> drawn <b>on a tablet</b> that hung <b>on the wall of his attic, which he would show to the laymen</b> who came to testify about the new moon but were unable to describe adequately what they had seen. <b>And he</b> would <b>say</b> to them: <b>Did you see</b> a form <b>like this or like this?</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to create these types of forms? <b>Isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver, or gods of gold” (Exodus 20:20), which is interpreted as teaching: <b>You shall not make images of My attendants,</b> i.e., those celestial bodies that were created to serve God, including the sun and the moon?
§ <b>Abaye said: The Torah prohibited only</b> the images of those <b>attendants</b> with regard to <b>which it is possible to reproduce</b> an item in <b>their likeness.</b> Since it is impossible for anyone to reproduce the sun and the moon, the prohibition does not apply to these objects. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>not construct a house</b> in the exact <b>form of the Sanctuary,</b> nor <b>a portico in</b> the exact <b>form of the Entrance Hall</b> of the Sanctuary, nor <b>a courtyard corresponding to</b> the Temple <b>courtyard,</b> nor <b>a table corresponding to the table</b> in the Temple, nor <b>a candelabrum corresponding to the candelabrum</b> in the Temple. <b>However, one may fashion</b>

Daf 24b

a candelabrum <b>of five or of six or of eight</b> lamps. <b>But one may not fashion</b> a candelabrum with <b>seven</b> lamps <b>even</b> if he constructs it <b>from other kinds of metal</b> rather than gold, as in exigent circumstances the candelabrum in the Temple may be fashioned from other metals. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: Also, one may not fashion</b> a candelabrum <b>of wood, in the manner that the kings of the Hasmonean monarchy fashioned</b> it. When they first purified the Temple they had to prepare the candelabrum out of wood, as no other material was available. Since this candelabrum is fit for the Temple, it is prohibited to fashion one of this kind for oneself.
The other Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda: <b>From there</b> you seek to bring <b>a proof?</b> There the branches of the candelabrum <b>were</b> comprised of <b>spits [<i>shippudin</i>] of iron and they covered them with tin.</b> Later, when <b>they grew richer</b> and could afford a candelabrum of higher-quality material, <b>they fashioned them from silver.</b> When <b>they grew even richer, they fashioned them from gold.</b> Still, Abaye proves from this <i>baraita</i> that the prohibition against forming an image applies only to items that can be reconstructed in an accurate manner. Since this is not possible in the case of the moon, Rabban Gamliel’s forms were permitted.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> really <b>permitted</b> to form images of <b>those attendants</b> concerning <b>which it is impossible to reproduce their likeness? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:19), comes to teach: <b>You shall not make images of My attendants that serve before Me on high.</b> Apparently, this includes the sun and the moon. <b>Abaye said:</b> This does not include the sun and the moon, as <b>the Torah prohibited only</b> the fashioning of <b>an image of</b> all <b>four faces</b> of the creatures of the Heavenly Chariot <b>together</b> (see Ezekiel, chapter 1). However, all other images, which are not the likeness of the ministering angels, are permitted.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, let</b> the fashioning of an image of <b>a human face [<i>partzuf</i> ] alone be permitted. Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All faces are permitted</b> for ornamental purposes, <b>except for the face of a person? Rav Huna, son of Rav Idi, said: From a lecture of Abaye I heard</b> that there is a different reason why one may not form an image of a human face, as the verse states: <b>“You shall not make with Me [<i>iti</i>]”</b> (Exodus 20:19). This can be read as: <b>You shall not make Me [<i>oti</i>].</b> Since man is created in the image of God, it is prohibited to form an image of a human being.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to form images of <b>other attendants? Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:19), teaches that <b>you shall not make images of My attendants that serve before Me on high, for example, <i>ofanim</i> and seraphim and the sacred <i>ḥayyot</i> and the ministering angels. Abaye said: The Torah prohibited only</b> those <b>attendants that are</b> found <b>in the upper Heaven,</b> i.e., the supreme angels in the highest firmament, but not the celestial bodies, e.g., the sun and the moon, despite the fact that they too are located in heaven.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>And is it permitted</b> to form images of <b>those</b> bodies found <b>in the lower heaven? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “You shall not make for yourself any graven image, nor any manner of likeness, of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth” (Exodus 20:3). The phrase <b>“that is in heaven”</b> comes <b>to include</b> the <b>sun,</b> the <b>moon,</b> the <b>stars, and</b> the <b>constellations.</b> The term <b>“above”</b> serves <b>to include the ministering angels.</b> Apparently, it is prohibited to form an image even of the celestial bodies found in the lower Heaven. The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is in reference to the prohibition <b>against worshipping them.</b> However, there is no prohibition against forming an image in their likeness.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the prohibition against worshipping them,</b> then <b>even a tiny worm</b> should <b>also</b> be prohibited. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so, as it is taught</b> in the same <i>baraita</i> with regard to the continuation of the verse, <b>“in the earth”</b> comes <b>to include mountains and hills, seas and rivers, streams and valleys; “beneath”</b> comes <b>to include a tiny worm.</b> If so, it is indeed possible to explain that the entire <i>baraita</i> is referring to the prohibition against idol worship.
The Gemara raises yet another objection: <b>And is the mere fashioning</b> of images of the celestial bodies <b>permitted? Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:19). This verse teaches that <b>you shall not make images of My attendants that serve before Me, for example</b> the <b>sun,</b> the <b>moon,</b> the <b>stars and</b> the <b>constellations.</b> This is explicit proof that it is prohibited to form images of the sun and the moon; consequently, the solution proposed by Abaye is rejected, leaving the difficulty with Rabban Gamliel’s diagram unresolved.
The Gemara proposes an alternative resolution: The case of <b>Rabban Gamliel is different, as others,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>fashioned</b> those images <b>for him,</b> and it is prohibited only for a Jew to fashion such images; there is no prohibition against having them in one’s possession. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>Rav Yehuda, as others fashioned for him</b> a seal in the form of a human being, <b>and Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda,</b> who was his student: <b>Sharp-witted one, blind this one’s eyes,</b> i.e., disfigure the image, as it is prohibited even to have the image of a human being in one’s possession.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of Rav Yehuda, <b>his was a protruding seal,</b> i.e., the image projected from the ring, and Shmuel prohibited it <b>due to</b> the potential <b>suspicion</b> that he had an object of idol worship in his hand. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a ring,</b> if <b>its seal protrudes it is prohibited to place it</b> on one’s finger, due to the suspicion of idol worship, <b>but it is permitted to seal</b> objects <b>with it.</b> In this case, the act of sealing creates an image that is sunken below the surface, which is not prohibited. However, if <b>its seal is sunken, it is permitted to place it</b> on one’s finger, <b>but it is prohibited to seal</b> objects <b>with it,</b> as that creates a protruding image.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are we concerned about</b> arousing <b>suspicion</b> in a case of this kind? <b>But</b> what about that <b>certain synagogue that had been</b> destroyed in Eretz Yisrael and its stones were <b>relocated and</b> it was rebuilt so that it <b>sat in Neharde’a,</b> and <b>there was a statue [<i>andarta</i>]</b> of the king <b>in it. And</b> nevertheless <b>Rav and Shmuel and Shmuel’s father and Levi would</b> all <b>enter and pray there and they were not concerned about</b> arousing <b>suspicion.</b> The Gemara answers: When <b>many</b> Jews are present it <b>is different,</b> as a large group is not suspected of having idolatrous intentions. Rather, it is assumed that the statue is there exclusively for purposes of ornamentation.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t Rabban Gamliel an individual?</b> According to this reasoning, his images of the moon should have been prohibited, as they would have aroused suspicion. The Gemara answers: <b>Since he is the <i>Nasi</i>,</b> the head of the Great Sanhedrin, <b>many</b> people <b>were</b> always <b>found with him,</b> and therefore there was no room for suspicion. The Gemara suggests an alternative answer: <b>If you wish, say</b> that these images were not whole; rather, they <b>were</b> formed <b>from pieces</b> of images that had to be put together. Only complete images are prohibited.
The Gemara suggests yet another answer: <b>If you wish, say:</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>did</b> this <b>to teach himself,</b> which is not prohibited, as <b>it is written: “You shall not learn to do</b> after the abominations of those nations” (Deuteronomy 18:9), which indicates: <b>However, you may learn to understand and to teach.</b> In other words, it is permitted to do certain things for the sake of Torah study which would otherwise be prohibited.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There was <b>an incident</b> in <b>which two</b> witnesses <b>came</b> to testify about the new moon, <b>and they said: We saw</b> the waning moon <b>in the morning in the east,</b>

Daf 25a

<b>and</b> that same day we saw the new moon <b>in the evening in the west. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: They are false witnesses,</b> as it is impossible to see the new moon so soon after the last sighting of the waning moon. However, <b>when they arrived in Yavne, Rabban Gamliel accepted them</b> as witnesses without concern.
<b>And</b> there was <b>another</b> incident in which <b>two</b> witnesses <b>came and said: We saw</b> the new moon <b>at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> i.e., on the night of the thirtieth day of the previous month; however, <b>on the</b> following <b>night,</b> i.e., the start of the thirty-first, which is often the determinant of <b>a full,</b> thirty-day month, <b>it was not seen. And</b> nevertheless <b>Rabban Gamliel accepted their</b> testimony and established the New Moon on the thirtieth day.
<b>Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas</b> disagreed and <b>said: They are false witnesses; how can</b> witnesses <b>testify that a woman gave birth and the next day her belly is between her teeth,</b> i.e., she is obviously still pregnant? If the new moon was already visible at its anticipated time, how could it not be seen a day later? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: I see</b> the logic of <b>your statement;</b> the New Moon must be established a day later. Upon hearing that Rabbi Yehoshua had challenged his ruling, <b>Rabban Gamliel sent</b> a message <b>to him: I decree against you that you</b> must <b>appear before me with your staff and with your money on</b> the day on which <b>Yom Kippur occurs according to your calculation;</b> according to my calculation, that day is the eleventh of Tishrei, the day after Yom Kippur.
<b>Rabbi Akiva went and found</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>distressed</b> that the head of the Great Sanhedrin was forcing him to desecrate the day that he maintained was Yom Kippur. In an attempt to console him, Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>I can learn</b> from a verse <b>that everything that Rabban Gamliel did</b> in sanctifying the month <b>is done,</b> i.e., it is valid. <b>As it is stated: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, sacred convocations, which you shall proclaim</b> in their season” (Leviticus 23:4). This verse indicates that <b>whether</b> you have proclaimed them <b>at their</b> proper <b>time</b> or <b>whether</b> you have declared them <b>not at their</b> proper <b>time, I have only these Festivals</b> as established by the representatives of the Jewish people.
Rabbi Yehoshua then <b>came to Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas,</b> who <b>said to him: If we come to debate</b> and question the rulings of <b>the court of Rabban Gamliel, we must debate</b> and question the rulings of <b>every court that has stood from the days of Moses until now. As it is stated: “Then Moses went up, and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel”</b> (Exodus 24:9). <b>But why were the names of these</b> seventy <b>Elders not specified? Rather,</b> this comes <b>to teach that every</b> set of <b>three</b> judges <b>that stands</b> as <b>a court over the Jewish people</b> has the same status <b>as the court of Moses.</b> Since it is not revealed who sat on that court, apparently it is enough that they were official judges in a Jewish court.
When Rabbi Yehoshua heard that even Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas maintained that they must submit to Rabban Gamliel’s decision, <b>he took his staff and his money in his hand, and went to Yavne to Rabban Gamliel on the day</b> on <b>which Yom Kippur occurred according to his</b> own <b>calculation.</b> Upon seeing him, <b>Rabban Gamliel stood up and kissed him on his head. He said to him: Come in peace, my teacher and my student.</b> You are <b>my teacher in wisdom,</b> as Rabbi Yehoshua was wiser than anyone else in his generation, <b>and</b> you are <b>my student, as you accepted my statement,</b> despite your disagreement.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Gamliel said to the Sages,</b> in explanation of his opinion that it is possible for the new moon to be visible so soon after the last sighting of the waning moon: <b>This is</b> the tradition that <b>I received from the house of my father’s father: Sometimes</b> the moon <b>comes by a long</b> path <b>and sometimes it comes by a short</b> one.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, i.e., the house of the heads of the Great Sanhedrin, the source of Rabban Gamliel’s ruling? <b>As it is written: “Who appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knows its going down”</b> (Psalms 104:19). This verse indicates that <b>it is</b> only <b>the sun</b> that <b>knows its going down,</b> i.e., its seasons and the times that it shines are the same every year. In contrast, <b>the moon does not know its going down,</b> as its course is not identical every month.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> once <b>saw</b> the waning <b>moon standing</b> in the sky <b>on the morning</b> of the <b>twenty-ninth</b> of the month. <b>He took a clump</b> of earth and <b>threw</b> it <b>at</b> the moon, <b>saying: This evening we need to sanctify you,</b> i.e., the new moon must be visible tonight so that we may declare the thirtieth of the month as the New Moon, <b>and you are</b> still <b>standing here? Go</b> and <b>cover yourself</b> for now, so that the new moon will be seen only after nightfall. The Gemara further relates that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi once <b>said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: Go to</b> a place called <b>Ein Tav and sanctify the</b> New <b>Moon</b> there, <b>and send me a sign</b> that you have sanctified it. The sign is: <b>David, king of Israel, lives and endures.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Once the sky was covered with clouds, and the form of the moon was visible on the twenty-ninth of the month. The people thought to say</b> that the day was <b>the New Moon, and the court sought to sanctify it.</b> However, <b>Rabban Gamliel said to them: This is</b> the tradition that <b>I received from the house of my father’s father:</b> The monthly cycle of the <b>renewal of the moon</b> takes <b>no less than twenty-nine and a half days, plus two-thirds of an hour, plus seventy-three</b> of the 1,080 <b>subsections</b> of an hour.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And on that day the mother of</b> the Sage <b>ben Zaza died, and Rabban Gamliel delivered a great eulogy</b> on <b>her</b> behalf. He did this <b>not because she was worthy of this</b> honor; <b>rather,</b> he eulogized her <b>so that the people would know that the court had not sanctified the month,</b> as eulogies are prohibited on the New Moon.
§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Akiva went and found him distressed</b> that the head of the Great Sanhedrin was forcing him to desecrate the day that he maintained was Yom Kippur. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Who was distressed?</b> Was <b>Rabbi Akiva distressed or</b> was <b>Rabbi Yehoshua distressed?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva went and found Rabbi Yehoshua in a state of distress,</b> and <b>he said to him: My teacher, for what</b> reason <b>are you distressed?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Rabbi Akiva, it is fitting for</b> one <b>to fall</b> sick <b>in bed for twelve months, rather than to have this decree issued against him</b> that he should have to desecrate Yom Kippur.
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: My teacher, allow me to say before you one matter that you</b> yourself once <b>taught me. He said to him: Speak. He said to him: It states</b> with respect to the Festivals: “The appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations (Leviticus 23:2). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, sacred convocations; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> in their season” (Leviticus 23:4). And it is written: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord; you shall proclaim <b>them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations” (Leviticus 23:37). <b>Three times</b> the verses use the term: Them [<i>otam</i>], which can also be read as you [<i>atem</i>], in plural.
This comes to teach: <b>You</b> [<b><i>atem</i></b>] are authorized to determine the date of the new month, <b>even</b> if you <b>unwittingly</b> establish the New Moon on the wrong day; <b>you, even</b> if you do so <b>intentionally; you, even</b> if you are <b>misled</b> by false witnesses. In all cases, once the court establishes the day as the New Moon, it is sanctified, and God grants His consent. After hearing this, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him in these words: Akiva, you have consoled me; you have consoled me.</b>
§ The mishna taught that Rabbi Yehoshua next <b>came to Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas,</b> who proved to him that the court of Rabban Gamliel has the same legal status as the court of Moses. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why were the names of these</b> seventy <b>Elders</b> who sat together with Moses on his court <b>not specified?</b> The reason is so <b>that a person not say:</b> Is <b>so-and-so</b> the judge in my time, <b>like Moses and Aaron?</b> Is <b>so-and-so like Nadav and Avihu?</b> Is <b>so-and-so like Eldad and Medad?</b> Therefore, the names of the other elders were not specified, so that there is no way of knowing the qualifications of the elders in the time of Moses to compare them to later judges.
<b>And</b> similarly <b>it says: “And Samuel said to the people: It is the Lord Who made Moses and Aaron”</b> (I Samuel 12:6). <b>And it says</b> further: <b>“And the Lord sent Jerubaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel”</b> (I Samuel 12:11). The Gemara explains: <b>Jerubaal, this is Gideon. And why is he called Jerubaal?</b> The reason is <b>that he waged a quarrel against Baal. Bedan, this is Samson. And why is he called Bedan? As he came from</b> the tribe of <b>Dan. Jephthah, in accordance with its</b> regular <b>meaning,</b> i.e., this is referring to Jephthah himself and is not a nickname.

Daf 25b

<b>And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name;</b> they called upon the Lord, and He answered them” (Psalms 99:6). This verse equates Samuel to Moses and Aaron. In this manner, <b>the verse weighed three light ones of the world,</b> i.e., it considered the three less distinguished figures of Gideon, Samson, and Jephthah <b>as</b> equal to <b>three significant ones of the world,</b> Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, three of the greatest leaders of the Jewish people.
This comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>Jerubaal in his generation</b> is worthy of being treated <b>like Moses in his generation; Bedan in his generation</b> is <b>like Aaron in his generation;</b> and <b>Jephthah in his generation</b> is <b>like Samuel in his generation.</b> This serves <b>to teach you</b> that <b>even the lightest of the light,</b> i.e., the least distinguished individual, once <b>he has been appointed</b> as <b>a leader over the community, he</b> must be treated <b>like the greatest of the great,</b> and all are required to heed him and obey his rulings.
<b>And it</b> further <b>says: “And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:9). <b>But</b> can it <b>enter your mind that a person</b> can <b>go to a judge that is not</b> alive <b>in his days?</b> What, then, is the meaning of the phrase “in those days”? It teaches that <b>you</b> need <b>to go only to the judge in one’s days,</b> i.e., he is authorized to judge and decide matters. <b>And it</b> also <b>says: “Do not say: How was it that the former days were better than these?</b> For it is not out of wisdom that you inquire concerning this” (Ecclesiastes 7:10). Instead, one must accept the rulings of the leaders of his generation.
§ The mishna taught: Rabbi Yehoshua <b>took his staff and his money in his hand,</b> and appeared before Rabban Gamliel on the day on which Yom Kippur occurred according to his calculation, as Rabban Gamliel had ordered him to do. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>saw</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>he rose from his chair and kissed him on his head</b> and <b>said to him: Peace be on you, my teacher and my student. My teacher, as you have taught me Torah in public, and my student, as I issue a decree against you and you fulfill it like a student</b> of mine. <b>Fortunate is the generation in which the greater heed the lesser, and</b> it is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the generation in which <b>the lesser</b> heed <b>the greater</b> is certainly fortunate as well.
The Gemara questions this last point: Is this derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? This is incorrect, as <b>it is an obligation</b> for the lesser to heed those who are greater than them. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Gamliel meant the following: <b>Since the greater heed the lesser, the lesser apply an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>to themselves</b> and heed the leaders of the generation.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the court and all of</b> the <b>Jewish people saw</b> the new moon, and <b>the witnesses were interrogated, but</b> the court <b>did not manage to say: Sanctified, before nightfall,</b> so that the thirtieth day already passed, the previous month <b>is</b> rendered <b>a full,</b> thirty-day month, and the following day is observed as the New Moon.
If <b>the court alone saw</b> the new moon, <b>two</b> members of the court <b>should stand and testify before the others, and</b> the court <b>should say: Sanctified, sanctified.</b> If <b>three</b> people <b>saw</b> the new moon, <b>and they are</b> themselves members of <b>a court</b> for this purpose, <b>two</b> of them <b>should stand and seat</b> two <b>of their colleagues next to the individual</b> who remains of the three, thereby forming a new court of three. The two standing judges <b>should</b> then <b>testify before</b> the three seated judges that they saw the new moon and the seated judges <b>say: Sanctified, sanctified.</b> This procedure is necessary <b>because an individual is not authorized</b> to declare the month sanctified <b>by himself.</b> Rather, a court of three is required.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach:</b> If <b>the court and all of</b> the <b>Jewish people saw</b> the new moon? Merely stating that the court saw the moon would have sufficed, since its sanctification depends on them. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that even in that case, the month is intercalated. As <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the court and all of</b> the <b>Jewish people saw</b> the new moon, <b>it was publicized</b> that it was the New Moon that day, <b>and let them</b> no longer <b>intercalate</b> the month. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even in the case where all the Jewish people saw the new moon, the New Moon must be declared by the court.
The Gemara asks further: <b>But once</b> the mishna <b>states:</b> If <b>the court and all of</b> the <b>Jewish people saw</b> the new moon, <b>why do I</b> need it to say: And <b>the witnesses were interrogated?</b> Why are witnesses necessary if the new moon was already seen by the court? The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Alternatively,</b> if <b>the witnesses were interrogated, but</b> the court <b>had no time to say: Sanctified, before nightfall,</b> the previous month is <b>intercalated</b> and rendered a full month of thirty days.
The Gemara raises another difficulty. <b>But once</b> the mishna <b>taught:</b> But the court did not manage to say: Sanctified, <b>before nightfall,</b> the previous month is rendered a full, thirty-day month, <b>why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach</b> about <b>the interrogation of the witnesses?</b> This <i>halakha</i> was already stated with regard to a case where the court itself saw the new moon.
The Gemara explains: It <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Let the interrogation of the witnesses be</b> regarded <b>as the beginning of the judicial</b> process, <b>and</b> let the declaration: <b>Sanctified, sanctified,</b> be regarded <b>as the conclusion of the judicial</b> process, <b>and let them sanctify</b> the month <b>at night,</b> because the process began during the day. This process would then be <b>just as it is in</b> cases of <b>monetary law, as we learned</b> in a mishna: In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> although they must be adjudicated during the day, the court may <b>judge</b> the majority of a case <b>during the day,</b> and <b>complete</b> the trial and issue the ruling <b>at night. Here too,</b> one might assume that the court may <b>sanctify</b> the month <b>at night,</b> as the process began during the day. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the court may not do so.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Why not say</b> that, <b>indeed,</b> the sanctification of the month should be treated like monetary cases? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Rosh HaShana: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment [<i>mishpat</i>] of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5). <b>When does</b> the sanctification of the month <b>become a statute? At the end of the judicial process, and the Merciful One calls it a judgment</b> as well, thereby teaching that <b>just as</b> the primary time of <b>a judgment is during the day, here too,</b> with regard to the sanctification of the New Moon, the process must take place <b>during the day,</b> and not at night.
§ The mishna continues: If <b>the court</b> alone <b>saw</b> the new moon, <b>two</b> members of the court <b>should stand and testify before the others.</b> The Gemara ponders: If the court saw the new moon, <b>why</b> is it necessary for two of its members to testify before the others? <b>Hearing</b> their testimony <b>should not be greater than</b> actually <b>seeing</b> the new moon.
The Gemara responds that <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The mishna is addressing a case <b>where</b> the court <b>saw</b> the new moon <b>at night.</b> Because they saw it at night, their testimony is inadmissible at that time, as testimonies are admissible only during the day. They must therefore wait until the following day and testify as any ordinary person would.
The mishna continues: If <b>three</b> people <b>saw</b> the new moon, <b>and they are</b> themselves members of <b>a court</b> for this purpose, <b>two</b> of them <b>should stand and seat</b> two <b>of their colleagues next to the individual</b> who remains of the three. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is this necessary? <b>Here too, let us say: Hearing</b> their testimony <b>should not be greater than</b> actually <b>seeing</b> the new moon. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>here too,</b> the mishna is addressing a case <b>where they saw</b> the new moon <b>at night, this</b> case <b>is</b> identical to <b>that</b> previous one, and there would be no need for two separate rulings.
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach <b>the last clause,</b> which states: <b>Because an individual is not deemed credible</b> and authorized to declare the month sanctified <b>by himself. For</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Cases of <b>monetary law</b> are adjudicated <b>by</b> a court of <b>three</b> judges, <b>but if</b> a person <b>was a publicly recognized expert, he may judge</b> monetary matters <b>even individually, then here too,</b> one judge <b>should</b> be authorized to <b>sanctify</b> the month <b>individually</b> if he is a recognized expert. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, and that three judges are required for the sanctification of the month.
The Gemara asks: <b>But why not say that here too,</b> a recognized expert can sanctify the month individually? The Gemara rejects this possibility: But certainly <b>there was no publicly recognized expert among</b> the <b>Jewish people greater than our teacher Moses,</b> and nevertheless <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him:</b> You may not sanctify the new month <b>until Aaron is with you, as it is written: “And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, this month shall be for you</b> the beginning of months” (Exodus 12:1–2), where the word “you” is in the plural form. And since, to avoid deadlock, a court cannot be composed of an even number of judges, another judge must be added. It is therefore apparent that three judges are required for the sanctification of the month by Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that a witness becomes a judge,</b> i.e., that one who witnessed an event can himself serve as a judge concerning the matter? <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, for it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the Sanhedrin saw someone kill</b> another <b>person,</b>

Daf 26a

<b>some of them are rendered witnesses</b> and testify before the others <b>and some of them become judges</b> in the case; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: They are all rendered witnesses, and a witness cannot become a judge.</b> It seems therefore that the mishna contradicts Rabbi Akiva’s opinion.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> but we must distinguish between the cases. <b>Rabbi Akiva states</b> his position <b>there only with regard to</b> cases of <b>capital law, for the Merciful One says: “And the congregation shall judge…and the congregation shall save”</b> (Numbers 35:24–25), which requires a court to search for grounds to exonerate the defendant, <b>but once they</b> themselves <b>have seen him kill a person, they will be unable to find</b> grounds to <b>exonerate</b> him. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the sighting of the new moon, <b>even Rabbi Akiva concedes</b> that a witness can be rendered a judge.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna begins to discuss the primary mitzva of Rosh HaShana, sounding the <i>shofar</i>. <b>All <i>shofarot</i> are fit</b> for blowing <b>except for</b> the horn <b>of a cow, because it is a horn [<i>keren</i>]</b> and not a <i>shofar</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: But aren’t all <i>shofarot</i> called horn, as it is stated:</b> “And it shall come to pass, <b>that when they sound a long blast with the horn [<i>keren</i>] of a ram [<i>yovel</i>]”</b> (Joshua 6:5), and a ram’s horn is a <i>shofar</i> fit for sounding on Rosh HaShana?
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yosei is saying well,</b> i.e., presents a convincing argument. Why do the Rabbis not accept it? The Gemara explains that <b>the Rabbis</b> counter Rabbi Yosei’s argument as follows: Indeed, <b>all</b> other <b><i>shofarot</i> are called <i>shofar</i> and</b> they are also <b>called <i>keren</i>,</b> but that of <b>a cow is called <i>keren</i>,</b> but <b>it is not called <i>shofar</i>, as it is written: “His firstborn bull, grandeur is his, and his horns [<i>karnav</i>] are the horns of [<i>karnei</i>] a wild ox”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17). It is therefore clear that the horns of a bull are called <i>keren</i>, and nowhere are they called <i>shofar</i>.
<b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> counter this argument? <b>He</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> The horns <b>of a cow are also called <i>shofar</i>, as it is written: “And it shall please the Lord better than an ox bull [<i>shor par</i>]</b> that has horns and hoofs” (Psalms 69:32). The wording of the verse is strange: <b>If</b> it is <b>an ox [<i>shor</i>], why</b> is it also called <b>a bull [<i>par</i>], and if</b> it is <b>a bull [<i>par</i>], why</b> is it called <b>an ox [<i>shor</i>]? Rather, what is</b> the meaning of <b><i>shor par</i>?</b> These two words must be read as if they were one single word: <b>Than a <i>shofar</i>.</b> According to this reading, even the horn of a cow is called a <i>shofar</i>.
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> explain the difficulty in this verse? They explain it <b>as</b> it was explained by <b>Rav Mattana, as Rav Mattana said: What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>shor par</i>? An ox [<i>shor</i>] that is as large as a bull [<i>par</i>],</b> as the animal is called a <i>shor</i> from birth, but is called a <i>par</i> only from the age of three.
<b>Ulla said: This is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who say that the horn of a cow is unfit for sounding on Rosh HaShana. They say this <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said: For what reason does the High Priest not enter the innermost sanctum,</b> the Holy of Holies, <b>with</b> his <b>golden garments to perform the service</b> there on Yom Kippur? It is <b>because a prosecutor [<i>kateigor</i>] cannot become an advocate [<i>sanneigor</i>].</b> Since the Jewish people committed the sin of worshipping the Golden Calf, the High Priest may not enter the Holy of Holies to atone for the Jewish people wearing golden garments, as they would bring that sin to mind.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> do we <b>not</b> use a cow in the Holy of Holies? <b>But there is the blood of the bull</b> that is brought there to be sprinkled on Yom Kippur, despite the fact that the Jewish people sinned with a calf. The Gemara answers: <b>Since it has changed,</b> i.e., it is not the bull itself, but only its blood, then <b>it has changed,</b> i.e., so it does not bring the sin of the Golden Calf to mind.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But there is the Ark, the Ark cover, and the cherub,</b> all of which are plated with gold. If this is problematic, why are they in the Holy of Holies? The Gemara explains: <b>What we are saying is</b> that <b>a sinner</b> seeking atonement <b>should not bring</b> something made of gold <b>into</b> the Holy of Holies, as it would bring the sin of the Golden Calf to mind.
The Gemara asks further: <b>But there is the spoon and coal pan</b> that are brought into the Holy of Holies, and they are made of gold. The Gemara answers: <b>What we are saying is</b> that <b>a sinner</b> seeking atonement <b>should not adorn</b> himself with ornaments of gold.
The Gemara raises yet another question: <b>But there are the golden garments</b> the High Priest wears <b>outside</b> the Holy of Holies. The Gemara answers: <b>What we are saying is</b> that a sinner should not adorn himself with gold <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, but outside there is no concern. The Gemara continues this line of questioning: If so, <b>the <i>shofar</i> is also outside,</b> since it is not brought into the Holy of Holies. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>is</b> sounded in order to evoke God’s <b>remembrance, it is considered as if</b> it were sounded <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies.
The Gemara asks: Is this indeed the reason that the Rabbis disqualify the use of a cow’s horn? <b>But</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> The horn of a cow cannot be used <b>because it is a <i>keren</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>stated one</b> reason <b>and</b> also <b>another</b> reason: <b>One</b> reason is <b>that a prosecutor cannot become an advocate, and another</b> is <b>because it is</b> called <b>a <i>keren</i></b> and not a <i>shofar</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> counter these arguments? The Gemara explains: <b>He</b> could have <b>said to you: That which you said,</b> that <b>a prosecutor cannot become an advocate,</b> is indeed true, but <b>this applies</b> only <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, <b>and the <i>shofar</i> is</b> sounded <b>outside. And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said, because it is a <i>keren</i>, all <i>shofarot</i> are also called <i>keren</i>.</b>
<b>Abaye said: This is the reasoning of the Rabbis: The Merciful One says</b> to sound a single <b><i>shofar</i>, and not two or three <i>shofarot</i></b> together, <b>but this</b> horn <b>of a cow, since it is comprised of layers, looks like two or three <i>shofarot</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> The horn of a cow cannot be used <b>because it is a <i>keren</i>.</b> Since the Rabbis’ reasoning appears clearly in the mishna, how can the reasoning provided by Abaye be correct? The Gemara replies: The <i>tanna</i> <b>stated one</b> reason <b>and</b> also <b>another</b> reason. <b>One</b> reason is <b>that the Merciful One says</b> to sound <b>a</b> single <b><i>shofar</i>, and not two or three <i>shofarot</i></b> together, <b>and another</b> is <b>because it is a <i>keren</i>.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> could have <b>said to you: That which you said,</b> that <b>the Merciful One says</b> in the Torah to sound a single <b><i>shofar</i>, and not two or three <i>shofarot</i>,</b> is not a difficulty. <b>Since</b> the layers of the cow’s horn <b>are connected to each other,</b> it is considered <b>a single</b> <i>shofar</i>. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said: Because it is a <i>keren</i>, all <i>shofarot</i> are also called <i>keren</i>.</b>
§ It is taught in the mishna that Rabbi Yosei proves from a verse that a the horn of a ram [<i>yovel</i>] is called a <i>keren</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that</b> this term <b><i>yovel</i> denotes</b> the horn <b>of a ram?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva said: When I went to Arabia,</b> I heard that <b>they called a ram <i>yovla</i>,</b> and from this we can infer the meaning of the term <i>yovel</i> in the related language of Hebrew.
The Gemara records a series of similar statements: <b>And Rabbi Akiva said: When I went to Galia,</b> I heard that <b>they called a menstruating woman <i>galmuda</i>,</b> and this clarifies the meaning of that word in Scripture. It should be understood as follows: <b>What</b> does <b><i>galmuda</i></b> mean? <b>She is separated [<i>gemula da</i>] from her husband,</b> as all physical contact between a menstruating woman and her husband is forbidden. <b>And Rabbi Akiva said: When I went to Africa,</b> I heard that <b>they called a <i>ma’a</i>,</b> which is a certain coin, <b><i>kesita</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>significance of this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To explain</b> that the words <b>in the Torah</b> relating to Jacob’s purchase of his field near Shechem: “And he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, from the sons of Hamor for <b>a hundred <i>kesita</i>”</b> (Genesis 33:19), denote <b>a hundred <i>dankei</i>,</b> i.e., a hundred <i>ma’a.</i>
Similarly, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When I went to the sea towns,</b> I heard that <b>they called a sale <i>kira</i>.</b> And the Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>significance of this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To explain</b> the verse relating to Jacob’s burial plot: “In my grave <b>which I purchased [<i>kariti</i>] for myself,</b> there shall you bury me” (Genesis 50:5).
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: When I went to the district of Kan Nishrayya,</b> I heard that <b>they called a bride <i>ninfi</i> and a rooster <i>sekhvi</i>.</b> The Gemara explains how this information serves to clarify the meanings of biblical verses: <b>A bride</b> is called <b><i>ninfi</i>; what is the verse</b> that uses a similar term? <b>“Beautiful view [<i>nof</i>], the joy of the whole earth,</b> Mount Zion” (Psalms 48:3), which therefore means beautiful like a bride. <b>And a rooster</b> is called <b><i>sekhvi</i>; Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said this: <b>What is the verse</b> that employs this term? <b>“Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the <i>sekhvi</i>”</b> (Job 38:36), which should be understood as follows: <b>“Who has put wisdom in the inward parts”: These are the kidneys</b> that are hidden in the body; <b>“or who has given understanding to the <i>sekhvi</i>”: This is a rooster,</b> who knows to crow at fixed times during the night.
Incidental to the discussion of the meanings of certain words in foreign countries, it was related that <b>Levi</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to a certain place,</b> where <b>a man came before him</b> to complain about what had been done to him. This man <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 26b

<b>So-and-so <i>keva’a</i> from me.</b> Levi <b>did not understand what</b> that man <b>was saying to him,</b> as he did not know the meaning of the word <i>kava</i>. So <b>he went</b> and <b>asked in the study hall. They said to him:</b> That man <b>said to you: He robbed me, as it is written: “Will a man rob [<i>hayikba</i>] God?”</b> (Malachi 3:8). <b>Rava from</b> a place called <b>Barnish said to Rav Ashi: Had I been there</b> in Levi’s place I would have tried to uncover the meaning of the word in a different way, for <b>I would have said to him: How did he <i>keva’a</i> you? With what did he <i>keva’a</i> you? And why did he <i>keva’a</i> you? And</b> from his answers <b>I would have understood on my own</b> what was being said. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Levi, who did not do this, <b>thought</b> that the man <b>was talking about a matter of prohibition</b> and not a monetary matter, and so asking the man these questions would not have helped, as they are relevant only to monetary matters.
The Gemara continues its discussion of unusual words: <b>The Sages did not know the meaning of</b> the word <b><i>seirugin</i>,</b> which is found in a mishna. One day <b>they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house say to the Sages whom she saw entering</b> the house not all at once, but <b>intermittently: How long shall you enter <i>seirugin seirugin</i>?</b> and from this they understood that the word <i>seirugin</i> means: At intervals.
It is similarly recounted that <b>the Sages did not know the meaning</b> of the word <b><i>ḥaloglogot</i>,</b> which is mentioned in various <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i>. <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house say to a certain man whom she saw scattering his purslane</b> plants: <b>How long shall you scatter your <i>ḥaloglogot</i>?</b> So they understood that <i>ḥaloglogot</i> means purslane.
<b>The Sages also did not know the meaning</b> of the word <i>salseleha</i> in the verse: <b>“<i>Salseleha</i> and it will exalt you”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house say to a certain man who was curling his hair: How long shall you <i>mesalsel</i> your hair?</b> And from this they understood that the verse means: Turn wisdom about, and it will exalt you.
It is further related that <b>the Sages did not know the meaning</b> of the words in the verse: <b>“And sweep it [<i>vetetetiha</i>] with the broom [<i>matatei</i>] of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23). <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saying to her workmate: Take a broom [<i>tateita</i>] and sweep</b> [<b><i>ta’ati</i></b>] <b>the house,”</b> and they understood the meaning of these words.
<b>The Sages</b> also <b>did not know the meaning</b> of the word <i>yehavkha</i> in the verse: <b>“Cast your load [<i>yehavkha</i>] upon the Lord and He will sustain you”</b> (Psalms 55:23). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: One day I was traveling with a certain Arab [<i>Tayya’a</i>],</b> and <b>I was carrying a load, and he said to me: Take your <i>yehav</i> and cast it on my camel,</b> and from this I understood that <i>yehav</i> means a load.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The <i>shofar</i></b> that was used <b>on Rosh HaShana</b> in the Temple was made from the <b>straight</b> horn <b>of an ibex, and its mouth,</b> the mouthpiece into which one blows, <b>was plated with gold. And</b> there were <b>two trumpets,</b> one <b>on</b> each of <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> of the person sounding the <i>shofar</i>. <b>The <i>shofar</i> would sound a long</b> blast, <b>whereas the trumpets would sound a short</b> blast, <b>because the mitzva of the day is with the <i>shofar</i>.</b>
<b>And</b> in contrast, the <i>shofarot</i> used <b>on</b> public <b>fast days</b> were made from <b>the curved</b> horns <b>of rams, and their mouths were plated with silver.</b> There were <b>two trumpets in the middle</b> between the <i>shofarot</i>, and <b>the <i>shofar</i> would sound a short blast, whereas the trumpets would sound a long</b> blast, <b>for the mitzva of the day is with the trumpets.</b>
Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana with regard to</b> both <b>the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts</b> that are sounded <b>and the</b> additional <b>blessings</b> that are recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> There is a difference between the two days: <b>On Rosh HaShana one blows with</b> horns <b>of rams, whereas in Jubilee Years</b> one blows <b>with</b> horns <b>of ibexes.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Levi said: The mitzva of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur</b> of the Jubilee Year is to blow <b>with curved</b> <i>shofarot</i>, <b>and</b> that <b>of the rest of the year,</b> on fast days, is to blow <b>with straight</b> <i>shofarot</i>. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> differently in the mishna: <b>The <i>shofar</i></b> that was used <b>on Rosh HaShana</b> was made from the <b>straight</b> horn <b>of an ibex?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Levi <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: On Rosh HaShana they would blow with the curved</b> horns <b>of rams, and on</b> the Days of Atonement of <b>the Jubilee Years with</b> the horns <b>of ibexes.</b>
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> it simply <b>say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Why was it necessary to quote the <i>baraita</i> in full, as if it provided new information? The Gemara explains: <b>If you had said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, I would have said</b> that <b>he,</b> Rabbi Levi, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda even with regard to</b> the <i>shofar</i> used <b>in the Jubilee Year,</b> i.e., that one must blow with the horn of ibexes at that time. Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that he agrees with Rabbi Yehuda only with regard to Rosh HaShana, and not with regard to any other matter.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree? One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>on Rosh HaShana the more a person bends his mind</b> and humbles himself by bending in prayer, <b>the better.</b> Therefore, a curved <i>shofar</i> is sounded as an allusion to our bent minds and bodies. <b>But on Yom Kippur, the more a person straightens his mind</b> and prays with simplicity, <b>the better.</b> Therefore, a straight <i>shofar</i> is sounded. <b>The other Sage,</b> the anonymous <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>maintains</b> the opposite: <b>On Rosh HaShana, the more a person straightens his mind</b> and avoids any crookedness, <b>the better. On fasts,</b> on the other hand, <b>the more a person bends his mind</b> and humbles himself, <b>the better.</b>

Daf 27a

§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> the <b>mouth</b> of the <i>shofar</i> that was used on Rosh HaShana <b>was plated with gold.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>shofar</i> <b>was plated with gold at the place where one puts his mouth,</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for blowing; if it was plated, but <b>not at the place where he puts his mouth,</b> it is <b>fit</b> for blowing? <b>Abaye said: When we learned</b> in the mishna <b>as well, we learned</b> that it referred <b>not to the place where one puts his mouth,</b> but a little above it.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> there were <b>two trumpets,</b> one <b>on</b> each of <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> of the person sounding the <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But is it</b> really <b>possible to</b> properly <b>discern two</b> different <b>sounds,</b> that of the <i>shofar</i> and that of the trumpets, at the same time? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The two versions of the fifth of the Ten Commandments, <b>“Remember</b> the Shabbat day” (Exodus 20:8) and <b>“Keep</b> the Shabbat day” (Deuteronomy 5:12), <b>were spoken</b> by God simultaneously <b>in a single utterance, something that the</b> human <b>mouth cannot speak and the</b> human <b>ear cannot hear?</b> This indicates that it is impossible to take in two sounds at once, and so, due to the sound of the trumpets, it should be impossible to hear the blast of the <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>For this reason</b> they <b>would sound a long</b> blast <b>with the <i>shofar</i>,</b> to make it possible to hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i> on its own.
The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>Is this to say that if one hears the end of a blast without</b> hearing <b>the beginning of the blast he has fulfilled</b> his obligation? In this case one hears only the end of the <i>shofar</i> blast, since the <i>shofar</i> was initially sounded together with the trumpets. If so, <b>it would follow</b> that if one hears <b>the beginning of the blast without</b> hearing <b>the end of the blast, he has</b> also <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation.
This, however, is difficult. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a mishna: If <b>one blew the initial</b> <i>tekia</i>, a long, continuous <i>shofar</i> blast, of the first <i>tekia-terua-tekia</i> set, <b>and</b> then <b>drew out the final</b> <i>tekia</i> of that set so that it spans the length of <b>two</b> <i>tekiot</i>, <b>it counts as only one</b> <i>tekia</i> and is not considered two <i>tekiot</i>, i.e., the final <i>tekia</i> of the first set, and the initial <i>tekia</i> of the second set. But <b>why</b> is this so? <b>Let it count for him as two</b> <i>tekiot</i>, since as stated above, half a blast is considered a blast. The Gemara explains: If one hears only the beginning or the end of a <i>shofar</i> blast, he has indeed fulfilled his obligation, but nevertheless <b>we do not divide</b> a <i>shofar</i> blast <b>into two.</b>
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a mishna: With regard to <b>one</b> who <b>sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit, or into a cistern, or into</b> a large <b>jug [<i>pitas</i>], if he</b> clearly <b>heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but if he</b> also <b>heard the sound of an echo, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. But <b>why</b> is this so? If half a blast is indeed considered a complete blast, <b>let him fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with the beginning of the blast, before the sound is confused</b> with the echo, since the beginning of the blast was heard clearly.
<b>Rather,</b> we must retreat from the explanation offered above and say as follows: <b>Two sounds</b> coming <b>from one</b> source or <b>person cannot be discerned,</b> and this was the miracle at Sinai in which the people heard both “Remember the Shabbat” (Exodus 20:8) and “Keep the Shabbat” (Deuteronomy 5:12) in a single divine utterance. But two sounds <b>from two</b> different sources or <b>people can be</b> properly <b>discerned.</b>
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But</b> is it really true that two sounds coming <b>from two</b> different <b>people can be</b> properly <b>discerned? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to</b> the public reading of <b>the Torah, one</b> person <b>may read and one may translate, provided that there are not two</b> people <b>reading and two</b> people <b>translating.</b> Consequently it is clear that two sounds cannot be properly heard, even when they come from two different people.
The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, since our case <b>is only similar to</b> the case mentioned in <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>, which reads: <b>With regard to</b> the reading of <b><i>hallel</i> and the Scroll</b> of Esther, <b>even ten</b> people <b>may read</b> simultaneously. <b>Apparently, since</b> these readings <b>are dear</b> to their listeners, <b>they direct their attention</b> to them, listen attentively, and distinguish between the different readers. <b>Here too, since</b> the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> <b>is dear</b> to the listener, <b>he directs his attention</b> to the matter <b>and discerns</b> between the two sounds.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if it is indeed possible to discern the sound of the <i>shofar</i> even when it is sounded simultaneously with the trumpets, <b>why does he sound a long</b> blast <b>with the <i>shofar</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: This is so people should <b>know that the mitzva of the day is</b> specifically <b>with the <i>shofar</i>.</b>
§ It was taught in the mishna: The <i>shofarot</i> that were used <b>on</b> public <b>fast days</b> were made from <b>the curved</b> horns <b>of rams, and their mouths were plated with silver.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there</b> that the <i>shofar</i> of Rosh HaShana is plated with <b>gold, and what is different here</b> that the <i>shofarot</i> of fast days are plated with <b>silver?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish,</b> you can <b>say: Any</b> <i>shofar</i> made for the purpose of <b>gathering people</b> together <b>is</b> made <b>of silver, as it is written: “Make for yourself two trumpets of silver;</b> of a whole piece shall you make them, and you shall use them for calling the assembly and for the journeying of the camps” (Numbers 10:2). <b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say: The Torah spared the money of the Jewish people</b> and therefore allows these <i>shofarot</i> to be made of silver, which is less costly than gold.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>there too,</b> the <i>shofar</i> of Rosh HaShana <b>should be made with silver</b> plating. The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, the</b> duty of <b>honoring the Festival is given priority,</b> so that it is proper to beautify the <i>shofar</i> of Rosh HaShana. On a fast day, however, since it is not a Festival, there is no need to use gold, and silver is sufficient.
It is related that <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel thought to act in accordance with the mishna</b> regarding all the details of the <i>shofar</i> and the trumpets. But <b>Rava said to him: They said</b> this <b>only with regard to the Temple. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Only <b>in the Temple, but in the provinces,</b> anywhere outside the Temple, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>Wherever there are trumpets,</b> e.g., on fast days, <b>there is no <i>shofar</i>, and wherever there is a <i>shofar</i>,</b> e.g., on Rosh HaShana, <b>there are no trumpets.</b>
<b>And similarly, Rabbi Ḥalafta established</b> the custom <b>in Tzippori</b> as it is described in the mishna, <b>and</b> so did <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon in Sikhni, and when the matter came before the Rabbis they said: They acted in this manner only at the east gates</b> of the Temple <b>and on the Temple Mount.</b>
<b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> that said: <b>What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is written: “With trumpets and the sound of a <i>shofar</i> make joyful noise before the Lord, the King”</b> (Psalms 98:6), from which it may be inferred: Only <b>before the Lord, the King,</b> i.e., in His Temple, <b>do we need</b> both <b>trumpets and the sound of a <i>shofar</i>, but in general,</b> outside the Temple, we do <b>not</b> need both.
§ It was taught in the mishna: Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana with regard to</b> both <b>the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts</b> that are sounded <b>and the</b> additional <b>blessings</b> that are recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we pray today</b> on Rosh HaShana, saying: <b>This day is the beginning of Your works, a commemoration of the first day? In accordance with whom? In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: The world was created in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei.</b> We therefore mention on Rosh HaShana that it is the first day.
<b>Rav Eina raised an objection:</b> It was taught in the mishna: Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana with regard to</b> both <b>the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts</b> that are sounded <b>and the</b> additional <b>blessings</b> that are recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>But there are</b> the words: <b>This day is the beginning of Your works, a commemoration of the first day, which can be</b> recited <b>on Rosh HaShana but cannot</b> be recited <b>on</b> Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year,</b> which is neither: The beginning of Your works, nor: A commemoration of the first day. If so, how can one recite the same blessing on both occasions? The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>was taught,</b> saying that the blessings of the Jubilee and Rosh HaShana are the same, it was taught <b>with regard to the other</b> parts of the blessings, but the line beginning: This day, is indeed omitted on Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year.
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, taught</b> the previous passage <b>as follows: Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: That which we learn</b> in the mishna, Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana with regard to</b> both <b>the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts</b> that are sounded <b>and the</b> additional <b>blessings</b> that are recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer; <b>in accordance with whom</b> was it taught? Apparently it was <b>not</b> taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as if</b> it reflects the view of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Since he said that the world was created in Tishrei,</b> then <b>there are also</b> the words: <b>This day is the beginning of Your works, a commemoration of the first day, which can be</b> recited <b>on Rosh HaShana, but cannot</b> be recited <b>on</b> Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year.</b> If so, how can one recite the same blessing on both occasions? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>was taught,</b> it was taught <b>with regard to the other</b> parts of the blessings, but this line is indeed omitted on Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A <i>shofar</i> that was cracked and</b> then <b>glued together,</b> even though it appears to be whole, is <b>unfit.</b> Similarly, if <b>one glued together broken fragments of <i>shofarot</i></b> to form a complete <i>shofar</i>, the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit.</b>

Daf 27b

If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was punctured and</b> the puncture <b>was sealed, if it impedes the blowing,</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If <b>one sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit, or into a cistern, or into</b> a large <b>jug, if he</b> clearly <b>heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation; <b>but if he heard the sound of an echo, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>And similarly,</b> if <b>one was passing behind a synagogue, or his house was adjacent to the synagogue, and he heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i> or the sound of the Scroll</b> of Esther being read, <b>if he focused his heart,</b> i.e. his intent, to fulfill his obligation, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation; <b>but if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. It is therefore possible for two people to hear the <i>shofar</i> blasts, but only one of them fulfills his obligation. <b>Even though this one heard and</b> also <b>the other one heard,</b> nevertheless, <b>this one focused his heart</b> to fulfill his obligation and has therefore indeed fulfilled it, <b>but the other one did not focus his heart,</b> and so he has not fulfilled his obligation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>shofar</i> was <b>long and it was shortened,</b> it <b>is</b> still <b>fit.</b> If it <b>was scraped</b> out, <b>so that</b> only <b>its outer layer remains,</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>fit.</b> If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was plated with gold at the place where one puts his mouth,</b> it is <b>unfit; if</b> it was plated <b>not at the place where he puts his mouth,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If it <b>was plated with gold on the inside,</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> as one does not hear the sound of a <i>shofar</i> but the sound of a golden instrument. If, however, it was plated with gold <b>on the outside,</b> the following distinction applies: <b>If its sound changed from what it was</b> before the plating, it is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> the gold plating is mere ornamentation and <b>it is</b> therefore <b>fit.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was punctured and</b> the puncture was <b>sealed, if it impedes the blowing,</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If <b>one placed</b> one <b><i>shofar</i> inside</b> another <b><i>shofar</i></b> and blew, <b>if he heard the sound of the inner</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, because it is considered one <i>shofar</i>, <b>but if he heard the sound of the outer</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>he has not fulfilled</b> it, as the sound issues from two <i>shofarot</i> at once.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>shofar</i> <b>was scraped</b> down, <b>whether on the inside or on the outside,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> Even if it <b>was scraped</b> out to the point <b>that</b> only <b>its outer layer remains,</b> it <b>is</b> still <b>fit.</b> If <b>one placed</b> one <b><i>shofar</i> inside</b> another <b><i>shofar</i></b> and blew, <b>if he heard the sound of the inner</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but if he heard the sound of the outer</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. If <b>he inverted</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>and blew it, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>Rav Pappa said: Do not say that</b> this means that <b>he</b> softened the <i>shofar</i> and <b>turned it inside out like a tunic. Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that he widened the narrow</b> end of the <i>shofar</i> <b>and narrowed</b> its <b>wide</b> end. <b>What is the reason</b> that this is unfit? It is <b>according</b> to the opinion <b>of Rav Mattana, as Rav Mattana said</b> that the verse states: <b>“You shall proclaim</b> [<i>veha’avarta</i>] with the <i>shofar</i>” (Leviticus 25:9), where the word <i>veha’avarta</i> literally means carry, thereby teaching that <b>we need</b> the <i>shofar</i> to be sounded <b>the</b> same <b>way that it was carried</b> on the head of the animal, and if a change was made, it is unfit.
§ It was taught in the mishna: If <b>one glued together broken fragments of <i>shofarot</i></b> to form a complete <i>shofar</i>, the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>anything was added</b> to a <i>shofar</i>, <b>whether</b> of <b>the same substance,</b> i.e., horn, <b>or of a foreign substance,</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit.</b> If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was punctured and sealed, whether with the same substance or with a foreign substance,</b> it is <b>unfit. Rabbi Natan says:</b> If it was sealed <b>with the same substance,</b> it is <b>fit; with a foreign substance,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> stated: If it was sealed <b>with the same substance,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> Concerning this <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This applies</b> only <b>where most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>is intact</b> and only a small patch was added. The Gemara concludes: <b>By inference,</b> if it was sealed <b>with a foreign substance,</b> then <b>even if most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>is intact,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
<b>Some teach this</b> ruling <b>with regard to the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, in which it was taught: If it was sealed <b>with a foreign substance,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> Concerning this <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is</b> only <b>where most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>was missing,</b> so that the patch constitutes the majority. The Gemara concludes: <b>By inference,</b> if it was sealed <b>with the same substance,</b> then <b>even if most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>was missing, it is</b> still <b>fit.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was plated with gold on the inside,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> If, however, it was plated <b>on the outside,</b> and <b>if its sound changed from what it was</b> before the plating, it is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was cracked lengthwise,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> But if it was cracked <b>along its width,</b> the following distinction applies: <b>If,</b> of the portion above the crack <b>there remains a measure</b> sufficient <b>to</b> sound <b>a blast,</b> it is <b>fit, but if not,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
<b>And how much is a measure</b> sufficient <b>to</b> sound <b>a blast? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explained: Enough that when he holds it in his hand, it can be seen</b> protruding <b>on one side</b> of his hand <b>and on the other side.</b> If the <b>sound</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>is high or deep or dry,</b> it is <b>fit</b> for blowing, <b>as</b> the Torah does not require a particular sound, and <b>all sounds</b> coming <b>from a <i>shofar</i> are fit.</b>
It is related that the following ruling <b>was sent</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>to Shmuel’s father:</b> If <b>one drilled</b> out the inside of a horn <b>and blew it, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious, for all</b> <i>shofarot</i> <b>are drilled,</b> since after the horn is removed from the animal, the bone that fills the horn and connects it to the animal’s head must be removed. What, then, does this ruling teach us?
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Here we are discussing a case <b>where he drilled the bone</b> that fills the horn instead of removing it in the usual manner. <b>Lest you say</b> that even something made <b>of the same substance interposes,</b> and the sound that is produced is emitted from the bone and not from the <i>shofar</i>, the ruling therefore <b>teaches us</b> that since the bone and the horn are considered to be of the same substance, the <i>shofar</i> is fit and he has fulfilled his obligation.
§ It was taught in the mishna: If <b>one sounds</b> a shofar <b>into a pit or into a cistern,</b> he has not fulfilled his obligation. <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> this <b>only with respect to those standing at the edge of the pit,</b> i.e., on the outside, as they can hear only the echo coming from the pit. <b>But those standing in the pit</b> itself <b>have fulfilled their obligation,</b> since they initially hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i>.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit or into a cistern, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that in that case <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from here</b> that the contradiction must be reconciled <b>in accordance with Rav Huna?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is so.
Some had a different version of the previous passage. <b>There are</b> those <b>who raise the</b> following source <b>as a contradiction: We learned</b> in the mishna that if <b>one sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit or into a cistern, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in that case <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation? <b>Rav Huna said: This</b> is <b>not difficult; here,</b> in the mishna, we are dealing <b>with those standing at the edge of the pit,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> we are dealing <b>with those standing in the pit.</b>
<b>Rabba said:</b>

Daf 28a

If <b>one heard part of the blast in the pit and part of the blast at the edge of the pit, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. But if he heard <b>part of the blast before dawn,</b> when it is not yet time to sound the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and part of the blast after dawn, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>Abaye said to him: What is different there,</b> in the case of one who heard part of the blast before dawn and part of it after dawn? If you say that there <b>the entire blast needs to be</b> heard <b>in</b> a time of <b>obligation, and</b> when he hears part of the blast before dawn and part after dawn <b>it is not</b> all within the same time of obligation, <b>here too,</b> in the case of the pit, <b>the entire blast needs to be in</b> a place where one can fulfill his <b>obligation, and</b> when he hears part of the blast in a pit and part at the edge, <b>it is not</b> all within a place where he can fulfill his obligation.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, night is not a time of obligation at all,</b> and sounding the <i>shofar</i> then has no meaning whatsoever, <b>but here, a pit is a place of obligation for those standing in the pit.</b> That is to say, the part of the blast that was heard in the pit is not inherently invalid, but merely disqualified due to an external factor, so that it is possible to connect it with the part of the blast that was heard at the edge of the pit.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rabba maintains</b> that if <b>one heard the end of a blast without</b> hearing <b>the beginning of the blast, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation? Because in the case where one heard the beginning of the blast in a pit, he is considered to have heard only the end of the <i>shofar</i> blast, which he heard at the edge of the pit. <b>And it</b> therefore <b>follows</b> that if one heard <b>the beginning of a blast without</b> hearing <b>the end of the blast, he has</b> also <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that this is not so, for we learned in the mishna: If <b>one blew the initial</b> <i>tekia</i> of the first set of <i>tekia-terua-tekia</i>, <b>and</b> then <b>drew out the second</b> <i>tekia</i> so that it spans the length of <b>two</b> <i>tekiot</i>, <b>it counts as only one</b> <i>tekia</i>, and is not considered two <i>tekiot</i>, i.e., the concluding <i>tekia</i> of the first set, and the initial <i>tekia</i> of the second set. <b>But why</b> is this so? If we consider part of a blast as a complete one, <b>let it count as two</b> <i>tekiot</i>. The Gemara explains: If one hears only the beginning or the end of a <i>shofar</i> blast, he has indeed fulfilled his obligation, but nevertheless, <b>we do not divide</b> a <i>shofar</i> blast <b>into two.</b>
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a mishna: If <b>one sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit, or into a cistern, or into a</b> large <b>jug, if he</b> clearly <b>heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation; <b>but if he heard the sound of an echo, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But why</b> is this so? If indeed half a blast is considered a blast, <b>let him fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with the beginning of the blast, before the sound</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>is confused</b> with the echo, since he heard the beginning of the blast clearly.
The Gemara answers: Indeed, half a blast is not considered a blast, and Rabba’s statement must be understood differently. <b>When Rabba spoke,</b> he was speaking not about other people hearing the blast, but <b>about</b> one who was <b>sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for himself</b> in a pit <b>and emerged</b> from the pit as he was blowing. He has fulfilled his obligation, because he was located in the same place as the sound of the <i>shofar</i> at all times, and so he heard the entire blast clearly.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose of Rabba’s <b>statement?</b> The <i>halakha</i> in this case should be obvious, as there is no reason that the blast should be disqualified. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say that his head might sometimes emerge</b> from the pit <b>while the <i>shofar</i></b> itself <b>is still in the pit, and the sound may become confused</b> with its echo, and so he would not fulfill his obligation. Therefore, Rabba <b>teaches us</b> that we are not concerned about this, and the obligation is considered to have been fulfilled.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said: One should not blow with the <i>shofar</i> of</b> an animal consecrated as <b>a burnt-offering, but if he</b> nevertheless transgressed and <b>blew, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>One should</b> also <b>not blow with the <i>shofar</i> of</b> an animal consecrated as <b>a peace-offering, and if he</b> nevertheless transgressed and <b>blew, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>A burnt-offering is subject to misuse</b> of consecrated objects before being offered, and <b>once one misuses it</b> for mundane purposes, <b>it becomes non-sacred,</b> so that the one who blows with its <i>shofar</i> fulfills his obligation. In contrast, <b>peace-offerings are not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated objects before being offered, since in the case of sacrifices of lesser sanctity, misuse is restricted to the fats and other portions that are offered on the altar, and even this applies only after the sprinkling of the blood. Since one is not considered to be misusing peace-offerings when utilizing them for mundane purposes, <b>the prohibition remains intact and they do not become non-sacred.</b> Therefore, one who blows the <i>shofar</i> of an animal consecrated as a peace-offering does not fulfill his obligation.
<b>Rava strongly objects to this</b> argument: <b>When does he commit misuse? After he has sounded</b> it, for only then has he misused the consecrated animal. If so, <b>when he sounds</b> it, <b>he is sounding with something that is</b> still <b>prohibited,</b> even in the case of the animal that was consecrated as a burnt-offering, and so he should not be able to fulfill his obligation with it.
<b>Rather, Rava said: Both this one,</b> the <i>shofar</i> of a burnt-offering, <b>and the other one,</b> the <i>shofar</i> of a peace-offering, are governed by the same <i>halakha</i>: If he sounded them, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Later,</b> Rava retracted his statement and <b>then said</b> the opposite: <b>Both this one,</b> the <i>shofar</i> of a burnt-offering, <b>and the other one,</b> the <i>shofar</i> of a peace-offering, are governed by the same <i>halakha</i>: If he sounded them, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The reason for this is that <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit.</b> That is to say, the fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit, and in the absence of benefit, one is not liable for misuse.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> further: <b>One should not sound a <i>shofar</i></b> that was used for <b>idol worship, but if he</b> nevertheless transgressed and <b>sounded it, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>One should</b> also <b>not sound a <i>shofar</i> from a city</b> whose residents were <b>incited</b> to idolatry, where the majority of inhabitants committed idolatry, <b>but if he</b> nevertheless transgressed and <b>sounded it, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>What is the reason</b> for this last ruling? With regard to any object found in <b>a city</b> whose residents were <b>incited</b> to idolatry, <b>its size</b> as required for the mitzva <b>is seen</b> by <i>halakha</i> <b>as crushed</b> into powder. Since a <i>shofar</i> from a city whose residents were incited to idolatry is destined for burning, it is considered as if it is already burnt, and it therefore lacks the requisite measurement for fulfilling the mitzva.
<b>Rava said:</b> If <b>one is prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from another,</b> i.e., if he took a vow not to receive any benefit whatsoever from a certain person, that other person <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>permitted to sound a blast for him</b> so that he fulfills the <b>mitzva,</b> in accordance with the principle that the fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit. For the same reason, if <b>one is prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from a</b> particular <b><i>shofar</i>, he is</b> nevertheless <b>permitted to sound a blast with it</b> so that he may fulfill the <b>mitzva.</b>
<b>And Rava said</b> further: If <b>one is prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from another,</b> that other person <b>may</b> nevertheless <b>sprinkle the waters of purification on him,</b> i.e., water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer, which was used to purify people and objects that had contracted ritual impurity through contact with a corpse, <b>in the rainy season,</b> for at that time the sprinkling is performed only in order to fulfill a mitzva. <b>But</b> he may <b>not</b> do so <b>in the summer season,</b> since then he also benefits from the very fact that water is being sprinkled on him. Similarly, if <b>one is prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from</b> a particular <b>spring, he may</b> nevertheless <b>immerse in it</b> an <b>immersion</b> performed in order to fulfill <b>a mitzva in the rainy season, but not in the summer season,</b> since then he also derives benefit from the very fact that he has immersed in cold water.
§ It is related that the following ruling <b>was sent</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>to Shmuel’s father:</b> If one <b>was</b> forcibly <b>compelled to eat <i>matza</i></b> on Passover, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara clarifies the matter: <b>Who compelled him</b> to eat the <i>matza</i>? <b>If we say</b> that <b>a demon forced him,</b> i.e., that he ate it in a moment of insanity, this is difficult. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>someone</b> who <b>is at times sane</b> and <b>at times insane, at the times when he is sane, he is considered</b> halakhically <b>competent for all purposes</b> and is obligated in all the mitzvot. And <b>when he is insane, he is considered insane for all purposes,</b> and is therefore exempt from the mitzvot. If so, someone who was compelled by a demon to eat <i>matza</i> is not considered obligated to perform the mitzvot at all.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where the Persians compelled him</b> to eat. <b>Rava said: That is to say</b> that <b>one who sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for the music,</b> having no intent to fulfill the mitzva, <b>fulfills</b> his obligation, since the critical issue is hearing the blast and not the intent of the blower.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious that this is</b> identical to <b>that</b> which was stated above, that one who was compelled to eat <i>matza</i> fulfills the mitzva even if he had no intention of doing so? The same should apply in the case of the <i>shofar</i>, that one who heard the blast of a <i>shofar</i> fulfills his obligation even if he had no intention of doing so. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that there is a difference between the two cases, <b>there, the Merciful One says: Eat <i>matza</i>, and he indeed ate</b> it, thereby fulfilling the mitzva.

Daf 28b

<b>But here,</b> with regard to a <i>shofar</i>, <b>it is written: “A memorial of blasts”</b> (Leviticus 23:24), which might have been understood as requiring conscious intent, <b>and this one was merely acting unawares,</b> without having any intent whatsoever of performing the mitzva. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that the absence of intent does not invalidate fulfillment of the mitzva, even in the case of <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently, Rava maintains</b> that the fulfillment of <b>mitzvot does not require intent.</b> That is to say, if one performs a mitzva, he fulfills his obligation even if he has no intention of doing so.
The Gemara <b>raised an objection to</b> this conclusion from what we learned in a mishna: If <b>one was reading</b> the passage of <i>Shema</i> <b>in the Torah, and the time of reciting</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>arrived, if he focused his heart, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara reasons: <b>What, is it not that he focused his heart to fulfill</b> his obligation, and if he failed to do so, he has not fulfilled his duty, therefore implying that the fulfillment of mitzvot requires intent?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> the mishna means that he intended <b>to read</b> the passage. The Gemara asks in astonishment: <b>To read? But he is</b> already <b>reading</b> it, for the mishna explicitly states: If one was reading in the Torah. The Gemara answers: We are discussing <b>one who was reading</b> from a Torah scroll in order <b>to correct</b> it, uttering the words indistinctly. The mishna teaches that if such an individual intends to articulate the words correctly, he has fulfilled his obligation.
The Gemara raises another objection: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which we learned in our mishna: If <b>one was passing behind a synagogue, or his house was adjacent to the synagogue, and he heard the sound of</b> the <b><i>shofar</i> or the sound of the Scroll</b> of Esther, <b>if he focused his heart, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>he focused his heart to fulfill</b> his obligation, and if he failed to do so, he has not fulfilled his duty, therefore implying that the fulfillment of mitzvot requires intent?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> the mishna means that he intended <b>to hear</b> the sound of the <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara immediately asks: <b>To hear? But he</b> already <b>hears</b> it, since the mishna explicitly states: And he heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara answers: We are discussing one <b>who thinks</b> that <b>it is merely</b> the sound of <b>a donkey</b> that he is hearing, and in this case, where the listener thinks that the sound was not that of a <i>shofar</i>, he does not fulfill his obligation. Therefore, the mishna teaches that it is sufficient that one have intent and know that he is hearing the sound of a <i>shofar</i>.
The Gemara <b>raised an objection to</b> this answer from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the hearer</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>had intent, but the sounder</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>did not have intent,</b> or if <b>the sounder</b> of the <i>shofar</i> had intent, <b>but the hearer did not have</b> intent, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>until</b> both <b>the hearer and the sounder have intent. Granted,</b> with regard to the case where <b>the sounder had intent, but the hearer did not have intent,</b> Rava can say that this is referring to a case where the hearer <b>thinks</b> that <b>it is merely</b> the sound of <b>a donkey</b> and he did not have intent to hear the sound of a <i>shofar</i>. <b>But</b> with regard to the case where <b>the hearer had intent, but the sounder did not have intent,</b> under <b>what circumstances</b> can this case <b>be found? Is it not</b> where <b>he sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for music</b> and despite the intent of the hearer he has not fulfilled his obligation? This implies that unless the sounder of the <i>shofar</i> has intent to fulfill the mitzva the hearer does not fulfill his obligation.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he sounded bark-like blasts</b> with the <i>shofar</i>, i.e., he did not sound the <i>shofar</i> in the proper manner, but merely acted unawares without intent to perform the mitzva. The <i>baraita</i> teaches us that if he has intent to sound the blasts in the correct manner, he has fulfilled his obligation.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the fulfillment of a mitzva does not require intent, <b>one who sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> on the Eighth Day of Assembly should receive lashes</b> for violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, since he is adding to the mitzva of: “You shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i> for seven days” (Leviticus 23:42). Since, according to Rava, even if one did not intend to observe the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> but slept in the <i>sukka</i> for a different reason, his sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> constitutes the fulfillment of a mitzva to dwell there, then, if one did so at an inappropriate time, he is considered to have transgressed the prohibition against adding to the mitzvot. Yet the Sages instituted that in the Diaspora one must observe <i>Sukkot</i> for eight days.
Rava <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>because I say</b> that <b>mitzvot can be transgressed only</b> by adding to them <b>in their</b> prescribed <b>times.</b> But if one adds to a mitzva outside of the period of obligation for the mitzva, there is no violation of the prohibition against adding to mitzvot. On the Eighth Day of Assembly there is no longer a mitzva to sleep in the <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> on that day does not constitute a prohibited act.
<b>Rav Shemen bar Abba raised an objection</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a priest who went up to the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Blessing <b>should not say: Since the Torah granted me permission to bless the Jewish people, I will add a blessing of my own,</b> which is not part of the Priestly Blessing stated in the Torah, <b>for example:</b> “May <b>the Lord God of your fathers make you</b> a thousand times <b>as many as you are”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:11)? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “You shall not add to the word</b> which I command you” (Deuteronomy 4:2). <b>But here, since</b> the priest already <b>recited</b> the Priestly <b>Blessing, the time</b> of the mitzva <b>has passed,</b> and according to Rava, after the prescribed time for performing a mitzva, one does not transgress the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, yet <b>it</b> nevertheless <b>teaches that he has transgressed.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here? With</b> a case <b>where he did not complete</b> the fixed text of the blessing but added to it in the middle.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a parallel <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he completed</b> the Priestly Blessing. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> means that <b>he completed one blessing,</b> i.e., the first verse of the Priestly Blessing, but he still has two more blessings to recite.
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> dealing with the same issue: If <b>he completed all of his blessings.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the Priestly Blessings, <b>it is different, since if he encounters another congregation, he may recite the blessings again,</b> from which we learn that <b>the entire day is the</b> prescribed <b>time</b> of the mitzva. Therefore, even if he added a blessing of his own only after he finished reciting all three verses of the Priestly Blessing, he is still considered to have added to the mitzva in its prescribed time, and he therefore transgresses the prohibition against adding to mitzvot.
The Gemara comments: <b>And from where do you say</b> that if a mitzva may be performed again, the whole day is considered its prescribed time? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If the blood of sacrifices <b>that require</b> only <b>one sprinkling,</b> such as the firstborn offering, <b>became mingled with</b> the blood of other sacrifices that <b>require</b> only <b>one sprinkling,</b> the mixture of blood <b>is sprinkled once.</b> Similarly, if the blood of sacrifices that require <b>four sprinklings,</b> such as burnt-offerings, became mingled <b>with</b> the blood of other sacrifices that require <b>four sprinklings,</b> the mixture <b>is sprinkled four times.</b>
However, if the blood of an offering that requires <b>four sprinklings</b> became mingled <b>with</b> the blood of an offering that requires only <b>one sprinkling,</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The mixture of blood <b>is sprinkled four times.</b> And <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: It is sprinkled once.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: But if he sprinkles the blood only once, <b>he</b> thereby <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not diminish,</b> which renders it prohibited to take away any element in the performance of a mitzva, as he has not sprinkled the blood of an offering requiring four sprinklings, i.e., the burnt-offering in the proper manner. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: But according to your position, that he must sprinkle the blood four times, <b>he</b> thereby <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not add,</b> which renders it prohibited to add elements to a mitzva, e.g. an offering requiring one sprinkling, like the firstborn animal.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua: The prohibition: <b>Do not add, is stated only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the blood stands <b>by itself,</b> but not when it is part of a mixture. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> to Rabbi Eliezer: Likewise, the prohibition: <b>Do not diminish, is stated only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the blood stands <b>by itself.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said further,</b> in defense of his position: <b>When you do not sprinkle</b> four times, even if <b>you transgress</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not diminish, you do not perform the act with your</b> own <b>hand,</b> since it is merely an omission, not an action. Whereas <b>when you sprinkle</b> four times, <b>you transgress</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not add,</b> with regard to one of the sacrifices, <b>and you perform the act with your</b> own <b>hand,</b> i.e., you transgress the Torah’s command by means of a positive act. If one is forced to deviate from the words of the Torah, it is preferable to do so in a passive manner. The Gemara concludes the citation from the mishna.
The Gemara proceeds to derive from here that if the mitzva may be performed again the whole day is considered its prescribed time: <b>And here, once he has already offered</b> one <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>of the firstborn</b> as required, <b>its time has passed,</b> since he has already completed the mitzva of sprinkling the blood of the firstborn, and <b>it</b> nevertheless <b>teaches</b> that <b>he transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not add. Is it not because we say</b> as follows: <b>Since if he encounters another firstborn</b> to be sacrificed, <b>he would sprinkle</b> of its blood <b>again?</b> If so, <b>the entire day is</b> considered the prescribed <b>time</b> for the mitzva of sprinkling.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>From where</b> do you conclude that this is so? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yehoshua maintains</b> that <b>mitzvot can be transgressed</b> by adding to them <b>even outside their</b> prescribed <b>times.</b> Therefore, this source provides no proof.
The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> what <b>we</b> were <b>saying</b> when we cited this mishna: <b>What is the reason that Rav Shemen bar Abba set aside the mishna,</b> which deals with the sprinkling of blood, <b>and raised an objection from a <i>baraita</i>? He should have raised an objection from the mishna,</b> which is more generally accepted. <b>What is the reason that he does not raise an objection</b> from <b>the mishna? Since</b> he knows that it can be argued as follows: <b>Because if he encounters another firstborn he will be required to sprinkle</b> its blood. Therefore <b>the entire day is</b> considered <b>the</b> prescribed <b>time</b> of the mitzva. If so, with regard to <b>the <i>baraita</i> as well,</b> it can be argued that <b>because if he encounters another congregation, he may recite</b> the Priestly <b>Blessing again, the whole day is</b> considered <b>its</b> prescribed <b>time.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the opinion of <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba,</b> who raised the objection from the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>There, it is not possible to refrain</b> from <b>sprinkling</b> the blood of another firstborn that comes his way, so the entire day is certainly its prescribed time. But <b>here, if he wishes, he may bless</b> the other congregation, and <b>if he wishes, he may refrain from blessing</b> them, since he is obligated to recite the Priestly Blessing only once a day.
<b>Rava</b> himself <b>said:</b> There is no difficulty at all, since <b>the fulfillment</b> of a mitzva <b>does not require intent,</b> but <b>the transgression</b> of the prohibition: Do not add, or: Do not diminish, <b>requires intent.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>the sprinkling of blood, according to Rabbi Yehoshua, the transgression</b> of the prohibition: Do not add, <b>does not require intent,</b> since he holds that if one added to the required sprinklings, he transgresses. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> One must say as follows: <b>The fulfillment</b> of a mitzva <b>does not require intent,</b> and <b>the transgression</b> of the prohibition: Do not add, <b>during the</b> prescribed <b>time</b> of the mitzva, <b>does not require intent,</b> and the sprinkler of the blood therefore transgresses, as Rabbi Yehoshua maintains. However, the transgression of the prohibition: Do not add, when it is <b>not in its</b> prescribed <b>time,</b> e.g., in the case of sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> on the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>requires intent</b> to fulfill the mitzva, and in the absence of such intent, there is no transgression.
With regard to the intent required in order to fulfill the mitzva of <i>shofar</i>, <b>Rabbi Zeira said to his servant:</b>

Daf 29a

<b>Have intent</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> on my behalf <b>and sound</b> it <b>for me.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>maintains</b> that <b>he who sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> for others <b>is required to have intent</b> to discharge the hearer’s obligation.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the mishna: If <b>one was passing behind a synagogue, or his house was adjacent to the synagogue, and he heard the sound of</b> the <b><i>shofar</i> or the sound of</b> the <b>Scroll</b> of Esther being read, <b>if he focused his heart</b> to fulfill his obligation, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. It may be asked: <b>And,</b> according to Rabbi Zeira, even <b>if</b> the hearer <b>focused his heart, what of it? The other one,</b> i.e., the one sounding the <i>shofar</i>, <b>did not focus his intent</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> <b>with him in mind?</b> If indeed the intent of the one sounding the <i>shofar</i> is required, how does the passerby fulfill his obligation?
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with the representative of the community,</b> i.e., one <b>who</b> sounds the <i>shofar</i> for the entire congregation and <b>has everyone in mind.</b> He does not sound it for a specific individual, but rather on behalf of the entire community, and therefore anyone who hears him sound the <i>shofar</i> fulfills his obligation.
The Gemara raises another objection: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the hearer</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>had intent, but the sounder</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>did not have intent,</b> or if <b>the sounder</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>had intent, but the hearer did not have intent, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>until</b> both <b>the hearer and the sounder have intent.</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>the sounder</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>in similar fashion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>the hearer.</b> From this it may be inferred that <b>just as the hearer hears for himself,</b> having intent to fulfill his own obligation, <b>so too, the sounder sounds for himself,</b> having intent to fulfill his own obligation, and not that of others. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that if the sounder did not have this intent, the hearer <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. But this indicates that if the sounder had intent to sound the <i>shofar</i> for himself, he need not have intent to sound it for others, therefore contradicting Rabbi Zeira’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The hearer hears for himself, and the sounder sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>in his</b> usual <b>way,</b> i.e., he need not intend to sound it for the sake of the hearer. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It was said in the case of a <b>representative of the community. But</b> in the case of <b>an</b> ordinary <b>individual,</b> the hearer <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>until</b> both <b>the hearer and the sounder have intent</b> to discharge the hearer’s obligation, as argued by Rabbi Zeira.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Incidental to the discussion of the required intent when sounding the <i>shofar</i>, the mishna cites the verse: <b>“And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed;</b> and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed” (Exodus 17:11). It may be asked: <b>Did the hands of Moses make war</b> when he raised them <b>or break war</b> when he lowered them? <b>Rather,</b> the verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>as long as the Jewish people turned their eyes upward and subjected their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they prevailed, but if not, they fell.</b>
<b>Similarly, you can say:</b> The verse states: <b>“Make for yourself a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that everyone that is bitten, when he sees it, he shall live”</b> (Numbers 21:8). Once again it may be asked: <b>Did the serpent kill, or did the serpent preserve life? Rather, when the Jewish people turned their eyes upward and subjected their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they were healed, but if not, they rotted</b> from their snakebites.
Returning to its halakhic discussion, the mishna continues: <b>A deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</b> who sounds the <i>shofar</i> <b>cannot discharge the obligation on behalf of the community. This is the principle</b> with regard to similar matters: <b>Whoever is not obligated to</b> do <b>a</b> certain <b>matter cannot discharge the obligation on behalf of the community.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>All are obligated to sound the <i>shofar</i>: Priests, Levites, and</b> ordinary <b>Israelites; converts; freed slaves; a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> i.e., one whose sexual organs from birth are concealed or are so undeveloped that it is impossible to determine whether the individual is male or female; <b>a hermaphrodite [<i>androginos</i>],</b> i.e., one with both male and female reproductive organs; and a <b>half-slave, half-freeman.</b>
<b>A <i>tumtum</i></b> who sounds the <i>shofar</i> <b>cannot discharge</b> the obligation of <b>one of his kind,</b> i.e., a fellow <i>tumtum</i>, since men are bound by the obligation, whereas women are not, and it is possible that the sounder is female and the hearer is male, <b>nor</b> can he discharge the obligation <b>of one who is not of his kind,</b> an ordinary man or woman. <b>A hermaphrodite can discharge</b> the obligation of <b>one of his kind,</b> a fellow hermaphrodite, since if the sounder is treated as a female, the hearer is also considered a female, <b>but</b> he <b>cannot</b> discharge the obligation of <b>one who is not of his kind. One who is half-slave and half-freeman cannot discharge</b> the obligation of <b>one of his kind,</b> as the slave component of the sounder cannot discharge the obligation of the free component of the hearer, <b>and</b> he certainly <b>cannot</b> discharge the obligation of <b>one who is not of his kind,</b> i.e., a completely free individual.
<b>The Master said</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>All are obligated to sound the <i>shofar</i>: Priests, Levites, and</b> ordinary <b>Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks in astonishment: Isn’t that <b>obvious? If these</b> people <b>are not obligated</b> to perform the mitzva, <b>who</b> then <b>is obligated</b> to perform it?
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to say that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill the mitzva, for <b>it may enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since it is written: “It is a day of sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1), you might have said that with regard to <b>one who</b> is obligated <b>to sound only one day, he is obligated</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are obligated to sound all year</b> long, because they sound trumpets when they offer the sacrifices in the Temple, <b>as it is written: “And you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt-offerings,</b> and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings” (Numbers 10:10), you might <b>say</b> that <b>they are not obligated</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> comes <b>to teach us</b> that this is not true, and that even priests are obligated to fulfill the mitzva.
The Gemara asks: <b>Are these</b> things <b>comparable? There,</b> the priests sound <b>trumpets, and here,</b> we are dealing with the sounding of a <b><i>shofar</i>. Rather, it was necessary</b> to say that priests are obligated to fulfill the mitzva for a different reason, for <b>it may enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since we learned</b> in a mishna: Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana, with regard to</b> both <b>the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts and the</b> additional <b>blessings</b> that are recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer, I might have said: <b>One who is</b> fully included <b>in the mitzva of the Jubilee is</b> also included <b>in the mitzva of Rosh HaShana. But these priests, since they are not</b> fully included <b>in the mitzva of the Jubilee, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Priests and Levites may sell</b> their fields <b>forever and they may</b> also <b>redeem</b> their lands <b>forever,</b> and they are not bound by the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year, I might <b>say</b> that <b>they should</b> also <b>not be obligated to fulfill the mitzva of Rosh HaShana.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> comes <b>to teach us</b> that this is not so, and that even priests are obligated to fulfill the mitzva.
§ It was taught in the same <i>baraita</i>: <b>A half-slave, half-freeman cannot discharge the obligation</b> on behalf of <b>one of his kind, and</b> he certainly <b>cannot</b> discharge the obligation <b>on behalf of one who is not of his kind. Rav Huna said:</b> Even though he cannot discharge the obligation on behalf of others, <b>he can discharge the obligation</b> on behalf of <b>himself.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna: What is the difference</b> whereby he may discharge the obligation on behalf of himself but <b>not on behalf of others?</b> Because his <b>slave component cannot come and discharge the obligation</b> on behalf of <b>the free component</b> of the other. If so, <b>with regard to himself as well, his slave component should not be able to come and discharge the obligation</b> on behalf <b>of his free component.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said: Even on behalf of himself he cannot discharge the obligation.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A half-slave, half-freeman cannot discharge the obligation even for himself.</b>
Continuing the discussion of performing an obligation on behalf of others, <b>Ahava, son of Rabbi Zeira, taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all the blessings, even if one</b> already recited a blessing for himself and has consequently <b>fulfilled</b> his own obligation, <b>he can</b> still recite a blessing for others and thereby <b>discharge</b> their obligation, as all Jews are responsible for one another. This is true with regard to all blessings <b>except for the blessing</b> recited <b>over bread and the blessing</b> recited <b>over wine,</b> both before and after their consumption. With regard to these blessings, <b>if he has not</b> yet <b>fulfilled</b> his own obligation, <b>he can discharge</b> the obligation of others as well, <b>but if he</b> already <b>fulfilled</b> his own obligation, <b>he cannot discharge</b> the obligation of others, as these blessings are recited in appreciation of physical enjoyment, and can only be recited by one who is actually deriving pleasure at the time.
<b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b>

Daf 29b

With regard to <b>the blessing over bread</b> that is recited before eating <b><i>matza</i></b> at the Passover seder <b>and the blessing over wine</b> recited as part <b>of the sanctification of the day</b> of Shabbat or a Festival, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara analyzes the question: Do we say that <b>since there is an obligation</b> to recite these blessings due to the mitzva involved, therefore <b>one can discharge</b> the obligation for others, even if he himself has already fulfilled his obligation? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>the blessing</b> itself <b>is not an obligation,</b> but rather the obligation lies in the eating and drinking, and the blessing is recited over one’s physical enjoyment; therefore, if he already fulfilled his own obligation, he cannot recite the blessing for others, as he derives no pleasure at this time.
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to this question from what <b>Rav Ashi said: When we were</b> studying <b>in the school of Rav Pappi, he would recite <i>kiddush</i> for us, and when his tenants would arrive from the field he would recite <i>kiddush</i></b> once again <b>on their behalf.</b> Therefore, it is clear that one may recite <i>kiddush</i> on behalf of others, including the blessing that is recited over the wine, even if he himself has already fulfilled his own obligation.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One should not break bread</b> and recite a blessing <b>for guests unless he is eating with them,</b> so that he is obligated to recite a blessing for himself. <b>But he may break</b> bread <b>for his children and for</b> the other <b>members of his household</b> and recite the blessing, <b>in order to educate them to</b> perform <b>the mitzvot,</b> so that they know how to recite a blessing. <b>And with regard to <i>hallel</i> and the Scroll</b> of Esther, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>even if he</b> already <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>he can</b> still <b>discharge</b> the obligation of others.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the <b>Festival day of Rosh HaShana that occurs on Shabbat, in the Temple they would sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> as usual. <b>However,</b> they would <b>not</b> sound it <b>in the</b> rest of the <b>country</b> outside the Temple. <b>After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> the people <b>should sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat <b>in every place where there is a court</b> of twenty-three judges. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted</b> this practice <b>only in Yavne,</b> where the Great Sanhedrin of seventy-one judges resided in his time, but nowhere else. <b>They said to him:</b> He instituted the practice <b>both</b> in <b>Yavne and</b> in <b>any place where there is a court.</b>
The mishna adds: <b>And Jerusalem</b> in earlier times <b>had this additional superiority over Yavne</b> after Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted this practice, <b>for</b> in <b>any city whose</b> residents <b>could see</b> Jerusalem <b>and hear</b> the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> from there, <b>and</b> which <b>was near</b> to Jerusalem <b>and</b> people <b>could come</b> to Jerusalem from there, <b>they</b> would <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> there as well, as it was considered part of Jerusalem. <b>But in Yavne they would sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>only in the court</b> itself, not in the surrounding cities.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> are <b>these matters;</b> from where is it derived that the <i>shofar</i> is not sounded on Shabbat? <b>Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: One verse says,</b> with regard to Rosh HaShana: <b>“A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts”</b> (Leviticus 23:24), which indicates that one should merely remember the <i>shofar</i> without actually sounding it. <b>And another verse says: “It is a day of blowing for you”</b> (Numbers 29:1), i.e., a day on which one must actually sound the <i>shofar</i>. This apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> the verse in which the <i>shofar</i> is only being remembered but not sounded, is referring <b>to a Festival that occurs on Shabbat; there,</b> the verse in which the <i>shofar</i> is actually sounded, is referring <b>to a Festival that occurs on a weekday.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> This explanation is difficult, for <b>if</b> the distinction between Shabbat and the rest of the week applies <b>by Torah law, how does one sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat <b>in the Temple?</b> If it is prohibited to sound the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat, it should be prohibited everywhere. <b>And furthermore,</b> there is an additional problem with this explanation: Although the Sages prohibited sounding a <i>shofar</i> and playing other musical instruments on Shabbat, by Torah law sounding a <i>shofar</i> <b>is not a prohibited labor</b> on Shabbat such <b>that a verse is necessary to exclude</b> it when Rosh HaShana occurs on Shabbat.
The Gemara cites a proof for this last claim: <b>As</b> a Sage <b>of the school of Shmuel taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse that prohibits performing prohibited labor on Festivals: <b>“Any prohibited labor of work you shall not perform”</b> (Numbers 29:1). This comes <b>to exclude</b> from the category of prohibited labors <b>the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> and the removal of bread</b> from the oven, each of <b>which is a skill and not a labor,</b> and therefore they are not included in the category of prohibited labor. Apparently, sounding the <i>shofar</i> is not prohibited by Torah law.
<b>Rather, Rava said: By Torah law one is permitted</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana even on Shabbat, <b>and it was the Sages who decreed</b> that <b>it</b> is prohibited. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, as Rabba said: All are obligated to sound the <i>shofar</i></b> on Rosh HaShana, <b>but not all are experts in sounding the <i>shofar</i>.</b> Therefore, the Sages instituted <b>a decree</b> that the <i>shofar</i> should not be sounded on Shabbat, <b>lest one take</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>in his hand and go to an expert to learn</b> how to sound it or to have him sound it for him, <b>and</b> due to his preoccupation <b>he</b> might <b>carry it four cubits in the public domain,</b> which is a desecration of Shabbat.
The Gemara comments: <b>And this is</b> also <b>the reason for</b> the rabbinical decree that <b>the palm branch</b> [<b><i>lulav</i></b>] may not be taken on Shabbat, <b>and this is</b> likewise <b>the reason for</b> the decree that <b>the Megilla</b> of Esther may not be read on Shabbat. The Sages were concerned that one might carry the <i>lulav</i> or the Megilla four cubits in the public domain to take it to an expert who will teach him the proper manner to perform these mitzvot.
§ The mishna taught: <b>After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> the people should sound the <i>shofar</i> even on Shabbat in every place where there is a court of twenty-three judges. The background to this decree is related in greater detail in a <i>baraita</i>, as <b>the Sages taught: Once Rosh HaShana occurred on Shabbat, and all the cities gathered</b> at the Great Sanhedrin in Yavne for the Festival prayers. <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to the sons of Beteira,</b> who were the leading halakhic authorities of the generation: <b>Let us sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, as in the Temple. <b>They said to him: Let us discuss</b> whether or not this is permitted.
<b>He said to them:</b> First <b>let us sound</b> it, <b>and afterward,</b> when there is time, <b>let us discuss</b> the matter. <b>After they sounded</b> the <i>shofar</i>, the sons of Beteira <b>said to</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>Let us</b> now <b>discuss</b> the issue. <b>He said to them: The horn has already been heard in Yavne, and one does not refute</b> a ruling <b>after action</b> has already been taken. There is no point in discussing the matter, as it would be inappropriate to say that the community acted erroneously after the fact.
§ The mishna further stated that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted</b> this practice <b>only in Yavne. They said to him:</b> He instituted the practice <b>both</b> in <b>Yavne and</b> in <b>any place where there is a court.</b> The Gemara asks: This last statement of the Rabbis: <b>They said to him,</b> etc.; <b>is</b> the same as the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna. Why did the mishna repeat this opinion?
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and the opinion of the Rabbis who issued that last statement is with regard to <b>a temporary court,</b> i.e., one that is not fixed in a certain place. According to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, the <i>shofar</i> is sounded there as well, whereas according to the opinion of the Rabbis who responded to Rabbi Elazar, the <i>shofar</i> is sounded only in a place where there is a permanent court, similar to that in Yavne.
§ The mishna taught that <b>they said to him:</b> He instituted the practice <b>both</b> in <b>Yavne and</b> in <b>any place where there is a court. Rav Huna said:</b>

Daf 30a

<b>And</b> they would sound the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat <b>with the court.</b> Rav Huna’s brief statement is obscure, and therefore the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>With the court?</b> It means: <b>In the presence of the court,</b> i.e., in the place where the court convenes. This comes <b>to exclude</b> any place that is <b>not in the presence of the court, as</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>not</b> sounded there.
§ <b>Rava raised an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>And Jerusalem had this additional superiority over Yavne. What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>And this additional? If we say</b> that it is referring only to <b>that which it teaches</b> in the mishna, <b>it should have</b> simply said: <b>This,</b> without mentioning that it is an additional superiority. <b>Rather,</b> it indicates <b>that in Jerusalem</b> even private <b>individuals sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat, whereas <b>in Yavne individuals do not sound</b> it, but only agents of the court.
<b>And</b> this too is difficult: <b>Don’t individuals sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>in Yavne? But when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: When the prayer leader completed the sounding</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>in Yavne, nobody could hear the sound of</b> his own voice in <b>his ears due to the noise of the sounding of individuals.</b> After the leader of the congregation finished sounding on behalf of the entire community, many individuals would take out their <i>shofars</i> and blast them, which created a loud noise. This indicates that individuals would sound the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat even in Yavne.
<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> the case <b>that in Jerusalem they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>both when the court</b> was in session, i.e., until midday, <b>and when the court</b> was <b>not</b> in session. <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>in Yavne, when the court</b> was in session, <b>yes,</b> they would sound the <i>shofar</i>, whereas <b>when the court</b> was <b>not</b> in session, <b>no,</b> they would not sound it. If so, this indicates that <b>when the court</b> was in session <b>they would in any case sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> in Yavne, <b>even</b> though this was <b>not in the presence of the court.</b> This contradicts Rav Huna’s opinion that in Yavne they would sound the <i>shofar</i> only in the presence of the court.
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>No,</b> the term additional can be explained to mean <b>that whereas in Jerusalem they</b> would <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat <b>both in the presence of the court and not in the presence of the court,</b> with regard <b>to Yavne, in the presence of the court, yes,</b> they would indeed sound it, but if it was <b>not in the presence of the court, no,</b> they would not sound the <i>shofar</i>.
§ <b>Some teach this</b> statement <b>of Rav Huna</b> not with regard to this mishna, but rather <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> that deals with the Jubilee Year. <b>As it is written: “On Yom Kippur you shall proclaim with the <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land”</b> (Leviticus 25:9). This <b>teaches that each and every individual is obligated to sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>. In this connection <b>Rav Huna said: And</b> they sound it <b>with the court.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>With the court?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>When the court</b> is in session. This serves <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>when the court</b> is <b>not</b> in session, <b>that</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>not</b> sounded.
<b>Rava raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The sounding</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>on Rosh HaShana and</b> on Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year overrides</b> the prohibitions of <b>Shabbat</b> even <b>in the outlying areas</b> outside the Temple, <b>every man and his house.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>Every man and his house? If we say</b> that it means, as usual: Every <b>man and his wife, is a woman obligated</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i>? <b>Isn’t</b> sounding the <i>shofar</i> <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva,</b> i.e., one that can be performed only at a certain time of the day, or during the day rather than during the night, or only on certain days of the year? <b>And</b> the principle is that with regard to <b>any positive, time-bound mitzva, women are exempt.</b>
<b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that this phrase means: <b>Every man in his house, and even</b> at a time <b>when the court</b> is <b>not</b> in session? This presents a difficulty for the opinion of Rav Huna. The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No; actually</b> it means that every man may sound the <i>shofar</i> in his house, but only <b>at a time when the court</b> is in session.
<b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana with regard to</b> both the <i>shofar</i> <b>sounding and the</b> additional <b>blessings</b> recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>However,</b> the difference is <b>that on</b> Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>both in the court where they sanctified the month and in a court where they did not sanctify the month, and each and every individual is obligated to sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>. Conversely, <b>on Rosh HaShana they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>only in the court where they sanctified the month, and each and every individual is not obligated to sound</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the clause: <b>Each and every individual is not obligated to sound</b> it? <b>If we say that on</b> Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year individuals sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>whereas on Rosh HaShana individuals do not sound</b> it at all, this is difficult: <b>But when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: When the prayer leader completed the sounding</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>in Yavne, nobody could hear the sound of</b> his own voice in <b>his ears due to the noise of the sounding of individuals.</b> This indicates that individuals would sound the <i>shofar</i> even on Rosh HaShana.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that <b>whereas on</b> Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>both when the court</b> is in session <b>and when the court</b> is <b>not</b> in session, <b>on Rosh HaShana, when the court</b> was in session, <b>yes,</b> they would indeed sound it, but <b>at a time when the court</b> was <b>not</b> in session, <b>no,</b> they would not sound the <i>shofar</i>. <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that <b>on</b> Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year</b> they would sound the <i>shofar</i> <b>both when the court</b> was in session <b>and when the court</b> was <b>not</b> in session. This presents a difficulty for the opinion of Rav Huna.
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>No; actually</b> they sound the <i>shofar</i> only <b>when the court</b> was in session, <b>and this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: On</b> Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year, when the court</b> was in session <b>they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>both in the presence of the court and not in the presence of the court;</b> however, <b>on Rosh HaShana they sound</b> it only <b>when the court</b> was in session, <b>and</b> even then only <b>in the presence of the court. It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: They sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>only throughout</b> the period <b>when the court is sitting</b> in session, and only in its presence.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raised a dilemma:</b> If the members of the court <b>stirred</b> themselves <b>to rise</b> at the end of the session, but there was some delay <b>and they did not</b> actually <b>rise, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we require</b> that <b>the court</b> be <b>seated, and that is</b> the case here, as the judges are still sitting? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded <b>when</b> the <b>court</b> is in session, <b>and that is not</b> the case, as they have stirred to rise. No relevant sources were found in this regard, and therefore the Gemara states that the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna stated: <b>And Jerusalem had this additional superiority over Yavne.</b> Any city that could see Jerusalem and hear the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> there, and was nearby, and people could come from there, they would sound the <i>shofar</i> there as well. The Gemara clarifies these requirements: The clause that the city had to be able to <b>see</b> Jerusalem comes to <b>exclude</b> a city <b>that sits in</b> a deep <b>valley,</b> from which one can hear but cannot see Jerusalem from afar.
When the mishna states that the city must be able to <b>hear,</b> this serves to <b>exclude</b> a city <b>sitting on a mountaintop,</b> from where one can see Jerusalem but cannot hear sounds from it. As for the requirement that the city must be <b>near,</b> this comes to <b>exclude</b> a place <b>sitting beyond</b> the Shabbat <b>limit</b> of Jerusalem, even if one can see and hear from that place. <b>And</b> with regard to the statement that one <b>can come,</b> this serves to <b>exclude</b> a city <b>that is separated</b> from Jerusalem <b>by a river,</b> which renders it impossible for people to come to the city, even if it is close by.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After the previous mishna mentioned Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s ordinance that applies to the sounding of the <i>shofar</i>, this mishna records other ordinances instituted by the same Sage: <b>At first,</b> during the Temple era, <b>the <i>lulav</i> was taken in the Temple</b> all <b>seven</b> days of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>and in the</b> rest of the <b>country</b> outside the Temple, it was taken only <b>one day,</b> on the first day of the Festival. <b>After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the <i>lulav</i> should be taken</b> even <b>in the</b> rest of the <b>country</b> all <b>seven</b> days, in <b>commemoration of the Temple.</b>
<b>And</b> for similar reasons, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted <b>that</b> for <b>the entire day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering, i.e., the sixteenth of Nisan, eating the grain of the new crop <b>is prohibited.</b> By Torah law, when the Temple is standing the new grain may not be eaten until after the <i>omer</i> offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan, usually early in the morning. When the Temple is not standing it may be eaten from the time that the eastern horizon is illuminated at daybreak. However, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted a prohibition against eating the new grain throughout the entire sixteenth of Nisan, until the seventeenth, to commemorate the Temple.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that one performs</b> actions in <b>commemoration of the Temple? As the verse states: “For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, said the Lord; because they have called you an outcast: She is Zion, there is none who care for her”</b> (Jeremiah 30:17). This verse teaches <b>by inference that</b> Jerusalem <b>requires caring</b> through acts of commemoration.
§ The mishna taught: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai also instituted <b>that</b> for <b>the entire day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering, eating the grain of the new crop <b>is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this ordinance? The reasoning is that <b>soon the Temple will be rebuilt and</b> people <b>will say: Last year,</b> when the Temple was in ruins, <b>didn’t we eat</b> from the new crop <b>as soon as the eastern</b> horizon <b>was illuminated</b> on the morning of the sixteenth of Nisan, as the new crop was permitted immediately? <b>Now too, let us eat</b> the new grain at that time.
<b>And they do not know that last year,</b> when <b>there was no <i>omer</i>, the eastern</b> horizon <b>illuminating,</b> i.e., the morning of the sixteenth of Nisan, served to <b>permit</b> the consumption of the new grain immediately. However, <b>now that</b> the Temple has been rebuilt and <b>there is an <i>omer</i></b> offering, it is <b>the <i>omer</i></b> that <b>permits</b> the consumption of the new grain. When the Temple is standing, the new grain is not permitted until the <i>omer</i> offering has been sacrificed.
The Gemara clarifies: In this scenario, <b>when</b> is it <b>that</b> the Temple was <b>built? If we say that it was rebuilt on the sixteenth</b> of Nisan, then the Temple was not standing in the morning and therefore <b>the eastern</b> horizon <b>illuminating</b> indeed rendered eating the new grain <b>permitted,</b> as it was not yet possible to bring the <i>omer</i> offering.
<b>Rather,</b> you must say <b>that it was rebuilt on the fifteenth</b> of Nisan or on some earlier date, in which case the new grain would not become permitted by the illumination of the eastern horizon. In that scenario, <b>from midday onward let it be permitted</b> to eat the new grain, <b>as didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: The people <b>distant</b> from Jerusalem, who are unaware of the precise time when the <i>omer</i> was brought, <b>are permitted</b> to eat the new grain <b>from midday onward, because the</b> members of the <b>court are not indolent with regard to</b> the <i>omer</i> offering and would certainly have sacrificed it by midday. If so, now too, it should be permitted to eat the new grain beginning at that time. Why did Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai prohibit it for the entire day?
The Gemara answers: This ordinance <b>was necessary only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the Temple <b>was rebuilt on the fifteenth adjacent to sunset. Alternatively,</b> in a situation <b>where</b> the Temple <b>was rebuilt at night,</b> on the evening of the sixteenth, and there was no opportunity to cut the <i>omer</i> that night. In either case there is insufficient time to complete all the preparations so that the offering can be sacrificed by noon the next day. If people eat the new grain at midday, they will have retroactively transgressed a prohibition. Therefore, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the new grain should be prohibited for the entire day of the sixteenth.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> That is not the reason. Rather, <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b>

Daf 30b

<b>stated</b> his decree <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> When the verse states: “And you shall eat neither bread nor parched corn, nor fresh stalks, <b>until this selfsame [<i>etzem</i>] day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14), this does not teach that it is permitted to eat the new grain on the morning of the sixteenth when the eastern horizon is illuminated. Rather, it is prohibited <b>until the essence [<i>atzmo</i>] of the day. And he holds</b> that when the verse says: <b>Until</b> that day, it means <b>until and including</b> this date. If so, by Torah law, eating the new grain is permitted only after the conclusion of the sixteenth, unless the <i>omer</i> offering was sacrificed, in which case it is permitted to eat the new grain immediately afterward.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>But he disagrees with him, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 41a): <b>After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> for <b>the entire day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering, eating the grain of the new crop <b>is prohibited. Rabbi Yehuda said: But isn’t it prohibited by Torah law, as it is written: “Until this selfsame day”?</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>There, it was Rabbi Yehuda who erred</b> in his understanding. <b>He thought</b> that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai was saying</b> that eating new grain on the sixteenth of Nisan is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law. But that is not so; he was</b> actually <b>saying</b> that it is prohibited <b>by Torah law.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But it is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Instituted.</b> This term is referring to a rabbinic ordinance, not a Torah law. The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term <b>instituted?</b> It means that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>interpreted</b> the verse, <b>and instituted</b> that this is how one should act from now onward. When the Temple was standing there was no need for this <i>halakha</i>, as it was permitted to eat the new grain after the sacrificing of the <i>omer</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Initially, they would accept testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month</b> throughout <b>the entire</b> thirtieth <b>day</b> from the beginning of the month of Elul, before Rosh HaShana, and if witnesses arrived from afar and testified that they had sighted the New Moon the previous night, they would declare that day the Festival.
<b>Once, the witnesses tarried coming</b> until the hour was late, <b>and the Levites erred with regard to the song,</b> i.e., the psalm that they were supposed to recite, as they did not know at the time whether it was a Festival or an ordinary weekday. From that point on, the Sages <b>instituted that they would accept</b> testimony to determine the start of the month <b>only until <i>minḥa</i></b> time. If witnesses had not arrived by that hour, they would declare Elul a thirty-day month and calculate the dates of the Festivals accordingly.
<b>And if witnesses came from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> although the calculations for the dates of the Festivals would begin from the following day, the people would nevertheless <b>observe that day,</b> on which the witnesses arrived, as <b>sacred,</b> so that in future years they would not treat the entire day as a weekday and engage in labor from the morning on the assumption that the witnesses will arrive only after <i>minḥa</i> time. <b>And</b> they would also observe <b>the following day</b> as <b>sacred.</b> On the second day, they observed Rosh HaShana in full, both by sacrificing its offerings as well as by calculating the upcoming Festivals from that date.
<b>After the Temple was destroyed</b> and there was no longer any reason for this ordinance, <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that they would</b> once again <b>accept testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month the entire day.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What error did the Levites make with regard to the song</b> they were supposed to recite? The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted that they did not recite any song at all,</b> as they did not know which psalm should be sung, the one for an ordinary weekday or the special one for the Festival. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Their mistake was <b>that they recited the song of</b> an ordinary <b>weekday with the daily afternoon offering.</b> After the witnesses testified, it became clear that they should have recited the psalm of the Festival.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to his son Ahava: Go out</b> and <b>teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>to</b> the Sages of Babylonia: <b>They instituted that</b> on Rosh HaShana the court <b>would accept testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month only if there was</b> enough <b>time left in the day to sacrifice the daily offerings and the additional offerings</b> of the Festival <b>and their libations, and to recite the</b> appropriate <b>song without a mistake. Granted, if you say</b> that <b>they recited the song of</b> an ordinary <b>weekday, this is</b> a case in <b>which there is a mistake. However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not recite</b> any psalm <b>at all, what mistake is there?</b> The term: Mistake, indicates the performance of an incorrect action.
The Gemara explains: <b>Since they did not recite</b> any psalm <b>at all, you do not have a mistake greater than this.</b> The failure to recite the appropriate psalm disrupts the entire sacrificial service.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the daily offering on Rosh HaShana,</b> in <b>the morning it is sacrificed in accordance with its</b> regular <b><i>halakhot</i>,</b> i.e., the Levites recite the regular psalm for that day of the week. When it comes <b>to the additional offering</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite?</b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength; shout to the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:2). With regard <b>to the</b> daily <b>afternoon</b> offering, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite?</b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness”</b> (Psalms 29:8).
<b>And when Rosh HaShana occurs on a Thursday, whose</b> regular <b>psalm</b> even on an ordinary weekday <b>is: “Sing aloud to God our strength,”</b> and the witnesses came before the daily morning offering was sacrificed, <b>one would not recite: “Sing aloud</b> to God our strength; shout to the God of Jacob” <b>with the</b> daily <b>morning</b> offering, <b>because one goes back and repeats that section</b> at the time of the additional offering.
<b>Rather, what does one recite? “I removed his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7), which is referring to Joseph, who was set free from prison on Rosh HaShana. In other words, the second half of Psalm 81 was recited with the morning offering, while the first half was recited with the additional offering. <b>And if the witnesses came</b> on a Thursday <b>after the daily morning offering</b> had already been sacrificed, <b>one recites: “Sing aloud</b> to God” at the additional offering, <b>even though</b> this means <b>that one goes back and repeats that section</b> again. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains the objection from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>anywhere there is a doubt</b> with regard to what to say, <b>one recites the song of</b> an ordinary <b>weekday, this is</b> the meaning of <b>that which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>states: One recites</b> the psalm for an ordinary weekday <b>and</b> then <b>repeats it. However, if you say</b> that in a case of doubt <b>no</b> psalm <b>is recited at all, what is</b> the meaning of the clause: <b>One recites it and repeats it?</b>

Daf 31a

The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>It is different there, as</b> in any case “Sing aloud” <b>is the psalm of the day,</b> either because it was an ordinary Thursday or because it was Rosh HaShana. However, there is no proof from here that in all uncertain cases they would recite the psalm for an ordinary weekday, as it is possible that they did not recite any psalm at all.
§ The Gemara expands on the topic of the daily psalms recited by the Levites. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Akiva: On the first</b> day of the week, Sunday, <b>what</b> psalm <b>would</b> the Levites <b>recite?</b> The psalm beginning with the phrase: <b>“The earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness”</b> (Psalms 24:1), in commemoration of the first day of Creation, <b>because</b> on that day <b>He acquired</b> the world <b>and transferred</b> it to man, <b>and</b> He <b>was</b> the only <b>ruler in His world,</b> as the angels were not created until the second day.
<b>On the second</b> day of the week <b>what</b> psalm <b>would</b> the Levites <b>recite?</b> The psalm that begins: <b>“Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised</b> in the city of our God, His sacred mountain” (Psalms 48:2). This is <b>because</b> on the second day of Creation <b>He separated His works,</b> dividing between the upper waters and the lower waters, <b>and ruled over them</b> as King; and this psalm speaks of Jerusalem as “The city of a great King” (Psalms 48:3).
<b>On the third</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“God stands in the congregation of God”</b> (Psalms 82:1), <b>because</b> on the third day of Creation <b>He revealed the land in His wisdom and</b> thereby <b>prepared the world for His assembly</b> that could now live on the dry land. <b>On the fourth</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“O Lord God, to Whom vengeance belongs”</b> (Psalms 94:1), <b>because</b> on the fourth day of Creation <b>He created the sun and the moon, and in the future He will punish</b> and take vengeance upon <b>those who worship them.</b>
<b>On the fifth</b> day of the week the Levites <b>would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength”</b> (Psalms 81:2), <b>because</b> on the fifth day of Creation <b>He created birds and fish to praise His name. On the sixth</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty”</b> (Psalms 93:1), <b>because</b> on that day <b>He completed His labor and ruled over</b> all of creation in full glory. <b>On the seventh</b> day of the week, Shabbat, <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat”</b> (Psalms 92:1), <b>as</b> the future world will be <b>a day that is all Shabbat.</b>
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya said: What did the Sages see</b> that led them <b>to distinguish between these chapters,</b> as they interpret the psalms recited on the six weekdays as referring to the past, whereas the psalm recited on Shabbat is referring to the future. <b>Rather,</b> all of the psalms refer to the past. The first six are as explained above: <b>On the first</b> day, the reason is <b>that He acquired</b> the world <b>and transferred</b> it to man, <b>and</b> He <b>was</b> the only <b>ruler in His world; on the second</b> day, the reason is <b>that He separated His works and ruled over them</b> as King; <b>on the third</b> day, the reason is <b>that He revealed the land in His wisdom and</b> thereby <b>prepared the world for His assembly.</b>
<b>On the fourth</b> day, the reason is <b>that He created the sun and the moon, and in the future He will punish those who worship them; on the fifth</b> day, the reason is <b>that He created birds and fish to praise His name; on the sixth</b> day, the reason is <b>that He completed His labor and ruled over</b> all of creation. However, <b>on the seventh</b> day, the reason is <b>that He rested</b> from His work, as the phrase “A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat” is referring to the first Shabbat of Creation.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with</b> regard to a statement <b>of Rav Ketina, as Rav Ketina said: The world will exist for six thousand years, and</b> for <b>one</b> thousand years it will be <b>destroyed, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day”</b> (Isaiah 2:11), and one day for God is a thousand years, as indicated in the verse: “For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it is past” (Psalms 90:4). Rav Ketina’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Conversely, <b>Abaye said:</b> The world will be <b>destroyed</b> for <b>two</b> thousand years, <b>as it is stated: “After two days He will revive us”</b> (Hosea 6:2). According to the opinion of Abaye that the destruction will be for two days, there is no connection between the future world and the day of Shabbat, which is only one day.
§ The Gemara further asks: When it came <b>to the additional offerings of Shabbat, what would</b> the Levites <b>recite? Rav Anan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> They would recite in accordance with the mnemonic <b><i>hei</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>kaf</i>.</b> They would divide the song of <i>Ha’azinu</i> into six sections, each of which began with a letter of the mnemonic: “Give ear [<i>ha’azinu</i>], you heavens” (Deuteronomy 32:1); “Remember [<i>zekhor</i>] the days of old” (Deuteronomy 32:7); “He made him ride [<i>yarkivehu</i>] on the high places of the earth” (Deuteronomy 32:13); “The Lord saw it [<i>vayar</i>] and spurned” (Deuteronomy 32:19); “Were it not [<i>lulei</i>] that I dread the enemy’s provocation” (Deuteronomy 32:27); “For <i>[ki]</i> the Lord will judge His people” (Deuteronomy 32:36).
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: In the manner that</b> the verses of the song of <i>Ha’azinu</i> <b>are divided here</b> for the recitation of the additional offerings of Shabbat in the Temple, <b>so too are they divided</b> when they are read <b>in the synagogue</b> on Shabbat.
The Gemara asks another question: When it came <b>to the</b> daily <b>afternoon offering on Shabbat, what would</b> the Levites <b>recite? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Then sang</b> Moses” (Exodus 15:1), <b>and: “Who is like You”</b> (Exodus 15:11), the two halves of the Song of the Sea, <b>and: “Then Israel sang</b> this song” (Numbers 21:17), the entire Song of the Well.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does <b>one recite all these</b> sections of the song of <i>Ha’azinu</i> <b>on each Shabbat, or perhaps on each and every Shabbat</b> they would <b>recite one</b> section? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: By</b> the time <b>that</b> those who recite <b>the first</b> set, i.e., the verses for the additional offerings brought on Shabbat, <b>recite</b> it <b>once,</b> those who recite <b>the second</b> set, for the daily afternoon offering, would <b>repeat</b> their cycle <b>twice,</b> as the first set was comprised of six sections, whereas the second set included only three sections. <b>Learn from here</b> that <b>each and every Shabbat they would recite</b> only <b>one</b> section. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is correct.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Divine Presence traveled ten journeys,</b> i.e., it left the Temple and Eretz Yisrael in ten stages at the time of the destruction of the First Temple, as derived <b>from verses. And corresponding to them the Sanhedrin was exiled</b> in ten stages at the end of the Second Temple period and after the destruction of the Temple, and this is known <b>from tradition.</b>
The Gemara elaborates. <b>The Divine Presence traveled ten journeys,</b> as derived <b>from verses.</b> The ten journeys are: <b>From the Ark cover to the cherub; and from</b> one <b>cherub to</b> the other <b>cherub; and from</b> the second <b>cherub to the threshold</b> of the Sanctuary; <b>and from the threshold to the courtyard; and from the courtyard to the altar; and from the altar to the roof; and from the roof to the wall</b> of the Temple Mount; <b>and from the wall to the city; and from the city to a mountain</b> close to Jerusalem; <b>and from</b> that <b>mountain to the wilderness; and from the wilderness it ascended and rested in its place</b> in Heaven, isolated from humanity, <b>as it is stated: “I will go and return to My place”</b> (Hosea 5:15).
The Gemara cites the sources for each of these stages: <b>From the Ark cover</b> the Divine Presence traveled <b>to the cherub,</b> and <b>from</b> one <b>cherub to</b> the other <b>cherub, and from the</b> second <b>cherub to the threshold, as it is written</b> with regard to Moses in the Tabernacle: <b>“And there I will meet with you, and I will speak to you from above the Ark cover,</b> from between the two cherubs” (Exodus 25:22). <b>And it is written: “And He rode upon a cherub, and flew”</b> (II Samuel 22:11), which indicates that the glory of the Divine Presence can rest upon one cherub. <b>And it is written: “And the glory of the God of Israel had ascended from the cherub, on which it was, to the threshold of the House”</b> (Ezekiel 9:3), i.e., the Divine Presence moved from the cherub to the threshold.
<b>And from the threshold</b> of the Sanctuary the Divine Presence went <b>to the courtyard, as it is written: “And the House was filled with the cloud and the courtyard was full of the brightness of the Lord’s glory”</b> (Ezekiel 10:4). <b>From the courtyard to the altar, as it is written: “I saw the Lord standing on the altar”</b> (Amos 9:1). <b>And from the altar to the roof, as it is written: “It is better to dwell in a corner of the roof</b> than in a house together with a contentious woman” (Proverbs 21:9). <b>From the roof to the wall, as it is written: “And behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb line”</b> (Amos 7:7). <b>From the wall to the city, as it is written: “The Lord’s voice cries to the city”</b> (Micah 6:9).
<b>And from the city</b> the Divine Presence arose <b>to the mountain</b> nearest the Sanctuary, i.e., the Mount of Olives, <b>as it is written: “And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain, which is on the east side of the city”</b> (Ezekiel 11:23). <b>And from the mountain to the wilderness, as it is written: “It is better to live in the wilderness</b> than with a contentious and fretful woman” (Proverbs 21:19). <b>And from the wilderness it ascended and rested in its place</b> in Heaven, <b>as it is written: “I will go and return to My place</b> until they acknowledge their guilt” (Hosea 5:15).
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> For <b>six months the Divine Presence lingered in the wilderness,</b> waiting <b>for the Jewish people,</b> hoping that <b>perhaps they would repent</b> and it would be able to return to its place. <b>When they did not repent,</b> the Divine Presence <b>said: Let them</b> despair and <b>be lost, as it is stated: “But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee, and their hope shall be the drooping of the soul”</b> (Job 11:20). This concludes the discussion of the ten stages of the exile of the Divine Presence from the Holy of Holies.
<b>And corresponding to</b> these ten stages, <b>the Sanhedrin was exiled</b> in ten stages at the end of the Second Temple period and after the destruction of the Temple, and this is known <b>from tradition: From the Chamber of Hewn Stone,</b> its fixed seat in the Temple, <b>to <i>Ḥanut</i>,</b> literally, shop, a designated spot on the Temple Mount outside the Temple proper; <b>and from <i>Ḥanut</i> to Jerusalem; and from Jerusalem to Yavne;</b>

Daf 31b

<b>and from Yavne to Usha; and from Usha</b> it returned <b>to Yavne; and from Yavne</b> it went back <b>to Usha; and from Usha to Shefaram; and from Shefaram to Beit She’arim; and from Beit She’arim to Tzippori; and from Tzippori to Tiberias. And Tiberias is lower than all of them,</b> as it is in the Jordan Valley. A verse alludes to these movements, <b>as it is stated: “And brought down, you shall speak out of the ground”</b> (Isaiah 29:4).
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> There are <b>six exiles,</b> if you count only the places, not the number of journeys, and a different verse alludes to this, <b>as it is stated: “For He has brought down those who dwell high, the lofty city laying it low, laying it low, to the ground, bringing it to the dust”</b> (Isaiah 26:5). This verse mentions six expressions of lowering: Brought down, laying it low, laying it low, to the ground, bringing it, and to the dust. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And from there,</b> i.e., from their lowest place of descent, <b>they are destined to be redeemed</b> in the future, <b>as it is stated: “Shake yourself from the dust, arise, sit,</b> Jerusalem” (Isaiah 52:2).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: And this, too, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted, that even</b> if <b>the head of the court</b> of seventy-one <b>is in any</b> other <b>place,</b> not where the Great Sanhedrin is in session, <b>the witnesses should</b> nevertheless <b>go only to the place</b> where the Great Sanhedrin <b>gathers</b> to deliver testimony to determine the start of the month. Although the date of the month is dependent on the head of the Great Sanhedrin, as it is he who declares that the month is sanctified (see 24a), nevertheless, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the members of the Great Sanhedrin may sanctify the month in the absence of the head of the court.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who was called to judgment before Ameimar in Neharde’a. Ameimar</b> temporarily <b>went to Meḥoza, and she did not follow him</b> to be judged there. <b>He wrote a document of excommunication [<i>petiḥa</i>] concerning her,</b> for disobeying the court. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Even</b> if <b>the head of the court</b> of seventy-one <b>is in any</b> other <b>place, the witnesses should go only to the place</b> where the Great Sanhedrin <b>gathers?</b> This shows that one must appear in the court itself, rather than follow the head of the court.
Ameimar <b>said to him: This applies only to testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month,</b> for which it is necessary to have a fixed place. The reason is <b>that if so,</b> if the witnesses come to court when the head of the court is absent and they will have to go to another place, <b>consequently you will be obstructing them for future</b> occasions, as they will consider it too much trouble and perhaps they will not come the next time. Therefore, the Sages said that these witnesses should go to the regular place where the Great Sanhedrin meets. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to monetary claims, the verse states: <b>“The borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7), i.e., the defendant must act as is convenient to the claimant and the court.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Priests are not allowed to ascend with their sandals to the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Blessing in the synagogue. <b>And this is one of the nine ordinances that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted. Six</b> are mentioned <b>in this chapter:</b> Sounding the <i>shofar</i> on Shabbat in Yavne, taking the <i>lulav</i> all seven days, the prohibition against eating new grain the entire day of waving, accepting testimony to determine the start of the month all day, having the witnesses to the New Moon go to the place of meeting, and reciting the Priestly Blessing without sandals. <b>And one</b> is stated <b>in the first chapter,</b> that the witnesses to the New Moon may desecrate Shabbat only for the months of Tishrei and Nisan.
<b>And the other, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A convert who converts nowadays is required to set aside a quarter</b>-shekel <b>for his nest,</b> i.e., his pair of doves. By Torah law a convert must bring two burnt-offerings of birds, in addition to his immersion and circumcision. After the destruction, it was instituted that he must set aside the value of two young pigeons in anticipation of the rebuilding of the Temple. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabban Yoḥanan</b> ben Zakkai <b>already</b> assembled a majority who <b>voted and rescinded</b> the ordinance <b>due to</b> a potential <b>mishap.</b> If a convert is obligated to set aside money, someone might unwittingly use this money, thereby violating the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property.
<b>And the other</b> ordinance, the ninth, <b>is</b> the subject of <b>a dispute between Rav Pappa and Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak. Rav Pappa said:</b> The ordinance concerned the fruit of a <b>fourth-year grapevine. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It was with regard to <b>the strip of crimson</b> wool.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the ordinance is referring to the fruit of <b>a fourth-year grapevine, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Beitza</i> 5a): The fruit of <b>a fourth-year grapevine</b> has the status of second-tithe fruits, and therefore their owner <b>would ascend to Jerusalem</b> and eat the grapes there. If he is unable to do so, due to the distance involved or the weight of the load, he may redeem the fruits with money where he is, and later redeem that money for other fruits in Jerusalem. However, the Sages decreed that fruit from the environs of Jerusalem should not be redeemed; rather, the owners should bring the fruit itself to Jerusalem. The environs of Jerusalem for this purpose were defined as <b>a day’s walk in each direction. And this is its boundary: Eilat to the north, Akrabat to the south, Lod to the west, and the Jordan</b> river <b>to the east.</b>
<b>And Ulla said, and some say Rabba bar Ulla</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> For <b>what reason</b> did the Sages institute this ordinance, that one who lives near Jerusalem must bring his fruit there? <b>In order to adorn the markets of Jerusalem with fruit,</b> as this decree ensures that there is always an abundance of fruit in Jerusalem.
<b>And it was</b> further <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Hyrcanus, a student of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, <b>had a fourth-year grapevine</b> located between Lod and Jerusalem, <b>to the east</b> of <b>Lod alongside the village of Tavi.</b> The vine was within the boundaries of Jerusalem for the purpose of this <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Eliezer could not bring the fruit to the Temple, as the Temple had been destroyed, <b>and Rabbi Eliezer sought to render</b> the fruit <b>ownerless</b> in favor <b>of the poor,</b> for whom it would be worth the effort to bring the fruit to Jerusalem.
<b>His students said to him:</b> Our <b>teacher,</b> there is no need to do so, as <b>your colleagues have already voted on</b> the matter <b>and permitted it,</b> as after the destruction of the Temple there is no need to adorn the markets of Jerusalem. The Gemara explains: <b>Who are: Your colleagues?</b> This is referring to <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The ordinance was with regard to <b>the strip of crimson</b> wool used on Yom Kippur. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first they would tie a strip of crimson</b> wool <b>to the opening of the Entrance Hall</b> of the Temple <b>on the outside.</b> If, after the sacrificing of the offerings and the sending of the scapegoat, the strip <b>turned white,</b> the people <b>would rejoice,</b> as this indicated that their sins had been atoned for. If <b>it did not turn white they would be sad.</b> When the Sages saw that people were overly distressed on Yom Kippur, <b>they instituted that they should tie</b> the strip of crimson wool <b>to the opening of the Entrance Hall on the inside,</b> where only a few could enter to see it.
<b>But</b> people <b>would still peek and see</b> it, and once again, if <b>it turned white they would rejoice,</b> and if <b>it did not turn white they would be sad.</b> Therefore, the Sages <b>instituted that they should tie half of</b> the strip <b>to a rock</b> near the place where the one who sent the scapegoat stood <b>and half of it between the horns of the scapegoat,</b> so that the people would not know what happened to the strip until after the conclusion of Yom Kippur. This ordinance was instituted by Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.
The Gemara explains this dispute: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak did not state</b> his opinion with regard to the ordinance <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa? He</b> could have <b>said to you: If it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> rescinded the ordinance of the fruit of fourth-year grapevines, <b>was he</b> one of <b>Rabbi Eliezer’s colleagues,</b> that the students would have referred to him in this manner? <b>He was his teacher.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan cannot be the one who instituted this ordinance. <b>And the other,</b> Rav Pappa, what would he respond to this? He would say that <b>since they were</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s <b>students</b> it is <b>not proper conduct</b> for one <b>to say to his teacher: Your teacher.</b> Therefore, they referred to Rabbi Yoḥanan as Rabbi Eliezer’s colleague.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Pappa did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak?</b> Rav Pappa could have <b>said to you: If it enters your mind</b> to say that this ordinance for Yom Kippur was instituted by <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, in the days of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai was there</b> in fact <b>a strip of crimson</b> wool? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All the years of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s</b> life were <b>120 years: Forty years he was involved in business</b> so that he could achieve financial independence and study Torah, <b>forty years he studied</b> Torah, and <b>forty years he taught</b> Torah.
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the forty years before the</b> Second <b>Temple was destroyed the strip of crimson</b> wool <b>would not turn white; rather,</b> it would <b>turn</b> a deeper shade of <b>red. And we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>When the Temple was destroyed Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted</b> his ordinances. This shows that Rabban Yoḥanan lived and taught Torah after the destruction. Therefore the ordinance of the crimson wool must have been made while Rabban Yoḥanan was still studying Torah, before he instituted any ordinances. The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, what would he answer? According to him, that ordinance was instituted during <b>those forty years that he studied</b> Torah. He <b>was</b> then <b>a student sitting before his teacher, and he said a matter,</b> i.e., he suggested this ordinance, <b>and his reasoning made sense</b> to the Sages,

Daf 32a

<b>and his teacher established it in his name.</b> Consequently, it is counted as one of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s ordinances.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The order of the blessings</b> of the additional prayer on Rosh HaShana is as follows: <b>One recites</b> the blessing of <b>the Patriarchs,</b> the blessing of God’s <b>Mighty Deeds, and</b> the blessing of <b>the Sanctification of</b> God’s <b>Name,</b> all of which are recited all year long. <b>And one includes</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship,</b> containing many biblical verses on that theme, <b>with them,</b> i.e., in the blessing of the Sanctification of God’s Name, <b>and he does not sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> after it.
Next, one adds a special blessing for <b>the Sanctification of the Day, and sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> after it; followed by the blessing of <b>Remembrances,</b> which contains many biblical verses addressing that theme, <b>and sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> after it; and recites the blessing of <b><i>Shofarot</i>,</b> which includes verses that mention the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> after it. <b>And</b> he then returns to the regular <i>Amida</i> prayer and <b>recites</b> the blessing of God’s <b>Service and</b> the blessing of <b>Thanksgiving and the Priestly Blessing.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If one does not sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship, why does he mention</b> it? <b>Rather,</b> the order of the blessings is as follows: One <b>recites</b> the blessing of <b>the Patriarchs and</b> that of God’s <b>Mighty Deeds and</b> that of <b>the Sanctification of</b> God’s <b>Name. He</b> subsequently <b>includes</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship in</b> the blessing of <b>the Sanctification of the Day, and sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i>. Next he recites the blessing of <b>Remembrances, and sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> after it, and the blessing of <b><i>Shofarot</i> and sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> after it. <b>He</b> then <b>recites</b> the blessing of God’s <b>Service and</b> the blessing of <b>Thanksgiving and the Priestly Blessing.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If one does not sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for the</b> blessing of <b>Kingship, why does he mention</b> it? The Gemara expresses surprise at this question: <b>Why does he mention</b> it? <b>The Merciful One states</b> that one should <b>mention</b> it. It is a mitzva to recite the blessing of Kingship, regardless of the sounding of the <i>shofar</i>. <b>Rather,</b> this is what Rabbi Akiva meant: <b>Why</b> does one mention <b>ten</b> verses of Kingship, as in the other blessings? <b>Let him recite nine</b> verses or fewer. <b>Since</b> the blessing <b>is different</b> in that it is not followed by <i>shofar</i> blasts, <b>let it</b> also <b>be different</b> with regard to the number of verses it includes.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one recites</b> the blessing of the <b>Patriarchs? As it is stated: “Ascribe to the Lord, O you sons of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 29:1), which is interpreted to mean that one should mention before God the greatness of the mighty, i.e., the righteous Patriarchs. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one recites</b> the blessing of God’s <b>Mighty Deeds? As it is stated: “Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength”</b> (Psalms 29:1). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one recites</b> the blessing of the <b>Sanctification</b> of God’s Name? <b>As it is stated: “Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to His name; worship the Lord in the beauty of sanctity”</b> (Psalms 29:2).
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> on Rosh HaShana <b>one recites</b> the blessings of <b>Kingship, Remembrances, and <i>Shofarot</i>? Rabbi Eliezer says: As it is written:</b> “In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have <b>a solemn rest, a memorial of blasts, a sacred convocation”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). This verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“A solemn rest,” this</b> is referring to the blessing of <b>the Sanctification of the Day; “a memorial,” this is Remembrances; “blasts,” this is <i>Shofarot</i>; “a sacred convocation”</b> this means <b>sanctify it by</b> abstaining from <b>performing</b> prohibited <b>labor.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>For what</b> reason <b>isn’t it stated</b> instead that the phrase <b>“solemn rest”</b> teaches that one must <b>rest</b> by abstaining from prohibited labor, as this is the term <b>with which the verse opened first.</b> It stands to reason that the verse would begin with the main issue, i.e., that this day is a Festival on which performing labor is prohibited. <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be explained as follows: <b>“A solemn rest,” sanctify it by</b> abstaining from <b>performing</b> prohibited <b>labor; “a memorial,” this is Remembrances; “blasts,” this is <i>Shofarot</i>; “a sacred convocation,” this is the Sanctification of the Day.</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>that one recites</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship? It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One verse states: <b>“I am the Lord your God”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), which is referring to God’s Kingship over the world; <b>and</b> two verses later it states: <b>“In the seventh month”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). <b>This</b> teaches that God’s <b>Kingship</b> must be mentioned on Rosh HaShana.
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says:</b> This is <b>not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your New Moons, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; <b>that they may be to you for a remembrance before your God:</b> I am the Lord your God” (Numbers 10:10). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “I am the Lord your God,” and</b> therefore <b>what</b> is the meaning <b>when the verse states: “I am the Lord your God”? This is a paradigm</b> that <b>in all places where</b> verses of <b>Remembrances are stated,</b> verses of <b>Kingship should be</b> recited <b>with them.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the issue discussed in the mishna: <b>And where does one recite the Sanctification of the Day? It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One recites it with the</b> blessing of <b>Kingship,</b> in the fourth blessing. He explains: <b>Just as we find in all</b> other <b>places</b> that the Sanctification of the Day is mentioned <b>in the fourth</b> blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>so too here,</b> it is recited <b>in the fourth</b> blessing.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One recites it</b> together <b>with</b> the blessing of <b>Remembrances,</b> in the fifth blessing. He explains: <b>Just as we find in all</b> other <b>places</b> that the Sanctification of the Day is mentioned <b>in the middle</b> blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, e.g., on Shabbat, when it is the fourth of seven blessings, <b>so too here,</b> it is recited <b>in the middle</b> blessing, which in the case of Rosh HaShana is the fifth blessing, as the Rosh HaShana <i>Amida</i> prayer is comprised of nine blessings.
§ <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> relates that <b>when the court sanctified the year in Usha, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka descended</b> as the prayer leader <b>in the presence of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and he acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Nuri</b> by including the blessing of Kingship in the blessing of the Sanctification of God’s Name. <b>Rabban Shimon said to him: They were not accustomed</b> to act in <b>this</b> manner <b>in Yavne. On the second day, Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, descended</b> as the prayer leader, <b>and he acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> by including the blessing of Kingship in the blessing of the Sanctification of the Day. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: This is</b> how <b>they were accustomed</b> to act <b>in Yavne.</b>
The Gemara asks a question concerning this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is that to say that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva? But didn’t Rabbi Akiva say</b> that <b>one recites</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship with</b> the blessing of <b>the Sanctification of the Day, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that one recites</b> the blessing of <b>the Sanctification of the Day with</b> the blessing of <b>Remembrances?</b> Why then did Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel indicate his agreement with Rabbi Akiva’s practice? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel merely meant <b>to say</b> that he agrees <b>that one sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> together <b>with</b> the blessing of <b>Kingship,</b> and that this was how they were accustomed to act in Yavne.
The <i>baraita</i> taught that <b>on the second day Rabbi Ḥanina descended</b> as the prayer leader. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>The second</b> day? <b>If we say</b> that this is referring to <b>the second day of the Festival day</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>is that to say that they rendered Elul a full</b> month, so that the thirtieth day of Elul was the first day of Rosh HaShana and the first day of Tishrei was the second day? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana say: From the days of Ezra onward we have not found that</b> the month of <b>Elul was</b> ever <b>rendered full.</b> If so, it is difficult to believe that a case of this kind occurred in the time of the <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>The second</b> day? It means <b>on the second day,</b> the next time it was Rosh HaShana, i.e., on Rosh HaShana <b>of the following year.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One does <b>not</b> recite <b>fewer than ten</b> verses in the blessing of <b>Kingship,</b> or fewer <b>than ten</b> verses in the blessing of <b>Remembrances,</b> or fewer <b>than ten</b> verses in the blessing of <b><i>Shofarot</i>. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: If one recited three from each of them, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>These ten</b> verses of <b>Kingship, to what do they correspond? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> They <b>correspond to the ten praises that David said in the book of Psalms.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>There are many</b> more <b>praises</b> than that in the book of Psalms. The Gemara answers that he means <b>those</b> in <b>which it is written by them: “Praise Him with the blast of the <i>shofar</i>”</b> (Psalms 150:3). In that chapter the phrase “Praise Him” appears ten times.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The ten verses <b>correspond to the Ten Commandments, which were said to Moses at Sinai. Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> They <b>correspond to the ten utterances through which the world was created.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Which are these</b> ten utterances? The Gemara explains: This is referring to the ten times that the phrase <b>“And He said”</b> appears in the story of Creation in the first two chapters of Genesis.
The Gemara asks: Does it refer to the repetition of the phrase: <b>“And He said” in Genesis? There are</b> only <b>nine</b> such phrases, not ten. The Gemara answers that the phrase <b>“In the beginning” is also</b> considered <b>an utterance, as it is written: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made”</b> (Psalms 33:6), which indicates that all of creation came into existence through a single utterance, after which all matter was formed into separate and distinct entities by means of the other nine utterances.
§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: If one recited three from each of them, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> he <b>teaching</b> here? Does Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri mean that one must recite <b>three</b> verses <b>from the Torah, three from the Prophets, and three from the Writings, which are nine</b> in total, <b>and</b> if so <b>the</b> practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and the first <i>tanna</i> is only <b>one</b> verse? <b>Or perhaps</b> he means that one must recite <b>one</b> verse <b>from the Torah and one from the Prophets and one from the Writings, which are three</b> altogether, <b>and the</b> practical difference <b>between them is a large</b> number of verses, i.e., seven.
The Gemara clarifies this matter: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One does <b>not</b> recite <b>fewer than ten</b> verses of <b>Kingship,</b> or fewer <b>than ten</b> verses of <b>Remembrances,</b> or fewer <b>than ten</b> verses of <b><i>Shofarot</i>. And if one recited seven from each of them, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as they <b>correspond to the seven firmaments</b> in heaven.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: One who</b> recites <b>fewer</b> than the requisite ten should <b>not</b> recite <b>fewer than seven, but if he recited three from each of them he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as they <b>correspond to the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings. And some say:</b> They <b>correspond to the priests, the Levites, and the Israelites.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri means a total of three verses for each blessing. <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not mention</b> verses of <b>Remembrance, Kingship, and <i>Shofar</i></b> that have a theme <b>of punishment.</b> When reciting the ten verses, <b>one begins with</b> verses from the <b>Torah and concludes with</b> verses from <b>the Prophets. Rabbi Yosei says: If he concluded with</b> a verse from <b>the Torah, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.

Daf 32b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites examples of verses that may not be used in Rosh HaShana prayers because they deal with punishment. With regard to verses of <b>Kingship, for example: “As I live, says the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I be King over you”</b> (Ezekiel 20:33). <b>And although Rav Naḥman said</b> about this verse: With regard to <b>any anger like this, let the Holy One, blessed be He, express</b> that <b>anger upon us and let Him redeem us,</b> if that is the process necessary for redemption, <b>since</b> the verse <b>was said with anger</b> it is not included, as <b>one does not mention anger on Rosh HaShana.</b>
Similarly, verses of <b>remembrance</b> that speak of a punishment may not be used in Rosh HaShana prayers, <b>for example: “So He remembered that they were but flesh,</b> a wind that passes away, and does not come again” (Psalms 78:39). Nor verses of <b><i>shofar</i>,</b> which refer to calamity, <b>for example: “Sound the <i>shofar</i> in Giva,</b> and the trumpet in Rama; sound an alarm at Beit Aven, behind you, O Benjamin” (Hosea 5:8).
The Gemara qualifies the mishna’s ruling. <b>However, if one comes to recite</b> verses of <b>Kingship, remembrance, and <i>shofar</i></b> with a theme <b>of the punishment of gentiles, one may recite</b> them. The Gemara offers examples of these verses: With regard to the verses of <b>Kingship, for example: “The Lord reigns, let the peoples tremble”</b> (Psalms 99:1), <b>and, for example: “The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land”</b> (Psalms 10:16). With regard to <b>remembrance, for example: “Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom</b> the day of Jerusalem, who said: Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation” (Psalms 137:7). With regard to the verses of <b><i>shofar</i>, for example: “And the Lord God will sound the</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>and will go with whirlwinds of the south”</b> (Zechariah 9:14), <b>and it is written: “The Lord of hosts will defend them”</b> (Zechariah 9:15), i.e., God will defend the Jewish people against their enemies.
The Gemara states: <b>One does not recite</b> a verse dealing with <b>the remembrance of an individual, even</b> if it is <b>for good, for example: “Remember me, O Lord, when You show favor to Your people”</b> (Psalms 106:4), <b>and, for example: “Remember me, my God, for good”</b> (Nehemiah 5:19).
Verses that mention God’s <b>revisitings [<i>pikdonot</i>] are</b> equivalent <b>to</b> verses of <b>remembrances [<i>zikhronot</i>],</b> and therefore they may be counted in the ten verses. <b>For example: “And the Lord revisited [<i>pakad</i>] Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21:1), <b>and, for example: “I have surely revisited [<i>pakadeti</i>] you”</b> (Exodus 3:16). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: They are not</b> equivalent <b>to</b> verses of <b>remembrances.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, although</b> verses that speak <b>of</b> God <b>revisiting</b> man <b>are</b> equivalent <b>to</b> verses of <b>remembrances,</b> he cites the following verse as an example: <b>“And the Lord revisited Sarah,”</b> which <b>is a revisiting of an individual.</b> Despite the fact that it was stated above that a remembrance must refer to the collective, <b>since many</b> descendants <b>came from her,</b> as Sarah is the mother of the Jewish people, <b>she is</b> considered <b>like many.</b> Therefore, this verse is effectively dealing with the remembrance of the entire Jewish people.
The Gemara discusses several verses from Psalms. <b>“Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle”</b> (Psalms 24:7–8). The psalm continues: <b>“Lift up your heads, O you gates, and lift them up, you everlasting doors; that the King of glory may come in. Who then is the King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory, Selah”</b> (Psalms 24:9–10). <b>The first</b> section is counted as <b>two</b> verses of Kingship, as the term king is mentioned twice, while <b>the second</b> section <b>is</b> counted as <b>three</b> verses of Kingship; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The first</b> section is counted as only <b>one</b> verse of Kingship, as the question: “Who is the King of glory,” is not considered a verse of Kingship. By the same reasoning, <b>the second</b> section is counted as only <b>two</b> verses of Kingship.
Similarly, the Gemara discusses the following verses: <b>“Sing praises to God, sing praises, sing praises to our King, sing praises. For God is the King of all the earth;</b> sing praises in a skillful song” (Psalms 47:7–8). These are counted as <b>two</b> verses of Kingship; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> They count as only <b>one</b> verse of Kingship, as the phrase: “Sing praises to our King,” is referring to God as the King of the Jewish people, not the King of the entire world. <b>And they</b> both <b>agree</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“God reigns over the nations, God sits upon His sacred throne”</b> (Psalms 47:9), <b>that it is</b> considered as only <b>one</b> verse of Kingship, as the phrase: “Sits upon His sacred throne,” is not referring to God explicitly as King.
With regard to a verse of <b>remembrance that</b> also <b>has</b> a mention of <b>sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>for example: “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts, a sacred convocation”</b> (Leviticus 23:24), <b>one may recite it with the</b> verses of <b>remembrances, and</b> one <b>may</b> also <b>recite it with the</b> verses of <b><i>shofarot</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may recite it only with the</b> verses of <b>remembrances alone,</b> as it does not explicitly mention a <i>shofar</i>.
With regard to a verse of <b>Kingship that</b> also <b>has</b> a mention of <b>sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>for example: “The Lord his God is with him, and the sounding of a king is among them”</b> (Numbers 23:21), <b>one may recite it with</b> the verses of <b>Kingship and</b> one may also <b>recite it with</b> the verses of <b><i>shofarot</i>;</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may recite it only with</b> the verses <b>of Kingship.</b>
With regard to a verse that mentions <b>sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>that has nothing</b> else <b>with it,</b> i.e., no mention of remembrances, Kingship, or an actual <i>shofar</i>, <b>for example: “It is a day of sounding the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1), <b>one may recite it with</b> the verses of <b><i>shofarot</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not recite it at all,</b> as it contains no explicit mention of a <i>shofar</i>.
§ The mishna taught: When reciting the ten verses, <b>one begins with</b> verses from <b>the Torah and concludes with</b> verses from <b>the Prophets. Rabbi Yosei says: If he concluded with</b> a verse from <b>the Torah, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara notes that Rabbi Yosei’s formulation: <b>If he concluded,</b> indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> he has fulfilled his obligation; <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> he has not fulfilled his obligation to recite the necessary verses. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One who concludes</b> the series of verses <b>with</b> a verse from <b>the Torah is praiseworthy?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the text of the mishna must be modified so that it reads: Rabbi Yosei says: <b>He concludes</b> with a verse from the Torah, i.e., one should do so <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach: If he concluded?</b> This indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> one has fulfilled his obligation; <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> he has not fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: One begins with</b> verses from <b>the Torah and concludes with</b> a single verse from <b>the Prophets. Rabbi Yosei says: One concludes with</b> a single verse from <b>the Torah, and if he concluded with</b> a single verse from <b>the Prophets he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Pious individuals [<i>vatikin</i>],</b> who were scrupulous in their performance of mitzvot, <b>would conclude</b> the series <b>with</b> a single verse from <b>the Torah.</b> Presumably, Rabbi Elazar followed the opinion of his father, Rabbi Yosei.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is possible to conclude <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i></b> with a verse from the Torah, as <b>there are many</b> such verses. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Kingship, there are</b> only <b>three: “The Lord his God is with him, and the sounding of a king is among them”</b> (Numbers 23:21); <b>“And he was king in Jeshurun”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:5); <b>and: “The Lord shall reign for ever and ever”</b> (Exodus 15:18). <b>And we require ten</b> verses, <b>and</b> according to Rabbi Yosei <b>there are not</b> enough, as he maintains that one should recite four verses from the Torah, the first three and the concluding one.
<b>Rav Huna said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from that which was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> (2:11): The verse: <b>“Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4), is a verse of <b>Kingship;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: It is not</b> a verse of <b>Kingship.</b>
<b>“Know this day, and lay it to your heart, that the Lord, He is God</b> in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath; <b>there is none else”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:39), is a verse of <b>Kingship;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>not</b> a verse of <b>Kingship. “To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:35), is a verse of <b>Kingship;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: It is not</b> a verse of <b>Kingship.</b> This shows that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei there are sufficient verses of Kingship in the Torah to recite three at the beginning and one at the end.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who is passing before the ark,</b> as prayer leader, <b>on the festival of Rosh HaShana,</b> it is <b>the second</b> prayer leader, i.e., the one who leads the additional prayer, who <b>sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> on behalf of the congregation. <b>And</b> on a day <b>when the <i>hallel</i></b> is recited, <b>the first</b> prayer leader, i.e., the one who leads the morning prayer, <b>recites the <i>hallel</i></b> on behalf of the congregation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the <b>second</b> prayer leader, that he <b>sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> during the additional prayer? Is it <b>due to</b> the principle <b>that: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28)? In other words, is the <i>shofar</i> sounded during the additional prayer because all of the congregants will have arrived by then? <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b><i>hallel</i> too, let us say</b> that it should be read <b>by the second</b> prayer leader, <b>due to</b> the principle <b>that “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people.”</b>
<b>Rather, what is different</b> about <b><i>hallel</i> that</b> it is recited <b>by the first</b> prayer leader? It is <b>due to</b> the principle <b>that the vigilant are early</b> in the performance of <b>mitzvot.</b> This is also difficult. With regard to the <b>sounding</b> of the <i>shofar</i>, <b>too, let us perform</b> it by means <b>of the first</b> prayer leader, <b>due to</b> the principle <b>that the vigilant are early</b> in the performance of <b>mitzvot.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>shofar</i> is sounded during the additional prayer <b>in a time of</b> religious <b>persecution.</b> The gentile authorities prohibited sounding the <i>shofar</i> and appointed guards during the morning to ensure that the Jews comply. Therefore, the Sages delayed the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> until after the guards had left. A similar decree was not imposed against the recitation of <i>hallel</i>, and therefore it was recited during the morning prayer, at the earliest possible time.
§ The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact that the mishna <b>states: When <i>hallel</i></b> is recited, one can conclude <b>by inference that on Rosh HaShana there is no</b> recitation of <b><i>hallel</i>. What is the reason</b> that <i>hallel</i> is omitted on Rosh HaShana? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, for what</b> reason <b>don’t the Jewish people recite songs</b> of praise, i.e., <i>hallel</i>, <b>before You on Rosh HaShana and on Yom Kippur? He said to them:</b> Is it <b>possible that</b> while <b>the King is sitting on the throne of judgment and the books of life and the books of death are open before Him, the Jewish people are reciting</b> joyous <b>songs</b> of praise? Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur are somber days of judgment whose mood is incompatible with the recitation of <i>hallel</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the <i>shofar</i> of Rosh HaShana, one may not pass</b> the Shabbat <b>limit for it,</b> i.e., to go and hear it, <b>nor may one clear a pile</b> of rubble to uncover a buried <i>shofar</i>. <b>One may not climb a tree, nor may one ride on an animal, nor may one swim in water,</b> in order to find a <i>shofar</i> to sound.<b> And one may not cut</b> the <i>shofar</i> to prepare it for use, <b>neither with an object that is prohibited due to a rabbinic decree nor with an object that</b> may not be used <b>due to a prohibition</b> by Torah law. <b>However, if one wishes to place water or wine into</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana so that it emits a clear sound, <b>he may place it,</b> as this does not constitute a prohibited labor.
<b>One</b> need <b>not prevent children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana, despite the fact that they are not obligated in mitzvot. <b>Rather, one occupies</b> himself <b>with them,</b> encouraging and instructing them, <b>until they learn</b> how to sound it properly. The mishna adds: <b>One who acts unawares</b> and sounds the <i>shofar</i> without any intention to perform the mitzva <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And,</b> similarly, <b>one who hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts <b>from one who acts unawares has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: There is a principle that a positive mitzva overrides a negative mitzva. With this in mind, <b>what is the reason</b> that one may not perform a prohibited labor on Rosh HaShana to fulfill the positive mitzva of sounding the <i>shofar</i>? The Gemara answers: Sounding the <b><i>shofar</i> is a positive mitzva, but</b> performing prohibited labor on <b>a Festival</b> violates both <b>the positive mitzva</b> to rest <b>and the prohibition</b> against performing prohibited labor, <b>and a positive mitzva does not override</b> both <b>a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b>
§ The mishna taught: One may not pass the Shabbat limit for it, i.e., to go and hear it, nor may one clear a pile of rubble to uncover a buried <i>shofar</i>. <b>One may not climb a tree, nor may one ride on an animal</b> to find a <i>shofar</i> to sound. The Gemara questions the order of these prohibitions: <b>Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that to sound the <i>shofar</i> one <b>may not</b> perform an action that is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law,</b> i.e., passing the Shabbat limit or clearing a pile of rubble, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that one may not perform an action that could lead to an act prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> i.e., climbing a tree or riding an animal? The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>teaches</b> employing the style: <b>This, and it is unnecessary to say that.</b> It begins with the more novel case before moving on to the more straightforward one.

Daf 33a

§ The mishna stated: <b>One may not cut</b> the <i>shofar</i> if it needs to be prepared, <b>neither with an object that is prohibited due to a rabbinic decree nor with an object</b> that may not be used <b>due to</b> a Torah <b>prohibition.</b> The Gemara explains: An example of an object prohibited <b>due to a rabbinic decree</b> is <b>a sickle,</b> which is not ordinarily used for preparing a <i>shofar</i>; an example of an object that may not be used due to <b>a prohibition</b> by Torah law is <b>a knife.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that to sound the <i>shofar</i> <b>one may not</b> perform an action that is prohibited <b>due to rabbinic law, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that one may not perform an action that violates <b>a prohibition</b> by Torah law? The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>teaches</b> employing the style: <b>This, and it is unnecessary to say that.</b>
§ The mishna continues. <b>However, if one wishes to place water or wine into</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana, so that it should emit a clear sound, <b>he may place it.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Water or wine, yes,</b> one may insert these substances into a <i>shofar</i>. However, <b>urine,</b> whose acidity is good for the <i>shofar</i>, <b>no.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is Abba Shaul, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> With regard to <b>water or wine,</b> one is <b>permitted</b> to pour these liquids into a <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana <b>in order to make</b> its sound <b>clear.</b> However, with regard to <b>urine,</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> to do so <b>due to the respect</b> that must be shown to the <i>shofar</i>. Although urine is beneficial, it is disrespectful to place it in a <i>shofar</i>, which serves for a mitzva.
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>One</b> need <b>not prevent children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana. The Gemara infers: If <b>women</b> wish to sound the <i>shofar</i>, <b>one</b> indeed <b>prevents</b> them from doing so. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one does not prevent women or children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>on a Festival?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult: This</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel…</b>and he shall place his hands upon the head of the burnt-offering” (Leviticus 1:2–4). The phrase “children of Israel” literally means sons of Israel, and this teaches that <b>the sons of Israel place</b> their hands upon offerings, <b>but the daughters of Israel do not place</b> their hands upon offerings; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> It is <b>optional</b> for <b>women</b> to <b>place</b> their hands on the head of an offering before it is slaughtered, although they are not obligated to do so. Apparently, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon, if a woman wishes to perform any mitzva that is not obligatory for her, she is permitted to do so. Here too, one does not prevent a woman from sounding the <i>shofar</i>.
§ The mishna further states: <b>Rather, one occupies</b> himself <b>with them,</b> encouraging and instructing children, <b>until they learn</b> how to sound it properly. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This applies <b>even</b> when Rosh HaShana occurs <b>on Shabbat. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One occupies</b> himself <b>with</b> children <b>until they learn</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> properly, <b>even on Shabbat. And one does not prevent the children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>on Shabbat, and needless to say</b> one does not prevent them <b>on</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana that occurs on a weekday.
The Gemara asks: <b>This matter itself is difficult,</b> i.e., there is an internal contradiction in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>You said</b> that <b>one occupies</b> himself <b>with</b> the children <b>until they learn</b> how to sound the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and</b> this applies <b>even on Shabbat. Apparently, we say to them <i>ab initio</i>: Sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>. <b>And then</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: One does not prevent</b> them from sounding the <i>shofar</i>, which indicates that although <b>one does not prevent them</b> from sounding it, <b>we do not say <i>ab initio</i>: Sound</b> it.
The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b>

Daf 33b

in the first clause, the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a minor who has reached</b> the age of <b>training</b> in mitzvot. This child is taught to sound the <i>shofar</i>, as one is obligated to teach him the proper way to perform mitzvot. However, <b>here,</b> in the second clause, the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a minor who has not</b> yet <b>reached</b> the age of <b>training.</b> Although one need not prevent this child from sounding the <i>shofar</i>, one does not encourage him to do so.
§ The mishna taught: <b>One who acts unawares</b> while sounding the <i>shofar</i>, without any intention to produce a sound, <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara infers: <b>One who sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for music,</b> even if he has no intention to perform the mitzva, <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, as Rava said: One who sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for music has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara rejects this suggestion. There is no clear proof from here, as <b>perhaps one who sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for music is also called</b> one who <b>acts unawares.</b> It is possible that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna includes in this category anyone who sounds the <i>shofar</i> without a clear intention to fulfill the mitzva.
§ The mishna continues. <b>And one who hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts <b>from one who acts unawares has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>However, one who hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts <b>from one who is sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for himself,</b> without intention of sounding it for others, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The mishna apparently indicates that <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira said to his attendant: Have the intention</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> on my behalf <b>and sound</b> it <b>for me.</b> This statement indicates that one must have the intention to enable the one who hears it to fulfill his obligation.
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>Perhaps</b> one can explain that <b>since</b> the <b>first clause</b> of the mishna <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who acts unawares, the latter clause also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who acts unawares.</b> If so, no inference may be drawn from here to the case of one who sounds the <i>shofar</i> for himself, with no intention of doing so for others.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The order of the blasts</b> is <b>three</b> sets <b>of three</b> blasts <b>each,</b> which are: <i>Tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, and <i>tekia</i>. <b>The length of a <i>tekia</i></b> is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>three <i>teruot</i>,</b> and <b>the length of a <i>terua</i></b> is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>three whimpers.</b> If <b>one sounded the first</b> <i>tekia</i> of the initial series of <i>tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, <i>tekia</i>, <b>and</b> then <b>extended the second</b> <i>tekia</i> of that series <b>to</b> the length of <b>two</b> <i>tekiot</i>, so that it should count as both the second <i>tekia</i> of the first set and the first <i>tekia</i> of the second set, <b>he has in his hand</b> the fulfillment of <b>only one</b> <i>tekia</i>, and he must begin the second set with a new <i>tekia</i>.
With regard to <b>one who recited the blessings</b> of the additional prayer, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward a <i>shofar</i> became available to him, he sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>, <b>sounds</b> a <i>terua</i>, <b>and sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>, an order he repeats <b>three times.</b>
<b>Just as the prayer leader is obligated</b> in the prayer of Rosh HaShana, <b>so too, each and every individual is obligated</b> in these prayers. <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> Individuals are not obligated, as <b>the prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty. Although the mishna taught that the length of a <i>tekia</i> is equal to the length of three <i>teruot</i>, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the length of a</b> single <b><i>tekia</i> is equal to</b> the length of an entire <b><i>terua</i>,</b> which is comprised of several shorter sounds? <b>Abaye said:</b> There is no difficulty. <b>The <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna <b>counts the <i>tekia</i> of all the sets</b> of blasts <b>and the <i>teruot</i> of all the sets.</b> He means that the length of the three <i>tekiot</i> is equal to the length of the three <i>teruot</i>. Conversely, <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>the <i>baraita</i> counts</b> the first <i>tekia</i> of only <b>one set, and no more,</b> and therefore he simply states that the length of one <i>tekia</i> is equal to the length of one <i>terua</i>.
§ The mishna continues. <b>The length of a <i>terua</i></b> is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>three whimpers.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the length of a <i>terua</i></b> is equal <b>to</b> the length of <b>three <i>shevarim</i>,</b> i.e., broken blasts, which presumably are longer than whimpers?
<b>Abaye said: In this</b> matter, the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>certainly disagree.</b> Although the first <i>baraita</i> can be reconciled with the mishna, this second <i>baraita</i> clearly reflects a dispute. <b>As it is written: “It is a day of sounding [<i>terua</i>]</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1), <b>and we translate</b> this verse in Aramaic as: <b>It is a day of <i>yevava</i> to you. And</b> to define a <i>yevava</i>, the Gemara quotes a verse that <b>is written about the mother of Sisera: “Through the window she looked forth and wailed [<i>vateyabev</i>], the mother of Sisera”</b> (Judges 5:28). One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that this means <b>moanings,</b> broken sighs, as in the blasts called <i>shevarim</i>. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>holds</b> that it means <b>whimpers,</b> as in the short blasts called <i>teruot</i>.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the soundings of Rosh HaShana must be performed <b>with a <i>shofar</i>? The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make proclamation with the <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land” (Leviticus 25:9).
From this <b>I have</b> derived the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to Yom Kippur <b>of the Jubilee Year. From where</b> do I derive that the soundings of <b>Rosh HaShana</b> must also be with a <i>shofar</i>? <b>The verse states: “Of the seventh month.” Since</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “Of the seventh month,”</b> as it already states: “On the Day of Atonement,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Of the seventh month”?</b> This comes to teach <b>that all</b> the obligatory <b>soundings of the seventh month must be similar to one another.</b>
This verse states: “The blast [<i>terua</i>] of the <i>shofar</i>,” indicating that one must sound a <i>terua</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>terua</i> sound <b>is preceded by a straight blast,</b> i.e., a <i>tekia</i>? <b>The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i> [<i>shofar terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:9), indicating that the <i>terua</i> must be preceded by the basic sound of a <i>shofar</i>, i.e., by the straight blast of a <i>tekia</i>. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>terua</i> sound <b>is followed by a straight blast? The</b> same <b>verse states</b> again: <b>“You shall make proclamation with the <i>shofar</i>,”</b> which indicates that there must be another <i>tekia</i> after the <i>terua</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> continues. From this <b>I have</b> derived the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> that these <i>tekia</i> blasts before and after the <i>terua</i> must be sounded on Yom Kippur <b>of the Jubilee Year. From where</b> do I derive that they must be sounded <b>on Rosh HaShana</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “Of the seventh month.”</b>

Daf 34a

<b>Since</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “Of the seventh month,”</b> as it already states: “On the Day of Atonement,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Of the seventh month”?</b> This serves to teach <b>that all</b> soundings of the <i>shofar</i> <b>of the seventh month must be similar to one another.</b>
<b>And from where</b> is it derived that there must be <b>three</b> sets <b>of three</b> blasts <b>each? The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> [<b><i>shofar terua</i></b>]”(Leviticus 25:9); and another verse states: <b>“A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24); and a third verse states: <b>“It is a day of sounding [<i>terua</i>] the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1). <i>Terua</i> is mentioned three times in these verses, and a <i>terua</i> is always preceded and followed by a <i>tekia</i>.
Since one of these verses deals with Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year, while two of them deal with Rosh HaShana, the Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to apply what is said about that</b> verse <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> verse <b>to that</b> one? With regard to Rosh HaShana, <b>the verse states:</b> “Of the <b>seventh</b> month” (Leviticus 25:9), and with regard to Yom Kippur the verse likewise states: “In the <b>seventh</b> month” (Leviticus 23:24). It is derived <b>by verbal analogy</b> that any <i>shofar</i> blasts sounded on one of these days must also be sounded on the other. Consequently, on each day one must sound three sets of <i>tekia-terua-tekia</i>.
<b>How so?</b> How does one actually perform the sounding of the <i>shofar</i>? One sounds <b>three</b> sets of three blasts each, <b>which</b> altogether <b>are nine</b> separate blasts. <b>The length of a <i>tekia</i> is equal to</b> the length of <b>a <i>terua</i>,</b> and <b>the length of a <i>terua</i></b> is equal <b>to</b> the length of <b>three <i>shevarim</i>.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>This <i>tanna</i> initially derives</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>from juxtaposition,</b> based on the phrase: “Of the seventh month,” which teaches that every sounding of the <i>shofar</i> in the seventh month must be alike. <b>And now he derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one sounds three <i>tekia</i>-<i>terua</i>-<i>tekia</i> sets <b>by verbal analogy</b> from the recurrence of the term “seventh.” How can the <i>tanna</i> change his method of derivation in the very same <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: If</b> there were <b>no verbal analogy, I would have derived</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>by juxtaposition. Now that it is derived through a verbal analogy, the juxtaposition is not necessary.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the following <b><i>tanna</i> derives this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>by verbal analogy from</b> the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> in <b>the wilderness, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“And you shall sound [<i>utekatem</i>] a <i>terua</i>”</b> (Numbers 10:5), indicates that <b>a <i>tekia</i> is its own</b> sound <b>and a <i>terua</i> is its own</b> sound. Do <b>you say</b> that <b>a <i>tekia</i> is its own</b> sound <b>and a <i>terua</i> is its own</b> sound? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>is it only that a <i>tekia</i> and a <i>terua</i> are one</b> and the same, i.e., the two terms are synonymous? <b>When it says: “But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall sound a <i>tekia</i> [<i>titke’u</i>], but you shall not sound a <i>terua</i> [<i>tari’u</i>]”</b> (Numbers 10:7), <b>you must say</b> that <b>a <i>tekia</i> is its own</b> sound <b>and a <i>terua</i> is its own</b> sound.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a <i>terua</i> <b>is preceded by a straight blast,</b> i.e., a <i>tekia</i>? <b>The verse states: “And you shall sound [<i>utekatem</i>] a <i>terua</i>”</b> (Numbers 10:5), which indicates that one must first sound a <i>tekia</i> and then a <i>terua</i>. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a <i>terua</i> is <b>followed by a straight blast? The verse states: “A <i>terua</i> you shall sound [<i>titke’u</i>]”</b> (Numbers 10:6), i.e., first a <i>terua</i> and then a <i>tekia</i>.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> This derivation <b>is not necessary,</b> as the verse <b>states: “And you shall sound [<i>utekatem</i>] a <i>terua</i> a second time”</b> (Numbers 10:6). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “A second time,”</b> since it is clear from the context that this is the second <i>terua</i>, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A second time?” This is a paradigm</b> of the principle <b>that</b> in <b>all places where it is stated <i>terua</i>, a <i>tekia</i> should be second to it. I have</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>only in the wilderness. From where</b> do I derive that the same applies <b>to Rosh HaShana? The verse states “<i>terua</i>”</b> with regard to the wilderness, and the verse states <b>“<i>terua</i>”</b> with regard to Rosh HaShana. This comes to teach <b>by verbal analogy</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of one applies to the other.
<b>And three <i>teruot</i> are stated</b> with regard <b>to Rosh HaShana: “A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24); “It is <b>a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i> [<i>terua</i>]</b> to you” (Numbers 29:1); <b>“Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i> [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:9). <b>And</b> there are <b>two <i>tekiot</i> for each and every one</b> of the <i>teruot</i>, one before and one after.
Consequently, <b>we are found to have learned</b> that <b>three <i>teruot</i> and six <i>tekiot</i> are stated</b> with regard <b>to Rosh HaShana. Two</b> of the <i>teruot</i> are required <b>by the statement of the Torah and one by the statement of the Sages,</b> i.e., based on the verses but not derived directly from them. How so? <b>“A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts [<i>terua</i>]”</b> and <b>“Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> [<b><i>terua</i></b>]”; these apply <b>by Torah law.</b> However, the verse <b>“It is a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i></b> [<b><i>terua</i></b>] <b>to you” comes for its</b> own <b>statement,</b> i.e., for the verbal analogy, which teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of the wilderness apply to Rosh HaShana as well. Consequently, the third <i>terua</i> is merely alluded to in that verse and its obligation applies by rabbinic law.
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: One</b> <i>terua</i> applies <b>by Torah law, and two</b> apply <b>by rabbinic law: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> [<b><i>terua</i></b>]” applies <b>by Torah law.</b> However, the verses: <b>“A solemn rest, a memorial of blasts</b> [<b><i>terua</i></b>]” <b>and “It is a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i></b> [<b><i>terua</i></b>] <b>to you”;</b> these two phrases <b>come for their</b> own <b>statement.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani mean when he says that the verse: “It is a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i> [<i>terua</i>] to you,” <b>comes for its</b> own <b>statement?</b> What other <i>halakha</i> is derived from this verse? The Gemara explains: <b>It is required</b> to teach that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded <b>during the day and not at night,</b> as indicated by the phrase: “A day of sounding the <i>shofar</i>.”
The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, who does not derive this <i>halakha</i> from this verse, <b>from where</b> does he learn that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded <b>during the day and not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that which is stated with regard to the Jubilee Year: <b>“On the Day of Atonement”</b> (Leviticus 25:9), which indicates that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded during the day, not at night.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“On the Day of Atonement,” let us also derive from it</b> that one must sound <b>a straight</b> blast of a <i>tekia</i> <b>before</b> each <i>terua</i> <b>and a straight one after it.</b> Since he derives one <i>halakha</i> from the verses that deal with Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year, why not derive this <i>halakha</i> from there as well? In that case, he would not need to derive it from the verses that deal with the wilderness. The Gemara answers: The phrases <b>“Then you shall make proclamation</b> [<b><i>veha’avarta</i></b>]” (Leviticus 25:9) and <b>“You shall make proclamation</b> [<b><i>ta’aviru</i></b>]” from the same verse <b>do not indicate</b> a <i>tekia</i> <b>according to him,</b> as they come to teach a different matter.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what does he learn from</b> those phrases? The Gemara answers: He expounds: <b>“<i>Veha’avarta</i>,” in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Mattana, as Rav Mattana said: “<i>Veha’avarta</i>,”</b> which literally means: And you shall carry, indicates that the <i>shofar</i> must be shaped <b>in the</b> same <b>way that</b> the animal <b>carries</b> it on its head while alive, i.e., the natural narrow end must be maintained. One should not widen that side and narrow the naturally wide end. And the word <b>“<i>ta’aviru</i>”</b> teaches <b>that the Merciful One states</b> it so that one should not mistakenly explain as follows: <b>Let us</b> merely <b>carry</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>by hand</b> throughout the land rather than sounding it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i> derive these <i>halakhot</i>, as he used this verse to learn that the <i>terua</i> must be preceded by a <i>tekia</i>. The Gemara answers: He derives the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav Mattana from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>changed its normal language.</b> It employs the term “<i>ta’aviru</i>” instead of <i>titke’u</i>, the more common expression for sounding the <i>shofar</i>.
As for the concern that one might think the verse means: <b>You shall</b> merely <b>carry</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>by hand</b> and not sound it, <b>you cannot</b> in any event <b>say</b> that, as that <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> by verbal analogy between the root <b><i>avara</i></b> used here and the same root <b><i>avara</i></b> that is found <b>with</b> regard to <b>Moses. It is written here: “Then you shall make proclamation</b> [<b><i>veha’avarta</i></b>] <b>with the blast of the <i>shofar</i>,” and it is written elsewhere: “And Moses commanded, and they caused to be proclaimed [<i>vaya’aviru</i>] throughout the camp”</b> (Exodus 36:6). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to Moses, they proclaimed <b>with a sound, so too here,</b> the proclamation must be <b>with a sound.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, who derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> that each <i>terua</i> of Rosh HaShana must be preceded by a <i>tekia</i> <b>from</b> the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> in <b>the wilderness</b> at the time of the gathering of the assembly, one can argue as follows: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as there,</b> in the wilderness, there was sounding of <b>trumpets, so too, here,</b> on Rosh HaShana, there must be sounding of <b>trumpets.</b>
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Sound the <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, at the full moon</b> [<b><i>keseh</i></b>] <b>for our feast day”</b> (Psalms 81:4). <b>Which is the Festival on which the month,</b> i.e., the moon, <b>is covered</b> [<b><i>mitkaseh</i></b>]? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Rosh HaShana,</b> the only Festival that coincides with the new moon, which cannot be seen. <b>And the Merciful One states:</b> “Sound <b>the <i>shofar</i></b> at the New Moon,” which indicates that on Rosh HaShana one sounds a <i>shofar</i> and nothing else.
§ <b>Rabbi Abbahu instituted in Caesarea</b> the following order of sounding of the <i>shofar</i>: First <b>a <i>tekia</i>,</b> a simple uninterrupted sound; next <b>three <i>shevarim</i>,</b> broken sounds; followed by <b>a <i>terua</i>,</b> a series of short blasts; and, finally, another <b><i>tekia</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Whichever way you look at it,</b> this is difficult. <b>If,</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Abbahu, the sound the Torah calls a <i>terua</i> is <b>a whimpering,</b> i.e., short, consecutive sounds, <b>one</b> should <b>perform a <i>tekia</i>-<i>terua</i>-<i>tekia</i></b> set. <b>And if</b> he holds that a <i>terua</i> is <b>moaning,</b> i.e., longer, broken sounds, <b>he</b> should <b>sound</b> a set as follows: <b><i>Tekia</i>,</b> followed by <b>three <i>shevarim</i>,</b> and then another <b><i>tekia</i>.</b> Why include both a <i>terua</i> and a <i>shevarim</i>?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Abbahu <b>was uncertain whether</b> a <i>terua</i> means <b>moaning or whimpering,</b> and he therefore instituted that both types of sound should be included, to ensure that one fulfills his obligation. <b>Rav Avira strongly objects to this: But perhaps</b> a <i>terua</i> <b>is whimpering, and the</b> addition of <b>three <i>shevarim</i> interrupts between the <i>terua</i> and</b> the initial <b><i>tekia</i>,</b> which disqualifies the entire set. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is why one <b>then performs a <i>tekia</i>-<i>terua</i>-<i>tekia</i></b> set, to account for this possibility. <b>Ravina strongly objects to this: But perhaps</b> a <i>terua</i> <b>is moaning, and the <i>terua</i> interrupts between the <i>shevarim</i> and</b> the final <b><i>tekia</i>,</b> once again disqualifying the entire set. The Gemara likewise answers: <b>That</b> is why one <b>then performs a <i>tekia</i>-<i>shevarim</i>-<i>tekia</i></b> set, to cover this possibility as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if in any case one must perform the two sets of blasts, for <b>what</b> purpose <b>did Rabbi Abbahu institute</b> that one should perform a <i>tekia</i>-<i>shevarim</i>-<i>terua</i>-<i>tekia</i> set? <b>If</b> a <i>terua</i> <b>is moaning, one</b> already <b>did it; if it is whimpering, one</b> already <b>did</b> this, too. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Abbahu <b>was uncertain,</b> and he thought that <b>perhaps</b> a <i>terua</i> consists of <b>moaning</b> followed by <b>whimpering.</b> Consequently, all three sets are necessary.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let one perform the opposite</b> set <b>as well: <i>Tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, three <i>shevarim</i>, <i>tekia</i>,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> a <i>terua</i> consists of <b>whimpering and</b> then <b>moaning.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The normal</b> way <b>of things</b> is that <b>when a person experiences a bad event, he first moans and then whimpers,</b> but not the reverse.
§ The mishna taught: If <b>one sounded the first</b> <i>tekia</i> <b>and</b> then <b>extended the second</b> <i>tekia</i> of that series <b>to</b> the length of <b>two</b> <i>tekiot</i>, so that it should count as both the second <i>tekia</i> of the first set and the first <i>tekia</i> of the second set, it is considered as only one <i>tekia</i>, and one must begin the second set with a new <i>tekia</i>. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>one heard</b>

Daf 34b

the requisite <b>nine</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts at nine</b> different <b>times of the day, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the blasts need not be heard in immediate succession.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>heard nine</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts at nine</b> different <b>times of the day, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. If one heard the blasts <b>from nine</b> different <b>people simultaneously, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. If one heard <b>a <i>tekia</i> from this</b> one <b>and</b> afterward he heard <b>a <i>terua</i> from this</b> other one, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as one does not have to hear all the blasts from the same individual. <b>And</b> this is true <b>even</b> if one heard the blasts from the different individuals <b>at intervals, and even</b> if it took the course of <b>the entire day.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: During</b> the reading of <b><i>hallel</i> or the Megilla</b> of Esther, <b>if one paused</b> long <b>enough to complete all of it, he must return to the beginning,</b> as it must be read in one session? Why is the <i>halakha</i> different in the case of the <i>shofar</i>? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling with regard to the <i>shofar</i> <b>is his</b> own opinion, <b>and that</b> case of <i>hallel</i> and the Megilla <b>is his teacher’s</b> opinion. It is Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak who holds that one may not pause in the middle of sounding the <i>shofar</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> this <b>not</b> also <b>his</b> own opinion as well? <b>Wasn’t Rabbi Abbahu</b> once <b>walking after Rabbi Yoḥanan, and</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>was reciting <i>Shema</i></b> as he walked? <b>When he reached alleyways</b> that were <b>filthy</b> with human excrement, where it is prohibited to utter words of Torah, <b>he fell silent</b> and stopped reciting <i>Shema</i>. <b>After he passed</b> through, Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to completing</b> <i>Shema</i> from where I left off? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: If you remained</b> in the alleyway for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>return to the beginning</b> and start again. This shows that Rabbi Yoḥanan himself holds that if one takes an extended break, he must start again from the beginning.
The Gemara answers: This is no proof, as it is possible that <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said: I myself do not hold</b> that one must start again after a long pause; however, <b>according to you, as you hold</b> that a delay is a problem, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>if you paused</b> for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> <i>Shema</i>, you must <b>return to the beginning.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The various trumpet <b>blasts</b> on a fast day <b>do not invalidate one another,</b> i.e., if one was omitted, this does not invalidate the other blasts. Similarly, the additional <b>blessings</b> that are inserted into the <i>Amida</i> prayer on a fast day <b>do not invalidate one another.</b> However, the <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts and</b> additional <b>blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur do invalidate</b> one another.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that all the blasts and blessings are indispensable on Rosh HaShana? <b>Rabba said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Recite before Me on Rosh HaShana Kingship, Remembrances, and <i>Shofarot</i>. Kingship, so that you will crown Me as King over you; Remembrances, so that your remembrance will rise before Me for good. And with what? With the <i>shofar</i>.</b> Since these blessings constitute a single unit, one who did not recite them all has not fulfilled his obligation.
§ The mishna taught: In the case of <b>one who recited the blessings</b> of the additional prayer <b>and</b> only <b>afterward a <i>shofar</i> became available to him, he sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>, <b>sounds</b> a <i>terua</i> <b>and sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>; this is a set that he repeats three times. The Gemara explains: <b>The reason</b> that he may do this is <b>that he did not have a <i>shofar</i> at the outset.</b> This indicates that if <b>he had a <i>shofar</i> at the outset, when he hears</b> the blasts <b>he must hear them by the order of the blessings,</b> i.e., one set must be sounded after each special blessing.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel</b> once <b>rose to pray</b> on Rosh HaShana. <b>He said to his attendant: When I signal to you</b> that I have finished each of the blessings, <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for me. Rava said to him: They said</b> that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded after each blessing <b>only where there is a quorum of ten [<i>ḥever ir</i>],</b> not when it is sounded for an individual.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts, <b>he</b> must <b>hear them in order,</b> i.e., a <i>tekia</i>-<i>terua</i>-<i>tekia</i> set, <b>and upon the order of the blessings. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? Where</b> there is <b>a quorum of ten [<i>ḥever ir</i>]. However, where</b> there is <b>not a <i>ḥever ir</i>, one</b> must <b>hear them in order, but</b> he need <b>not</b> hear them <b>upon the order of the blessings. And</b> in the case of <b>an individual who has not sounded</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>another may sound</b> it <b>for him. But</b> with regard to <b>an individual who has not recited the blessings, another may not recite the blessings for him.</b>
<b>And</b> if one has to choose between hearing the <i>shofar</i> and reciting the blessings, the <b>mitzva</b> to be among <b>those who sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>more</b> important <b>than</b> the mitzva to be among <b>those who recite the blessings. How so?</b> If there are <b>two towns, in one</b> there are those who know how to <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and in the other</b> there are individuals who know how to <b>recite the blessings, one</b> should <b>go to the place where they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and</b> one does <b>not go to the place where they</b> know how to <b>recite the blessings.</b>
The Gemara asks: This <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious.</b> Sounding the <i>shofar</i> <b>is</b> a mitzva <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas the additional prayer applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> A mitzva that applies by Torah law is clearly more important. The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> this seemingly superfluous ruling <b>is necessary</b> to teach that <b>although</b> in <b>this</b> town it is <b>certain</b> that the additional prayer will be recited <b>and</b> in <b>this</b> other town it is <b>uncertain</b> whether or not the <i>shofar</i> will be sounded, one should still go to the place where they know how to sound the <i>shofar</i> rather than the location where they know how to recite the blessings.
§ The mishna states: <b>Just as the prayer leader is obligated</b> in the prayers of Rosh HaShana, <b>so too, every individual</b> is obligated in these prayers. Rabban Gamliel says: The prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Rabbis <b>said to Rabban Gamliel: According to your statement, why does the congregation recite</b> the silent <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> beforehand? <b>He said to them: In order that the prayer leader</b> should have time to prepare and <b>arrange his prayer.</b>
<b>Rabban Gamliel said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>According to your statement,</b> that the prayer leader does not fulfill the obligation on behalf of the many, <b>why does the prayer leader descend before the ark</b> and recite the <i>Amida</i> prayer? <b>They said to him:</b> He does so <b>to fulfill</b> the obligation <b>of one who is not an expert</b> in prayer. Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them: Just as he can fulfill</b> the obligation <b>of one who is not an expert</b> in prayer, <b>so too, he can fulfill</b> the obligation <b>of the expert.</b>
With regard to this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Ultimately, <b>the Rabbis concede to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel. But Rav said: It is still a dispute</b> that remains unresolved. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabba bar Naḥmani, heard this and went and stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Dimi bar Ḥinnana. He said to him</b> that <b>this is what Rav said: It is still a dispute.</b> Rav Dimi bar Ḥinnana <b>said to him: This is what Rabba bar bar Ḥana also said: When Rabbi Yoḥanan said this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that the Rabbis concede to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, <b>Reish Lakish disagreed with him and said: It is still a dispute.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥana from</b> the city of <b>Tzippori say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel?</b> From the fact that he said: <b>The <i>halakha</i>,</b> one can conclude <b>by inference</b> that the Rabbis still <b>disagree.</b> The very fact that he issued a ruling in favor of Rabban Gamliel shows that Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the Sages do not accept this opinion.

Daf 35a

The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Abba returned from</b> his travels <b>at sea, he explained</b> the matter as follows: <b>The Sages concede to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> with regard <b>to the blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur,</b> that in these cases the prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel, which, <b>by inference,</b> indicates <b>that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> still <b>disagree,</b> is referring <b>to the blessings of the entire year.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥana from</b> the city of <b>Tzippori say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with</b> regard to <b>the blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur?</b> Apparently, he holds that the <i>tanna’im</i> remain in dispute even with regard to these blessings.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statements must be attributed to different Sages, as <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Who concedes</b> to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel? <b>Rabbi Meir. And</b> with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel, which, <b>by inference,</b> indicates <b>that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> still <b>disagree,</b> this is referring to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir.
The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur, the prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many.</b> This is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Just as the prayer leader is obligated</b> in these prayers, <b>so too, every individual is obligated</b> to recite them on his own. Clearly, Rabbi Meir agrees with Rabban Gamliel with regard to the blessings of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, while the Rabbis dispute this ruling.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>these</b> blessings of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, that Rabbi Meir concedes to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel only with regard to them, but not about the blessings recited the rest of the year? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>due to the many verses</b> that are included in these blessings, this is difficult. <b>Didn’t Rav Ḥananel say</b> that <b>Rav said: Once one has recited</b> the line of the prayer: <b>And in Your Torah it is written, saying, it is no longer necessary</b> to recite the verses themselves. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because there are many blessings,</b> and as the blessings are long, not everyone is capable of learning them by heart.
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: Once one has recited</b> the line of the prayer: <b>And in Your Torah it is written, saying, it is no longer necessary</b> to recite the verses themselves. The Gemara clarifies the scope of this ruling: Some <b>understood from this</b> that <b>it applies only to an individual; however,</b> with regard <b>to a congregation, no,</b> this is not the case. Nevertheless, <b>it is stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Both</b> with regard to <b>an individual and a congregation, once one has recited: And in Your Torah it is written, saying, it is no longer necessary</b> to recite the verses.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar said: A person should always arrange his prayer</b> in his mind <b>and</b> only <b>then pray. Rabbi Abba said: Rabbi Elazar’s statement is reasonable</b> with regard <b>to the blessings of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur and</b> in the case <b>of</b> prayers that are recited only <b>intermittently. However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> blessings recited <b>all year, no,</b> this practice is not necessary.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Yehuda</b> first <b>arrange his prayer</b> in his mind <b>and</b> only then <b>pray,</b> even on an ordinary day? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda was different, since he would pray</b> only once <b>every thirty days.</b> During the rest of the month he would not engage in prayer, as he was busy with Torah study. Therefore, for him even regular weekdays prayers were <b>like</b> prayers recited <b>intermittently.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Avira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said: Rabban Gamliel would</b> allow the prayer leader to <b>exempt even the people who were in the fields</b> and away from the synagogue. The Gemara challenges: This statement implies that the prayer leader exempts even the people in the fields, <b>and needless to say,</b> he exempts <b>those who are here</b> in the city but did not attend the prayer service in the synagogue.
The Gemara questions this conclusion: <b>On the contrary,</b> the opposite is more reasonable: <b>Those</b> in the fields did not come to the synagogue <b>due to circumstances beyond their control,</b> and therefore they should be allowed to fulfill their obligation through the prayer leader. By contrast, <b>those</b> in the city were <b>not</b> prevented from coming to the synagogue <b>due to circumstances beyond their control.</b> Consequently, they should not fulfill their obligation through the prayer leader.
<b>As Abba, son of Rav Binyamin bar Ḥiyya, taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Those <b>people</b> standing in the synagogue <b>behind the priests</b> during the Priestly Blessing, who are not positioned in front of them, face-to-face, <b>are not included in the blessing.</b> They are expected to make the minimal effort to stand in front of the priests. However, those in the fields are included in the Priestly Blessing.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabban Gamliel’s statement should be understood differently: <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥasida said: Rabban Gamliel</b> allowed the prayer leader to <b>exempt only the people in the fields. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Because</b> the people in the fields are unable to come to the synagogue <b>due to work circumstances beyond their control,</b> and do not have time to prepare their prayers. <b>However,</b> Rabban Gamliel did not exempt those <b>in the city</b> who do not come to the synagogue, as they are able to prepare their prayers and pray by themselves.
