Megillah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The Megilla is read on the eleventh, on the twelfth, on the thirteenth, on the fourteenth,</b> or <b>on the fifteenth</b> of the month of Adar, <b>not earlier and not later.</b> The mishna explains the circumstances when the Megilla is read on each of these days. <b>Cities [<i>kerakin</i>] that have been surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, read</b> the Megilla <b>on the fifteenth</b> of Adar, whereas <b>villages and large towns</b> that have not been walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, <b>read</b> it <b>on the fourteenth. However,</b> the Sages instituted <b>that the villages may advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., Monday or Thursday, when the rabbinical courts are in session and the Torah is read publicly, and the villagers therefore come to the larger towns.
<b>How so?</b> If <b>the fourteenth</b> of Adar <b>occurs on Monday, the villages and large towns read</b> it <b>on that day, and the walled cities</b> read it <b>on the next day,</b> the fifteenth. If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Tuesday or Wednesday, the villages advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., Monday, the twelfth or thirteenth of Adar; <b>the large towns read</b> it <b>on that day,</b> i.e., the fourteenth of Adar, <b>and the walled cities</b> read it <b>on the next day,</b> the fifteenth.
If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Thursday, the villages and large towns read</b> it <b>on that day,</b> the fourteenth, <b>and the walled cities</b> read it <b>on the next day,</b> the fifteenth. If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat eve, the villages advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., Thursday, the thirteenth of Adar; <b>and the large towns and the walled cities read</b> it <b>on that day,</b> i.e., the fourteenth of Adar. Even the walled cities read the Megilla on the fourteenth rather than on the fifteenth, as they do not read it on Shabbat.
If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> both <b>the villages and large towns advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., Thursday, the twelfth of Adar; <b>and the walled cities</b> read it <b>on the day after</b> Purim, the fifteenth. If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Sunday, the villages advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., Thursday, the eleventh of Adar; <b>and the large towns read</b> it <b>on that day,</b> i.e., the fourteenth of Adar; <b>and the walled cities</b> read it <b>on the next day,</b> the fifteenth.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: <b>The Megilla is read on the eleventh</b> of Adar. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara expresses surprise at the question: What room is there to ask: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The reason is <b>as we intend to say further on: The Sages were lenient with the villages</b> and allowed them <b>to advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, so that they</b> would be free to <b>supply water and food to their brethren in the cities</b> on the day of Purim. Accordingly, the Megilla is read on the eleventh due to a rabbinic enactment.
The Gemara explains: <b>This is what we said,</b> i.e., this is what we meant when we asked the question: <b>Now, all of these</b> days when the Megilla may be read <b>were enacted by the members of the Great Assembly</b> when they established the holiday of Purim itself. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that the members of the Great Assembly enacted</b> only <b>the fourteenth and fifteenth</b> as days for reading the Megilla, is it possible that <b>the</b> later <b>Sages came and uprooted an ordinance that was enacted by the members of the Great Assembly? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:5) that <b>a rabbinical court cannot rescind the statements of another rabbinical court, unless it is superior to it in wisdom and in number?</b> No subsequent court was ever greater than the members of the Great Assembly, so it would be impossible for another court to rescind the enactments of the members of the Great Assembly.
<b>Rather, it is obvious</b> that <b>all</b> these days <b>were enacted by the members of the Great Assembly,</b> and the question is: <b>Where is the allusion</b> to this in the Bible? The Megilla itself, which was approved by the members of the Great Assembly, mentions only the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar.
<b>Rav Shemen bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is alluded to when <b>the verse states: “To confirm these days of Purim in their times”</b> (Esther 9:31). The phrase “in their times” indicates that <b>they enacted many times for them</b> and not only two days.
The Gemara objects: <b>This</b> verse <b>is necessary for its own</b> purpose, to teach that the days of Purim must be observed at the proper times. The Gemara responds: <b>If so, let the verse say:</b> To confirm these days of Purim in its <b>time. What is</b> the significance of the term <b>“their times,”</b> in the plural? It indicates that <b>many times</b> were established for the reading of the Megilla.
The Gemara objects: <b>But still,</b> the plural term is <b>necessary</b> to indicate that <b>the time of this</b> walled city <b>is not</b> the same as <b>the time of that</b> unwalled town, i.e., Purim is celebrated on different days in different places. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse say: Their time,</b> indicating that each place celebrates Purim on its respective day. <b>What</b> is the significance of the compound plural <b>“their times”? Learn from this</b> term that although the verse (Esther 9:21) specifies only two days, the Megilla may, at times, be read on <b>all of</b> the days enumerated in the mishna.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say</b> that the plural term indicates <b>many times,</b> and the Megilla may be read even earlier than the eleventh of Adar. The Gemara rejects this argument: The compound plural <b>“their times,”</b> should be understood as <b>similar to</b> the simple plural term, <b>their time. Just as</b> the term <b>their time</b> can be understood to refer to <b>two</b> days, indicating that each location reads the Megilla in its respective time on the fourteenth or the fifteenth of Adar, <b>so too, “their times”</b> should be understood as referring to only <b>two</b> additional days when the Megilla may be read.
The Gemara asks: <b>Say</b> that these two added days are <b>the twelfth and the thirteenth</b> of Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on the eleventh as well? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said</b> in a different context: <b>The thirteenth</b> of Adar <b>is a time of assembly for all,</b> as it was on that day that the Jews assembled to fight their enemies, and the main miracle was performed on that day. Consequently, <b>there is no need</b> for a special derivation <b>to include it</b> as a day that is fit for reading the Megilla. <b>Here too,</b> since <b>the thirteenth</b> of Adar <b>is a time of assembly for all, there is no need</b> for a special derivation <b>to include it</b> among the days when the Megilla may be read.
The Gemara objects: <b>And say</b> that the two additional days are <b>the sixteenth and the seventeenth</b> of Adar. The Gemara responds: <b>It is written: “And it shall not pass”</b> (Esther 9:27), indicating that the celebration of Purim is not delayed until a later date.
Having cited and discussed the opinion of Rav Shemen bar Abba, the Gemara cites another answer to the question of where the verses allude to the permissibility of reading the Megilla on the days enumerated in the mishna. <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said:</b> These dates are alluded to when <b>the verse states: “As the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies”</b> (Esther 9:22). The term <b>“days”</b> is referring to the two days that are explicitly mentioned in the previous verse, i.e., the fourteenth and the fifteenth. The term <b>“as the days”</b> comes <b>to include</b> two additional days, i.e., <b>the eleventh and twelfth</b> of Adar.
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that the two additional days are <b>the twelfth and thirteenth</b> of Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on the eleventh as well? In answer to this question, <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: The thirteenth</b> of Adar <b>is a time of assembly for all, and there is no need</b> for a special derivation <b>to include it</b> as a day fit for reading. The Gemara objects: <b>Say</b> that these additional days are <b>the sixteenth and seventeenth</b> of Adar. This suggestion is rejected: <b>It is written: “And it shall not pass.”</b>
Since two derivations were offered for the same matter, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani did not state</b> that the days enumerated in the mishna are fit for reading the Megilla <b>based upon</b> the term <b>“in their times,”</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Shemen bar Abba? The Gemara answers: <b>He does not learn</b> anything from the distinction between the terms <b>time, their time,</b> and <b>their times.</b> Therefore, the verse indicates only that there are two days when the Megilla may be read.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba did not state</b> that the days enumerated in the mishna are fit for reading the Megilla <b>based upon</b> the term <b>“as the days,”</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani? The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you: That</b> verse <b>is written</b> as a reference <b>to</b> future <b>generations,</b> and it indicates that just as the Jews rested on these days at that time, they shall rest and celebrate on these days for all generations.
§ With regard to the mishna’s ruling that the Megilla may be read on the day of assembly, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva the unattributed.</b> Most unattributed statements of <i>tanna’im</i> were formulated by Rabbi Akiva’s students and reflect his opinions. <b>As, he derives</b> <i>halakhot</i> based on the distinction that he draws between the terms <b>time, their time, and their times. However, the Sages say: One may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time,</b> i.e., the fourteenth of Adar.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is one permitted to read the Megilla from the eleventh to the fifteenth of Adar? One may read on these dates <b>at a time when the years are established</b> properly <b>and the Jewish people dwell</b> securely <b>in their</b> own <b>land. However, nowadays, since</b> people <b>look</b> to the reading of the Megilla and use it to calculate when Passover begins, <b>one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time,</b> so as not to cause confusion with regard to the date of Passover, which is exactly one month from the day after Purim.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> issue his ruling? <b>If we say that it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> whose opinion is expressed in the mishna, there is a difficulty, as Rabbi Akiva holds that <b>even nowadays this ordinance applies.</b> According to Rabbi Akiva, it is permitted for residents of villages to read the Megilla on the day of assembly even nowadays, as he did not limit his ruling to times when the Jewish people dwell securely in their land.
<b>Rather, is it not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Sages,</b> who disagreed with Rabbi Akiva? <b>And,</b> nevertheless, <b>at least when the years are established</b> properly <b>and the Jewish people dwell</b> securely <b>in their land,</b> the Megilla <b>is read</b> even prior to the fourteenth, as the Sages disagree only about the <i>halakha</i> nowadays. This contradicts the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who holds that the Megilla could never be read earlier than the fourteenth of Adar. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan is</b> indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the previous passage. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva, the unattributed. However, the Sages said: Nowadays, since</b> people <b>look</b> to the reading of the Megilla and use it to calculate when Passover begins, <b>one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is one permitted to read the Megilla from the eleventh to the fifteenth of Adar? <b>At a time when the years are established</b> properly <b>and the Jewish people dwell</b> securely <b>in their</b> own <b>land. However, nowadays, since</b> people <b>look</b> to the reading of the Megilla and use it to calculate when Passover begins, <b>one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time.</b> According to this version, Rabbi Yehuda’s statement is consistent with the opinion of the Sages, as cited by Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara adds: <b>Rav Ashi</b> poses <b>a difficulty</b> based on an apparent contradiction between the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> and a ruling cited in a mishna in the name of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b>

Daf 2b

<b>and he establishes the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda,</b> rather than Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara explains the apparent contradiction: <b>And did Rabbi Yehuda</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>nowadays, since</b> people <b>look</b> to the reading of the Megilla and use it to calculate when Passover begins, <b>one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (5a): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is one permitted to read the Megilla from the eleventh of Adar? In <b>a place where</b> the villagers generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday. However,</b> in <b>a place where they do not</b> generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday, one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the fourteenth of Adar.
The mishna indicates that, <b>at least</b> in <b>a place where</b> the villagers <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday, one may read</b> the Megilla from the eleventh of Adar <b>even nowadays. And</b> due to this contradiction, Rav Ashi <b>establishes the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Because</b> Rav Ashi poses <b>a difficulty</b> due to the apparent contradiction between the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the <i>baraita</i> and the opinion cited in a mishna in the name of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he establishes the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda?</b> How could he have emended the text just because he had a difficulty that he did not know how to resolve?
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Ashi heard that there were those who taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and there were those who taught it</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda. And since he had a difficulty</b> with the apparent contradiction between one ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> another ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he said: The one who taught it</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yehuda is not precise,</b> whereas <b>the one who taught it</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda is precise,</b> and in this way he eliminated the contradiction.
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>Cities that have been surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, read</b> the Megilla <b>on the fifteenth</b> of Adar. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, as they are not stated explicitly in the Megilla? <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “Therefore the Jews of the villages, who dwell in the unwalled towns,</b> make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of gladness and feasting” (Esther 9:19). <b>From</b> the fact that <b>the unwalled towns</b> celebrate Purim <b>on the fourteenth,</b> it may be derived that <b>the walled cities</b> celebrate Purim <b>on the fifteenth.</b>
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>Say</b> that the <b>unwalled towns</b> celebrate Purim <b>on the fourteenth,</b> as indicated in the verse, and <b>the walled cities</b> do <b>not</b> celebrate it <b>at all.</b> The Gemara expresses astonishment: <b>And are they not Jews? And furthermore: It is written</b> that the kingdom of Ahasuerus was <b>“from Hodu until Cush”</b> (Esther 1:1), and the celebration of Purim was accepted in all of the countries of his kingdom (Esther 9:20–23).
Rather, the following challenge may be raised: <b>Say</b> that <b>the unwalled towns</b> celebrate Purim <b>on the fourteenth</b> and <b>the walled cities</b> celebrate it <b>on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth, as it is written: “That they should keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and the fifteenth day of the same, in every year”</b> (Esther 9:21). This verse can be understood to mean that there are places where Purim is celebrated on both days.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If it had been written</b> in the verse: <b>The fourteenth day and [<i>ve</i>] the fifteenth,</b> it would be <b>as you</b> originally <b>said.</b> However, <b>now that it is written: The fourteenth day and [<i>ve’et</i>] the fifteenth day,</b> the particle <b><i>et</i></b> used here to denote the accusative <b>comes and interrupts,</b> indicating that the two days are distinct. Therefore, residents of <b>these</b> locations celebrate Purim <b>on the fourteenth, and</b> residents of <b>those</b> locations celebrate it <b>on the fifteenth.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that residents of <b>unwalled towns</b> celebrate Purim <b>on the fourteenth,</b> as stated in the verse, and with regard to residents of <b>walled cities, if they wish</b> they may celebrate it <b>on the fourteenth,</b> and <b>if they wish</b> they may celebrate it <b>on the fifteenth.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states: “In their times”</b> (Esther 9:31), indicating that <b>the time</b> when the residents of <b>this</b> place celebrate Purim <b>is not the time</b> when the residents of <b>that</b> place celebrate Purim.
The Gemara raises another challenge: <b>Say</b> that the walled cities should celebrate Purim <b>on the thirteenth</b> of Adar and not on the fifteenth. The Gemara answers: It stands to reason that the residents of walled cities, who do not celebrate Purim on the fourteenth, celebrate it <b>as</b> it is celebrated in <b>Shushan,</b> and it is explicitly stated that Purim was celebrated in Shushan on the fifteenth.
The Gemara comments: <b>We found</b> a source for <b>observing</b> the holiday of Purim on the fourteenth of Adar in unwalled towns and on the fifteenth of Adar in walled cities; <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>remembering</b> the story of Purim through the reading of the Megilla takes place on these days? The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “That these days should be remembered and observed”</b> (Esther 9:28), from which it is derived that <b>remembering is compared to observing.</b>
§ The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (1:1) that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Cities that have been surrounded by a wall since the days of Ahasuerus read</b> the Megilla <b>on the fifteenth.</b> According to the <i>Tosefta</i>, the status of walled cities is determined based upon whether they were walled in the time of Ahasuerus rather than the time of Joshua.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa?</b> The Gemara explains that the Megilla is read on the fifteenth in cities that are <b>like Shushan: Just as Shushan</b> is a city <b>that was surrounded by a wall since the days of Ahasuerus, and one reads</b> the Megilla there <b>on the fifteenth, so too every</b> city <b>that was walled since the days of Ahasuerus reads</b> the Megilla <b>on the fifteenth.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna? The Gemara explains: It is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>unwalled and</b> another instance of the word <b>unwalled. It is written here: “Therefore the Jews of the villages,</b> who dwell in the unwalled towns” (Esther 9:19), <b>and it is written there,</b> in Moses’ statement to Joshua before the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael: “All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates and bars; <b>besides unwalled towns, a great many”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:5). <b>Just as there,</b> in Deuteronomy, the reference is to a city <b>that was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun, so too here</b> it is referring to a city <b>that was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>Granted</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>because he did not hold</b> that a verbal analogy can be established between one verse that employs the word <b>unwalled</b> and the other verse that employs the word <b>unwalled. However, what is the reason</b> that <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna <b>did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa?</b>
The Gemara expresses astonishment: <b>What is the reason? Isn’t it</b> because <b>he holds</b> that it is derived from the verbal analogy between one usage of the word <b>unwalled</b> and the other usage of the word <b>unwalled?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This is what he said,</b> i.e., this was the question: According to the <i>tanna</i> of our mishna, <b>in accordance with whom does Shushan observe</b> Purim? Shushan is <b>not like the unwalled towns and not like the walled cities,</b> as residents of Shushan celebrate Purim on the fifteenth, but the city was not surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua.
<b>Rava said, and some say it unattributed</b> to any particular Sage: <b>Shushan is different since the miracle occurred in it</b> on the fifteenth of Adar, and therefore Purim is celebrated on that day. However, other cities are only considered walled cities and read the Megilla on the fifteenth of Adar if they were walled since the days of Joshua.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according</b> to <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>this is</b> the meaning of <b>what is written:</b> “And these days should be remembered and observed throughout every generation, every family, <b>every province, and every city”</b> (Esther 9:28). The phrase <b>“every province [<i>medina</i>]”</b> is expressed in the verse using repetition, so that it reads literally: Every province and province, and therefore contains a superfluous usage of the word province, is meant <b>to distinguish between</b> cities <b>that were surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun,</b> where the Megilla is read on the fifteenth, <b>and</b> a city that <b>was surrounded by a wall since the days of Ahasuerus,</b> where the Megilla is read on the fourteenth.
The phrase <b>“every city,”</b> which is similarly expressed through repetition and contains a superfluous usage of the word city, <b>also</b> serves <b>to distinguish between Shushan and other cities,</b> as Purim is celebrated in Shushan on the fifteenth despite the fact that it was not walled since the time of Joshua. <b>However, according to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, granted</b> that the phrase <b>“every province”</b> comes <b>to distinguish between Shushan and other cities</b> that were not walled since the days of Ahasuerus; <b>but what does</b> the phrase <b>“every city” come</b> to teach?
The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa</b> could have <b>said to you: According to the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>does it work out well? Since he holds</b> that it is derived from the verbal analogy between one verse that employs the word <b>unwalled</b> and the other verse that employs the word <b>unwalled, why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“every province”? Rather, the verse comes for</b> a midrashic <b>exposition, and it comes</b> to indicate that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling issued by <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city, and all</b> settlements <b>adjacent to it, and all</b> settlements that can be <b>seen with it,</b> i.e., that can be seen from the walled city, are <b>considered like the</b> walled <b>city,</b> and the Megilla is read there on the fifteenth.
The Gemara asks: <b>Up to what</b> distance is considered adjacent? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who said: The limit is <b>like</b> the distance <b>from</b> the town of <b>Ḥamtan to Tiberias,</b> a <b><i>mil</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let him say</b> simply that the limit is a <b><i>mil</i>;</b> why did he have to mention these places? The Gemara answers that the formulation of the answer <b>teaches us this: How much</b> distance comprises <b>the measure</b> of a <b><i>mil</i>?</b> It is <b>like</b> the distance <b>from Ḥamtan to Tiberias.</b>
§ Having cited a statement of Rabbi Yirmeya, which some attribute to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, the Gemara cites other statements attributed to these Sages. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who said: <b>The Seers,</b> i.e., the prophets, were the ones who <b>said</b> that the letters <b><i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>peh</i>,</b> and <b><i>kaf</i></b> [<b><i>mantzepakh</i></b>], have a different form when they appear at the end of a word.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Isn’t it written: “These are the commandments</b> that the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai” (Leviticus 27:34), which indicates <b>that a prophet is not permitted to initiate</b> or change <b>any matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>from now on?</b> Consequently, how could the prophets establish new forms for the letters? <b>And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> The letters <b><i>mem</i> and <i>samekh</i> in the tablets</b> of the covenant given at Sinai

Daf 3a

<b>stood by way of a miracle?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> two forms of these letters <b>did exist</b> at that time, <b>but</b> the people <b>did not know which</b> one of them was to be used <b>in the middle of the word and which at the end of the word, and the Seers came and established</b> that <b>the open</b> forms are to used be <b>in the middle of the word and the closed</b> forms <b>at the end of the word.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b> however, doesn’t the phrase <b>“these are the commandments”</b> (Leviticus 27:34) indicate <b>that a prophet is not permitted to initiate any matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>from now on? Rather,</b> it may be suggested that the final letters already existed at the time of the giving of the Torah, but over the course of time the people <b>forgot them,</b> and the prophets <b>then</b> came and <b>reestablished them.</b>
§ The Gemara cites another ruling of Rabbi Yirmeya or Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who said: <b>The</b> Aramaic <b>translation of the Torah</b> used in the synagogues <b>was composed by Onkelos the convert based on</b> the teachings of <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua. The</b> Aramaic <b>translation of the Prophets was composed by Yonatan ben Uzziel based on</b> a tradition going back to the last prophets, <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</b> The Gemara relates that when Yonatan ben Uzziel wrote his translation, <b>Eretz Yisrael quaked</b> over an area of <b>four hundred parasangs [<i>parsa</i>] by four hundred parasangs,</b> and <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: Who is this who has revealed My secrets to mankind?</b>
<b>Yonatan ben Uzziel stood up on his feet and said: I am the one who has revealed Your secrets to mankind</b> through my translation. However, <b>it is revealed and known to You that I did this not for my</b> own <b>honor, and not for the honor of the house of</b> my <b>father, but rather</b> it was <b>for Your honor</b> that <b>I did this, so that discord not increase among the Jewish people.</b> In the absence of an accepted translation, people will disagree about the meaning of obscure verses, but with a translation, the meaning will be clear.
<b>And</b> Yonatan ben Uzziel <b>also sought to reveal a translation of the Writings,</b> but <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said to him: It is enough for you</b> that you translated the Prophets. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that he was denied permission to translate the Writings? <b>Because it has in it</b> a revelation of <b>the end,</b> when the <b>Messiah</b> will arrive. The end is foretold in a cryptic manner in the book of Daniel, and were the book of Daniel translated, the end would become manifestly revealed to all.
The Gemara asks: <b>Was the translation of the Torah</b> really <b>composed by Onkelos the convert? Didn’t Rav Ika bar Avin say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with respect to the days of Ezra: <b>“And they read in the book, the Torah of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, and they caused them to understand the reading”</b> (Nehemiah 8:8)? The verse should be understood as follows: <b>“And they read in the book, the Torah of God,” this is the</b> scriptural <b>text; “distinctly,” this is the translation,</b> indicating that they immediately translated the text into Aramaic, as was customary during public Torah readings.
<b>“And they gave the sense,” these are</b> the divisions of the text into separate <b>verses. “And they caused them to understand the reading,” these are the cantillation notes,</b> through which the meaning of the text is further clarified. <b>And some say</b> that <b>these are the</b> Masoretic <b>traditions</b> with regard to the manner in which each word is to be written. This indicates that the Aramaic translation already existed at the beginning of the Second Temple period, well before the time of Onkelos. The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> ancient Aramaic translation <b>was forgotten and then</b> Onkelos came and <b>reestablished it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the translation of Prophets? Why is it that when Onkelos revealed the translation <b>of the Torah,</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>did not quake, and</b> when he revealed the translation <b>of the Prophets, it quaked?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The</b> meaning of <b>matters</b> discussed <b>in the Torah is clear,</b> and therefore its Aramaic translation did not reveal the meaning of passages that had not been understood previously. Conversely, in <b>the Prophets, there are matters that are clear and there are matters that are obscure,</b> and the Aramaic translation revealed the meaning of obscure passages. The Gemara cites an example of an obscure verse that is clarified by the Aramaic translation: <b>As it is written: “On that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon”</b> (Zechariah 12:11).
<b>And</b> with regard to that verse, <b>Rav Yosef said: Were it not for the</b> Aramaic <b>translation of this verse, we would not have known what it is saying,</b> as the Bible does not mention any incident involving Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. The Aramaic translation reads as follows: <b>On that day, the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Ahab, son of Omri, who was slain by Hadadrimmon, son of Tavrimon, in Ramoth-Gilead, and like the mourning for Josiah, son of Amon, who was slain by Pharaoh the lame in the valley of Megiddon.</b> The translation clarifies that the verse is referring to two separate incidents of mourning, and thereby clarifies the meaning of this verse.
§ The Gemara introduces another statement from the same line of tradition. The verse states: <b>“And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great trembling fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves”</b> (Daniel 10:7). <b>Who were these men?</b> The term “men” in the Bible indicates important people; who were they? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who said: <b>These are</b> the prophets <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</b>
The Gemara comments: In certain ways <b>they,</b> the prophets, <b>were greater than him,</b> Daniel, and in certain ways <b>he,</b> Daniel, <b>was greater than them. They were greater than him, as they were prophets and he was not a prophet.</b> Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were sent to convey the word of God to the Jewish people, while Daniel was not sent to reveal his visions to others. In another way, however, <b>he was greater than them, as he saw</b> this vision, <b>and they did not see</b> this vision, indicating that his ability to perceive obscure and cryptic visions was greater than theirs.
The Gemara asks: <b>Since they did not see</b> the vision, <b>what is the reason that they were frightened?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Even though they did not see</b> the vision, <b>their guardian angels saw</b> it, and therefore they sensed that there was something fearful there and they fled.
<b>Ravina said: Learn from</b> this incident that with regard to <b>one who is frightened</b> for no apparent reason, <b>although he does not see</b> anything menacing, <b>his guardian angel sees</b> it, and therefore he should take steps in order to escape the danger. The Gemara asks: <b>What is his remedy? He should recite <i>Shema</i>,</b> which will afford him protection. <b>And if he is standing in a place of filth,</b> where it is prohibited to recite verses from the Torah, <b>he should distance himself four cubits from his</b> current <b>location</b> in order to escape the danger. <b>And if</b> he is <b>not</b> able to do so, <b>let him say the following</b> incantation: <b>The goat of the slaughterhouse is fatter than I am,</b> and if a calamity must fall upon something, it should fall upon it.
§ After this digression, the Gemara returns to the exposition of a verse cited above. <b>Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that the phrases <b>“every province” and “every city”</b> appear <b>for</b> the purposes of midrashic <b>exposition, for what</b> exposition do the words <b>“every family”</b> appear in that same verse (Esther 9:28)? <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> These words come <b>to include the priestly and Levitical families,</b> and indicate <b>that they cancel their service</b> in the Temple <b>and come to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b>
<b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The priests at their</b> Temple <b>service, the Levites on their platform</b> in the Temple, where they sung the daily psalm, <b>and the Israelites at their watches,</b> i.e., the group of Israelites, corresponding to the priestly watches, who would come to Jerusalem and gather in other locations as representatives of the entire nation to observe or pray for the success of the Temple service, <b>all cancel their service and come to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b>
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The priests at their service, the Levites on the platform, and the Israelites at their watches, all cancel their service and come to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b> The Sages of <b>the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>relied</b> upon the <i>halakha</i> stated <b>here</b> and determined <b>that one cancels his Torah study and comes to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b> They derived this principle by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from the</b> Temple <b>service: Just as</b> one who is engaged in performing <b>service</b> in the Temple, <b>which is</b> very <b>important, cancels</b> his service in order to hear the Megilla, is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that one who is engaged in <b>Torah study</b> cancels his study to hear the Megilla?
The Gemara asks: <b>Is the</b> Temple <b>service more important than Torah study? Isn’t it written: “And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood over against him</b> with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went over to him and said to him: Are you for us, or for our adversaries? And he said, No, but I am captain of the host of the Lord, I have come now. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, <b>and bowed down”</b> (Joshua 5:13–14).
The Gemara first seeks to clarify the incident described in the verse. <b>How did</b> Joshua <b>do this,</b> i.e., how could he bow to a figure he did not recognize? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: It is prohibited for a person to greet his fellow at night</b> if he does not recognize him, as <b>we are concerned that perhaps it is a demon?</b> How did Joshua know that it was not a demon? The Gemara answers: <b>There it was different, as</b> the visitor <b>said to him: But I am captain of the host of the Lord.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps</b> this was a demon <b>and he lied?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that demons <b>do not utter the name of Heaven for naught,</b> and therefore since the visitor had mentioned the name of God, Joshua was certain that this was indeed an angel.
As for the angel’s mission, the Gemara explains that the angel <b>said to</b> Joshua: <b>Yesterday,</b> i.e., during the afternoon, <b>you neglected the afternoon daily offering</b> due to the impending battle, <b>and now,</b> at night, <b>you have neglected Torah study,</b> and I have come to rebuke you. Joshua <b>said to him: For which of these</b> sins <b>have you come? He said to him: I have come now,</b> indicating that neglecting Torah study is more severe than neglecting to sacrifice the daily offering. Joshua <b>immediately</b> determined to rectify the matter, as the verses states: <b>“And Joshua lodged that night”</b> (Joshua 8:9) <b>“in the midst of the valley</b> [<b><i>ha’emek</i></b>]” (Joshua 8:13), and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b>

Daf 3b

This <b>teaches that he spent the night in the depths</b> [<b><i>be’umeka</i></b>] <b>of <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., that he spent the night studying Torah with the Jewish people. <b>And Rav Shmuel bar Unya said: Torah study is greater than sacrificing the daily offerings, as it is stated: “I have come now”</b> (Joshua 5:14), indicating that the angel came to rebuke Joshua for neglecting Torah study and not for neglecting the daily offering. Consequently, how did the Sages of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi determine that the Temple service is more important than Torah study?
The Gemara explains that it is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, with regard to the story of Joshua, is referring to Torah study <b>by the masses,</b> which is greater than the Temple service. <b>That</b> statement of the Sages of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring to Torah study <b>by an individual,</b> which is less significant than the Temple service.
The Gemara asks: Is the Torah study <b>of an individual a light</b> matter? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>On</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, women may lament</b> the demise of the deceased in unison, <b>but they may not clap</b> their hands in mourning? <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Those that are close to the bier may clap. On the New Moon, on Hanukkah, and on Purim,</b> which are not mandated by Torah law, <b>they may</b> both <b>lament and clap</b> their hands in mourning. However, <b>on both</b> groups of days, <b>they may not wail</b> responsively, a form of wailing where one woman wails and the others repeat after her.
<b>And Rabba bar Huna said:</b> All these regulations were said with regard to an ordinary person, but <b>there are no</b> restrictions on expressions of mourning on the intermediate days of <b>a Festival in the presence of a</b> deceased <b>Torah scholar.</b> If a Torah scholar dies on the intermediate days of a Festival, the women may lament, clap, and wail responsively as on any other day, <b>and all the more so on Hanukkah and Purim.</b> This indicates that even the Torah study of an individual is of great importance.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>You speak of the honor</b> that must be shown <b>to the Torah,</b> and indeed, <b>the honor</b> that must be shown to <b>the Torah</b> in the case of <b>an individual</b> Torah scholar <b>is important;</b> but <b>the Torah study of an individual</b> in itself <b>is light</b> and is less significant than the Temple service.
§ <b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is obvious to me</b> that if one must choose between Temple <b>service and reading the Megilla, reading the Megilla</b> takes <b>precedence, based upon</b> the exposition of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> with regard to the phrase “every family” (Esther 9:28). Similarly, if one must choose between <b>Torah study and reading the Megilla, reading the Megilla</b> takes <b>precedence, based upon</b> the fact that the Sages of <b>the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>relied</b> on Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina’s exposition to rule that one interrupts Torah study to hear the reading of the Megilla.
Furthermore, it is obvious that if one must choose between <b>Torah study and</b> tending to <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>],</b> the task of burying <b>the <i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence.</b> This is derived <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One cancels his Torah study to bring out a corpse</b> for burial, <b>and to</b> join a wedding procession and <b>bring in the bride.</b> Similarly, if one must choose between the Temple <b>service and</b> tending to <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>,</b> tending to the <b><i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence, based upon</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived from the term <b>“or for his sister”</b> (Numbers 6:7).
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to verses addressing the laws of a nazirite: “All the days that he consecrates himself to the Lord, he shall not come near to a dead body. For his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, he shall not make himself ritually impure for them when they die” (Numbers 6:6–7). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “or for his sister”?</b> The previous verse, which states that the nazirite may not come near a dead body, already prohibits him from becoming impure through contact with his sister. Therefore, the second verse is understood to be teaching a different <i>halakha</i>: One <b>who was going to slaughter his Paschal</b> lamb <b>or to circumcise his son, and he heard that</b> a relative <b>of his died,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he</b> should return and <b>become ritually impure</b> with the impurity imparted by a corpse.
<b>You said: He shall not become impure;</b> the death of his relative will not override so significant a mitzva from the Torah. One <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Just as he does not become impure for his sister, so he does not become impure for a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>]. The verse states: “Or for his sister”; he may not become impure for his sister,</b> as someone else can attend to her burial, <b>but he does become impure for a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b>
On the basis of these premises, <b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b> If one must choose between <b>reading the Megilla and</b> tending to <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>, which of them</b> takes <b>precedence?</b> Does <b>reading the Megilla</b> take <b>precedence due to</b> the value of <b>publicizing the miracle, or perhaps</b> burying <b>the <i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence due to</b> the value of preserving <b>human dignity? After he raised the dilemma,</b> Rava <b>then resolved it</b> on his own and ruled that attending to a <b><i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence, as the Master said: Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah.</b> Consequently, it certainly overrides the duty to read the Megilla, despite the fact that reading the Megilla publicizes the miracle.
§ The Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city, and all</b> settlements <b>adjacent to it, and all</b> settlements that can be <b>seen with it,</b> i.e., that can be seen from the walled city, are <b>considered like the</b> walled <b>city,</b> and the Megilla is read on the fifteenth. It was <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a settlement <b>adjacent</b> to a walled city, <b>although it cannot be seen</b> from it, and also a place that <b>can be seen</b> from the walled city, <b>although it is not adjacent</b> to it.
The Gemara examines the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Granted</b> that with regard to a place that <b>can be seen</b> from the walled city, <b>although it is not adjacent</b> to it, <b>you find it where</b> the place <b>is located on the top of a mountain,</b> and therefore it can be seen from the walled city, although it is at some distance from it. <b>However,</b> with regard to a settlement that is <b>adjacent</b> to a walled city <b>although it cannot be seen</b> from it, <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> You find it, for example, <b>where</b> the place <b>is located in a valley,</b> and therefore it is possible that it cannot be seen from the walled city, although it is very close to it.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city that was</b> initially <b>settled and</b> only <b>later surrounded</b> by a wall <b>is considered a village</b> rather than a walled city. <b>What is the reason? As it is written: “And if a man sells a residential house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). The wording of the verse indicates that it is referring to a place <b>that was</b> first <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and</b> only <b>later settled, and not</b> to a place <b>that was</b> first <b>settled and</b> only <b>later surrounded</b> by a wall.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city that does not have ten idlers,</b> i.e., individuals who do not work and are available to attend to communal needs, <b>is treated as a village.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (5a): <b>What is a large city? Any</b> city <b>in which there are ten idlers;</b> however, if there are <b>fewer than that, it is a village.</b> The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>it was necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a large <b>city,</b> to indicate that <b>even if</b> idlers <b>happen to come there from elsewhere,</b> since they are not local residents, it is still considered a village.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>said: A</b> walled <b>city that was destroyed and</b> then <b>later settled is considered a city.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term <b>destroyed? If we say</b> that the city’s <b>walls were destroyed,</b> and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi comes to teach us that if it was <b>settled, yes</b> it is treated as a walled city, but if it was <b>not settled,</b> it is <b>not</b> treated that way, there is a difficulty. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Yosei says:</b> The verse states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall</b> (Leviticus 25:30),” and the word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, which means no, but in context the word <i>lo</i> is used as though it was written with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even though</b> the city <b>does not have</b> a wall <b>now,</b> as the wall was destroyed, if it <b>had</b> a wall <b>before,</b> it retains its status as a walled city.
<b>Rather, what is</b> meant by the term <b>destroyed? That it was destroyed</b> in the sense that it no longer has <b>ten idlers,</b> and therefore it is treated like a village. However, once it has ten idlers again, it is treated like a city.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b>

Daf 4a

The cities <b>Lod, and Ono, and Gei HeḤarashim</b> are cities <b>that have been surrounded</b> by walls <b>since the days of Joshua, son of Nun.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Did Joshua</b>, son of Nun, really <b>build these</b> cities? <b>Didn’t Elpaal build them</b> at a later date, <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Elpaal: Eber, and Misham, and Shemed, who built Ono and Lod, with its hamlets”</b> (I Chronicles 8:12)? The Gemara counters: <b>According to your reasoning,</b> that this verse proves that these cities were built later, you can also say that <b>Asa,</b> king of Judah, <b>built them, as it is written: “And he,</b> Asa, <b>built fortified cities in Judah”</b> (see II Chronicles 14:5). Therefore, it is apparent that these cities were built more than once.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: These</b> cities <b>were surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun,</b> and they <b>were destroyed in the days of the concubine in Gibea,</b> as they stood in the tribal territory of Benjamin, and in that war all of the cities of Benjamin were destroyed (see Judges, chapters 19–21). <b>Elpaal</b> then <b>came and built them</b> again. <b>They then fell</b> in the wars between Judah and Israel, and <b>Asa came and restored them.</b>
The Gemara comments: The language of the verse <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as it is written </b>with regard to Asa: <b>“And he said to Judah: Let us build these cities”</b> (II Chronicles 14:6), which proves <b>by inference that they had</b> already <b>been cities at the outset,</b> and that he did not build new cities. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that it is so.
§ <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>said: Women are obligated in the reading of the Megilla, as they too were</b> significant partners <b>in that miracle. And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>said:</b> When <b>Purim occurs on Shabbat, one asks</b> questions <b>and expounds upon the subject of the day.</b>
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the last <i>halakha</i>: <b>Why</b> was it necessary to <b>specify Purim?</b> The same principle applies <b>also to the Festivals, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses enacted for the Jewish people that they should ask</b> questions about <b>and expound upon the subject of the day:</b> They should occupy themselves with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover on Passover,</b> with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Shavuot</i> on <i>Shavuot</i>, and</b> with the <b><i>halakhot</i> of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>.
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to mention <b>Purim, lest you say</b> that when Purim falls on Shabbat <b>we should decree</b> that it is prohibited to expound upon the <i>halakhot</i> of the day <b>due to</b> the concern of <b>Rabba,</b> who said that the reason the Megilla is not read on a Purim that falls on Shabbat is due to a concern that one carry the Megilla in the public domain. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>therefore teaches us</b> that expounding the <i>halakhot</i> of the day is not prohibited as a preventive measure lest one read the Megilla on Shabbat.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> further <b>said</b> with regard to Purim: <b>A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>to repeat it</b> [<b><i>lishnota</i></b>] <b>during the day, as it is stated: “O my God, I call by day but You do not answer; and at night, and there is no surcease for me”</b> (Psalms 22:3), which alludes to reading the Megilla both by day and by night.
Some of the students who heard this statement <b>understood from it</b> that one is obligated <b>to read</b> the Megilla <b>at night and to study its</b> relevant tractate of <b>Mishna by day,</b> as the term <i>lishnota</i> can be understood to mean studying Mishna. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to them: It was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba himself</b> that the term <i>lishnota</i> here has a different connotation, <b>for example, as people say: I will conclude this section and repeat it,</b> i.e., I will review my studies. Similarly, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s statement means that one must repeat the reading of the Megilla by day after reading it at night.
The Gemara notes that this ruling <b>was also stated</b> by another <i>amora</i>, as <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Ulla Bira’a said: A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>repeat it during the day, as it is stated: “So that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent; O Lord, my God, I will give thanks to You forever”</b> (Psalms 30:13). The dual formulation of singing praise and not being silent alludes to reading the Megilla both by night and by day.
§ We learned in the mishna that residents of unwalled towns read the Megilla on the fourteenth of Adar; <b>however,</b> residents of <b>villages may advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> the Monday or Thursday preceding Purim. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The Sages were lenient with the villages</b> and allowed them <b>to advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, so that they</b> could be free to <b>provide water and food to their brethren in the cities</b> on the day of Purim. If everyone would be busy reading the Megilla on the fourteenth, the residents of the cities would not have enough to eat.

Daf 4b

The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> this ordinance is <b>for the benefit of the cities? Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if the fourteenth <b>occurred on a Monday, the</b> residents of <b>villages and large towns read it on that very day? If it is so,</b> that the ordinance allowing the villagers to sometimes advance their reading of the Megilla is for the benefit of the cities, <b>let</b> the villagers <b>advance</b> their reading <b>to the</b> previous <b>day of assembly</b> even when the fourteenth occurs on a Monday. The Gemara responds: That would mean that Megilla reading <b>for them</b> would take place on <b>the tenth</b> of Adar, <b>and the Sages did not establish the tenth</b> of Adar as a day that is fit to read the Megilla.
The Gemara continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different statement of the mishna: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on a Thursday, the villages and large towns read</b> it <b>on that day,</b> the fourteenth, <b>and the walled cities</b> read it <b>on the next day,</b> the fifteenth. <b>If it is so,</b> that the ordinance is for the benefit of the cities, <b>let</b> the villagers <b>advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the</b> previous <b>day of assembly,</b> i.e., the previous Monday, as it is <b>the eleventh</b> of Adar. The Gemara responds: <b>We do not defer</b> the reading of the Megilla <b>from</b> one <b>day of assembly to</b> another <b>day of assembly.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following mishna (5a): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is the Megilla read from the eleventh of Adar and onward? <b>In a place where</b> the villagers generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday. However,</b> in a <b>place where they do not</b> generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday, one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the fourteenth of Adar. The Gemara infers: <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that the ordinance is for <b>the benefit of the cities,</b> would it be reasonable to suggest that <b>because</b> the villagers <b>do not enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday the</b> residents of the <b>cities</b> should <b>lose out</b> and not be provided with food and water?
The Gemara accepts this argument: <b>Do not say</b> that the Sages allowed the villages to advance their reading of the Megilla to the day of assembly <b>so that they</b> can be free to <b>provide water and food to their brethren in the cities</b> on the day of Purim. <b>Rather, say</b> that the Sages were lenient with them <b>because</b> the villages <b>supply water and food to their brethren in the cities.</b> This ordinance was established for the benefit of the villagers so that they should not have to make an extra trip to the cities to hear the reading of the Megilla. However, in a place where the villages do not go to the cities, advancing their reading of the Megilla to the day of assembly will not benefit them, and therefore they must read on the fourteenth.
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>How so?</b> If the fourteenth of Adar <b>occurs on Monday, the villages and large towns read</b> it <b>on that day.</b> The mishna continues to explain the days on which the Megilla is read. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which employs the order</b> of the dates <b>of the month,</b> i.e., the eleventh of Adar, <b>and the latter clause, which employs the order of the days</b> of the week, i.e., Monday?
The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the days of the week <b>would be reversed</b> if the latter clause was organized according to the dates of the month, as the mishna would first have to mention a case where the fourteenth occurs on a Sunday, then a case where it occurs on a Wednesday or Shabbat, and then a case where it occurs on a Friday or Tuesday, the mishna <b>employed the order of the days</b> of the week in order to avoid confusion.
§ We learned in the mishna: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat eve,</b> Friday, the villages advance their reading to the day of assembly, i.e., Thursday, and the large towns and walled cities read it on Friday, the fourteenth of Adar. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna?</b> It can be <b>either Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>or Rabbi Yosei.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat eve, villages and large towns advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., Thursday, <b>and walled cities read it on the day</b> of Purim, Friday. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi disagrees and <b>says: I say</b> that <b>the</b> readings in the large <b>towns should not be deferred from their</b> usual <b>date,</b> i.e., the fourteenth of Adar. <b>Rather, both these,</b> the large towns <b>and those,</b> the walled cities, <b>read</b> the Megilla <b>on the day</b> of Purim.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The Gemara explains that it is <b>as it is written:</b> “To keep these two days, according to their writing and according to their time, <b>in every year”</b> (Esther 9:27), which indicates that Purim must be celebrated every year in similar fashion. <b>Just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year</b> the large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day, <b>so too here the</b> large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day. Consequently, since the walled cities cannot read the Megilla on Shabbat and they are required to advance the reading to Friday, the large towns must also advance their reading a day to Thursday.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year”</b> indicate that <b>just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the</b> Megilla readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns are not deferred from their</b> usual <b>date</b> and they read the Megilla on the fourteenth, <b>so too here the</b> Megilla readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns should not be deferred from their</b> usual <b>date</b> and they too should read on the fourteenth. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> for the large towns to fulfill all of the conditions at the same time, i.e., to read on the fourteenth and to read a day before the walled cities.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what is</b> his <b>reason?</b> The Gemara explains that it is also based upon the words <b>“in every year”; just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the</b> readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns are not deferred from their</b> usual <b>date</b> and they read on the fourteenth, <b>so too here, the</b> readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns are not deferred from their</b> usual <b>date,</b> but rather they read on the fourteenth.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year”</b> indicate that <b>just as every year the</b> large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day, and read on the fourteenth, <b>so too here the</b> large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day, and read on the thirteenth. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> to fulfill all of the conditions at the same time, i.e., to read on the fourteenth and to read a day before the walled cities.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat eve, the walled cities and villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, and the large towns read</b> it <b>on the day</b> of Purim <b>itself. Rabbi Yosei says: The walled cities never precede the</b> large <b>towns; rather, both these,</b> the large towns, <b>and those,</b> the walled cities, <b>read on that day,</b> i.e., Friday, the fourteenth of Adar.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>? As it is written: “In every year”; just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the</b> large <b>towns</b> read the Megilla <b>on the fourteenth, and the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla, as the large towns and walled cities never read the Megilla on the same day, <b>so too here, the</b> large <b>towns</b> read the Megilla <b>on the fourteenth, and the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla. Therefore, the walled cities must advance their reading of the Megilla by two days to the day of assembly, Thursday.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year”</b> indicate that <b>just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the walled cities do not precede the</b> large <b>towns, so too here, the walled cities do not precede the</b> large <b>towns.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> to fulfill all of the conditions at the same time, i.e., that the large towns should read on the fourteenth, the large towns and the walled cities should read on different days, and the walled cities should not precede the large towns.
<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei?</b> It is based upon the words <b>“in every year”; just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the walled cities do not precede the</b> large towns, <b>so too here, the walled cities do not precede the</b> large <b>towns.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year” indicate</b> that <b>just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year, the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla, <b>so too here, the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla. Therefore, since the large towns read on the fourteenth, the walled cities read on the thirteenth. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> to fulfill all the conditions. It is clear from these <i>baraitot</i> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna can either be Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi or Rabbi Yosei, but not either of two anonymous <i>tanna’im</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi really <b>hold that one does not defer</b> the reading of the Megilla in large towns <b>to the day of assembly? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat, the villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, the large towns read</b> it <b>on Shabbat eve, and the walled cities</b> read it <b>the next day,</b> i.e., on Sunday. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>since the</b> readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns were</b> already <b>deferred from their</b> usual <b>date,</b> i.e., the fourteenth, <b>they are deferred to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., to Thursday. Consequently, even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees that the reading in the large towns can be shifted to the day of assembly. Why doesn’t he also hold that large towns read the Megilla on the day of assembly when the fourteenth occurs on a Friday?
The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, the designated <b>time for them</b> to read the Megilla <b>is Shabbat,</b> but the Megilla is not read on Shabbat, and therefore they must read it on a different day. Therefore, <b>since</b> the readings in the large towns have been <b>deferred, they are deferred</b> an additional day, and take place on Thursday, the day of assembly, at the same time as the readings in the villages. <b>Here, their</b> designated <b>time is Shabbat eve,</b> and there is no reason to move the reading from that day.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> When <b>Purim occurs on Shabbat,</b> the reading of the Megilla in <b>all</b> places is <b>deferred to the day of assembly?</b> The Gemara corrects the wording of Rav Huna’s statement: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> to say that the reading of the Megilla in <b>all</b> places is deferred to the day of assembly? <b>Aren’t there walled cities that perform</b> this ceremony <b>the next day,</b> i.e., on Sunday? <b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna’s statement should say as follows: <b>All</b> readings <b>that are deferred are deferred to the day of assembly. In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this stated? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>In any case,</b> it is apparent from the mishna and the <i>baraitot</i> that <b>everyone agrees that one does not read the</b> Megilla <b>on Shabbat. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabba said: Everyone is obligated</b> to participate in <b>reading the Megilla</b> on Purim <b>and blowing the <i>shofar</i></b> on Rosh HaShana, <b>and not everyone is proficient in reading the Megilla.</b> Therefore, the Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that the Megilla is not read on Shabbat, <b>lest one take</b> the Megilla <b>in his hand and go to an expert to learn</b> how to read it or to hear the expert read it, <b>and,</b> due to his preoccupation, he will <b>carry it four cubits in the public domain,</b> and thereby desecrate Shabbat.
The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> same concern for the sanctity of Shabbat <b>is the reason</b> that the Sages decreed <b>that the <i>shofar</i></b> is not blown when Rosh HaShana occurs on Shabbat. <b>And this</b> same concern <b>is the reason</b> that the Sages decreed that one may not take <b>the <i>lulav</i></b> on Shabbat.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that there is another reason the Megilla is not read on Shabbat: <b>Because the eyes of the poor are raised to the reading of the Megilla.</b> The poor await the day on which the Megilla is read, because on that day gifts are distributed to the poor. If the Megilla is read on Shabbat, it will not be possible to distribute gifts to the poor, who will be deeply disappointed. The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said that the villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, they</b> also <b>collect</b> the gifts for the poor <b>on that day, and they distribute</b> them to the poor <b>on that day.</b>
The Gemara is troubled by the wording of this <i>baraita</i>. Does the <i>baraita</i> read: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said? On the contrary,</b> it is <b>because they said</b> that the villages advance their reading to the day of assembly that the gifts must be collected and distributed to the poor on that very day. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: <b>Since</b> the Sages <b>said that the villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, they collect</b> the gifts for the poor <b>on that day and they distribute</b> them <b>on that day, because the eyes of the poor are raised to the reading of the Megilla,</b> and they should not be disappointed. <b>However,</b>

Daf 5a

<b>the rejoicing</b> that takes place on Purim <b>is practiced only in its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the fourteenth of Adar.
§ <b>Rav said: One may read the Megilla in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> i.e., on the fourteenth of Adar, <b>even privately.</b> However, when it is read <b>not at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> e.g., when the villages advance their reading to the day of assembly, it must be read <b>with</b> a quorum of <b>ten,</b> because the enactment allowing the Megilla to be read before its proper time was only made for a community. <b>Rav Asi</b> disagreed and <b>said: Both at its</b> proper <b>time and not at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> the Megilla must be read <b>with</b> a quorum of <b>ten.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>there was an incident</b> where <b>Rav</b> had to read the Megilla on Purim, <b>and he was concerned for this</b> opinion of <b>Rav Asi</b> and gathered ten men even though he was reading the Megilla in its proper time, on the fourteenth of Adar.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that when the Megilla is read not at its proper time, it can only be read with a quorum of ten? <b>Didn’t Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, say in the name of Rav:</b> If <b>Purim occurs on Shabbat, Shabbat eve is</b> the proper <b>time</b> for reading the Megilla? The Gemara expresses surprise with regard to the wording of Rav’s statement: Is <b>Shabbat eve</b> the proper <b>time</b> for reading the Megilla? <b>Isn’t Shabbat</b> itself <b>its</b> proper <b>time? Rather, is it not</b> true <b>that this is what</b> he <b>said,</b> i.e., that this is the way his statement should be understood: Reading the Megilla <b>not at its</b> proper <b>time is like</b> reading it <b>at its</b> proper <b>time; just as at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> it can be read <b>even privately, so too, not at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> it can be read <b>even privately.</b>
The Gemara rejects this argument: Rav’s statement was <b>not</b> made <b>with regard to reading the Megilla with</b> a quorum of <b>ten. Rather, what</b> is the meaning of Rav’s statement that <b>Shabbat eve is</b> the proper <b>time?</b> It was meant <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said: Since</b> the readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns were</b> already <b>deferred from their</b> usual <b>date</b> and the Megilla was not read on the fourteenth, <b>they are deferred to the day of assembly. This</b> statement of Rav <b>teaches us that Shabbat eve is</b> the proper <b>time</b> for these towns to read the Megilla, as stated in the mishna.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What is</b> considered <b>a large city,</b> where the Megilla is read on the fourteenth of Adar? <b>Any</b> city <b>in which there are ten idlers.</b> However, if there are <b>fewer than that, it is</b> considered <b>a village,</b> even if it has many inhabitants.
<b>It was with regard to these</b> times for reading the Megilla that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one advances</b> the reading of the Megilla before the fourteenth of Adar <b>and one does not postpone</b> the reading to after its proper time. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>the time</b> when families of <b>priests</b> donate <b>wood</b> for the fire on the altar, which were times those families would treat as Festivals; as well as the fast of the <b>Ninth of Av;</b> the <b>Festival</b> peace-offering that was brought on the Festivals; <b>and the</b> commandment of <b>assembly</b> [<b><i>hakhel</i></b>] of the entire Jewish people in the Temple courtyard on <i>Sukkot</i> in the year following the Sabbatical year to hear the king read the book of Deuteronomy; <b>one postpones</b> their observance until after Shabbat <b>and does not advance</b> their observance to before Shabbat.
The mishna continues: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one advances</b> the time for reading the Megilla <b>and one does not postpone</b> the reading, one is <b>permitted</b> to <b>eulogize and fast</b> on these days, as they are not actually Purim; nevertheless, <b>gifts for the poor</b> are distributed on this day. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is the Megilla read on the day of assembly, before the fourteenth of Adar? In <b>a place where</b> the villagers generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday. However,</b> in <b>a place where they do not</b> generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday, one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the fourteenth of Adar.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that a large city is one that has ten idlers. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>ten idlers</b> that are mentioned here are ten idlers <b>that are in the synagogue,</b> i.e., men who do not have professional responsibilities other than to sit in the synagogue and attend to communal religious needs. The presence of ten such men establishes a location as a prominent city.
We learned in the mishna: <b>It was with regard to these</b> times for reading the Megilla that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one advances</b> the reading of the Megilla <b>and one does not postpone</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b>verse states:</b> “The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all who joined themselves to them, <b>and it shall not pass,</b> that they should keep these two days” (Esther 9:27), which indicates that the designated time must not pass without the reading of the Megilla.
Having mentioned a teaching of Rabbi Abba in the name of Shmuel, the Gemara cites another of his statements: <b>And Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not count days to</b> make up <b>years,</b> i.e., a year is considered to be comprised of either twelve or thirteen lunar months, and not 365 days? <b>As it is stated: “Of the months of the year”</b> (Exodus 12:2), which indicates that <b>you count months to</b> make up <b>years, but you do not count days</b> to make up <b>years.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And the Sages of Caesarea said in the name of Rabbi Abba: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not calculate hours to</b> reckon the <b>months?</b> A lunar cycle takes approximately twenty-nine and a half days, but a calendar month is considered to be twenty-nine or thirty full days and not precisely a lunar cycle. <b>As it is stated: “Until a month of days”</b> (Numbers 11:20), which indicates that <b>you calculate days to</b> reckon the <b>months, but you do not calculate hours to</b> reckon the <b>months.</b>
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>the time</b> when families of <b>priests</b> donate <b>wood</b> for the fire on the altar, the fast of <b>the Ninth of Av, the Festival</b> peace-offering, <b>and the</b> commandment of <b>assembly [<i>hakhel</i>], one postpones</b> their observance until after Shabbat <b>and does not advance</b> their observance to before Shabbat. The Gemara explains the reason for this <i>halakha</i> with respect to each item mentioned in the mishna. The fast of <b>the Ninth of Av</b> is not advanced because <b>one does not advance calamity;</b> since the Ninth of Av is a tragic time, its observance is postponed as long as possible. <b>The Festival</b> peace-offering <b>and the</b> commandment of <b>assembly [<i>hakhel</i>]</b> are not advanced <b>because the time of their obligation has not yet arrived,</b> and it is impossible to fulfill mitzvot before the designated time has arrived.
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One postpones the Festival</b> peace-offering <b>and the entire time</b> period <b>of the Festival</b> peace-offering. The Gemara attempts to clarify this statement: <b>Granted</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> says that the <b>Festival</b> peace-offering is postponed, it means <b>that if</b> a Festival <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> when the Festival peace-offering cannot be sacrificed, <b>one postpones it until after Shabbat</b> and sacrifices the offering on the intermediate days of the Festival. <b>However, what is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>The time</b> period <b>of the Festival</b> peace-offering?
<b>Rav Oshaya said: This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> One postpones <b>the Festival</b> peace-offering if the Festival occurs <b>on Shabbat, and one postpones the</b> burnt-offering <b>of appearance even</b> due to <b>the Festival</b> itself. Despite the fact that a Festival day is <b>the time</b> for sacrificing a <b>Festival</b> peace-offering, the burnt-offering of appearance may not be sacrificed until after the Festival day.
The Gemara adds: <b>Whose</b> opinion is reflected in the mishna according to Rav Oshaya’s explanation? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Beitza</i> 19a) that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may bring</b> peace-offerings <b>on a Festival</b> day to be sacrificed in the Temple. Most portions of a peace-offering are eaten by the priests and the individual who brought the offering. Consequently, its slaughter is considered food preparation, which is permitted on a Festival day. <b>And one may not place</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of the offering, as that includes leaning with all one’s might upon the animal, which is prohibited on a Festival.
<b>However,</b> burnt-offerings <b>may not</b> be brought at all on the Festival. Since they are not eaten, their slaughter is not considered food preparation, and it therefore constitutes a prohibited labor on the Festival. <b>Beit Hillel</b> disagree and <b>say: One may bring</b> both peace-offerings <b>and</b> burnt-offerings on a Festival day, <b>and one may</b> even <b>place</b> his <b>hands on them.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>One postpones the Festival</b> peace-offering <b>for the entire time</b> period <b>of the Festival</b> peace-offering, i.e., for the entire duration of the Festival. However, it may <b>not</b> be postponed for <b>longer</b> than this. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 9a): <b>One who did not offer the Festival</b> peace-offering <b>on the first Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>may offer the Festival</b> peace-offering <b>for the</b> duration of the <b>entire pilgrimage Festival,</b> including the intermediate days <b>and the last day of the Festival.</b> If <b>the pilgrimage Festival has passed and he did not</b> yet <b>bring the Festival</b> peace-offering, <b>he is not obligated</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b> The obligation is no longer in force, and he therefore is not liable to bring another offering as compensation.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>The Festival</b> peace-offering <b>may be postponed for the entire time</b> period <b>of a Festival</b> peace-offering. This indicates that <b>even</b> if <b><i>Shavuot</i>, which is one day,</b> occurs on Shabbat, <b>one postpones</b> the Festival peace-offering and offers it on one of the six days after <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 17a): Beit Hillel <b>concede that if <i>Shavuot</i> occurs on Shabbat, the day of slaughter is after Shabbat.</b> Since the Festival peace-offering and the burnt-offering of appearance cannot be sacrificed on Shabbat, they are slaughtered after Shabbat. This indicates that the Festival peace-offering may be slaughtered after the Festival day of <i>Shavuot</i>, as is the case on the other Festivals.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi did several unusual things: <b>He planted a sapling on Purim,</b> and was not concerned about performing labor and thereby possibly denigrating the day.

Daf 5b

<b>And he bathed</b> at the time when the <b>wagons [<i>kerona</i>]</b> were traveling through <b>Tzippori,</b> i.e., on the market day, when the public would know about it, <b>on the seventeenth of Tammuz,</b> to show that bathing is permitted on that day. <b>And he sought to abolish</b> the fast of <b>the Ninth of Av. And</b> with respect to the Ninth of Av, the Sages <b>did not agree with him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>My teacher, the incident did not</b> occur in <b>this</b> fashion. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi never sought to abolish the fast of the Ninth of Av. <b>Rather, it was</b> a year when <b>the Ninth of Av occurred on Shabbat, and they postponed it until after Shabbat. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> about that case: <b>Since it has</b> already <b>been deferred</b> from its usual time, <b>let it be</b> altogether <b>deferred</b> this year. <b>And the Rabbis did not agree with him.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Abba bar Zavda: <b>“Two are better than one”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:9), meaning, it is good that you were here to provide an accurate report about that incident.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> could <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>plant a sapling on Purim? Didn’t Rav Yosef teach</b> with regard to the verse: “Therefore the Jews of the villages, who dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of <b>gladness and feasting, and a good day [<i>yom tov</i>]”</b> (Esther 9:19), that the term <b>“gladness” teaches that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>eulogize</b> on Purim; <b>“feasting” teaches that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>fast; and</b> the term <b>“good day” [<i>yom tov</i>] teaches that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>perform labor,</b> just as on a Festival, which is also referred to as a <i>yom tov</i>? <b>Rather,</b> what happened was as follows: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi was in a place that observed Purim <b>on the fourteenth, and when he planted</b> the sapling, <b>he planted</b> it <b>on the fifteenth.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Wasn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>in Tiberias, and Tiberias was surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun.</b> Consequently, he was obligated to observe Purim on the fifteenth. <b>Rather,</b> say just the opposite: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi lived in a place that observed Purim <b>on the fifteenth, and when he planted</b> the sapling, <b>he planted</b> it <b>on the fourteenth.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Was it obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>that</b> the city of <b>Tiberias was surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun? Didn’t Hezekiah read</b> the Megilla <b>in Tiberias</b> both <b>on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth</b> of Adar, because <b>he was uncertain if</b> it had been <b>surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, or not?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Hezekiah was</b> indeed <b>uncertain</b> about the matter, whereas <b>it was obvious to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that Tiberias had been surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua.
The Gemara asks further: <b>And when it was obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that the Megilla should be read in Tiberias on the fifteenth, <b>was it permitted</b> to plant there on the fourteenth? <b>Isn’t it written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i></b> that <b>the fourteenth day and the fifteenth day of Adar are the days of Purim,</b> and <b>one is not</b> permitted <b>to eulogize on them?</b>
<b>And Rava said:</b> This statement <b>is necessary only to prohibit</b> those who observe Purim <b>on this</b> day to eulogize <b>on that</b> day, <b>and</b> those who observe Purim <b>on that</b> day to eulogize <b>on this</b> day. Since the two days are mentioned in the Bible, it was only necessary to mention them in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> in order to indicate that the prohibition against eulogizing applies to both days. Presumably, the same should apply to the prohibition against performing labor. Consequently, how could Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi plant a sapling on the fourteenth of Adar? The Gemara answers: <b>That applies</b> only to <b>eulogies and fasting. However, labor</b> is prohibited for only <b>one day,</b> either the fourteenth or the fifteenth, <b>and no more.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav see a certain man planting flax on Purim, and cursed him, and</b> the man’s <b>flax never grew.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the man <b>was</b> obligated to observe Purim <b>on that day</b> that he planted the flax. Therefore, it was certainly prohibited to perform labor.
<b>Rabba, son of Rava, said</b> a different answer to the question: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi planted the sapling <b>on his</b> own <b>day</b> of Purim, i.e., on the day that the Megilla was read in his location, it was still permitted to plant the sapling. This is because the Jewish people <b>accepted upon themselves</b> the prohibitions against <b>eulogizing and fasting</b> on Purim, but <b>they did not accept upon themselves the prohibition</b> against performing <b>labor.</b>
This can be proven from the fact <b>that initially,</b> when Mordecai and Esther proposed the celebration of Purim, <b>it is written:</b> “A day of <b>gladness and feasting and a good day [<i>yom tov</i>]”</b> (Esther 9:19), <b>and at the end,</b> when the celebration of Purim was accepted by the Jewish people, <b>it is written:</b> “That they should <b>make them days of feasting and gladness”</b> (Esther 9:22), <b>whereas</b> the term <b>good day [<i>yom tov</i>],</b> which alludes to a day when it is prohibited to perform labor, <b>is not written.</b> The people never accepted upon themselves the prohibition against performing labor on Purim as if it were a Festival, and therefore the prohibition never took effect.
The Gemara asks: If labor is permitted on Purim, <b>what is the reason that Rav cursed that man</b> who planted the flax? The Gemara answers: <b>It was</b> a case of <b>matters that are permitted</b> by <i>halakha</i>, <b>but others were accustomed to</b> treat <b>them as a prohibition,</b> in which case one may not permit these actions in their presence, lest they come to treat other prohibitions lightly. In the place where that man planted his flax, it was customary to abstain from labor on Purim. However, <b>in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>place, it was not the custom</b> to abstain from labor on Purim, and therefore it was permitted for him to plant the sapling even in public.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> an alternative answer: <b>Actually, it was the custom</b> to abstain from labor on Purim in Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s place, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi engaged in a <b>joyful</b> act of <b>planting,</b> for pleasure rather than for financial benefit. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to public fasts: If <b>these</b> fasts for rain <b>have passed and</b> the community’s prayers <b>have</b> still <b>not been answered,</b> and the drought continues, <b>one decreases his business</b> activities, as well as <b>construction, planting, betrothals, and marriages.</b>
<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>about this</b> mishna: When the Sages said that <b>construction</b> must be decreased on public fasts, they were not referring to the construction of homes for people who have nowhere to live, but to <b>joyful construction.</b> Similarly, when they said that <b>planting</b> must be decreased, they were not referring to planting food crops, but to <b>joyful planting. What is</b> meant by <b>joyful construction? This</b> is referring to <b>one who builds a wedding chamber for his son.</b> It was customary to build a special house where the wedding would take place, and at times the couple would also live there. <b>What is</b> meant by <b>joyful planting? This</b> is referring to <b>one who plants</b> trees for shade and pleasure such as one might find in <b>a royal garden</b> [<b><i>avurneki</i></b>]. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi engaged in joyful planting on Purim, in keeping with the joyous nature of the day.
§ The Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the previous discussion. <b>Hezekiah read</b> the Megilla <b>in Tiberias</b> both <b>on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth</b> of Adar, because <b>he was uncertain if it</b> had been <b>surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, or not.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was he</b> really <b>uncertain about the matter of Tiberias? Isn’t it written: “And the fortified cities were Ziddim-zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth”</b> (Joshua 19:35)<b>, and we maintain</b> that <b>Rakkath is Tiberias?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is the reason that he was uncertain:</b> Although Tiberias was surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua, Hezekiah was uncertain about the <i>halakha</i> <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> on <b>one side, there was a wall of the sea,</b> i.e., there was no physical wall, but the city was protected due to the fact that it adjoined the sea.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why was he uncertain?</b> The sea is <b>certainly not a wall. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the sale of houses in walled cities, the phrase: <b>“Which has a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), indicates that the city has a bona fide wall <b>and not</b> merely <b>a wall of roofs.</b> If a city is completely encircled by attached houses but there is no separate wall, it is not considered a walled city. The next verse, which is referring to cities that have no wall <b>“round about</b> them” (Leviticus 25:31), <b>excludes Tiberias</b> from being considered a walled city, <b>as the sea is its wall</b> on one side and it is not fully encircled by a physical wall. Consequently, Tiberias is not considered a walled city.
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to</b> the sale of <b>houses of walled cities,</b> Hezekiah <b>was not uncertain. Where he was uncertain was with regard to the reading of the Megilla: What are the unwalled towns and what are the walled cities that are written with regard to the reading of the Megilla?</b> Is the difference between them <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that these</b> unwalled towns <b>are exposed, whereas those</b> walled cities <b>are not exposed?</b> If so, since Tiberias <b>is also exposed,</b> as it is not entirely surrounded by a wall, it should be considered unwalled. <b>Or perhaps</b> the difference is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that these</b> walled cities <b>are protected, whereas those</b> unwalled towns <b>are not protected, and</b> Tiberias <b>is also protected</b> by the sea and should be treated as a walled city. It was <b>due to that</b> reason that Hezekiah <b>was uncertain</b> when to read the Megilla.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Asi read the Megilla in</b> the city of <b>Huzal</b> in Babylonia on both <b>the fourteenth and the fifteenth</b> of Adar, because <b>he was uncertain if</b> it had been <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, or not.</b> Huzal was an ancient city, and it was possible that it had been surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua. <b>Some say</b> a different version of this report, according to which there was no uncertainty. <b>Rav Asi said: This</b> city of <b>Huzal of the house of Benjamin was walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun.</b>
Incidental to the previous discussion concerning Tiberias, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When I was a child I said something that I</b> later <b>asked the Elders</b> about,

Daf 6a

<b>and it was found in accordance with my</b> opinion. I said that <b>Hammath is Tiberias. And why was it called Hammath? On account of the hot springs of [<i>ḥammei</i>] Tiberias</b> that are located there. And I said that <b>Rakkath is Tzippori. And why was it called Rakkath? Because it is raised</b> above the surrounding areas <b>like the bank [<i>rakta</i>] of a river.</b> And I said that <b>Chinnereth is Ginosar. And why was it called Chinnereth? Because its fruit are sweet like the sound of a harp [<i>kinnor</i>].</b>
<b>Rava said: Is there anyone who says that Rakkath is not Tiberias? Isn’t</b> it true that <b>when a</b> great <b>man dies here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they lament his</b> demise <b>there,</b> in Tiberias, <b>as follows: Great was he in Sheshakh,</b> i.e., Babylonia (see Jeremiah 25:26), <b>and he had a name in Rakkath?</b> Furthermore, <b>when they bring up the casket</b> of an important person <b>to there,</b> to Tiberias, <b>they lament his</b> demise <b>as follows:</b> You <b>lovers</b> of <b>the remnants</b> of the Jewish people, <b>residents of Rakkath, go out and receive the dead from the deep,</b> i.e., the low-lying lands of Babylonia.
Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>when Rabbi Zeira died, a certain eulogizer opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> with these words: <b>The land of Shinar,</b> i.e., Babylonia, Rabbi Zeira’s birthplace, <b>conceived and bore</b> him; <b>the land of the deer,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, where Rabbi Zeira lived as an adult and rose to prominence, <b>raised her delights. Woe unto her, said Rakkath, for she has lost her precious instrument.</b> It is apparent from these examples that Rakkath is Tiberias.
<b>Rather, Rabba said: Hammath is the hot springs of Gerar</b> that are adjacent to Tiberias; <b>Rakkath is Tiberias;</b> and <b>Chinnereth is Ginosar. And why was</b> Tiberias <b>called Rakkath? Because even the empty ones [<i>reikanin</i>] of</b> Tiberias <b>are</b> as <b>full of mitzvot as a pomegranate</b> is full of seeds. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> In fact, <b>Rakkath is its</b> real <b>name; and why was it called Tiberias? Because it sits in the</b> very <b>center</b> [<b><i>tabbur</i></b>] <b>of Eretz Yisrael. Rava said: Rakkath is its</b> real <b>name, and why was it called Tiberias? Because its appearance is good [<i>tova re’iyyata</i></b>].
§ While continuing to identify places that are mentioned in the Bible, <b>Zeira said:</b> The city of <b>Kitron</b> that is mentioned in the Bible <b>is</b> the city of <b>Tzippori. And why was it called Tzippori? Because it sits on top of a mountain like a bird [<i>tzippor</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is Kitron</b> really <b>Tzippori? Wasn’t Kitron in the</b> tribal <b>territory of Zebulun, as it is written: “Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol”</b> (Judges 1:30)? <b>And</b> the tribe of <b>Zebulun was resentful of its portion, as it is stated: “Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the death”</b> (Judges 5:18). <b>What is the reason</b> for their resentfulness? <b>Because “Naphtali was on the high places of the field”</b> (Judges 5:18).
The verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>Zebulun said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe! To my brothers,</b> the tribes whose territory is adjacent to mine, <b>You gave fields and vineyards, whereas to me You gave mountains and hills; to my brothers You gave lands, whereas to me You gave seas and rivers.</b> God <b>said</b> back <b>to him:</b> Nevertheless, <b>all will need you due to the <i>ḥilazon</i>,</b> the small sea creature residing in your territory that is the source of the dye used in the ritual fringes [<i>tzitzit</i>]. <b>As it is stated</b> in Moses’ blessing to Zebulun: <b>“They shall call the people to the mountain:</b> There they shall sacrifice offerings of righteousness; for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, <b>and of the hidden treasures of the sand”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:19).
<b>Rav Yosef teaches</b> about this: <b>“Treasures”; this is</b> referring to <b>the <i>ḥilazon</i>,</b> which is found in the waters of Zebulun. <b>“Hidden”; this is</b> referring to the <b><i>tarit</i>,</b> a type of sardine, which is also found in Zebulun’s coastal waters. <b>“Sand”; this is</b> referring to the sand from which <b>white glass</b> is made. Zebulun <b>said to Him:</b> All of these resources are indeed found in my territory, but <b>Master of the Universe, who will inform me</b> if others take them without permission? <b>He said to</b> the tribe of Zebulun: <b>“There they shall sacrifice offerings of righteousness.” This shall be a sign for you</b> that <b>anyone who takes</b> these items <b>from you without</b> making <b>payment will not prosper at all in his business.</b>
It is clear from the exposition of the verse in Judges that the territory of Zebulun did not contain fields and vineyards. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Kitron is Tzippori, why was</b> Zebulun <b>resentful of his portion? Wasn’t Tzippori</b> in his territory, which was land that was <b>vastly superior</b> with regard to its produce? <b>And if you would say that</b> Zebulun’s portion <b>did not have</b> quality land <b>flowing with milk and honey, didn’t Reish Lakish say: I myself have seen</b> the land <b>flowing with milk and honey</b> around <b>Tzippori, and it was sixteen <i>mil</i> by sixteen <i>mil</i>?</b>
<b>And if you would say that</b> the part of <b>his</b> territory that flowed with milk and honey <b>was not as vast as</b> that of <b>his brothers,</b> the other tribes, <b>didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I myself have seen</b> the land <b>flowing with milk and honey</b> over <b>all of Eretz Yisrael. And</b> the size of the fertile land <b>was like</b> the distance <b>from Bei Kovei to the fortress of Tulbakni,</b> a total of <b>twenty-two parasangs [<i>parsa</i>] in length and six parasangs in width.</b> A parasang is four <i>mil</i>; consequently, the area flowing with milk and honey around Tzippori was four by four parasangs, which is more than the fair share of one tribe among twelve.
The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, fields and vineyards were preferable to</b> Zebulun. The fertile land in Zebulun’s territory is in a mountainous region, which makes it more difficult to cultivate. The Gemara comments: The language of the verse <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as it is written: “And Naphtali was on the high places of the field,”</b> which indicates that Zebulun’s complaint was due to the fact that Naphtali had fields. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is so.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion with regard to identifying places mentioned in the Bible. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: “And Ekron shall be uprooted”</b> (Zephaniah 2:4). <b>This is</b> an allusion to <b>Caesarea, daughter of Edom, which is situated among the sands.</b> Caesarea was primarily populated by Greeks and Romans, and it served as the seat of Roman rule when the Romans, who are identified with Edom in Jewish literature, ruled Eretz Yisrael. <b>And it was a spike stuck in</b> the side of <b>the Jewish people</b> already <b>in the days of the Greeks,</b> as it was an obstacle to the spread of Jewish settlement. <b>When the Hasmonean monarchy prevailed and triumphed over them, they called it: The captured tower of Shir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his detestable things from between his teeth, and he also shall be a remnant for our God;</b> and he shall be as a chief in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite” (Zechariah 9:7)? The verse should be understood as follows: <b>“And I will take away his blood out of his mouth”; this is</b> referring to <b>their house of altars,</b> where they sacrifice offerings. <b>“And his detestable things from between his teeth”; this is</b> referring to <b>their house of piles,</b> where they heap their ritual stones.
<b>“And he also shall be a remnant for our God,” these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the synagogues and study halls in Edom. “And he shall be as a chief</b> [<b><i>aluf</i></b> ] <b>in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite,” these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the theaters [<i>tere’atrayot</i>] and the circuses [<i>kirkesayot</i>] in Edom where the officers of Judah are destined to teach Torah in public.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> “And the children of Dan went up and fought against <b>Leshem”</b> (Joshua 19:47); <b>this is</b> referring to the city that was known in the Talmudic period as <b>Pamyas. “Ekron shall be uprooted”</b> (Zephaniah 2:4); <b>this is</b> referring to <b>Caesarea, the daughter of Edom, which was a metropolis [<i>metropolin</i>],</b> i.e., a capital city, <b>of kings. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> this means <b>that kings were raised there, and there are</b> those <b>who say</b> it means <b>that kings were appointed from there,</b> meaning the kings of Edom were appointed from among the residents of this city.
The Sages said that the fortunes of <b>Caesarea,</b> which represents Rome, <b>and Jerusalem</b> are diametric opposites. <b>If,</b> therefore, <b>someone says to you</b> that <b>both</b> cities <b>are destroyed, do not believe</b> him. Similarly, if he says to you that <b>they are both settled</b> in tranquility, <b>do not believe</b> him. If, however, he says to you that <b>Caesarea is destroyed and Jerusalem is settled,</b> or that <b>Jerusalem is destroyed and Caesarea is settled, believe</b> him. <b>As it is stated:</b> “Because Tyre has said against Jerusalem: Aha, the gates of the people have been broken; she is turned to me; <b>I shall be filled with her that is laid waste”</b> (Ezekiel 26:2), and Tyre, like Caesarea, represents Rome. Consequently, the verse indicates that <b>if this</b> city <b>is filled, that one is laid waste,</b> and <b>if</b> that city <b>is filled, this one is laid waste.</b> The two cities cannot coexist.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The same idea may be derived <b>from here,</b> a verse dealing with Jacob and Esau: <b>“And the one people shall be stronger than the other people”</b> (Genesis 25:23), teaching that when one nation rises, the other necessarily falls.
§ Having mentioned Edom, the Gemara cites what <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness;</b> in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord” (Isaiah 26:10)? <b>Isaac said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, let favor be shown to Esau,</b> my beloved son. God <b>said to him:</b> Esau <b>is wicked.</b> Isaac <b>said to</b> God: <b>“Yet will he not learn righteousness,”</b> i.e., is there no one who can find merit in him? God <b>said to him: “In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,”</b> meaning that he is destined to destroy Eretz Yisrael. Isaac <b>said to</b> God: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that he is that wicked, <b>“he will not behold the majesty of the Lord.”</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they not exalt themselves. Selah”</b> (Psalms 140:9)? <b>Jacob said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, grant not to the wicked Esau the desires of his heart,</b> as he wishes to destroy us. <b>Further not his evil device [<i>zemamo</i>];</b> do not remove the muzzle [<i>zamam</i>] that constrains him and prevents him from breaking out and gathering further strength. <b>This is</b> a reference to

Daf 6b

<b>Germamya of Edom,</b> i.e., Germany, which is near the land of Edom, i.e., Rome. <b>As, if</b> the Germans <b>would go forth, they would destroy the entire world.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ḥama Bar Ḥanina said: There are three hundred</b> young princes with <b>crowns tied</b> to their heads <b>in Germamya of Edom, and there are three hundred and sixty-five chieftains [<i>marzavnei</i>] in Rome. Every day these go out</b> to battle <b>against those, and one of them is killed, and they are preoccupied with appointing a</b> new <b>king</b> in his place. Since neither side is united, neither side is able to achieve a decisive victory. It is these wars between Rome and the Germanic tribes that act as a muzzle upon Esau-Edom-Rome and prevent it from becoming too strong.
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> in the style of a previous passage: <b>If a person says to you: I have labored and not found</b> success, <b>do not believe</b> him. Similarly, if he says to you: <b>I have not labored but</b> nevertheless <b>I have found</b> success, <b>do not believe</b> him. If, however, he says to you: <b>I have labored and I have found</b> success, <b>believe</b> him.
The Gemara comments: <b>This applies</b> only <b>to matters of Torah,</b> as success with respect to Torah study is in accordance with the toil and effort invested. <b>But with regard to</b> success in <b>business, it</b> all depends upon <b>assistance from Heaven,</b> as there is no correlation between success and effort. <b>And</b> even <b>with regard to matters of Torah, we said</b> this <b>only with regard to sharpening</b> one’s understanding of Torah, as the more one labors, the deeper the understanding of the material he achieves. <b>However, to preserve what one has learned,</b> it <b>is</b> dependent upon <b>assistance from Heaven.</b> Not everyone achieves this, even with much effort.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> also <b>said: If you see a wicked man whom the hour is smiling upon,</b> i.e., who is enjoying good fortune, <b>do not provoke him, as it is stated: “Contend not with evildoers”</b> (Psalms 37:1). <b>And not only that, but</b> if you provoke him, <b>his undertakings will be successful, as it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times”</b> (Psalms 10:5). <b>And not only that, but</b> even if he is brought to court, <b>he emerges victorious in judgment, as it is stated: “Your judgments are far above him”</b> (Psalms 10:5), as though the trial is far removed from him and does not affect him. <b>And not only that, but he will see his enemies</b> fall, <b>as it is stated: “As for all his enemies, he hisses at them”</b> (Psalms 10:5).
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, as it is stated: “They that forsake the Torah praise the wicked; but they who keep the Torah contend with them”</b> (Proverbs 28:4)? <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Dostai bar Matun said: It is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, and if a person whispers to you to say</b> that this is not so, relying on the verse: <b>“Contend not with evildoers, nor be envious against the workers of iniquity” (</b>Psalms 37:1), know that only <b>one whose heart strikes him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he committed <b>says this.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the true meaning of that verse is: <b>“Contend not with evildoers,” to be like the evildoers; “nor be envious against the workers of iniquity,” to be like the workers of iniquity. And it says</b> elsewhere: <b>“Let not your heart envy sinners,</b> but be in the fear of the Lord all the day” (Proverbs 23:17). In this context, to be envious of sinners means to desire to be like them. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Dostai indicate that one is permitted to provoke the wicked, against the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak.
The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as it can be understood that <b>this,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement that one may not provoke the wicked, is referring <b>to his</b> personal <b>matters,</b> while <b>that,</b> the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Dostai that it is permitted to provoke them, is referring <b>to matters of Heaven,</b> i.e., religious matters.
<b>And if you wish, say:</b> Both <b>this</b> statement <b>and that</b> statement are stated <b>with regard to his own affairs, and</b> still it is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that it is permitted to provoke the wicked, <b>applies to a completely righteous</b> individual; <b>that</b> statement, that one may not provoke them, <b>applies to</b> an individual <b>who is not completely righteous. As Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Why do you look upon them that deal treacherously, and remain silent when the wicked devours the man that is more righteous than he”</b> (Habakkuk 1:13)? This verse indicates that the wicked <b>devours one who is more righteous than he;</b> however, <b>he does not devour one who is completely righteous.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: When the <b>hour is smiling upon him,</b> i.e., when the wicked individual is enjoying good fortune, it <b>is different.</b> He is receiving divine assistance, and even the completely righteous should not provoke him.
§ Having mentioned Rome, the Gemara cites what <b>Ulla said. Greek Italy,</b> i.e., southern Italy, <b>is the great city of Rome, and it is three hundred parasang [<i>parsa</i>] by three hundred parasang. It has three hundred and sixty-five markets, corresponding to the number of days in the solar</b> year, <b>and the smallest of them all is</b> the market <b>of poultry sellers,</b> which <b>is sixteen <i>mil</i> by sixteen <i>mil</i>. And the king,</b> i.e., the Roman emperor, <b>dines every day in one of them.</b>
<b>And one who resides in</b> the city, <b>even if he was not born there, receives an allowance</b> for his living expenses <b>from the king’s palace. And one who was born there, even if he does not reside there,</b> also <b>receives an allowance from the king’s palace. And there are three thousand bathhouses in</b> the city, <b>and five hundred apertures that let the smoke</b> from the bathhouses <b>out beyond the walls</b> in a way that doesn’t blacken the walls themselves. <b>One side</b> of the city is bordered by the <b>sea, one side</b> by <b>mountains and hills, one side</b> by <b>a barrier of iron and one side</b> by <b>gravel [<i>ḥulsit</i>] and swamp.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the people <b>read the Megilla during the first Adar and</b> subsequently <b>the year was</b> then <b>intercalated</b> by the court and now the following month will be the second Adar, <b>one reads</b> the Megilla again <b>during the second Adar.</b> The Sages formulated a principle: <b>The difference between the first Adar and the second Adar</b> with regard to the mitzvot that are performed during those months <b>is only</b> that <b>the reading of the Megilla and</b> distributing <b>gifts to the poor</b> are performed in the second Adar and not in the first Adar.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of the sequence of</b> Torah <b>portions</b> read each year on two <i>Shabbatot</i> before Purim, the portions of <i>Shekalim</i> and <i>Zakhor</i>, and on two <i>Shabbatot</i> after Purim, <i>Para</i> and <i>HaḤodesh</i>, <b>this,</b> the first Adar, <b>and that,</b> the second Adar <b>are equal,</b> in that reading them during the first Adar exempts one from reading them in the second Adar.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>whose</b> opinion is taught in <b>the mishna? It is neither</b> the opinion of <b>the</b> anonymous <b>first <i>tanna</i></b> of the following <i>baraita</i>, <b>nor</b> that of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, nor</b> that of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>they read the Megilla during the first Adar and the year was</b> then <b>intercalated, they read it during the second Adar, as all mitzvot that are practiced during the second</b> Adar <b>are practiced in the first</b> Adar, <b>except for the reading of the Megilla.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: They do not read it</b> again <b>during the second Adar, as all mitzvot that are practiced during the second</b> Adar <b>are practiced during the first</b> Adar. Once the Megilla was read during the first Adar, one need not read it again during the second Adar.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Yosei: They even read it</b> again <b>during the second Adar, as all mitzvot that are practiced during the second</b> Adar <b>are not practiced during the first</b> Adar. <b>And</b> they all <b>agree with regard to eulogy and with regard to fasting that they are prohibited on</b> the fourteenth and the fifteenth days of <b>this</b> month of the first Adar <b>and on that</b> month of the second Adar.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. The opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is</b> identical to <b>that</b> of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> What novel element does he introduce? <b>Rav Pappa said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>the sequence of</b> four Torah <b>portions, as the first <i>tanna</i> maintains:</b> They should read those portions <b>during the second</b> Adar, <b><i>ab initio</i>. However, if they did</b> so <b>during the first</b> Adar, <b>they did</b> so; and they fulfilled their obligation and need not read them again during the second Adar, <b>except for the reading of the Megilla, as even though they</b> already <b>read</b> it <b>during the first</b> Adar, <b>they read it</b> again <b>during the second</b> Adar.
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, maintains</b> that <b>even the reading of the Megilla</b> may be performed <b>during the first</b> Adar, <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> and they need not read it again during the second Adar. <b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains: Even</b> with regard to <b>the sequence of</b> four Torah <b>portions, if they read</b> them <b>during the first</b> Adar, <b>they read</b> them again <b>during the second</b> Adar.
Returning to the original question, according to <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna taught? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>gifts</b> to the poor is <b>difficult.</b> The first <i>tanna</i> does not mention these gifts, indicating that he maintains that if gifts were distributed during the first Adar one need not distribute gifts to the poor during the second Adar. And <b>if</b> the mishna was taught according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, the reading of the Megilla</b> is <b>also difficult.</b> And <b>if</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, the sequence of</b> Torah <b>portions</b> is <b>difficult.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is according to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, and he taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the reading of the Megilla, and the same is true</b> with regard to <b>gifts to the poor, as this</b> mitzva <b>is dependent upon that</b> one. The Gemara already explained that the gifts to the poor are distributed on the day that the Megilla is read.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and the mishna is incomplete and is teaching the following: The difference between the fourteenth</b> day <b>of the first Adar and the fourteenth</b> day <b>of the second Adar is only</b> with regard to <b>the reading of the Megilla and</b> distributing <b>gifts</b> to the poor. The Gemara infers <b>that</b> with regard to <b>the matter of eulogy and fasting, this,</b> the first Adar, <b>and that,</b> the second Adar <b>are equal, while</b> about <b>the sequence of</b> Torah <b>portions,</b> the mishna <b>does not speak</b> at all. The mishna limits its discussion to the <i>halakhot</i> of Purim.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>interpreted the same verse</b> differently, leading them to their conclusions. It is written: “To enjoin upon them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and the fifteenth day of the same, <b>in each and every year”</b> (Esther 9:21). <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, maintains: “In each and every year”</b> teaches that Purim must be celebrated the same way each year, even if it is intercalated: <b>Just as each and every year</b> Purim is celebrated during <b>Adar that is adjacent to Shevat, so too here</b> in an intercalated year Purim is celebrated during <b>Adar that is adjacent to Shevat.</b>
<b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains: “In each and every year”</b> teaches that <b>just as each and every year</b> Purim is celebrated in <b>Adar that is adjacent to Nisan, so too here,</b> in an intercalated year, Purim is celebrated during <b>Adar that is adjacent to Nisan.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, the reason</b> for his opinion <b>is logical,</b> based on the principle that <b>one does not forego</b> performance of <b>the mitzvot;</b> rather, when presented with the opportunity to perform a mitzva, one should do so immediately. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, what is the reason</b> for his opinion?
<b>Rabbi Tavi said: The reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> is that <b>juxtaposing</b> the celebration of one <b>redemption,</b> Purim, <b>to</b> the celebration of another <b>redemption,</b> Passover, <b>is preferable.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: The reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> is derived <b>from here, as it is written: “To confirm this second letter of Purim”</b> (Esther 9:29), indicating that there are circumstances where the Megilla is read a second time (Jerusalem Talmud), i.e., when the year was intercalated after the Megilla was read in the first Adar.
The Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary to write</b>

Daf 7a

the term: <b>The second, and it was</b> also <b>necessary to write</b> the phrase: <b>In each and every year;</b> proof from one of the verses would have been insufficient. <b>As, if</b> I had derived the <i>halakha</i> only <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>In each and every year, I would have said</b> my conclusion <b>according to our question</b> raised earlier: Why not celebrate Purim in the Adar adjacent to Shevat? <b>Therefore, it teaches us</b> using the term: <b>The second. And had it taught us</b> only the term: <b>The second, I would have said</b> that Purim must be celebrated both <b>in the first</b> Adar <b>and in the second</b> Adar, <b><i>ab initio</i>. Therefore, it teaches us: In each and every year,</b> indicating that even in an intercalated year, just as in an ordinary year, Purim is to be celebrated only once.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, what does he do with this</b> term: <b>The second?</b> Since he holds that the Megilla is read in the first Adar, what does he derive from the verse? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> the term <b>to</b> derive <b>that</b> statement <b>of Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda, as Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda said: Initially, they established</b> the observance of Purim <b>in</b> the city of <b>Shushan</b> alone, <b>and ultimately</b> they established it <b>throughout the world,</b> according to the second letter of Purim.
Apropos the statement of Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda with regard to the establishment of the holiday of Purim, the Gemara cites a related statement. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda said: Esther sent to the Sages: Establish me for</b> future <b>generations.</b> Esther requested that the observance of Purim and the reading of the Megilla be instituted as an ordinance for all generations. <b>They sent to her: You will</b> thereby <b>arouse the wrath of the nations upon us,</b> as the Megilla recounts the victory of the Jews over the gentiles, and it is best not to publicize that victory. <b>She sent</b> back <b>to them: I am already written in the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia,</b> and so the Megilla will not publicize anything that is not already known worldwide.
It was related that <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rav Ḥaviva taught</b> the statement cited below. The Gemara comments: <b>Throughout the order of <i>Moed</i>, wherever this</b> latter <b>pair</b> of Sages is mentioned, <b>exchange Rabbi Yoḥanan and insert Rabbi Yonatan</b> in his place. They said: <b>Esther sent to the Sages: Write me for</b> future <b>generations</b> and canonize my book as part of the Bible. <b>They sent to her</b> that it is written: <b>“Have I not written for you three times”</b> (Proverbs 22:20), indicating that Israel’s battle with Amalek is to be mentioned <b>three times</b> in the Bible <b>and not four times?</b> Since it is already mentioned three times (Exodus 17:8–16; Deuteronomy 25:17–19; I Samuel 15), there is no need to add a fourth source.
The Sages did not accede to Esther’s request <b>until they found a verse written in the Torah: “Write this for a memorial in the book,</b> and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: That I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens” (Exodus 17:14). The Sages interpreted the verse: <b>“Write this,” that which is written</b> in the Torah <b>here</b> in Exodus, <b>and in Deuteronomy; “a memorial,” that which is written in the Prophets,</b> i.e., in I Samuel, on this matter; <b>“in the book,” that which is written in the Megilla.</b> The Megilla is the third mention of Amalek and not the fourth, as both mentions in the Torah pertaining to Amalek are considered one; therefore, Esther would be the third, not the fourth source.
The Gemara comments: This matter is <b>parallel</b> to a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Write this,” that which is written here,</b> in the book of Exodus; <b>“a memorial,” that which is written in Deuteronomy; “in the book,” that which is written in the Prophets;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i</b> disagrees and <b>says: “Write this,” that which is written</b> in the Torah <b>here</b> in Exodus, <b>and in Deuteronomy; “a memorial,” that which is written in the Prophets</b> on this matter; <b>“in the book,” that which is written in the Megilla.</b> Here too, the <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed whether or not the book of Esther has the same force and sanctity as that of the canonized books of the Bible.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The book of <b>Esther does not render the hands ritually impure.</b> Although the Sages issued a decree that sacred scrolls render hands ritually impure, the book of Esther was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Shmuel maintains</b> that the book of <b>Esther was not stated with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit? But didn’t Shmuel</b> himself <b>say</b> elsewhere that the book of <b>Esther was stated with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was stated</b> with the Divine Spirit that it is <b>to be read</b> in public; <b>however, it was not stated</b> that it is <b>to be written.</b> Therefore, the text was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls.
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The book of <b>Ecclesiastes does not render the hands ritually impure,</b> as it was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls; <b>however, there is a dispute with regard to</b> whether or not <b>the Song of Songs</b> renders the hands impure. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The Song of Songs renders the hands ritually impure, but there is a dispute with regard to</b> the book of <b>Ecclesiastes. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The ruling with regard to <b>Ecclesiastes is among the leniencies of Beit Shammai and among the stringencies of Beit Hillel,</b> as according to Beit Hillel it renders the hands impure and according to Beit Shammai it does not. <b>However,</b> everyone agrees that the books of <b>Ruth, and the Song of Songs, and Esther render the hands ritually impure,</b> contrary to the opinion of Shmuel. The Gemara answers: It was Shmuel <b>who stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> cited earlier that the book of Esther was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> The book of <b>Ecclesiastes does not render the hands ritually impure because it is the wisdom of Solomon,</b> and not divinely inspired. <b>They said to him:</b> It was certainly divinely inspired and that is the reason that the book of Ecclesiastes was added to the canon; <b>as was it this alone that</b> Solomon <b>said? Wasn’t it already stated: “And he spoke three thousand proverbs,</b> and his poems were a thousand and five” (I Kings 5:12)? Solomon spoke many proverbs, but only a portion of them were canonized in the Bible. Apparently, what is unique about those in Ecclesiastes is that they were divinely inspired. <b>And it says: “Add you not unto his words”</b> (Proverbs 30:6).
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is added by the proof introduced with the phrase: <b>And it says?</b> Why wasn’t the first proof sufficient? The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that in terms of what <b>he said, he said a great deal,</b> with regard to <b>which, if he</b> so <b>desired, it was written, and if he</b> so <b>desired, it was not written;</b> then that is why not all of his statements were preserved. Therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: Add you not unto his words.</b> Apparently, the reason that it is prohibited to add to the proverbs is that the book of Ecclesiastes was divinely inspired.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “And Haman thought in his heart”</b> (Esther 6:6). If the book of Esther was not divinely inspired, how was it known what Haman thought in his heart? <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked upon her”</b> (Esther 2:15); this could have been known only through divine inspiration.
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated</b> with regard to the conspiracy of Bigtan and Teresh against Ahasuerus: <b>“And the thing became known to Mordecai”</b> (Esther 2:22). This too could have been known only through divine inspiration. <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “But they did not lay their hands on the plunder”</b> (Esther 9:15). The only way that could have been stated with certainty is through divine inspiration.
<b>Shmuel said: Had I been there</b> among the <i>tanna’im</i>, <b>I would have stated a matter that is superior to them all, as it is stated: “They confirmed, and took upon themselves”</b> (Esther 9:27), which was interpreted to mean: <b>They confirmed above</b> in heaven <b>what they took upon themselves below</b> on earth. Clearly, it is only through divine inspiration that this could have been ascertained.
<b>Rava said: There is a refutation for all</b> of these proofs, <b>except for</b> the proof cited by <b>Shmuel, for which there is no refutation.</b> The Gemara elaborates. That <b>which Rabbi Eliezer</b> said with regard to knowledge of what Haman was thinking in his heart can be refuted, as <b>it is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning</b> to conclude that this was his thinking. <b>There was no</b> other <b>person as important to the king as he</b> was; <b>and</b> the fact is <b>that when he elaborated extensively and said:</b> “Let the royal apparel be brought” (Esther 6:8), <b>he said</b> it <b>with himself in mind.</b>
That <b>which Rabbi Akiva</b> said with regard to the knowledge that Esther found favor in the eyes of all, <b>perhaps</b> it can be understood and refuted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who said:</b> This <b>teaches that she appeared to each and every one as</b> one of <b>his nation,</b> and they expressed that sentiment aloud.
<b>And that which Rabbi Meir</b> said, i.e., that the divine inspiration of the book of Esther is clear from the fact that Mordecai exposed the conspiracy against Ahasuerus, <b>perhaps</b> this can be explained and refuted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, who said: Bigtan and Teresh were both</b> members of the <b>Tarsi</b> people and conversed in their own language. Mordecai, who was a member of the Sanhedrin and therefore fluent in many languages, understood what they were saying.
<b>And that which Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit</b> said with regard to the knowledge that no spoils were taken, <b>perhaps</b> this can be explained and refuted by the fact that <b>they dispatched messengers</b> who informed them of the situation. However, <b>with regard to Shmuel’s</b> proof from the fact that they confirmed above what they took upon themselves below, <b>there is certainly no refutation. Ravina said: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: One sharp pepper is better than a basketful of pumpkins,</b> as the quality of the pepper’s taste is more significant than the quantity of the pumpkins.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Proof that the book of Esther was divinely inspired may be cited <b>from here: “And these days of Purim shall not cease from among the Jews”</b> (Esther 9:28), an assertion that could have been made only with divine inspiration. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> Proof may be cited <b>from here,</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“Nor the memorial of them perish from their seed”</b> (Esther 9:28).
The mishna mentions: <b>And gifts</b> distributed <b>to the poor. Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And of sending portions one to another”</b> (Esther 9:22), indicating <b>two portions to one person.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And gifts to the poor”</b> (Esther 9:22), indicating <b>two gifts to two people.</b>
The Gemara relates that, on Purim, <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia sent to Rabbi Oshaya the leg of a third-</b>born <b>calf and a jug of wine.</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>sent him</b> a message of gratitude:

Daf 7b

<b>You have fulfilled</b> two mitzvot <b>through us, our teacher:</b> The mitzva of: <b>“And sending portions one to another,”</b> and the mitzva of: <b>“And gifts to the poor,”</b> as Rabbi Oshaya was poor and this was a substantial gift.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba sent</b> Purim portions from the house of the Exilarch <b>to Marei bar Mar in the hands of Abaye,</b> who was his nephew and student. The Purim portions consisted of <b>a sack [<i>taska</i>] full of dates [<i>kashva</i>] and a cupful of roasted flour [<i>kimḥa de’avshuna</i>]. Abaye said to him: Now, Mari will say</b> the popular expression: Even <b>if a farmer becomes the king, the basket does not descend from his neck.</b> Rabba was named the head of the yeshiva in Pumbedita, and nevertheless, he continued to send very plain gifts, because he was impoverished.
Marei bar Mar <b>sent back to him a sack full of ginger and a cupful of long peppers [<i>pilpalta arikha</i>],</b> a much more expensive gift. <b>Abaye said</b> to him: <b>The master,</b> Rabba, <b>will now say: I sent him sweet</b> items <b>and he sent me pungent</b> ones.
In describing that same incident, <b>Abaye said: When I left</b> the <b>house of the master,</b> Rabba, to go to Marei bar Mar, <b>I was</b> already <b>satiated.</b> However, <b>when I arrived there</b> at Marei bar Mar’s house, <b>they served me sixty plates of sixty kinds of cooked dishes, and I ate sixty portions from</b> each of <b>them. The last dish was called pot roast, and</b> I was still so hungry that <b>I wanted to chew the plate afterward.</b>
And in continuation <b>Abaye said: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: The poor</b> man <b>is hungry and does not know</b> it, as Abaye was unaware how hungry he had been in his master’s house. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is another appropriate, popular expression: <b>Room</b> in the stomach <b>for sweets</b> can always be <b>found.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin would exchange their meals with each other</b> to fulfill their obligation of sending portions on Purim.
<b>Rava said: A person is obligated to become intoxicated</b> with wine <b>on Purim until he</b> is so intoxicated <b>that he does not know</b> how to distinguish <b>between cursed is Haman and blessed is Mordecai.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba and Rabbi Zeira prepared a Purim feast with each other,</b> and <b>they became intoxicated</b> to the point that <b>Rabba arose and slaughtered Rabbi Zeira. The next day,</b> when he became sober and realized what he had done, Rabba <b>asked</b> God <b>for mercy, and revived him. The next year,</b> Rabba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Let</b> the <b>Master come and let us prepare the Purim feast with each other. He said to him: Miracles do not happen each and every hour,</b> and I do not want to undergo that experience again.
<b>Rava said: A Purim feast that one ate at night did not fulfill his obligation. What is the reason? “Days of feasting and gladness”</b> (Esther 9:22) <b>is written,</b> i.e., days and not nights. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ashi was sitting before Rav Kahana</b> his teacher on Purim, and <b>it grew dark and the Sages</b> who usually came to study with him <b>did not come.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: What is the reason that the Sages did not come</b> today? Rav Kahana answered: <b>Perhaps they are preoccupied with the Purim feast.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Wasn’t it possible</b> for them <b>to eat</b> the feast <b>at night</b> on Purim, instead of being derelict in their Torah study on Purim day? Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Didn’t the master learn that which Rava said: A Purim feast that one ate at night did not fulfill his obligation?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Did Rava say that?</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Ashi then <b>learned it from him forty times until</b> he remembered it so well that <b>it seemed to him as if it were placed in his purse.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The previous mishna concluded with the formula: The difference between…is only, thereby distinguishing between the <i>halakhot</i> in two different cases. The following <i>mishnayot</i> employ the same formula and distinguish between the <i>halakhot</i> in cases unrelated to Purim and the Megilla. The first is: <b>The difference between Festivals and Shabbat</b> with regard to the labor prohibited on those days <b>is only</b> in <b>preparing food alone.</b> It is permitted to cook and bake in order to prepare food on Festivals; however, on Shabbat it is prohibited.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of</b> actions that <b>facilitate preparation of food,</b> e.g., sharpening a knife for slaughter, <b>this,</b> Shabbat, <b>and that,</b> Festivals, <b>are equal,</b> in that actions that facilitate preparation of food are prohibited.
The Gemara comments: If so, <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The difference between Festivals and Shabbat is only preparing food. Rabbi Yehuda permits even</b> actions that <b>facilitate preparation of food</b> on Festivals.
The Gemara elaborates. <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is as the <b>verse states:</b> “Except that which every person must eat, only that may be done for you” (Exodus 12:16). <b>“That”</b> is permitted, <b>and not</b> actions that <b>facilitate</b> it. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says: “For you”</b> means <b>for you, for all your needs.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>the other,</b> first, <i>tanna</i> <b>too, isn’t it written: “For you”?</b> The Gemara answers: He infers: <b>For you, and not for gentiles; for you, and not for dogs.</b> It is forbidden to perform labors for the sake of gentiles, or for animals, even if it is to feed them.
The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehuda, <b>too, isn’t it written: “That,”</b> which is a restrictive term that limits the application of a particular <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written: “That,”</b> which is restrictive, <b>and it is written: “For you,”</b> which is inclusive. Rabbi Yehuda resolves the conflict between the two: <b>Here,</b> the word: “That,” is referring <b>to</b> actions that <b>facilitate,</b> in <b>which it is possible to perform them on the Festival eve</b> but which are prohibited on the Festival; <b>there,</b> the phrase: “For you,” is referring <b>to</b> actions that <b>facilitate,</b> in <b>which it is impossible to perform them on the Festival eve</b> and which are permitted even on the Festival.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur</b> with regard to the labor prohibited on those days <b>is only that</b> in <b>this</b> case, i.e., Shabbat, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable <b>at the hand of Man,</b> as he is stoned by a court based on the testimony of witnesses who forewarned the transgressor; <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, i.e., Yom Kippur, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable at the hand of God, <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of payment</b> of damages, both <b>this,</b> Shabbat, <b>and that,</b> Yom Kippur, <b>are equal</b> in that one is exempt in both cases. If one performs an action on Shabbat that entails both a prohibited labor and damage to another’s property, since his transgression is punishable by death, he is exempt from paying damages. Apparently, according to the mishna, the same <i>halakha</i> applies to Yom Kippur.
The Gemara asks: According to <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>the mishna</b> taught? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana would render Yom Kippur like Shabbat with regard to payment</b> of damages. <b>Just as</b> in the case of one who intentionally desecrates <b>Shabbat he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> is therefore <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of <b>payment</b> of damages caused while desecrating Shabbat, <b>so too,</b> in the case of one who intentionally desecrates <b>Yom Kippur, he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> is therefore <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of <b>payment</b> of damages caused while desecrating Yom Kippur.
<b>We learned there</b> in a mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 23a): <b>All</b> those <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> who were flogged</b> in court <b>were exempted from their <i>karet</i>,</b> which is imposed by heaven. Most transgressors are liable to receive <i>karet</i> for violating prohibitions that are punishable by flogging. If they are flogged, they are exempt from <i>karet</i>, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to one liable to receive lashes: <b>“Then your brother shall be dishonored before you”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3), indicating that <b>once he was flogged he is like your brother,</b> and his sins have been pardoned; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him</b> on this issue.
<b>Rava said</b> that the Sages of <b>the school of Rav said: We learned: The difference between Yom Kippur and Shabbat is only that</b> in <b>this</b> case, Shabbat, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable <b>at the hand of Man; and</b> in <b>that</b> case, Yom Kippur, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable <b>with <i>karet</i>. And if</b> the statement of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel <b>is so,</b> in both <b>this</b> case, Shabbat, <b>and that</b> case, Yom Kippur, the punishment <b>is at the hand of Man.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> There is no proof from here that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said: There are no lashes in</b> cases of <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the persons that commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> administered to <b>one’s sister excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence her to</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> and not to</b> the punishment of <b>lashes.</b> This serves as a paradigm; wherever one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, there are no lashes.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yitzḥak and hold that there are lashes even in cases where there is liability for <i>karet</i>, there is no proof that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him. The mishna can be understood as follows: In <b>this</b> case, Shabbat, the <b>primary</b> punishment for <b>its intentional</b> desecration is <b>at the hand of Man; and</b> in <b>that</b> case, Yom Kippur, the <b>primary</b> punishment for <b>its intentional</b> desecration is <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b> If, however, he was flogged, he is exempt from <i>karet</i>.

Daf 8a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow and one for whom benefit from</b> another’s <b>food is forbidden by vow is only</b> with regard to <b>stepping foot</b> on his property, <b>and</b> with regard to borrowing <b>utensils</b> from him <b>that one does not use</b> in the <b>preparation of food,</b> but for other purposes; as those two benefits are prohibited to the former, but permitted to the latter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of utensils that one uses</b> in <b>preparation of food,</b> both <b>this,</b> one who vowed that any benefit is forbidden, <b>and that,</b> one who vowed that benefit from food is forbidden, <b>are equal.</b> It is prohibited for both to derive benefit from utensils used in the preparation of food.
The mishna stated that for one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, <b>stepping foot</b> on the latter’s property is prohibited. The Gemara asks: What benefit is that? <b>Aren’t people not particular</b> about other people treading on their property? <b>Rava said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: Overlooking is prohibited</b> in the case <b>of one for whom benefit is forbidden by vow.</b> For one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, benefit is forbidden even in matters with regard to which one is typically not particular and overlooks others’ use of his property, e.g., stepping foot on it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between</b> animals consecrated to the Temple as <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and</b> animals consecrated as <b>gift</b> offerings <b>is only that</b> in the case of <b>vow</b> offerings, if they died or were lost before being sacrificed on the altar, one <b>is obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them, and</b> in the case of <b>gift</b> offerings, if they died or were lost, one <b>is not obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not be slack</b> to pay one’s pledges, both <b>this,</b> a vow offering, <b>and that,</b> a gift offering, <b>are equal.</b> If one delayed bringing either a vow offering or a gift offering, he violates the prohibition.
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there: Which is</b> the case of <b>a vow</b> offering? It is <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt-offering. Which is</b> the case of <b>a gift</b> offering? It is <b>one who says: This</b> animal is a <b>burnt-offering. And what is</b> the difference <b>between a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering? With regard to <b>vow</b> offerings, if the animals <b>died or were stolen or were lost,</b> the one who vowed <b>is obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them,</b> as he undertook to bring a burnt-offering and he is not absolved of his obligation until he brings the offering. With regard to <b>gift</b> offerings, however, if the animals <b>died or were stolen or were lost,</b> the one who vowed <b>is not obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a burnt-offering, that the verse states: <b>“And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement upon him”</b> (Leviticus 1:4). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: That which is</b> incumbent <b>upon him,</b> i.e., which he accepted as a personal obligation, <b>he bears responsibility</b> to replace <b>it</b> if it died or was stolen; <b>however, that which is not</b> incumbent <b>upon him,</b> i.e., that which he did not accept as a personal obligation but which he designated as an offering, he <b>does not bear responsibility</b> to replace <b>it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> that conclusion <b>be inferred</b> from the verse? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said: Since he said</b> it is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a burnt-offering, he is <b>considered as one who bears</b> it <b>upon his shoulders.</b> The expression: Upon me, indicates an assumption of responsibility to bring an offering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between a <i>zav</i> who experiences two emissions</b> of a pus-like discharge from his penis <b>and one who experiences three</b> emissions <b>is only</b> that the <i>zav</i> who experienced three emissions is obligated to bring <b>an offering</b> after he recovers, in order to complete his purification process.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of</b> transmitting ritual impurity to a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting, and</b> similarly with regard to <b>the counting of seven</b> days clean of emissions so that he may immerse in a ritual bath as part of the purification process, both <b>this,</b> i.e., one who experienced two emissions, <b>and that,</b> one who experienced three emissions, <b>are equal.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions: “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his emission he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), <b>and it called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure.</b> Another verse enumerated <b>three</b> emissions: “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3), <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure. How so?</b> If he is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity and three to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering.</b>
The Gemara raises an alternative. <b>And say</b> instead: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity but not to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering; three</b> emissions <b>to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering, but not to</b> establish <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara rejects this: That is impossible, as <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> that <b>until he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he</b> already <b>experienced two,</b> and therefore he is impure in the case of three emissions as well.
The Gemara raises a different alternative. <b>And say</b> instead: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering, but not to</b> establish <b>impurity; three</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity as well.</b> The Gemara answers that this suggestion <b>cannot enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord from his emission”</b> (Leviticus 15:15). The preposition “from” that precedes the words “his emissions” indicates that <b>some</b> with the status of a <b><i>zav</i> bring an offering and some</b> with the status of a <b><i>zav</i> do not bring an offering. How so?</b> If <b>he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he brings</b> an offering; if he experienced <b>two</b> emissions, <b>he does not bring</b> an offering.
The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>it</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than that if <b>one experienced two</b> emissions, <b>he brings</b> an offering; if <b>he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he does not bring</b> an offering. The Gemara rejects this: That is impossible, as <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> that <b>until he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he</b> already <b>experienced two,</b> and therefore he is obligated to bring an offering in the case of three emissions as well.
The Gemara comments: <b>It was necessary</b> to cite the proof <b>of Rabbi Simai</b> based on the number of mentions of the word emissions in the two verses, <b>and it was necessary</b> to cite the proof from the words: <b>From his emission. As if</b> the difference between two and three emissions was derived <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Simai, I would have said in accordance with our question:</b> Perhaps one who experiences two emissions brings an offering, and one who experiences three emissions is impure and brings an offering. Therefore, <b>it teaches us: From his emission. And if</b> the difference between two and three emissions was derived from the term: <b>From his emission, I would not have known how many emissions</b> render him liable to bring an offering, only that some with the status of a <i>zav</i> are not required to bring an offering. Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> the proof cited <b>by Rabbi Simai.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you said</b> that the term: <b>From his emission,</b> is exclusionary and comes <b>for derivation, what do you derive from</b> the verse: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is cleansed from his emission”</b> (Leviticus 15:13)?
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is needed to</b> derive <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is cleansed</b> from his emission, then he shall count to himself seven days for his purification” (Leviticus 15:13), <b>when</b> his emissions <b>cease.</b> The <i>baraita</i> infers from the term: <b>From his emission,</b> that he needs to be cleansed only <b>from his emission, but not from his emission and his leprosy.</b> If one was both a <i>zav</i> and also had leprosy, he need not wait until he is asymptomatic of his leprosy before counting seven clean days. Rather, he counts seven clean days, and after the leprosy symptoms cease, he immerses for both impurities. <b>“From his emission, then he shall count”: This teaches concerning a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions, that he</b> too <b>requires a count of seven</b> clean days.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> in order to derive that <i>halakha</i>, the verse is unnecessary, as <b>isn’t it</b> only <b>logical?</b> If a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions <b>renders</b> a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting ritually impure</b> and all strictures of a <i>zav</i> apply to him, <b>wouldn’t he require a count of seven</b> clean days to become purified?

Daf 8b

<b>A woman who observes a</b> clean <b>day for</b> one <b>day</b> or two days that she experiences a discharge <b>will prove</b> that this is not the case. This refers to a woman who experienced one or two days of bleeding not during her menstrual period and is required to wait one day without any further discharge of blood before immersion in a ritual bath. This is significant <b>because she renders</b> a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting ritually impure, and</b> nevertheless <b>she does not require a count of seven</b> clean days to become purified.
<b>And you too should not</b> then <b>be surprised that this</b> <i>zav</i>, <b>although he renders</b> a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting ritually impure, he does not require a count of seven</b> clean days to become purified. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “From his emission, then he shall count,”</b> meaning that even <b>a partial <i>zav</i></b> is obligated in the mitzva of: <b>Then he shall count. This teaches concerning a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions, that he</b> too <b>requires a count of seven</b> clean days.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: What is different</b> about <b>this</b> verse that states: “<b>From his emission,” which</b> is interpreted to <b>include a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions</b> in the obligation to count seven clean days; <b>and what is different</b> about <b>that</b> verse that states: “<b>From his emission,” which</b> is interpreted to <b>exclude a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions</b> from the obligation to bring an offering? Why is the identical term interpreted once as inclusionary and once as exclusionary?
Abaye <b>said to him: If it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>this</b> instance of the term: “From his emission,” <b>comes to exclude</b> a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions from the obligation to count seven clean days, <b>let the verse remain silent</b> and omit the term, as there would have been no basis to include a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions in that <i>halakha</i>. <b>And if you would say</b> that this <b>can be inferred logically, a woman who observes a day for a day will prove</b> that there is no correlation between ritual impurity transmitted to a surface designated for lying and a surface designated for sitting, and the obligation to count seven clean days.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this</b> term: From his emission, <b>is needed</b> to derive a different inclusion, i.e., that he counts seven days when he is clean <b>from his emission and not from his leprosy</b> and therefore it was necessary to write this term, that is not so. As <b>if</b> it were <b>so,</b> then <b>let the verse write: “And when the <i>zav</i> is cleansed” and let</b> the verse <b>remain silent</b> and omit the term, and it would have been clear that even one afflicted with leprosy counts seven clean days once he is cleansed from his emission. <b>Why</b> then <b>do I</b> need the term: <b>From his emission?</b> Rather, it must be understood as an inclusionary term that <b>teaches concerning a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions, that he</b> too <b>requires a count of seven</b> clean days.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between a quarantined leper,</b> i.e., one examined by a priest who found his symptoms to be inconclusive, and who must therefore remain in isolation for a period of up to two weeks waiting to see if conclusive symptoms develop; <b>and a confirmed leper,</b> i.e., one whose symptoms were conclusive and the priest declared him an absolute leper, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>letting</b> the hair on one’s head grow <b>wild and rending</b> one’s garments. A confirmed leper is obligated to let the hair on his head grow wild and rend his garments; a quarantined leper is not.
<b>The difference between</b> a leper <b>purified from quarantine,</b> whose symptoms never became conclusive, <b>and</b> a leper <b>purified from</b> a state of <b>confirmed</b> leprosy <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>shaving</b> the hair on all his body <b>and</b> bringing <b>birds</b> as a purification offering, which are obligations incumbent only upon the confirmed leper.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of expulsion,</b> from all three camps in the encampment of the Israelites in the desert and from the walled cities in Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> the <b>ritual impurity</b> of a leper: Both <b>this,</b> the quarantined leper, <b>and that,</b> the confirmed leper, <b>are equal.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Huna.</b> It is written with regard to a leper who was purified from quarantine: <b>“The priest shall pronounce him clean: It is but a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be purified [<i>vetaher</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 13:6). The word <i>vetaher</i> is not in the future tense, which would indicate that from that point he is purified; it is rather in the present tense, indicating <b>that at the outset,</b> even before the priest’s pronouncement, <b>he was pure</b> in the sense that he was exempt <b>from</b> the initial obligation of <b>letting</b> the hair on his head grow <b>wild and rending</b> his garments, as those obligations are incumbent exclusively upon the confirmed leper.
<b>Rava said to him: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> i.e., that <i>vetaher</i> means that one is somewhat pure at the outset, then <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i>, as it is written: “And he shall wash his clothes,</b> and bathe his flesh in running water, <b>and he shall be clean [<i>vetaher</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 15:13), <b>there, what</b> sense <b>of: And he shall be clean, at the outset is there</b> in that case? Up until that point, the <i>zav</i> was ritually impure in every sense.
<b>Rather,</b> <i>vetaher</i> means that <b>he is now pure from rendering earthenware vessels impure through movement.</b> There is a <i>halakha</i> that a <i>zav</i> renders a vessel impure if he causes it to be moved, even though he did not come into direct contact with it, even if the opening of the vessel is smaller than a fingerbreadth. The verse teaches that once the <i>zav</i> is purified through counting and immersion, he no longer renders vessels impure in that manner. The novelty here is that <b>even if he then experiences another</b> emission, <b>he does not render</b> the vessels <b>impure retroactively.</b> This emission is unrelated to the previous emissions. Therefore, upon experiencing the emission, the <i>zav</i> is not retroactively considered to have been ritually impure the entire time, even after immersion. Rather, since he counted seven clean days and immersed, the legal status of this latest emission is that of a new emission.
<b>Here too,</b> with regard to the leper, <i>vetaher</i> means that the quarantined leper <b>is now pure from retroactively rendering</b> the contents of a house <b>impure by</b> his <b>entrance</b> into the house. If someone with inconclusive symptoms of leprosy was quarantined and then declared ritually pure, and subsequently conclusive symptoms of leprosy developed, he is not considered to have been a leper from the time of the original quarantine, in which case the contents of any house he entered from that point would be rendered impure retroactively. Rather, once he was purified, he was absolutely pure. These subsequent conclusive symptoms are unrelated to the previous inconclusive symptoms. Therefore, the proof adduced by Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak is no proof.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that a quarantined leper is exempt from the obligation to let his hair grow and to rend his clothing is derived <b>from here.</b> It is written: <b>“And the leper in whom [<i>bo</i>] the plague is,</b> his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall grow wild” (Leviticus 13:45), indicating that only <b>one whose leprosy is dependent on</b> the state of <b>his body,</b> in whom the plague is, is obligated to let his hair grow wild and to rend his garments. This <b>excludes that</b> leper <b>whose leprosy is not dependent</b> solely <b>on</b> the state of <b>his body, but rather on</b> the passage of <b>days,</b> as he is obligated to wait seven days.
<b>Abaye said to him: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> then also with regard to the verse: <b>“All the days during which the plague shall be in him [<i>bo</i>] he shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:46), say <b>one whose leprosy is dependent on</b> the state of <b>his body requires expulsion</b> from the camp, <b>and one whose leprosy is not dependent</b> solely <b>on</b> the state of <b>his body,</b> but rather on the passage of days, <b>does not require expulsion.</b>
<b>And if you would say: Indeed</b> that is <b>so, but isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>The difference between a quarantined leper and a confirmed leper is only</b> with regard to <b>letting</b> the hair on one’s head grow <b>wild and rending</b> one’s garments? And it is inferred <b>that with regard to the matter of expulsion and</b> the capacity of a leper <b>to render impure</b> the contents of a house <b>by entry</b> into the house, both <b>this,</b> the quarantined leper, <b>and that,</b> the confirmed leper, <b>are equal.</b>
Rava <b>said to him:</b> There is a different source for the obligation to expel the quarantined leper from the camp. The verse could have stated: <b>The days</b> during which the plague shall be upon him. Instead the verse states: <b>All the days, to include a quarantined leper</b> in the obligation <b>of expulsion</b> from the camp, like a confirmed leper.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what is the reason</b> that a quarantined leper <b>is not</b> obligated in <b>shaving</b> the hair on all his body <b>and</b> bringing <b>birds</b> as a purification offering as part of his purification process? <b>As it teaches</b> in the mishna: <b>The difference between</b> a leper <b>purified from quarantine,</b> whose symptoms never became conclusive, <b>and</b> a leper <b>purified from</b> a state of <b>confirmed</b> leprosy, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>shaving</b> the hair on all his body <b>and</b> bringing <b>birds</b> as a purification offering.
<b>Abaye said</b> that the <b>verse states: “And the priest shall go out of the camp,</b> and the priest shall look, <b>and behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed</b> in the leper” (Leviticus 14:3), then the purification process that includes shaving and bringing birds commences. This indicates that these <i>halakhot</i> apply to a confirmed leper <b>whose leprosy is dependent on healing, to exclude that</b> leper <b>whose leprosy is not dependent</b> solely <b>on healing but rather on</b> the passage of <b>days.</b> Even if his symptoms are healed, he is pure only at the conclusion of the seven days of quarantine.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between</b> Torah <b>scrolls, and phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>,</b> in terms of the manner in which they are written, <b>is only that</b> Torah <b>scrolls are written in any language, whereas phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> are written only in <i>Ashurit</i>,</b> i.e., in Hebrew and using the Hebrew script.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even with regard to</b> Torah <b>scrolls,</b> the Sages <b>permitted them to be written only</b> in <b>Greek.</b> Torah scrolls written in any other language do not have the sanctity of a Torah scroll.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that</b> with regard <b>to the matter of stitching</b> the sheets of parchment <b>with sinews, and</b> with regard <b>to rendering the hands</b> of one who touches them <b>impure,</b> both <b>this,</b> Torah scrolls, <b>and that,</b> phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, are <b>equal.</b> The Sages issued a decree rendering the hands of one who touches sacred scrolls impure with second-degree ritual impurity.
The mishna stated: Torah <b>scrolls are written in any language. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: A Torah scroll containing a Hebrew verse in the <b>Bible that one wrote in</b> Aramaic <b>translation,</b> or a verse written in Aramaic <b>translation that one wrote</b> in the Hebrew of the <b>Bible,</b> or that was written <b>in</b> the ancient <b>Hebrew script</b> and not in <i>Ashurit</i>, <b>renders the hands impure only if one writes it in <i>Ashurit</i> script, on a</b> parchment <b>scroll, and in ink.</b> Apparently, contrary to the mishna, a scroll written in a language other than Hebrew is not sacred.
<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 9a

<b>Here,</b> the mishna is referring to Torah scrolls written in another language <b>in our script,</b> i.e., in Hebrew letters. <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to Torah scrolls written in another language <b>in their script,</b> in the letters of another alphabet.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>How did you establish that</b> <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that it is referring to Torah scrolls written in another language <b>in their script?</b> If it is so, <b>why</b> did the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically teach</b> that the legal status of a Hebrew verse in the <b>Bible that one wrote</b> in Aramaic <b>translation, or</b> a verse written in Aramaic <b>translation that one wrote</b> in the Hebrew of the <b>Bible,</b> is not that of sacred writings? The legal status of <b>even</b> a Hebrew verse in the <b>Bible that one wrote</b> in the Hebrew of the <b>Bible and</b> a verse written in Aramaic <b>translation that one wrote in</b> Aramaic <b>translation</b> are <b>also</b> not that of sacred writings, <b>as it is taught</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: A Torah scroll renders the hands impure <b>only if one writes it in <i>Ashurit</i></b> script, <b>on a</b> parchment <b>scroll,</b> and <b>in ink.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the matter must be explained differently. This is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling in the mishna is according to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who permit writing Torah scrolls in any language, and <b>that</b> ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is according to <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
The Gemara asks: If the <i>baraita</i> is according to <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> in addition to <i>Ashurit</i>, <b>isn’t there Greek</b> in which the Torah may also be written? <b>Rather,</b> say this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the mishna is referring to Torah <b>scrolls,</b> which may be written in any language; <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, which may be written only in Hebrew, using Hebrew script.
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, what is the reason</b> that they must be written in Hebrew? The Gemara explains: It is <b>because it is written with regard to them: “And</b> these words <b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), indicating that <b>as they are so shall they be,</b> without change. The Gemara raises a difficulty: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>what</b> Aramaic <b>translation that one wrote</b> in the Hebrew of the <b>Bible is there? Granted,</b> in the <b>Torah there is</b> a verse written in Aramaic translation: <b>“<i>Yegar sahaduta</i>”</b> (Genesis 31:47); <b>however, here,</b> in phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>what</b> verses in Aramaic <b>translation are there</b> that could be written in Hebrew?
<b>Rather,</b> say this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is referring to</b> the <b>Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, which must be written in Hebrew; <b>there,</b> the mishna <b>is referring to</b> Torah <b>scrolls,</b> which may be written in any language. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <b>Megilla</b> must be written in Hebrew? It is due to the fact <b>that it is written with regard to</b> the Megilla: <b>“According to their writing, and according to their language”</b> (Esther 8:9), without change. The Gemara asks: But if the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the Megilla, <b>what</b> Aramaic <b>translation that one wrote</b> in the Hebrew of the <b>Bible is there?</b> The entire Megilla is written in Hebrew.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that it is written: <b>“And when the king’s decree [<i>pitgam</i>] shall be publicized”</b> (Esther 1:20), and that <i>pitgam</i> is essentially an Aramaic word. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it is written: <b>“And all the wives will give honor [<i>yekar</i>] to their husbands”</b> (Esther 1:20), and <i>yekar</i> is Aramaic for honor.
<b>Rav Ashi</b> suggested a different explanation and <b>said: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught</b> it is taught <b>with regard to the rest of</b> the <b>books</b> of the Bible, other than the Torah. <b>And it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> are written only in <i>Ashurit</i>; and our Rabbis permitted</b> writing them in <b>Greek</b> as well.
The Gemara asks: How did our Rabbis permit this? <b>Isn’t it written</b> with regard to phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>: <b>“And</b> these words <b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), indicating that their language may not be changed. <b>Rather, say</b> that this is what the <i>baraita</i> is saying: Torah <b>scrolls are written in any language; and our Rabbis permitted</b> writing them <b>in Greek</b> as well. Once again the Gemara asks: Our Rabbis <b>permitted? By inference,</b> apparently <b>the first <i>tanna</i> prohibits</b> writing a Torah scroll in Greek. However, he explicitly permits writing a Torah scroll in any language.
<b>Rather, say</b> in explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And our Rabbis permitted them to be written only in Greek. And it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Even when our Rabbis permitted Greek, they permitted it only in a Torah scroll,</b> and not for other books of the Bible, which must be written only in Hebrew.
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> this was <b>due to the incident of King Ptolemy, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving King Ptolemy</b> of Egypt, <b>who assembled seventy-two Elders</b> from the Sages of Israel, <b>and put them into seventy-two</b> separate <b>rooms, and did not reveal to them for what</b> purpose <b>he assembled them,</b> so that they would not coordinate their responses. <b>He entered</b> and <b>approached each and every one, and said to</b> each of <b>them: Write for me</b> a translation of <b>the Torah of Moses your teacher. The Holy One, Blessed be He, placed wisdom in the heart of each and every one, and they all agreed to one</b> common <b>understanding.</b> Not only did they all translate the text correctly, they all introduced the same changes into the translated text.
<b>And they wrote for him: God created in the beginning [<i>bereshit</i>],</b> reversing the order of the words in the first phrase in the Torah that could be misinterpreted as: “<i>Bereshit</i> created God” (Genesis 1:1). They did so to negate those who believe in the preexistence of the world and those who maintain that there are two powers in the world: One is <i>Bereshit</i>, who created the second, God. And they wrote: <b>I shall make man in image and in likeness,</b> rather than: “Let us make man in our image and in our likeness” (Genesis 1:26), as from there too one could mistakenly conclude that there are multiple powers and that God has human form.
Instead of: “And on the seventh day God concluded His work” (Genesis 2:2), which could have been understood as though some of His work was completed on Shabbat itself, they wrote: <b>And on the sixth day He concluded</b> His work, <b>and He rested on the seventh day.</b> They also wrote: <b>Male and female He created him, and they did not write</b> as it is written in the Torah: “Male and female <b>He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2), to avoid the impression that there is a contradiction between this verse and the verse: “And God created man” (Genesis 1:27), which indicates that God created one person.
Instead of: “Come, let us go down, and there confound their language” (Genesis 11:7), which indicates multiple authorities, they wrote in the singular: <b>Come, let me go down, and there confound their language.</b> In addition, they replaced the verse: “And Sarah laughed within herself [<i>bekirba</i>]” (Genesis 18:12), with: <b>And Sarah laughed among her relatives [<i>bikroveha</i>].</b> They made this change to distinguish between Sarah’s laughter, which God criticized, and Abraham’s laughter, to which no reaction is recorded. Based on the change, Sarah’s laughter was offensive because she voiced it to others.
They also altered the verse: “For in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they slaughtered an ox” (Genesis 49:6), to read: <b>For in their anger they slew an ox and in their self-will they uprooted a trough,</b> to avoid the charge that Jacob’s sons were murderers. Instead of: “And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey” (Exodus 4:20), they wrote: <b>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a carrier of people,</b> which could be understood as referring to a horse or a camel rather than the lowly donkey.
Instead of: “And the residence of the children of Israel, who resided in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years” (Exodus 12:40), which when read literally is imprecise, for they did not dwell in Egypt that long, they wrote: <b>And the residence of the children of Israel, who resided in Egypt and in other lands, was four hundred years.</b> Instead of: “And he sent the youth of the children of Israel, who brought burnt-offerings” (Exodus 24:5), which evokes the question of why young men were sent to perform that service, they wrote: <b>And he sent the elect [<i>za’atutei</i>] of the children of Israel.</b> The same term was substituted again several verses later, rendering the verse: “And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not His hand” (Exodus 24:11), as: <b>And upon the elect of the children of Israel He laid not His hand.</b>

Daf 9b

Instead of Moses’ assertion: “I have not taken one donkey [<i>ḥamor</i>] from them” (Numbers 16:15), they wrote in more general terms: <b>“I have not taken one item of value [<i>ḥemed</i>] from them,”</b> to prevent the impression that Moses took other items. To the verse that discusses the worship of the sun and the moon, about which it is written: “Which the Lord your God has allotted to all the nations” (Deuteronomy 4:19), they added a word to make it read: <b>“Which the Lord your God has allotted to give light to all the nations,”</b> to prevent the potential misinterpretation that the heavenly bodies were given to the gentiles so that they may worship them.
The verse: <b>“And has gone and served other gods,</b> and worshipped them, either the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, <b>which I have not commanded”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:3), could be understood as indicating that God did not command their existence, i.e., these entities created themselves. Therefore, when these Elders translated the verse they added a word to the end of the verse to make it read: Which I have not commanded <b>to serve them.</b>
<b>And</b> in the list of unclean animals <b>they wrote for him: The short-legged beast [<i>tze’irat haraglayim</i>]. And they did not write for him: “And the hare [<i>arnevet</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:6), <b>since the name of Ptolemy’s wife</b> was <b>Arnevet, so that he would not say: The Jews have mocked me and inserted my wife’s name in the Torah.</b> Therefore, they did not refer to the hare by name, but by one of its characteristic features.
The mishna cites that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even with regard to</b> Torah <b>scrolls,</b> the Sages <b>permitted them to be written only</b> in <b>Greek. Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b> He based his opinion on an allusion in the Torah, as the <b>verse states: “God shall enlarge Japheth, and He shall dwell in the tents of Shem”</b> (Genesis 9:27), indicating that <b>the words of Japheth shall be in the tents of Shem.</b> The language of Javan, who is the forbear of the Greek nation and one of the descendants of Japheth, will also serve as a sacred language in the tents of Shem, where Torah is studied.
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that it is the languages of <b>Gomer and Magog</b> that serve as sacred languages, as they too were descendants of Japheth (see Genesis 10:2). The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: This is the reason, as it is written: “God shall enlarge [<i>yaft</i>] Japheth [<i>Yefet</i>].”</b> <i>Yaft</i> is etymologically similar to the Hebrew term for beauty [<i>yofi</i>]. The verse teaches that <b>the beauty of Japheth shall be in the tents of Shem,</b> and Greek is the most beautiful of the languages of the descendants of Japheth.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between a</b> High <b>Priest anointed with the oil of anointing,</b> which was the method through which High Priests were consecrated until the oil was sequestered toward the end of the First Temple period, <b>and</b> one consecrated by donning <b>multiple garments</b> unique to the High Priest, which was the practice during the Second Temple period, <b>is only</b> that the latter does not bring the <b>bull that comes for</b> transgression of <b>any of the mitzvot.</b> An anointed High Priest who unwittingly issued an erroneous halakhic ruling and acted upon that ruling, and transgressed a mitzva whose unwitting violation renders one liable to bring a sin-offering, is obligated to bring a sin-offering unique to one in his position.
<b>The difference between a</b> High <b>Priest</b> currently <b>serving</b> in that capacity <b>and a former</b> High <b>Priest,</b> who temporarily filled that position when the High Priest was unfit for service, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>the bull</b> brought by the High Priest on <b>Yom Kippur, and the tenth of an ephah</b> meal-offering brought daily by the High Priest. Each of these offerings is brought only by the current High Priest, and not by a former High Priest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that</b> with regard <b>to the matter of the bull</b> brought by the High Priest on <b>Yom Kippur, and</b> with regard to <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> meal-offering, both <b>this,</b> the anointed High Priest, <b>and that,</b> the High Priest consecrated by donning multiple garments, are <b>equal.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as if it</b> were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it would be difficult. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A High Priest consecrated by donning the <b>multiple garments</b> unique to the High Priest <b>brings the bull brought for</b> the unwitting violation of <b>any of the mitzvot;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: He does not bring</b> that offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “If the anointed priest shall sin” (Leviticus 4:3). From the word <b>anointed, I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to a High Priest who was actually <b>anointed with the oil of anointing. From where</b> do I derive that even a High Priest consecrated by donning the <b>multiple garments</b> is also included in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “The anointed,”</b> with the definite article, indicating that the <i>halakha</i> applies to every High Priest.
The Gemara asks: <b>How did we establish</b> the mishna? We established <b>that</b> it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>The difference between a</b> High <b>Priest</b> currently <b>serving</b> in that capacity <b>and a former</b> High <b>Priest is only</b> with regard to <b>the bull</b> brought <b>on Yom Kippur, and the tenth of an ephah</b> meal-offering. The Gemara infers <b>that</b> with regard <b>to all</b> other <b>matters,</b> both <b>this,</b> a High Priest currently serving, <b>and that,</b> a former High Priest, are <b>equal.</b> If so <b>we have arrived at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If temporary <b>disqualification befell</b> the High Priest, <b>and they appointed another priest in his stead,</b> then after the cause of disqualification of <b>the first</b> priest passes, he <b>returns to his service</b> as High Priest. With regard to <b>the second</b> priest, <b>all of the mitzvot of the High Priest</b> are incumbent <b>upon him;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: The first returns to his service; the second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as a High Priest nor as a common priest.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yosei said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving</b> the priest <b>Rabbi Yosef ben Elem of Tzippori,</b> who, <b>when disqualification befell a High Priest,</b> the priests <b>appointed him in his stead. And</b> after the cause of the disqualification was resolved, <b>the incident came before the Sages</b> for a ruling with regard to the status of Rabbi Yosef ben Elem. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> The <b>original</b> High Priest <b>returns to his service,</b> while the <b>second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as High Priest nor as a common priest.</b>
The Gemara explains: Neither as a <b>High Priest, due to hatred,</b> jealousy, and bitterness that would arise if there were two High Priests with equal standing in the Temple; nor as a <b>common priest, because</b> the principle is: <b>One elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Once he has served as a High Priest he cannot be restored to the position of a common priest. Is that to say that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir, <b>and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Indeed, the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. Rav Yosef said:</b> The entire mishna <b>is</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he formulates it according to</b> the opinions <b>of</b> different <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> that is to say, resulting in a third opinion, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis with regard to a High Priest consecrated by donning multiple garments, and the opinion of Rabbi Meir with regard to a former High Priest.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between a great,</b> public <b>altar,</b> such as the altars established at Nob and Gibeon, which served as religious centers following the destruction of the Tabernacle in Shiloh, <b>and a small,</b> personal <b>altar</b> on which individuals would sacrifice their offerings, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>Paschal lambs,</b> which may not be sacrificed on a small altar. <b>This is the principle: Any</b> offering <b>that is vowed or contributed</b> voluntarily <b>is sacrificed on a</b> small <b>altar, and any</b> offering <b>that is neither vowed nor contributed</b> voluntarily, but rather is compulsory, e.g., a sin-offering, <b>is not sacrificed on a</b> small <b>altar.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Is the difference only <b>Paschal lambs and nothing more?</b> The continuation of the mishna indicates that there are additional differences. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the difference between them is only with regard to offerings that are <b>similar to Paschal lambs.</b>
The Gemara asks: According to <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna taught? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even the public sacrificed only Paschal lambs and compulsory</b> offerings <b>for which there is a set time,</b> like fixed communal offerings. <b>However, compulsory</b> offerings <b>for which there is not a set time,</b> e.g., sin-offerings brought for an unwitting transgression committed by the community, <b>are sacrificed neither here</b> on a small altar <b>nor here</b> on a great altar; they are sacrificed only in the Temple.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between</b> the Tabernacle in <b>Shilo and</b> the Temple in <b>Jerusalem is only that in Shiloh one eats offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., individual peace-offerings, thanks-offerings, and the Paschal lamb, <b>and</b> also <b>the second tithe, in any place that overlooks</b> Shiloh, as Shiloh was not a walled city and any place within its Shabbat boundary was regarded as part of the city. <b>And in Jerusalem</b> one eats those consecrated items only <b>within the walls.</b>
<b>And here,</b> in Shiloh, <b>and there,</b> in Jerusalem, <b>offerings of the most sacred order are eaten</b> only <b>within the hangings.</b> The Tabernacle courtyard in Shiloh was surrounded by hangings and the Temple courtyard in Jerusalem was surrounded by a wall. There is another difference: With regard to <b>the sanctity of Shiloh,</b>

Daf 10a

<b>after</b> the Tabernacle was destroyed, <b>there is permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the sanctity of Jerusalem, after</b> the Temple was destroyed, <b>there is no permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars, as the prohibition remains intact.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: I heard that one sacrifices</b> offerings <b>in the temple of Onias</b> in Egypt <b>at the present time.</b> The Gemara cites the basis for the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak. <b>He maintains</b> that <b>the temple of Onias is not a house of idol worship</b> but rather a temple devoted to the service of God, <b>and he maintains</b> that <b>the initial consecration sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time and did not sanctify</b> Jerusalem <b>forever.</b> Therefore, after the destruction of the Temple, the sanctity of Jerusalem lapsed and the sacrifice of offerings elsewhere was no longer prohibited. For these reasons it was permitted to sacrifice offerings in the temple of Onias after the Temple was destroyed.
The Gemara cites the source of this <i>halakha</i>. It is <b>as it is written: “For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:9), which is interpreted: “<b>Rest,” this is Shiloh; “inheritance,” this is Jerusalem.</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> and likens <b>inheritance to rest: Just as</b> in the place of <b>rest,</b> Shiloh, <b>after</b> its destruction <b>there is permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars, <b>so too</b> in the place of <b>inheritance,</b> Jerusalem, <b>after</b> its destruction <b>there is permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars.
The Gemara reports that the other Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak: <b>Did you say</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the temple of Onias? <b>He said to them: No,</b> I did not say that. <b>Rava said,</b> reinforcing his assertion with an oath: <b>By God!</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>did</b> in fact <b>say this, and I</b> myself <b>learned it from him,</b> but he later retracted this ruling.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason he retracted</b> his ruling? The Gemara explains: It is <b>due to the difficulty</b> raised <b>by Rav Mari, as Rav Mari raised an objection</b> from the mishna: With regard to <b>the sanctity of Shiloh, after</b> the Tabernacle was destroyed <b>there is permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars. But with regard to <b>the sanctity of Jerusalem, after</b> the Temple was destroyed <b>there is no permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars. <b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 112b): <b>Once they came to Jerusalem,</b> improvised altars <b>were prohibited, and they did not again have permission</b> to do so, <b>and</b> Jerusalem <b>became the</b> everlasting <b>inheritance.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> matter <b>is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:6): <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: I heard that when they were building the Sanctuary</b> in the Second Temple, <b>they fashioned</b> temporary <b>hangings for the Sanctuary and</b> temporary <b>hangings for the courtyard</b> to serve as partitions until construction of the stone walls was completed. The difference was <b>only that in</b> building <b>the Sanctuary,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>outside</b> the hangings, without entering, <b>and in the courtyard,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>inside</b> the hangings.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua said: I heard that one sacrifices</b> offerings on the altar <b>even though there is no Temple, one eats offerings of the most sacred order</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>even if there are no hangings,</b> and one eats <b>offerings of lesser sanctity and second tithe</b> produce in Jerusalem <b>even if there is no wall</b> surrounding the city, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the initial consecration sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time and</b> also <b>sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>forever.</b> Even if the walls do not exist, the sanctity remains intact. The Gemara concludes: From the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua based his opinion on the principle that the initial sanctification sanctified Jerusalem forever, <b>by inference</b> one can conclude <b>that Rabbi Eliezer holds: It did not sanctify</b> Jerusalem <b>forever.</b> Apparently, this issue is subject to a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> do you draw this inference? <b>Perhaps everyone maintains that the initial consecration sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time and</b> also <b>sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>forever. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>stated that</b> tradition, <b>which he heard</b> from his teachers, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>stated that</b> tradition, <b>which he heard</b> from his teachers, and there is no dispute between them. <b>And if you would say: Why</b> then <b>do I</b> need <b>hangings</b> at all <b>according to Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The original sanctity remained when Jerusalem was not surrounded by walls, and the presence or absence of hangings is irrelevant as well. The Gemara answers: The hangings were established <b>merely for seclusion,</b> as it would have been unbecoming for the activity in this most sacred venue to be visible to all.
<b>Rather,</b> this matter is subject to the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Why did the Sages enumerate these</b> nine cities in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> as cities walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun? Weren’t there many more? <b>As, when the exiles ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia, <b>they discovered these</b> cities <b>and consecrated them</b> as walled cities; <b>but the</b> sanctity of the <b>first</b> walled cities enumerated in the book of Joshua <b>was negated when</b> settlement in <b>the land was negated</b> and the Jewish people were exiled. <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>maintains: The initial consecration sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time</b> only <b>and did not sanctify</b> Jerusalem <b>forever.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Were these</b> cities that were enumerated in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> <b>the only</b> walled cities? <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “Sixty cities, all the region of Argov”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:4), <b>and</b> concerning these cities <b>it is written: “All these cities were fortified with high walls,</b> gates and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:5), indicating that there were a great number of walled cities? <b>Rather, why then did the Sages enumerate these</b> specific cities? It is due to the fact <b>that when the exiles ascended</b> from Babylonia <b>they discovered these and consecrated them</b> as walled cities.
The Gemara asks: <b>Consecrated them?</b> If their sanctity remained, why was it necessary to consecrate them?

Daf 10b

<b>Now, didn’t they say</b> later in the same <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is not necessary to consecrate</b> them? <b>Rather,</b> this is what the <i>baraita</i> means to say: It is due to the fact that when the exiles ascended from Babylonia <b>they discovered these and enumerated them.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>And not only these, but</b> in <b>any</b> city with regard to <b>which you receive a tradition from your ancestors that it was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun, all these mitzvot are observed in it, due to</b> the fact <b>that the initial consecration sanctified</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>for its time and sanctified</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>forever.</b> This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is a dispute between <b>two</b> later <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who hold <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei.</b> Each transmitted Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion in a different manner. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that one of the traditions is mistaken, as with regard to <b>this</b> statement, <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei said it, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said</b> that the verse states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). The word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, meaning no, that it does not have a wall, but its vocalization is in the sense of its homonym, <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even though it does not presently have</b> a wall, as it was destroyed, <b>but it had a wall previously,</b> it retains its status as a walled city. It is Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, who maintains that the first consecration sanctified Jerusalem forever.
§ The Gemara returns to the primary topic of this chapter, the book of Esther. The Gemara cites various aggadic interpretations of the verses of the Megilla. The opening verse of the Megilla states: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> (Esther 1:1). <b>Rabbi Levi said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> who said: <b>This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from the members of the Great Assembly. Anywhere that</b> the word <b><i>vayhi</i> is stated, it is</b> an ominous <b>term</b> indicating <b>nothing other</b> than impending <b>grief,</b> as if the word were a contraction of the words <i>vai</i> and <i>hi</i>, meaning woe and mourning.
The Gemara cites several proofs corroborating this interpretation. <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> led to grief, as there <b>was Haman. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days when the judges ruled”</b> (Ruth 1:1) introduces a period when there <b>was famine. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>], when men began to multiply”</b> (Genesis 6:1) is immediately followed by the verse: <b>“And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:5).
<b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] as they journeyed from the east”</b> (Genesis 11:2) is followed by: <b>“Come, let us build us a city”</b> (Genesis 11:4), which led to the sin of the Tower of Babel. The Gemara cites further examples: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1), about whom it is stated: <b>“These made war”</b> (Genesis 14:2). Another verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho”</b> (Joshua 5:13), it was there that he saw an angel <b>“with his sword drawn in his hand”</b> as a warning. It is written: <b>“And the Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joshua”</b> (Joshua 6:27), and immediately afterward: <b>“But the children of Israel committed a trespass”</b> (Joshua 7:1). It states: <b>“And it came to pass that there was a certain man of Ramathaim”</b> (I Samuel 1:1), and it mentions shortly afterward Hannah’s inability to conceive: <b>“For he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed up her womb”</b> (I Samuel 1:5).
Similarly, the verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when Samuel was old”</b> (I Samuel 8:1), and then it is written: <b>“And his sons did not walk in his ways”</b> (I Samuel 8:3). Also, it states: <b>“And it came to pass that David was successful in all his ways, and the Lord was with him”</b> (I Samuel 18:14), and only a few verses prior it is written: <b>“And Saul viewed David with suspicion”</b> (I Samuel 18:9). In another instance, the verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house”</b> (II Samuel 7:1). Here King David mentioned his desire to build a temple for God, but it is written elsewhere that he was told: <b>“Yet you shall not build the house”</b> (II Chronicles 6:9).
After citing several verses where <i>vayhi</i> portends grief, the Gemara mentions a number of verses that seem to indicate otherwise. <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day”</b> (Leviticus 9:1), which was the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that day: <b>On that day there was joy before the Holy One, Blessed be He, similar to</b> the joy that existed on the <b>day on which the heavens and earth were created.</b> The Gemara cites a verbal analogy in support of this statement. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day,” and it is written there,</b> in the Creation story: <b>“And it was [<i>vayhi</i>]</b> evening, and it was <b>morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). This indicates that there was joy on the eighth day, when the Tabernacle was dedicated, similar to the joy that existed on the day the world was created. Apparently, the term <i>vayhi</i> is not necessarily a portent of grief.
The Gemara answers: This verse does not contradict the principle. On the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle, a calamity also befell the people, <b>as Nadav and Avihu died.</b>
The Gemara cites additional verses where <i>vayhi</i> is not indicative of impending grief: <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the four hundred and eightieth year”</b> (I Kings 6:1), which discusses the joyous occasion of the building of the Temple? <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] when Jacob saw Rachel”</b> (Genesis 29:10), which was a momentous occasion? <b>And isn’t it written: “And it was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening, and it was [<i>vayhi</i>] morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5)? <b>And isn’t there the second</b> day of Creation, <b>and isn’t there the third</b> day, where the term <i>vayhi</i> is used? <b>And aren’t there many</b> verses in the Bible in which the term <i>vayhi</i> appears and no grief ensues? Apparently, the proposed principle is incorrect.
Rather, <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> instance of <b><i>vayhi</i></b> alone, <b>there are</b> some that mean <b>this,</b> grief, <b>and there are</b> some that mean <b>that,</b> joy. However, wherever the phrase <b>“and it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>]”</b> is used in the Bible, <b>it is nothing other</b> than <b>a term of</b> impending <b>grief.</b>
The Gemara states that <b>there are five</b> instances of <b><i>vayhi bimei</i></b> in the Bible. <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahasuerus”; “And it came to pass in the days [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] when the judges ruled”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Amraphel”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahaz”</b> (Isaiah 7:1); <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Jehoiakim”</b> (Jeremiah 1:3). In all those incidents, grief ensued.
§ Apropos the tradition cited by Rabbi Levi above, the Gemara cites additional traditions that he transmitted. <b>Rabbi Levi said: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors: Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers.</b> The Gemara questions: <b>What</b> novel element <b>is this</b> statement <b>teaching us?</b>
The Gemara responds: It is <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Any bride who is modest in the house of her father-in-law merits that kings and prophets</b> will <b>emerge from her. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar, as it is written: “When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; for she had covered her face”</b> (Genesis 38:15). Can it be that <b>because</b> Tamar <b>covered her face he thought her to be a prostitute?</b> On the contrary, a harlot tends to uncover her face.
<b>Rather, because she covered her face in the house of her father-in-law and he was not familiar with her</b> appearance, Judah didn’t recognize Tamar, thought she was a harlot, and sought to have sexual relations with her. Ultimately, <b>she merited that kings and prophets emerged from her. Kings</b> emerged from her <b>through David,</b> who was a descendant of Tamar’s son, Peretz. However, there is no explicit mention that she was the forebear of <b>prophets.</b> This is derived from that <b>which Rabbi Levi said: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors. Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers, and it is written: “The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). Amoz was a member of the Davidic dynasty, and his son, the prophet Isaiah, was also a descendant of Tamar.
<b>And Rabbi Levi said: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors: The place of the Ark</b> of the Covenant <b>is not</b> included <b>in the measurement</b> of the Holy of Holies in which it rested.
The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Ark crafted by Moses had ten cubits</b> of empty space <b>on each side. And it is written</b> in the description of Solomon’s Temple: <b>“And before the Sanctuary, which was twenty cubits in length,</b> and twenty cubits in breadth” (I Kings 6:20). The place “before the Sanctuary” is referring to the Holy of Holies. It was twenty by twenty cubits. If there were ten cubits of empty space on either side of the Ark, apparently the Ark itself occupied no space. <b>And it is written: And the wing of one of the cherubs was ten cubits and the wing of the other cherub was ten cubits;</b> the wings of the cherubs occupied the entire area. If so, <b>where was the Ark itself standing? Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that the Ark <b>stood by means of a miracle</b> and occupied no space?
§ The Gemara cites prologues utilized by various Sages to introduce study of the Megilla: <b>Rabbi Yonatan introduced this passage,</b> the book of Esther, <b>with an introduction from here: “For I will rise up against them,</b> says the Lord of hosts, <b>and cut off from Babylonia name, and remnant, and offspring [<i>nin</i>], and posterity, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 14:22). This verse may be interpreted homiletically: <b>“Name,” this is</b> the <b>writing</b> of ancient Babylonia that will disappear from the world. <b>“Remnant,” this is</b> the <b>language</b> of ancient Babylonia. <b>“Offspring,” this is</b> their <b>kingdom. And “posterity,” this is Vashti,</b> who according to tradition was Nebuchadnezzar’s granddaughter, and the book of Esther relates how she too was removed from the throne.
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Instead of the thorn shall the cypress come up, and instead of the nettle shall the myrtle come up;</b> and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off” (Isaiah 55:13). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani interpreted the verse homiletically as referring to the righteous individuals who superseded the wicked ones in the book of Esther.
<b>“Instead of the thorn”;</b> this means <b>instead of the wicked Haman.</b> He is referred to as a thorn <b>because he turned himself into an object of idol worship,</b> as he decreed that all must prostrate themselves before him. The Gemara cites proof that the term thorn is used in connection with idol worship, <b>as it is written: “And upon all thorns, and upon all brambles”</b> (Isaiah 7:19), which is understood to be a reference to idol worship.
The next section of the verse discusses what will replace the thorns, i.e., Haman: <b>“Shall the cypress [<i>berosh</i>] come up”; this is Mordecai.</b> Why is he called a cypress [<i>berosh</i>]? <b>Because he was called the chief</b> [<b><i>rosh</i></b>] <b>of all the spices, as it is stated: “Take you also to yourself the chief spices, of pure myrrh [<i>mar deror</i>]”</b> (Exodus 30:23), <b>and we translate</b> “pure myrrh,” into Aramaic as <b><i>mari dakhei</i>.</b> Mordecai was like <i>mari dakhi</i>, the chief [<i>rosh</i>] of spices, and therefore he is called <i>berosh</i>.
The verse continues: “And <b>instead of the nettle [<i>sirpad</i>],”</b> this means <b>instead of the wicked Vashti.</b> Why is she called a nettle [<i>sirpad</i>]? Because she was <b>the daughter of the son of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who burned the ceiling [<i>saraf refidat</i>] of the House of God, as it is written: “Its top [<i>refidato</i>] of gold”</b> (Song of Songs 3:10).
The next section of the verse states: <b>“Shall the myrtle [<i>hadas</i>] come up”; this is the righteous Esther, who was called Hadassah</b> in the Megilla, <b>as it is stated: “And he had brought up Hadassah;</b> that is, Esther” (Esther 2:7). The concluding section of the verse states: <b>“And it shall be to the Lord for a name”; this is the reading of the Megilla. “For an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off”; these are the days of Purim.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good,</b> and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you” (Deuteronomy 28:63). The verse indicates that just as the Lord rejoiced in the good he did on behalf of Israel, so too, the Lord <b>will rejoice to cause you harm.</b>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked: <b>Does the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> in fact <b>rejoice over the downfall of the wicked? But it is written: “As they went out before the army, and say: Give thanks to the Lord, for His kindness endures forever”</b> (II Chronicles 20:21), <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For what</b> reason were the words: <b>“for He is good” not stated in this</b> statement of <b>thanksgiving,</b> as the classic formulation is: “Give thanks to the Lord; for He is good; for His kindness endures forever” (I Chronicles 16:34)? <b>Because the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not rejoice over the downfall of the wicked.</b> Since this song was sung in the aftermath of a military victory, which involved the downfall of the wicked, the name of God was not mentioned for the good.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And the one came not near the other all the night”</b> (Exodus 14:20)? <b>The ministering angels wanted to sing</b> their <b>song,</b> for the angels would sing songs to each other, as it states: “And they called out to each other and said” (Isaiah 6:3), but <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: The work of My hands,</b> the Egyptians, are <b>drowning at sea, and you</b> wish to <b>say songs?</b> This indicates that God does not rejoice over the downfall of the wicked.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that this is how the matter is to be understood: Indeed, God Himself <b>does not rejoice</b> over the downfall of the wicked, <b>but He causes others to rejoice.</b> The Gemara comments: One can <b>learn from</b> the language of the verse <b>as well, as it is written: “So</b> the Lord <b>will rejoice [<i>ken yasis</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:63). <b>And it is not written <i>yasus</i>,</b> the grammatical form of the verb meaning: He will rejoice. Rather, it is written <i>yasis</i>. The grammatical form of this verb indicates that one causes another to rejoice. Consequently, these words are understood to mean that God will cause others to rejoice. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> it that this is the case.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana introduced this passage with an introduction from here.</b> The verse states with regard to God’s reward to the righteous: <b>“He gives to a man that is good in His sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:26). The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>the righteous Mordecai.</b> With regard to the next part of the verse: <b>“But to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and heaping up,” this is</b> referring to <b>Haman.</b> The conclusion of the verse states: <b>“That he may give it to one who is good before God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:26). <b>This is Mordecai and Esther, as it is written: “And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman”</b> (Esther 8:2).
<b>Rabba bar Oferan introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy from there the king and the princes, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 49:38). <b>“The king”</b> who was destroyed; <b>this is</b> referring to <b>Vashti. “And the princes”; this is</b> referring to <b>Haman and his ten sons.</b>
<b>Rav Dimi bar Yitzḥak introduced this passage with an introduction from here:</b>

Daf 11a

<b>“For we are bondmen; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia”</b> (Ezra 9:9). <b>When</b> did this occur? <b>In the time of Haman.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa introduced this passage with an introduction from here:</b> The verse states: <b>“You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water;</b> but You brought us out into abundance” (Psalms 66:12). <b>“Through fire”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar,</b> who cast the righteous into the furnace. <b>“And through water”;</b> this was <b>in the days of Pharaoh,</b> who decreed that all newborn males be cast into the water. <b>“But You brought us out into abundance”;</b> this was <b>in the days of Haman,</b> where abundant feasts played a pivotal role in their peril and salvation.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan introduced this passage with an introduction from here:</b> The verse states: <b>“He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God”</b> (Psalms 98:3). <b>When did all the ends of the earth see the salvation of our God? In the days of Mordecai and Esther,</b> for their peril and salvation became known through the letters sent throughout the empire.
<b>Reish Lakish introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “As a roaring lion, and a ravenous bear, so is a wicked ruler over a poor people”</b> (Proverbs 28:15). <b>“A roaring lion”; this is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written about him: “The lion has come up from his thicket”</b> (Jeremiah 4:7). <b>“A hungry bear”; this is Ahasuerus, as it is written about him: “And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear”</b> (Daniel 7:5). <b>And Rav Yosef taught</b> that <b>these</b> who are referred to as a bear in the verse <b>are the Persians.</b> They are compared to a bear, <b>as they eat and drink</b> in large quantities <b>like a bear; and they are coated with flesh like a bear; and they grow their hair</b> long <b>like a bear; and they never rest like a bear,</b> whose manner it is to move about from place to place.
<b>“A wicked ruler”; this is Haman. “Over a poor people”; this is the Jewish people,</b> who are referred to in this manner <b>because they are poor in</b> their observance of <b>the mitzvot.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Through laziness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] sink in [<i>yimakh</i>]; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:18). Rabbi Elazar interprets the verse homiletically: <b>Through the laziness of the Jewish people, who did not occupy themselves with Torah</b> study, <b>the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> a euphemism for God Himself, <b>became poor [<i>makh</i>],</b> so that, as it were, He was unable to help them, <b>as <i>makh</i></b> is <b>nothing other than poor, as it is stated: “But if he be too poor [<i>makh</i>] for the valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). <b>And</b> the word <b><i>mekare</i></b> in the verse <b>is referring</b> to <b>no</b> one <b>other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [<i>hamekare</i>] of His chambers in the waters”</b> (Psalms 104:3).
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “A song of ascents</b> of David. <b>If not for the Lord Who was with us, let Israel now say; if not for the Lord who was with us, when a man rose up against us”</b> (Psalms 124:1–2). The verse speaks of <b>“a man”</b> who rose up against us <b>and not a king.</b> This occurred in the days of Haman, as he, and not King Ahasuerus, was the chief enemy of the Jewish people.
<b>Rava introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “When the righteous are on the increase, the people rejoice; but when the wicked man rules, the people mourn”</b> (Proverbs 29:2). <b>“When the righteous are on the increase, the people rejoice”; this is Mordecai and Esther, as it is written: “And the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad”</b> (Esther 8:15). <b>“But when the wicked man rules, the people mourn”; this is Haman, as it is written: “But the city of Shushan was perplexed”</b> (Esther 3:15).
<b>Rav Mattana said</b> his introduction <b>from here: “For what nation is there so great, that has God so near to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), as to witness the great miracles in the days of Mordecai and Esther? <b>Rav Ashi said</b> his introduction <b>from here:</b> The verse states: <b>“Or has God ventured</b> to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation?” (Deuteronomy 4:34), as in the times of Esther, God saved the Jewish people who were scattered throughout the Persian Empire.
§ The Gemara returns to its interpretation of the book of Esther. The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> (Esther 1:1). <b>Rav said:</b> The word <i>vayhi</i> may be understood as if it said <b><i>vai</i> and <i>hi</i>,</b> meaning <b>woe and mourning. This is as it is written: “And there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondsmen and bondswomen,</b> and no man shall buy you” (Deuteronomy 28:68). The repetitive nature of the verse, indicating that no one will be willing to buy you for servitude, but they will purchase you in order to murder you, indicates a doubly horrific situation, which is symbolized by the dual term <i>vayhi</i>, meaning woe and mourning.
<b>And Shmuel said</b> his introduction from here: “And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, <b>I will not reject them, nor will I abhor them,</b> to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God” (Leviticus 26:44). Shmuel explains: <b>“I will not reject them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the Greeks. “Nor will I abhor them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of</b> Vespasian. <b>“To destroy them utterly”;</b> this was <b>in the days of Haman. “To break My covenant with them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the Persians. “For I am the Lord their God”;</b> this is <b>in the days of Gog and Magog.</b>
An alternative understanding <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: “I will not reject them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the Chaldeans, when I appointed for them Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</b> to pray on their behalf. <b>“Nor will I abhor them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the Greeks, when I appointed Shimon HaTzaddik for them, and</b> the <b>Hasmonean and his sons, and Mattithiah the High Priest. “To destroy them utterly”;</b> this was <b>in the days of Haman, when I appointed for them</b> the righteous leaders <b>Mordecai and Esther. “To break My covenant with them”;</b> this was <b>in the days of the Romans, when I appointed for them</b> the Sages of <b>the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Sages of</b> other <b>generations. “For I am the Lord their God”;</b> this will be <b>in the future, when no nation or</b> people of a foreign <b>tongue will be able</b> to <b>subjugate them</b> further.
<b>Rabbi Levi said</b> his introduction <b>from here: “But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land</b> from before you, then it shall come to pass, that those whom you allow to remain of them shall be as thorns in your eyes” (Numbers 33:55). King Saul’s failure to completely annihilate Amalek allowed for the existence of his descendant Haman, who acted as a thorn in the eyes of Israel during the Purim episode.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said</b> his introduction <b>from here,</b> the continuation of the previously cited verse: <b>“And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so I shall do unto you”</b> (Numbers 33:56). Prior to the miracle of Purim, the Jewish people were subject to the punishment that the Torah designated for its enemies, because they did not fulfill God’s commandments.
The Gemara continues with its explanation of the book of Esther, beginning with a discussion of the name <b>Ahasuerus. Rav said:</b> The name should be viewed as a contraction: <b>The brother of the head [<i>aḥiv shel rosh</i>] and of the same character as the head [<i>ben gilo shel rosh</i>].</b> Rav explains: <b>The brother of the head,</b> i.e., <b>the brother of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who is called “head,” as it is stated: “You are the head of gold”</b> (Daniel 2:38). <b>Of the same character as the head, for he,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, <b>killed</b> the Jews, and <b>he,</b> Ahasuerus, <b>sought to kill</b> them. <b>He destroyed</b> the Temple, and <b>he sought to destroy</b> the foundations for the Temple laid by Zerubbabel, <b>as it is stated: “And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem”</b> (Ezra 4:6), and he ordered that the construction of the Temple cease.
<b>And Shmuel said:</b> The name Ahasuerus should be understood in the sense of black [<i>shaḥor</i>], as <b>the face of the Jewish people was blackened in his days like the bottom of a pot. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> a different explanation: <b>Everyone who recalled him said: “Woe upon his head” [<i>aḥ lerosho</i>]. And Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> The name alludes to the fact <b>that everyone became poor</b> [<b><i>rash</i>] in his days, as it is stated: “And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute</b> upon the land” (Esther 10:1).
The Gemara continues: <b>“This is [<i>hu</i>] Ahasuerus”</b> (Esther 1:1); the term <i>hu</i>, this is, comes to teach that <b>he</b> remained as he was <b>in his wickedness from beginning to end.</b> Similarly, wherever the words “this is” appear in this manner, the verse indicates that the individual under discussion remained the same from beginning to end, for example: <b>“This is [<i>hu</i>] Esau”</b> (Genesis 36:43); <b>he</b> remained <b>in his wickedness from beginning to end. “This is [<i>hu</i>] Dathan and Abiram”</b> (Numbers 26:9); <b>they</b> remained <b>in their wickedness from beginning to end. “This is [<i>hu</i>] the king Ahaz”</b> (II Chronicles 28:22); <b>he</b> remained <b>in his wickedness from beginning to end.</b>
The Gemara continues: The word <i>hu</i> is also used to recognize sustained righteousness. <b>“Abram, this is [<i>hu</i>] Abraham”</b> (I Chronicles 1:27); this indicates that Abraham didn’t change, as <b>he</b> remained <b>in his righteousness from beginning to end.</b> Similarly, <b>“This is [<i>hu</i>] Aaron and Moses”</b> (Exodus 6:26); <b>they remained in their righteousness from</b> the <b>beginning</b> of their life <b>to</b> the <b>end</b> of their life. Similarly, with respect to David: <b>“And David, this was [<i>hu</i>] the youngest”</b> (I Samuel 17:14), indicates that <b>he remained in his humility from beginning to end. Just as in his youth,</b> when he was still an ordinary individual, <b>he humbled himself before anyone who was greater than him in Torah, so too, in his kingship, he humbled himself before anyone who was greater than him in wisdom.</b>
The next term in the opening verse: <b>“Who reigned”</b> (Esther 1:1), is now interpreted. <b>Rav said:</b> This comes to teach <b>that he reigned on his own,</b> without having inherited the throne. <b>Some say</b> this <b>to</b> his <b>credit, and some say it to</b> his <b>disgrace.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Some say</b> this <b>to</b> his <b>credit, that there was no</b> other <b>man as fit as him to be king. And some say it to</b> his <b>disgrace, that he was not fit to be king, but he distributed large amounts of money, and</b> in that way <b>rose</b> to the throne.
The opening verse continues that Ahasuerus reigned <b>“from Hodu to Cush.” Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed about its meaning. <b>One said: Hodu</b> is a country <b>at one end of the world, and Cush</b> is a country <b>at the</b> other <b>end of the world. And one said: Hodu and Cush are situated next to each other,</b> and the verse means to say as follows: <b>Just as</b> Ahasuerus <b>reigned</b> with ease <b>over</b> the adjacent countries of <b>Hodu and Cush, so too, he reigned</b> with ease <b>from one end of the world to the other.</b>
<b>On a similar</b> note, <b>you say</b> with regard to Solomon: <b>“For he had dominion over all the region on this side of the river, from Tiphsah even to Gaza”</b> (I Kings 5:4), and also with regard to this <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said: Tiphsah is at one end of the world, whereas Gaza is at the other end of the world. And one said: Tiphsah and Gaza are situated next to each other,</b> and the verse means to say as follows: <b>Just as</b> Solomon <b>reigned</b> with ease <b>over</b> the adjacent <b>Tiphsah and Gaza, so too, he reigned</b> with ease <b>over the entire world.</b>
The opening verse continues, stating that Ahasuerus reigned “over <b>seven and twenty and a hundred provinces”</b> (Esther 1:1). <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This verse should be understood as follows: <b>At first he reigned over seven</b> provinces; <b>and then he reigned over twenty</b> more; <b>and finally he reigned over</b> another <b>hundred.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> with regard to the similarly worded verse: <b>“And the years of the life of Amram were seven and thirty and a hundred years”</b> (Exodus 6:20), <b>what would you expound</b> from <b>it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here,</b> in the book of Esther, <b>as</b> this part of <b>the verse is</b> entirely <b>superfluous. Since it is</b> already <b>written: “From Hodu to Cush,” why</b> then <b>do I need “Seven and twenty and a hundred provinces”?</b> Rather, <b>learn from here</b> that these words come <b>for</b> this <b>exposition,</b> to teach that Ahasuerus did not begin to reign over all of them at the same time.
§ Apropos the discussion of the kingdoms of Ahasuerus and Solomon, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught: Three</b> men <b>ruled over the</b> entire <b>world, and they were Ahab, and Ahasuerus, and Nebuchadnezzar.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Ahab, as it is written</b> in the words of Obadiah, servant of Ahab, to Elijah: <b>“As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to seek you,</b> and they said: He is not there; and he made the kingdom and nation swear, that they had not found you” (I Kings 18:10). <b>And if he did not reign over them, how could he have made them swear?</b> Apparently, then, he reigned over the entire world.
<b>Nebuchadnezzar</b> also ruled over the whole world, <b>as it is written: “And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom</b> that not serve this same Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylonia, and that <b>will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylonia,</b> that nation will I visit, says the Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand” (Jeremiah 27:8). <b>Ahasuerus</b> also ruled the world, <b>as we have said</b> above.

Daf 11b

After mentioning three kings who ruled over the world, the Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of other kings that will be discussed below: <b><i>Shin</i>,</b> Solomon, i.e., Shlomo; <b><i>samekh</i>,</b> Sennacherib; <b><i>dalet</i>,</b> Darius; <b><i>kaf</i>,</b> Cyrus, i.e., Koresh. The Gemara asks: <b>But is there no other</b> king besides those previously mentioned who ruled over the entire world? <b>But there is</b> King <b>Solomon</b> who ruled over the world and should be added to the list. The Gemara answers: Solomon <b>did not complete his kingship,</b> as he left the throne during his lifetime, and therefore, his name doesn’t appear on the list.
The Gemara asks: This works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that Solomon was first <b>a king and</b> then <b>a commoner,</b> never returning to the throne. <b>But according to the one who said that he was</b> first <b>a king and</b> then <b>a commoner, and</b> then afterward he returned again to be <b>a king, what can be said</b> to explain why he is not mentioned in the list of kings who ruled over the entire world? The Gemara answers: <b>There was something else about Solomon</b> that makes it impossible to compare him to the others, <b>for he ruled over</b> the inhabitants of <b>the heavenly worlds,</b> i.e., demons and spirits, <b>as well as</b> the human inhabitants of <b>the earthly worlds, as it is stated: “Then Solomon sat upon the throne of the Lord as king”</b> (I Chronicles 29:23), which indicates that his reign extended even to the heavenly worlds, with King Solomon sitting upon the throne of the Lord, and therefore he cannot be compared to the others, who merely ruled on earth.
The Gemara asks further: <b>But there was Sennacherib,</b> who ruled over the entire world, <b>as it is written: “Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand</b> that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?” (Isaiah 36:20). The Gemara answers: <b>There is Jerusalem that he did not conquer,</b> as indicated in the verse.
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>But there is Darius, as it is stated: “Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you”</b> (Daniel 6:26). The Gemara answers: <b>There are the seven</b> provinces <b>over which he did not rule, as it is written: “It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps”</b> (Daniel 6:2). It is apparent from here that Darius did not rule over the entire world, for his son Ahasuerus ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, an additional seven.
The Gemara raises another question: <b>But there is Cyrus, as it is written: “Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: The Lord,</b> God of heaven, <b>has given me all the kingdoms of the earth”</b> (Ezra 1:2). The Gemara answers: This is not proof that he ruled the world, for <b>there he was</b> merely <b>boasting about himself,</b> although in fact there was no truth to his words.
§ The second verse in Esther states: <b>“In those days when the king</b> Ahasuerus <b>sat</b> on the throne of his kingdom” (Esther 1:2), implying that the events to follow took place during the first year of his reign; <b>and</b> one verse <b>afterward it is written: “In the third year of his reign”</b> (Esther 1:3), indicating that it was the third year, not the first. <b>Rava said:</b> There is no contradiction. <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“when he sat” [<i>keshevet</i>]?</b> It is intended to indicate that he acted not immediately upon his rise to the throne, but rather <b>after his mind was settled [<i>shenityasheva</i>],</b> and he overcame his anxiety and worry with regard to the redemption of the Jewish people. <b>He said</b> to himself as follows: <b>Belshazzar,</b> the king of Babylonia, <b>calculated and erred</b> with regard to the Jewish people’s redemption. <b>I</b> too <b>will calculate, but I will not err.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> this calculation? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to Jeremiah’s prophecy of a return to Eretz Yisrael: <b>“After seventy years are accomplished for Babylonia I will remember you</b> and perform My good word toward you, enabling you to return to this place” (Jeremiah 29:10), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written</b> in a slightly different formulation: “In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, meditated in the books, over the number of the years, which the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, <b>that He would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years”</b> (Daniel 9:2). <b>He,</b> Belshazzar, <b>calculated</b> as follows: <b>Forty-five</b> years <b>of Nebuchadnezzar, and twenty-three of Evil-merodach, and two of his</b> own, for a total of <b>seventy</b> years that had passed without redemption. He was therefore certain that Jeremiah’s prophecy would no longer be fulfilled, and he therefore said: <b>I will take out the vessels of the Holy Temple and use them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that Nebuchadnezzar reigned for forty-five years? As the Master said: They were exiled in the seventh</b> year; <b>they were exiled in the eighth</b> year; <b>they were exiled in the eighteenth</b> year; and <b>they were exiled in the nineteenth</b> year.
The Gemara explains: <b>They were exiled in the seventh</b> year <b>after</b> Nebuchadnezzar’s <b>subjugation of Jehoiakim,</b> in what was known as <b>the exile of Jehoiachin, which was</b> actually <b>the eighth</b> year <b>of Nebuchadnezzar’s</b> reign. Then later <b>they were exiled</b> a second time <b>in the eighteenth</b> year <b>after the subjugation of Jehoiakim,</b> in what was known as <b>the exile of Zedekiah, which was</b> actually in <b>the nineteenth</b> year <b>of Nebuchadnezzar’s</b> reign, <b>as the Master said: In the first year</b> of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar <b>conquered Nineveh; in</b> his <b>second</b> year <b>he conquered Jehoiakim. And it is written: “And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judea, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-merodach, king of Babylonia, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judea, and brought him out of prison”</b> (Jeremiah 52:31).
The Gemara calculates: Since Evil-merodach acted in the first year of his reign, immediately after coming to power, it turns out that Nebuchadnezzar ruled for <b>eight</b> years before he sent Jehoiachin into exile, <b>and thirty-seven</b> years during which Jehoiachin was in prison. <b>This</b> equals <b>forty-five</b> years of the reign <b>of Nebuchadnezzar. And the twenty-three</b> years <b>of Evil-merodach</b> are known through <b>tradition. And</b> together with the <b>two years</b> of Belshazzar, <b>this</b> brings the count of the years of exile to <b>seventy.</b> At that point Belshazzar <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Now for sure they will not be redeemed.</b> Therefore, <b>I will take out the vessels of the Holy Temple and use them.</b>
<b>This is that</b> which <b>Daniel said to him</b> with regard to his impending punishment for using the Temple’s vessels: <b>“But you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His House before you”</b> (Daniel 5:23). <b>And it is written</b> further in the chapter: <b>“In that night Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldeans, was slain”</b> (Daniel 5:30). This was the description of Belshazzar’s mistaken calculation. <b>And it states</b> after the fall of Belshazzar: <b>“And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old”</b> (Daniel 6:1).
Ahasuerus <b>said: He,</b> Belshazzar, <b>erred. I</b> too <b>will calculate, but I will not err,</b> thinking he understood the source of Belshazzar’s mistake. <b>Is it written:</b> “Seventy years <b>for the kingdom of Babylonia”? It is written:</b> “Seventy years <b>for Babylonia.” What is</b> meant by <b>“for Babylonia”?</b> These words are referring to the seventy years <b>for the exile of Babylonia. How many</b> years <b>are</b> still <b>lacking</b> from the seventy years? <b>Eight</b> years. <b>He calculated, and inserted in their stead one</b> year <b>of Belshazzar, and five</b> years <b>of Darius and Cyrus, and two</b> years <b>of his own,</b> bringing the total to <b>seventy. Once he saw that seventy</b> years <b>had been completed, and</b> the Jewish people <b>were</b> still <b>not redeemed, he said: Now for sure they will not be redeemed.</b> Therefore, <b>I will take out the vessels of the Temple and use them.</b> What happened to him? As a punishment for what he did, <b>the Satan came and danced among them, and</b> brought confusion to his celebration until <b>he killed Vashti.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But he calculated properly;</b> why then did this happen? The Gemara answers: <b>He too erred</b> in his calculation, <b>for he should have counted from the destruction of Jerusalem</b> at the time of the exile of Zedekiah and not from the first exile of Jehoiachin.
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, how many</b> years <b>were lacking? Eleven,</b> for the exile of Zedekiah took place eleven years after that of Jehoiachin. <b>How many</b> years <b>did</b> Ahasuerus <b>reign</b> as king? <b>Fourteen.</b> Indeed, <b>in his fourteenth year,</b> then, <b>the Temple should have been built.</b> If so, <b>why is it written: “Then the work of the House of God, which is in Jerusalem, ceased;</b> so it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia” (Ezra 4:24), which indicates that the Temple was not built during the entire reign of Ahasuerus? <b>Rava said: The years</b> reckoned <b>were partial</b> years. To complete the seventy years, it was necessary to wait until the second year of the rule of Darius II, when indeed the Temple was built.

Daf 12a

<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, as an indication that the years counted were only partial years: <b>And</b> when Belshazzar was killed, <b>there was still another year</b> left <b>for Babylonia</b> before the reckoning of the seventy years was completed. <b>And</b> then <b>Darius arose and completed it.</b> Although seventy years were previously counted according to Belshazzar’s count, from the exile of Jehoiakim, because the years were only partial, there was still one year left in order to complete those seventy years.
<b>Rava said: Daniel also erred in this calculation, as it is written: “In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, meditated in the books</b> over the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years” (Daniel 9:2). <b>From</b> the fact <b>that he said “I meditated,”</b> a term indicating recounting and calculating, <b>it can be inferred that he had</b> previously <b>erred.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>In any case, the verses contradict each other</b> with regard to how the seventy years should be calculated. In one verse <b>it is written:</b> “After seventy years <b>are accomplished for Babylonia</b> I will remember [<i>efkod</i>] you, and perform My good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place” (Jeremiah 29:10), which indicates that the seventy years should be counted from the Babylonian exile. <b>And</b> in another verse <b>it is written:</b> “That he would accomplish <b>for the desolations of Jerusalem</b> seventy years” (Daniel 9:2), indicating that the seventy years are calculated from the destruction of Jerusalem.
<b>Rava said</b> in response: The seventy years that “are accomplished for Babylonia” were <b>only for being remembered [<i>lifekida</i>],</b> as mentioned in the verse, allowing the Jews to return to Eretz Yisrael but not to build the Temple. <b>And this is as it is written</b> with regard to Cyrus’s proclamation permitting the Jewish people’s return to Eretz Yisrael, in the seventieth year of the Babylonian exile: <b>“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The Lord, God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He has charged [<i>pakad</i>] me to build Him a house in Jerusalem”</b> (Ezra 1:2). The verse makes use of the same root, <i>peh-kuf-dalet</i>, heralding the return to Jerusalem to build the Temple, but not its actual completion.
Apropos its mention of Cyrus, the Gemara states that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda interpreted homiletically</b> a verse concerning Cyrus: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Thus says the Lord to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held”</b> (Isaiah 45:1), which seemingly is referring to Cyrus as God’s anointed? <b>Now was Cyrus</b> God’s anointed one, i.e., the <b>Messiah,</b> that the verse should refer to him in this manner? <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be understood as God speaking to the Messiah with regard to Cyrus: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Messiah: I am complaining to you about Cyrus,</b> who is not acting in accordance with what he is intended to do. <b>I had said: “He shall build My House and gather My exiles”</b> (see Isaiah 45:13), but he did not carry this out. <b>Rather, he said: “Whoever is among you of all His people…let him go up</b> to Jerusalem” (Ezra 1:3). He gave permission to return to Israel, but he did no more than that.
§ The Gemara returns to its interpretations of verses in the Megilla. The Megilla mentions that among those invited to the king’s feast were: <b>“The army of Persia and Media, the nobles</b> and princes of the provinces” (Esther 1:3), <b>and it is written</b> near the conclusion of the Megilla: “In the book of chronicles <b>of the kings of Media and Persia”</b> (Esther 10:2). Why is Persia mentioned first at the beginning of the Megilla, while later in the Megilla, Media is mentioned first? <b>Rava said</b> in response: These two peoples, the Persians and the Medes, <b>stipulated with each other,</b> saying: <b>If the kings</b> will come <b>from us, the ministers</b> will come <b>from you; and if the kings</b> will come <b>from you, the ministers</b> will come <b>from us.</b> Therefore, in reference to kings, Media is mentioned first, whereas in connection with nobles and princes, Persia is given priority.
The verse states: <b>“When he showed the riches of his glorious [<i>kevod</i>] kingdom</b> and the honor of his majestic [<i>tiferet</i>] greatness” (Esther 1:4). <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: This teaches that</b> Ahasuerus <b>wore the priestly vestments.</b> Proof for this assertion may be adduced from the fact that the same terms are written with regard to the priestly vestments, as <b>it is written here:</b> “The riches of his glorious [<i>kevod</i>] kingdom and <b>the honor of his majestic [<i>tiferet</i>] greatness.” And it is written there,</b> with regard to the priestly garments: <b>“For glory [<i>kavod</i>] and for majesty [<i>tiferet</i>]”</b> (Exodus 28:2).
The verse states: <b>“And when these days were fulfilled,</b> the king made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the capital” (Esther 1:5). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed as to whether this was a wise decision. <b>One said:</b> Ahasuerus arranged a feast for the residents of Shushan, the capital, after the feast for foreign dignitaries that preceded it, as mentioned in the earlier verses, indicating that <b>he was a clever king. And</b> the other <b>one said:</b> It is precisely this that indicates that <b>he was a foolish king. The one who said</b> that this proves that <b>he was a clever king</b> maintains <b>that he acted well when he first brought close those</b> more <b>distant</b> subjects by inviting them to the earlier celebration, <b>as he could appease the residents of his</b> own <b>city whenever he wished. And the one who said</b> that <b>he was foolish</b> maintains <b>that he should have invited the residents of his city first, so that if those</b> faraway subjects <b>rebelled against him, these</b> who lived close by <b>would have stood with him.</b>
<b>The students of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai asked him: For what</b> reason <b>were the enemies of Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves when exhibiting behavior that is not in their best interests, <b>in that generation deserving of annihilation? He,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>said to them: Say</b> the answer to your question <b>yourselves. They said to him: It is because they partook of the feast of that wicked one,</b> Ahasuerus, and they partook there of forbidden foods. Rabbi Shimon responded: <b>If so, those in Shushan should have been killed</b> as punishment, but <b>those in the rest of the world,</b> who did not participate in the feast, <b>should not have been killed. They said to him:</b> Then <b>you say</b> your response to our question. <b>He said to them: It is because they prostrated before the idol</b> that Nebuchadnezzar had made, as is recorded that the entire world bowed down before it, except for Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
<b>They said to him:</b> But if it is true that they worshipped idols and therefore deserved to be destroyed, why was a miracle performed on their behalf? <b>Is there favoritism</b> expressed by God <b>here? He said to them: They did not</b> really worship the idol, but pretended to <b>do</b> so <b>only for appearance,</b> acting as if they were carrying out the king’s command to bow before the idol. <b>So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not</b> destroy them but <b>did</b> act angry <b>with them only for appearance.</b> He too merely pretended to desire to destroy them, as all He did was issue a threat, but in the end the decree was annulled. <b>And this is as it is written: “For He does not afflict from His heart</b> willingly” (Lamentations 3:33), but only for appearances’ sake.
The verse states: <b>“In the court of the garden of the king’s palace”</b> (Esther 1:5). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to how to understand the relationship between these three places: Court, garden, and palace: <b>One said:</b> The guests were received in different places. <b>One</b> who, according to his stature, was <b>fit for the courtyard</b> was brought <b>to the courtyard; one</b> who was <b>fit for the garden</b> was brought <b>to the garden;</b> and <b>one</b> who was <b>fit for the palace</b> was brought <b>to the palace. And</b> the other <b>one said: He</b> first <b>sat them in the courtyard, but it did not hold them,</b> as they were too numerous. He then sat them <b>in the garden, but it did not hold them</b> either, <b>until he brought them into the palace and it held them.</b> A third understanding <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: He sat them in the courtyard and opened two entranceways for them, one to the garden and one to the palace.</b>
The verse states: “There were hangings of <b><i>ḥur</i>, <i>karpas</i>, and sky blue”</b> (Esther 1:6). The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>ḥur</i>? Rav said:</b> A fabric fashioned with <b>many holes [<i>ḥarei ḥarei</i>],</b> similar to lace. <b>And Shmuel said: He spread out for them</b> carpets of <b>white wool,</b> as the word <i>ḥavar</i> means white. And what is <b><i>karpas</i>? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Cushions [<i>karim</i>] of velvet [<i>pasim</i>].</b>
The verse states: <b>“On silver rods and pillars of marble; the couches were of gold and silver”</b> (Esther 1:6). <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Some couches were of gold and others of silver. <b>One</b> who, according to his stature, was <b>fit for silver</b> sat on a couch of <b>silver,</b> and <b>one</b> who was <b>fit for gold</b> sat on one of <b>gold. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him:</b> This was not done. <b>If so, you</b> would <b>cast jealousy into the feast,</b> for the guests would be envious of each other. <b>Rather,</b> the couches <b>themselves</b> were made <b>of silver, and their feet</b> were made <b>of gold.</b>
The verse continues: “Upon a pavement of <b><i>bahat</i> and marble”</b> (Esther 1:6). <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> with regard to the definition of <i>bahat</i>: These are <b>stones that ingratiate themselves with their owners,</b> as they are precious stones that people are willing to spend large amounts of money to acquire. <b>And similarly, it states</b> elsewhere that the Jewish people will be likened to precious stones: “And the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they shall be as <b>“the stones of a crown, glittering over His land”</b> (Zechariah 9:16).
The verse concludes: <b>“And <i>dar</i> and <i>soḥaret</i>”</b> (Esther 1:6). <b>Rav said:</b> <i>Dar</i> means <b>many rows [<i>darei darei</i>]</b> around. Similarly, <i>soḥaret</i> is derived from <i>seḥor seḥor</i>, around and around, meaning that the floor was surrounded with numerous rows of <i>bahat</i> and marble stones. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> There is <b>a precious stone in the seaports, and its name is <i>dara</i>,</b> and Ahasuerus <b>placed it in the center of</b> the <b>feast, and it illuminated</b> the festivities <b>for them as</b> the sun illuminates the world <b>at midday.</b> He explains that the word <i>soḥaret</i> is derived from <i>tzohar</i>, a light. A scholar from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: This means <b>that he proclaimed a remission for all the merchants,</b> absolving them from paying their taxes, understanding that the word <i>dar</i> derives from <i>deror</i>, freedom, and <i>soḥaret</i> from <i>soḥer</i>, merchant.
The verse states: <b>“And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, the vessels being diverse [<i>shonim</i>] from one another”</b> (Esther 1:7). The Gemara asks: Why does the verse use the term <i>shonim</i> to express that they are different? <b>It should have said</b> the more proper term <b><i>meshunim</i>. Rava said: A Divine Voice issued forth and said to them: The early ones,</b> referring to Belshazzar and his people, <b>were destroyed because</b> they used <b>these vessels,</b> the vessels of the Temple, <b>and</b> yet <b>you use them again [<i>shonim</i>]?</b> The verse continues: <b>“And royal wine in abundance [<i>rav</i>]”</b> (Esther 1:7). <b>Rav said: This teaches that each and every</b> guest at the feast <b>was poured</b> well-aged <b>wine that was older [<i>rav</i>] than himself in years.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel”</b> (Esther 1:8). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“according to the law”? Rabbi Ḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> The drinking was <b>according to the law of the Torah. Just as,</b> according to <b>the law of the Torah,</b> with regard to offerings, <b>the food</b> sacrificed on the altar <b>is greater</b> in quantity <b>than the drink,</b> for the wine libation is quantitatively much smaller than the sacrificial offerings it accompanies, <b>so too,</b> at the <b>feast of that wicked man, the food was greater</b> in quantity <b>than the drink.</b>
The verse states: <b>“None did compel”</b> (Esther 1:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This teaches that each and every</b> guest at the feast <b>was poured</b> a drink <b>from wine of his</b> own <b>country,</b> so that he would feel entirely free, as if he were in his home country. The verse continues: <b>“That they should do according to every man’s pleasure”</b> (Esther 1:8). <b>Rava</b> commented on the literal meaning of the verse, which is referring to two men, a man and a man [<i>ish va’ish</i>], and <b>said:</b> The man and man whom they should follow indicates <b>that they should do according to the wishes of Mordecai and Haman.</b> The two of them served as butlers at the feast, and they were in charge of distributing the wine. Why is the verse interpreted in this way? <b>Mordecai</b> is called “man,” <b>as it is written:</b> “There was a certain <b>Jewish man [<i>ish</i>]</b> in Shushan the castle, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair” (Esther 2:5). <b>And Haman</b> is also called man, as it states: <b>“A man [<i>ish</i>] who is an adversary and an enemy,</b> this evil Haman” (Esther 7:6).
The verse states: <b>“Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women, in the royal house,</b> which belonged to King Ahasuerus” (Esther 1:9). The Gemara questions why she held the feast in the royal house, a place of men, rather than in <b>the women’s house,</b> where it <b>should have been. Rava said</b> in response: <b>The two of them had sinful intentions.</b> Ahasuerus wished to fornicate with the women, and Vashti wished to fornicate with the men. <b>This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: He with pumpkins and his wife</b>

Daf 12b

<b>with zucchinis,</b> indicating that often a man and his wife engage in similar actions.
The verse states: <b>“On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine”</b> (Esther 1:10). The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>until now his heart was not merry with wine?</b> Did it take seven days for him to achieve merriment? <b>Rava said: The seventh day was Shabbat,</b> when the difference between the Jewish people and the gentiles is most apparent. On Shabbat, <b>when the Jewish people eat and drink, they begin</b> by occupying themselves <b>with words of Torah and words of praise</b> for God. <b>But the nations of the world, when they eat and drink, they begin only with words of licentiousness.</b>
The Gemara continues to detail what occurred at the feast. <b>So too, at the feast of that wicked man,</b> Ahasuerus, when the men began to converse, <b>some said: The Median women are</b> the most <b>beautiful, while others said: The Persian women are</b> the most <b>beautiful. Ahasuerus said to them: The vessel that I use,</b> i.e., my wife, <b>is neither Median nor Persian, but</b> rather <b>Chaldean. Do you wish to see her? They said to him: Yes, provided that she be naked,</b> for we wish to see her without any additional adornments.
The Gemara comments: Vashti was punished in this humiliating way <b>for it is with the measure that a man measures</b> to others <b>that he</b> himself <b>is measured.</b> In other words, God punishes individuals in line with their transgressions, measure for measure. <b>This teaches that the wicked Vashti would take the daughters of Israel, and strip them naked, and make them work on Shabbat.</b> Therefore, it was decreed that she be brought before the king naked, on Shabbat. This is <b>as it is written: “After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her”</b> (Esther 2:1). That is to say, <b>just as she had done</b> with the young Jewish women, <b>so it was decreed upon her.</b>
The verse states: <b>“But the queen Vashti refused</b> to come” (Esther 1:12). The Gemara asks: <b>Since she was immodest, as the Master said</b> above: <b>The two of them had sinful intentions, what is the reason</b> that <b>she did not come? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: This teaches that she broke out in leprosy,</b> and therefore she was embarrassed to expose herself publicly. An alternative reason for her embarrassment <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> The angel <b>Gabriel came and fashioned her a tail.</b>
The verse continues: <b>“Therefore the king was very wrathful,</b> and his anger burned in him” (Esther 1:12). The Gemara asks: <b>Why did</b> his anger <b>burn in him so greatly</b> merely because she did not wish to come? <b>Rava said:</b> Vashti not only refused to come, but she also <b>sent him</b> a message by way of a messenger: You, <b>son of my father’s stableman [<i>ahuriyyarei</i>].</b> Belshazzar, <b>my father, drank wine against a thousand</b> men <b>and did not become inebriated,</b> as the verse in Daniel (5:1) testifies about him: “Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand”; <b>and that man,</b> referring euphemistically to Ahasuerus himself, <b>has become senseless from his wine.</b> Due to her audacity, <b>immediately “his anger burned in him”</b> (Esther 1:12).
The following verse states: <b>“Then the king said to the wise men,</b> who knew the times” (Esther 1:13). The Gemara asks: <b>Who are these wise men?</b> These wise men are <b>the Sages</b> of the Jewish people, who are referred to as those <b>“who knew the times,” for they know how to intercalate years and fix the months</b> of the Jewish calendar. Ahasuerus <b>said to them: Judge her for me.</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in their hearts: <b>What should we do?</b> If <b>we say to him: Kill her, tomorrow he will become sober and</b> then come and <b>demand her from us.</b> If <b>we say to him: Let her be, she has scorned royalty,</b> and that cannot be tolerated. Consequently, they decided not to judge the matter, and <b>they said to him</b> as follows: <b>From the day that the Temple was destroyed and we have been exiled from our land, counsel</b> and insight <b>have been removed from us, and we do not know how to judge capital cases,</b> as they are exceptionally difficult. <b>Go to</b> the people of <b>Ammon and Moab, who have remained</b> permanently <b>settled in their places like wine that is settled on its lees,</b> and so their minds are settled as well.
<b>And</b> they provided a good <b>reason</b> when <b>they spoke to him,</b> as they proved that one who is settled retains his reasoning: <b>For it is written: “Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into exile; therefore his taste has remained in him, and his scent is not changed”</b> (Jeremiah 48:11). Ahasuerus <b>immediately</b> acted on their advice and asked his advisors, as it is written: <b>“And next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,</b> Meres, Marsena, and Memucan” (Esther 1:14).
<b>Rabbi Levi said: This entire verse</b> listing the names of the king’s advisors <b>is stated on account of offerings.</b> Each name alludes to an aspect of the sacrificial service that was unique to the Jewish people, which the ministering angels mentioned as merit for the Jewish people.
<b>“Carshena”; the ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, did</b> the gentiles <b>ever offer before You lambs [<i>karim</i>] of the first year [<i>shana</i>], as the Jewish people have offered before You? “Shethar”; have they ever offered before You two turtledoves [<i>shetei torim</i>]? “Admatha”; have they ever built before You an altar of earth [<i>adama</i>]? “Tarshish”; have they ever ministered before You in the priestly vestments, as it is written</b> that on the fourth of the four rows of precious stones contained on the breastplate were: <b>“A beryl [<i>tarshish</i>], an onyx, and a jasper”</b> (Exodus 28:20). <b>“Meres”; have they ever stirred [<i>meirsu</i>] the blood of the offerings before You? “Marsena”; have they ever stirred [<i>meirsu</i>] the meal-offering before You? “Memucan”; have they ever prepared [<i>hekhinu</i>]</b> the <b>table before You,</b> on which the shewbread was placed?
The verse states: <b>“And Memucan said”</b> (Esther 1:16). A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Memucan is Haman. And why is</b> Haman <b>referred to as Memucan? Because he was prepared [<i>mukhan</i>] to</b> bring <b>calamity</b> upon the Jewish people. <b>Rav Kahana said: From here</b> we see <b>that the common man jumps to the front</b> and speaks first, for Memucan was mentioned last of the king’s seven advisors, and nevertheless he expressed his opinion first.
The king sent out letters to the people of all his provinces, in which it was written: <b>“That every man shall wield authority in his own house</b> and speak according to the language of his people” (Esther 1:22). <b>Rava said: Were it not for the first letters</b> sent by Ahasuerus, which everybody discounted, <b>there would not have been left among the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <b>a remnant or a refugee.</b> Since these first letters were the subject of ridicule, people didn’t take the king seriously and did not immediately act upon the directive of the later letters, calling for the Jewish people’s destruction.
The Gemara continues. The reason that the first letters were not taken seriously is that <b>they</b> who received them would <b>say: What is this that he has sent us: “That every man shall wield authority in his own house”?</b> This is <b>obvious; even</b> a lowly <b>weaver is commander [<i>paredashekha</i>] in his house.</b> If so, why then did the king find it necessary to make such a proclamation?
The verse describes Ahasuerus’s search for a new wife by stating: <b>“And let the king appoint officers</b> in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the castle” (Esther 2:3). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “In everything a prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool unfolds his folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16)? The verse highlights the difference between two kings’ approaches to finding a wife.
<b>“In everything a prudent man acts with knowledge”; this</b> statement is referring to <b>David,</b> who also sought a wife for himself, <b>as it is written: “And his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin”</b> (I Kings 1:2). Since he sought one maiden, <b>whoever had a daughter brought her to him,</b> for everyone wanted his daughter to be the king’s wife. With regard to the continuation of the verse: <b>“But a fool unfolds his folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16), <b>this</b> statement <b>is</b> referring to <b>Ahasuerus, as it is written: “And let the king appoint officers”</b> to seek out many maidens. Since it became clear that the king would have relations with all of them, but in the end he would choose only one as his bride, <b>whoever had a daughter hid her from him.</b>
The verse that initially describes Mordecai states: <b>“There was a certain Jew in Shushan the castle,</b> whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish, a <b>Benjamite”</b> (Esther 2:5). The Gemara asks: <b>What is it</b> conveying in the verse by <b>saying</b> the names of Mordecai’s ancestors? <b>If</b> the verse in fact <b>comes to</b> trace his <b>ancestry, it should continue tracing</b> his lineage <b>back</b> all the way <b>to Benjamin,</b> the founder of his tribe. <b>Rather, what is different</b> about these names that they deserve special mention?
The Gemara answers: A Sage <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of them are names by which</b> Mordecai <b>was called.</b> He was called <b>“the son of Jair”</b> because he was <b>the son who enlightened [<i>heir</i>] the eyes of</b> all of <b>the Jewish people with his prayers; “the son of Shimei”</b> because he was <b>the son whom God heard [<i>shama</i>] his prayers; “the son of Kish” because he knocked [<i>hikish</i>] on the gates of mercy and they were opened to him.</b>
The Gemara points out a contradiction: Mordecai <b>is referred to as a “Jew [<i>Yehudi</i>],” apparently</b> indicating that <b>he came from</b> the tribe of <b>Judah,</b> but in the continuation of the verse <b>he is called “Benjamite” [<i>Yemini</i>], which indicates that he came from</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin. Rav Naḥman said: Mordecai was crowned with</b> honorary <b>names.</b> <i>Yehudi</i> is one such honorary epithet, due to its allusion to the royal tribe of Judah, but it is not referring to Mordecai’s tribal affiliation.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> an alternative explanation: Mordecai’s <b>father was from</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin, and his mother was from</b> the tribe of <b>Judah.</b> Therefore, he was both a <i>Yemini</i>, a Benjamite, and a <i>Yehudi</i>, from the tribe of Judah. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that the dual lineage is due to a dispute: <b>The families competed</b> with <b>each other</b> over which tribe could take credit for Mordecai. <b>The family of Judah</b> would <b>say: I caused the birth of Mordecai,</b> as only <b>because David did not kill Shimei, the son of Gera,</b> when he cursed him (see II Samuel 16) was it possible for Mordecai to be born later from his descendants. <b>And the family of Benjamin said</b> in response: In the end <b>he came from me,</b> as he in fact was from Benjamin’s tribe.
<b>Rava said: The Congregation of Israel</b> at the time <b>said</b> this <b>from the opposite perspective,</b> not as a boast, but as a complaint, remarking: <b>See what a Judean has done to me and how a Benjamite has repaid me. What a Judean has done to me</b> is referring to

Daf 13a

the responsibility of Judah, <b>as David did not kill Shimei,</b> although he was liable to the death penalty. The grave consequences of this failure included <b>that Mordecai was born from him,</b> and it was he <b>against whom Haman was jealous,</b> leading Haman to issue a decree against all of the Jewish people. <b>And how a Benjamite has repaid me</b> is referring to the fact <b>that Saul,</b> who was from the tribe of Benjamin, <b>did not kill</b> the Amalekite king <b>Agag</b> immediately, <b>from whom Haman was</b> later <b>born, and he caused suffering to the Jewish people.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> a different explanation of the verse: <b>Actually,</b> Mordecai <b>came from</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin. Why,</b> then, <b>was he referred to as <i>Yehudi</i>? On account of</b> the fact <b>that he repudiated idol worship, for anyone who repudiates idolatry is called <i>Yehudi</i>.</b> It is understood here in the sense of <i>yiḥudi</i>, one who declares the oneness of God, <b>as it is written: “There are certain Jews [<i>Yehuda’in</i>]</b> whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylonia, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: They serve not your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up” (Daniel 3:12). These three individuals were in fact Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were not all from the tribe of Judah but are referred to as <i>Yehuda’in</i> because they repudiated idol worship.
§ Incidental to the exposition of the word <i>Yehudi</i> as one who repudiates idolatry, the Gemara relates that <b>when Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi introduced</b> his exposition of <b>the book of Chronicles, he</b> addressed the book of Chronicles and <b>said as follows: All of your words are one, and we know how to expound them.</b> This introduction made reference to the fact that the book of Chronicles cannot always be interpreted literally but requires exposition, as the same individual might be called by various different names, as in the following verse: <b>“And his wife <i>HaYehudiyya</i> bore Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Soco, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah. And these are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took”</b> (I Chronicles 4:18).
<b>Why is she,</b> who we are told at the end of the verse was Pharaoh’s daughter Bithiah, <b>referred to as <i>Yehudiyya</i>? Because she repudiated idol worship, as it is written: “And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself in the river”</b> (Exodus 2:5), <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She went down to wash</b> and purify <b>herself from the idols of her father’s house.</b>
The Gemara understands that all the names referred to in the verse as children of Pharaoh’s daughter refer to Moses, as it will soon explain. The Gemara asks: Pharaoh’s daughter <b>bore</b> Moses? <b>But didn’t she</b> merely <b>raise him?</b> Rather, <b>it is telling you that</b> with regard to <b>anyone who raises an orphan boy or girl in his house, the verse ascribes him credit as if he gave birth to him.</b>
The Gemara explains how all the names in fact are referring to Moses: <b>“Jered”; this is Moses, and why was he called Jered? Because manna came down [<i>yarad</i>] for the Jewish people in his days.</b> He was also called <b>“Gedor” because he fenced in [<i>gadar</i>] the breaches of the Jewish people.</b> He was called <b>“Heber” because he connected [<i>ḥibber</i>] the Jewish people to their Father in Heaven.</b> He was called <b>“Soco” because he was for the Jewish people like a shelter [<i>sukka</i>]</b> and shield. He was called <b>“Jekuthiel” because the Jewish people trusted in God [<i>kivu laEl</i></b>] <b>in his days.</b> Lastly, he was called <b>“Zanoah” because he caused the iniquities of the Jewish people to be disregarded [<i>hizniaḥ</i>].</b>
The Gemara notes that the words “father of” appear three times in that same verse: “And his wife Hajehudijah bore Jered the <b>father of</b> Gedor, and Heber the <b>father of</b> Soco, and Jekuthiel the <b>father of</b> Zanoah.” This teaches that Moses was a father to all of the Jewish people in three respects: <b>A father in Torah, a father in wisdom,</b> and <b>a father in prophecy.</b>
The aforementioned verse stated: <b>“And these are the sons of Bithiah</b> the daughter of Pharaoh, <b>whom Mered took.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was</b> Bithiah’s husband’s <b>name Mered? Wasn’t his name Caleb?</b> Rather, the verse alludes to the reason that Caleb married Bithiah. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Caleb, who rebelled [<i>marad</i>] against the advice of the spies, come and marry the daughter of Pharaoh, who rebelled against the idols of her father’s home.</b>
§ The Gemara resumes its explanation of the book of Esther. The verse states with regard to Mordecai: <b>“Who had been exiled from Jerusalem”</b> (Esther 2:6). <b>Rava said:</b> This language indicates <b>that he went into exile on his own,</b> not because he was forced to leave Jerusalem. He knew that he would be needed by those in exile, and therefore he consciously left Jerusalem to attend to the needs of his people.
The verse states: <b>“And he had brought up Hadassah,</b> that is, Esther” (Esther 2:7). <b>She is referred to as “Hadassah” and she is referred to as “Esther.”</b> What was her real name? <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages differed in their opinion as to which was in fact her name and which one was a description: <b>Rabbi Meir says: Esther was her</b> real <b>name. Why</b> then <b>was she called Hadassah? On account of the righteous, who are called myrtles [<i>hadassim</i>], and so it states: “And he stood among the myrtles [<i>hahadassim</i>]”</b> (Zechariah 1:8).
<b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> differs and <b>says: Hadassah was her</b> real <b>name. Why</b> then <b>was she called Esther? Because she concealed [<i>masteret</i>] the truth</b> about herself, <b>as it is stated: “Esther had not yet made known</b> her kindred nor <b>her people”</b> (Esther 2:20).
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> concurs and <b>says: Hadassah was her</b> real <b>name. Why</b> then <b>was she called Esther?</b> This was her non-Hebrew name, <b>for</b> owing to her beauty <b>the nations of the world called her after Istahar,</b> Venus. <b>Ben Azzai says: Esther was neither tall nor short, but of average size like a myrtle</b> tree, and therefore she was called Hadassah, the Hebrew name resembling that myrtle tree. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Esther</b> was called Hadassah because she <b>was greenish,</b> having a pale complexion like a myrtle, but <b>a cord of</b> Divine <b>grace was strung around her,</b> endowing her with a beautiful appearance.
The verse initially states with regard to Esther: <b>“For she had neither father nor mother”</b> (Esther 2:7). <b>Why do I need</b> to be told in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And when her father and mother were dead,</b> Mordecai took her for his own daughter”? <b>Rav Aḥa said:</b> This repetition indicates that <b>when</b> her mother <b>became pregnant</b> with her, <b>her father died,</b> and <b>when she gave birth</b> to her, <b>her mother died,</b> so that she did not have a mother or a father for even a single day.
The verse states: <b>“And when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter”</b> (Esther 2:7). A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir: Do not read</b> the verse literally as <b>for a daughter [<i>bat</i>],</b> but <b>rather</b> read it as <b>for a home [<i>bayit</i>].</b> This indicates that Mordecai took Esther to be his wife. <b>And so it states: “But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared: And it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his bread, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter [<i>kevat</i>] to him”</b> (II Samuel 12:3). The Gemara questions: <b>Because it lay in his bosom, it “was like a daughter to him”? Rather,</b> the parable in II Samuel referenced the illicit taking of another’s wife, and the phrase should be read: <b>Like a home [<i>bayit</i>]</b> to him, i.e., a wife. <b>So too, here,</b> Mordecai took her <b>for a home,</b> i.e., a wife.
The verse states: <b>“And the seven maids</b> chosen to be given her out of the king’s house” (Esther 2:9). <b>Rava said: She would</b> have a separate maid attend her each day, and she would <b>count the days of the week by them,</b> so she was always aware when Shabbat was. The verse continues: <b>“And he advanced her and her maids</b> to the best place in the house of the women.” <b>Rav said:</b> The advancement in the verse signals <b>that he fed her food of Jews,</b> i.e., kosher food.
<b>And Shmuel said</b> an alternative understanding: The advancement was a well-intentioned act in <b>that he fed her pig hinds,</b> thinking she would view it as a delicacy, although in fact they were not kosher.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> a third understanding: He gave her <b>vegetables,</b> which did not pose a problem with regard to the kosher laws. <b>And so it states</b> with regard to the kindness done for Daniel and his associates: <b>“So the steward took away their food</b> and the wine that they should drink; <b>and gave them vegetables”</b> (Daniel 1:16).
The verse states: <b>“Six months with oil of myrrh”</b> (Esther 2:12). The Gemara asks: <b>What is “oil of myrrh”? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said:</b> It is the aromatic oil called <b><i>setakt</i>. Rav Huna said:</b> It is a cosmetic <b>oil</b> derived <b>from olives that have not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of their growth. <b>It is</b> similarly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: <i>Anpakinon</i></b> is <b>the oil of olives that have not reached one-third</b> of their growth. <b>And why is it smeared</b> on the body? Because <b>it removes the hair and softens the skin.</b>
The verse states: <b>“In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned”</b> (Esther 2:14). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From the</b> implicit <b>criticism of that wicked man,</b> Ahasuerus, who cohabited with many women, <b>we have</b> incidentally <b>learned his praise</b> as well, <b>that he would not engage in sexual relations during the day,</b> but in a more modest fashion at night.
The verse states: <b>“And Esther obtained favor</b> in the sight of all those who looked upon her” (Esther 2:15). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This teaches that she appeared to each and every one as if</b> she were a member of <b>his</b> own <b>nation,</b> and therefore she obtained favor in the eyes of all. The next verse states: <b>“So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tevet”</b> (Esther 2:16). It was by act of divine providence that Esther was taken to Ahasuerus in a cold winter <b>month, in which the body takes pleasure in</b> the warmth of <b>another body,</b> and therefore she found favor in his eyes.
The verse states: <b>“And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins”</b> (Esther 2:17). <b>Rav said:</b> This double language indicates that if <b>he wanted to taste</b> in her <b>the taste of a virgin</b> during intercourse, <b>he tasted</b> it, and if he wanted to experience <b>the taste of a non-virgin, he tasted</b> it, and therefore he loved her more than all the other women.
The verse states: <b>“Then the king made a great feast</b> for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast” (Esther 2:18). The Gemara explains that this was part of an attempt to have Esther reveal her true identity. <b>He made</b> a great <b>feast</b> in her honor, <b>but she did not reveal</b> her identity <b>to him. He lowered the taxes [<i>karga</i>]</b> in her name, <b>but</b> still <b>she did not reveal</b> it <b>to him. He sent gifts [<i>pardishenei</i>]</b> to the ministers in her name, <b>but</b> even so <b>she did not reveal</b> it <b>to him.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And when the virgins were gathered together the second time</b> and Mordecai sat in the king’s gate” (Esther 2:19). The Gemara explains: The reason Ahasuerus gathered the women together was that <b>he went</b> and <b>took advice from Mordecai</b> as to what he should do to get Esther to reveal her identity. Mordecai <b>said</b> to him: As a rule, <b>a woman is jealous only of the thigh of another</b> woman. Therefore, you should take for yourself additional women. <b>But even so she did not reveal</b> her origins <b>to him, as it is written: “Esther had not yet made known her kindred</b> nor her people” (Esther 2:20).
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b>

Daf 13b

<b>“He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous;</b> but with kings upon the throne He establishes them forever, and they are exalted” (Job 36:7)? This teaches that <b>in reward for the modesty shown by Rachel she merited that Saul,</b> who was also modest, <b>should descend from her, and in reward for the modesty shown by Saul, he merited that Esther should descend from him.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What was the modesty shown by Rachel?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother,</b> and that he was Rebecca’s son” (Genesis 29:12). It may be asked: <b>Was he,</b> Jacob, in fact <b>her father’s brother? But wasn’t he the son of her father’s sister?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it must be understood that when Jacob met Rachel, <b>he said to her: Will you marry me? She said to him: Yes, but my father,</b> Laban, <b>is a swindler, and you will not be able to</b> outwit <b>him.</b> Jacob alleviated her fears, as <b>he said to her</b> that he is her father’s brother, referring not to their familial affiliation but rather to his ability to deal with her father on his level, as if to say: <b>I am his brother in deception. She said to him: But is it</b> really <b>permitted for the righteous to be involved in deception? He said to her: Yes,</b> it is permitted when dealing with deceptive individuals, as the verse states: <b>“With the pure you will show yourself pure, and with the perverse you will show yourself subtle”</b> (II Samuel 22:27), indicating that one should deal with others in the manner appropriate for their personality.
Jacob then <b>said to her: What is the deception</b> that he will plan to carry out and I should be prepared for? Rachel <b>said to him: I have a sister who is older than I, and he will not marry me off before her,</b> and will try to give you her in my place. So Jacob <b>gave her</b> certain <b>distinguishing signs</b> that she should use to indicate to him that she was actually Rachel and not her sister.
<b>When the</b> wedding <b>night arrived,</b> and Laban planned to switch the sisters, Rachel <b>said</b> to herself: <b>Now my sister will be embarassed,</b> for Jacob will ask her for the signs and she will not know them. So <b>she gave them to her. And this is as it is written: “And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah”</b> (Genesis 29:25). Does this imply <b>by inference that until now she was not Leah? Rather, due to the distinguishing signs that Rachel had given to Leah, he did not know until now,</b> when it was light outside, that she was Leah. <b>Therefore,</b> Rachel <b>merited that Saul should descend from her,</b> due to her act of modesty in not revealing to Jacob that she had shown the signs to Leah.
<b>And what was the modesty shown by Saul? As it is written: “But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he did not tell him”</b> (I Samuel 10:16). Saul expressed his modesty by not revealing Samuel’s promise that he would be king, and thereby <b>merited that Esther would descend from him.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, assigns greatness to a person, He assigns it to his sons and to his son’s sons for all generations, as it is stated:</b> “He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous; but with kings upon the throne <b>He establishes them forever, and they are exalted”</b> (Job 36:7). <b>And if he becomes arrogant</b> due to this, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, lowers him</b> in order to humble him, <b>as it is stated</b> in the next verse: <b>“And if they are bound in chains,</b> and are held in cords of affliction, then He declares unto them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved proudly” (Job 36:8–9).
§ The Gemara returns to its exposition of the Megilla. The verse states: <b>“For Esther adhered to the words of Mordecai,</b> as she did when she was brought up with him” (Esther 2:20). <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> This teaches <b>that she would show</b> discharges of her <b>menstrual blood to the Sages</b> to inquire whether she was pure or impure. The verse continues: <b>“As she did when she was brought up with him”</b> (Esther 2:20). <b>Rabba bar Lima said in the name of Rav:</b> This means <b>that she</b> maintained a relationship with Mordecai, as she <b>would arise from the lap of Ahasuerus, immerse herself</b> in a ritual bath, <b>and sit in the lap of Mordecai.</b>
The Megilla continues: <b>“In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate,</b> two of the king’s chamberlains, <b>Bigthan and Teresh,</b> of those that guarded the doors, <b>became angry,</b> and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus” (Esther 2:21). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, caused a master to become angry with his servants</b> in order <b>to fulfill the will of a righteous man. And who is this?</b> It is <b>Joseph, as it is stated</b> in the chief butler’s account of how Pharaoh had become angry with him and with the chief baker and sent them to jail: <b>“And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew”</b> (Genesis 41:12).
Similarly, the Holy One, Blessed be He, also caused <b>servants</b> to become angry <b>with their master in order to perform a miracle for</b> another <b>righteous man. And who is he?</b> It is <b>Mordecai, as</b> with regard to the plot to kill the king <b>it is written: “And the matter became known to Mordecai”</b> (Esther 2:22).
The Gemara explains how the matter became known to him. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Bigthan and Teresh were two Tarsians, and they would talk</b> with one another in the <b>Tarsian language. They said: From the day that</b> Esther arrived <b>we have not slept,</b> as Ahasuerus has been with Esther all night, and he has been busying us with his demands. <b>Come, let us cast poison in the goblet</b> from which he drinks <b>so that he will die. But they did not know that Mordecai was</b> one <b>of those who sat</b> on the Sanhedrin, which convened <b>in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, and that he knew seventy languages,</b> a necessity for members of the Sanhedrin.
While planning their plot, one of them <b>said to</b> the other: <b>But my post and your post are not identical.</b> How then can one of us leave our position to succeed in our plot to poison the king? The other one <b>said to him: I will guard</b> both <b>my post and your post. And this is as it is written</b> with regard to the king’s verifying Mordecai’s revelation of the plan to kill the king: <b>“And when inquiry was made of the matter, it was found to be so”</b> (Esther 2:23); it was discovered <b>that they were not</b> both <b>found at their posts.</b>
The verse describes when the rest of the events of the Megilla occurred: <b>“After these events</b> did King Ahasuerus promote Haman” (Esther 3:1). The Gemara asks: <b>After what</b> particular events? <b>Rava said:</b> Only <b>after the Holy One, Blessed be He, created a remedy for the blow</b> and set in place the chain of events that would lead to the miraculous salvation was Haman appointed, setting the stage for the decree against the Jews to be issued.
Rava explains: <b>As Reish Lakish said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not strike at the Jewish people unless He has</b> already <b>created a remedy for them beforehand, as it is stated: “When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered”</b> (Hosea 7:1). <b>But</b> this is <b>not so</b> with regard to <b>the nations of the world.</b> With them, God first <b>strikes them and</b> only <b>afterward does He create a remedy, as it is stated: “And the Lord shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing”</b> (Isaiah 19:22).
The verse states: <b>“But it seemed contemptible in his eyes to lay his hand on Mordecai alone;</b> for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai” (Esther 3:6). <b>Rava said: At first</b> he wanted to lay his hands on <b>Mordecai alone, and in the end on the people of Mordecai. And who were</b> the people of Mordecai? They were <b>the Sages,</b> i.e., Mordecai’s special people. <b>And ultimately</b> he sought to bring harm <b>on all the Jews.</b>
The verse states: <b>“They cast <i>pur</i>, that is, the lot”</b> (Esther 3:7). A Sage <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Once the lot fell on the month of Adar, he,</b> Haman, <b>greatly rejoiced,</b> for he saw this as a favorable omen for the execution of his plans. <b>He said: The lot has fallen for me in the month that Moses died,</b> which is consequently a time of calamity for the Jewish people. <b>But he did not know that</b> not only <b>did</b> Moses <b>die on the seventh of Adar,</b> but <b>he was</b> also <b>born on the seventh of Adar,</b> and therefore it is also a time of rejoicing for the Jewish people.
Haman said to Ahasuerus: <b>“There is [<i>yeshno</i>] one</b> people scattered abroad [<i>mefuzar</i>] and dispersed [<i>meforad</i>] among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; nor do they keep the king’s laws; therefore it does not profit the king to tolerate them” (Esther 3:8). <b>Rava said: There was none who knew how to slander like Haman,</b> as in his request to the king he included responses to all the reasons Ahasuerus might be reluctant to destroy the Jewish people. <b>He said to</b> Ahasuerus: <b>Let us destroy them.</b> Ahasuerus <b>said to him: I am afraid of their God, lest He do to me as He did to those</b> who stood against them <b>before me.</b> Haman <b>said to him: They have been asleep [<i>yashnu</i>] with respect to the mitzvot,</b> having ceased to observe the mitzvot, and, therefore there is no reason to fear.
Ahasuerus <b>said to him: There are the Sages among them</b> who observe the mitzvot. Haman <b>said to him: They are one people,</b> i.e., they are all the same; nobody observes the mitzvot.
Haman continued with his next response as expressed in the verse: <b>Perhaps you will say</b> that <b>I am making a bald spot in your kingdom,</b> i.e., you fear that if an entire nation is wiped out there will be a desolate area within the kingdom. There is no need to worry, though, as <b>they are scattered [<i>mefuzarin</i>] among the peoples,</b> and eradicating them will not result in the creation of an unpopulated zone in the area where they had once lived. Furthermore, <b>perhaps you will say</b> that <b>there is benefit from them;</b> but this nation is <b><i>meforad</i>, like this</b> barren <b>mule [<i>pereida</i>] that cannot bear offspring,</b> and there is no benefit to be gained from them. And <b>perhaps you will say</b> that <b>there is</b> at least <b>a province</b> that is filled <b>with them. Therefore the verse states</b> that they are scattered <b>“in all the provinces of your kingdom”</b> (Esther 3:8), and they do not inhabit one place.
Haman continued: <b>“And their laws are diverse from those of every people”</b> (Esther 3:8), <b>as they do not eat from our</b> food, <b>nor do they marry from our</b> women, <b>nor do they marry off</b> their women <b>to us. “Nor do they keep the king’s laws”</b> (Esther 3:8). <b>They spend the entire year</b> in idleness, as they are constantly saying: <b><i>Shehi pehi</i>,</b> an acronym for: It is Shabbat today [<i>Shabbat hayom</i>]; it is Passover today [<i>Pesaḥ hayom</i>]. The verse continues: <b>“Therefore it does not profit the king to tolerate them,” as they eat and drink and scorn the throne.</b> And a proof of this is that <b>even if a fly falls into the cup of one of them, he will throw</b> the fly <b>out and drink</b> the wine <b>it</b> fell into, <b>but if my master the king were to touch the glass of one of them, he would throw it to the ground, and would not drink it,</b> since it is prohibited to drink wine that was touched by a gentile.
Therefore, Haman concluded: <b>“If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed, and</b> I will weigh out <b>ten thousand talents of silver</b> into the hands of those who have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries” (Esther 3:9). <b>Reish Lakish said: It is revealed and known</b> in advance <b>to the One Who spoke and the world came into being, that in the future Haman was going to weigh out shekels against the Jewish people; therefore, He</b> arranged that the Jewish people’s <b>shekels</b> that were given to the Temple <b>preceded</b> Haman’s <b>shekels.</b>
<b>And this is as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 2a): <b>On the first of Adar</b> the court <b>makes a</b> public <b>announcement about</b> the contribution to the Temple of half-<b>shekels</b> that will soon be due, <b>and about</b> the need to uproot forbidden mixtures of <b>diverse kinds</b> of seeds from the fields now that they have begun to sprout. Therefore, it turns out that the Jewish people give the shekels on the first of Adar, preceding the date of Haman’s planned destruction of the Jewish people and his own collecting of shekels.
Ahasuerus responded to Haman’s request: <b>“And the king said to Haman: The silver is given to you; the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you”</b> (Esther 3:11). <b>Rabbi Abba said:</b>

Daf 14a

The actions of <b>Ahasuerus and Haman</b> can be understood with <b>a parable; to what may they be compared? To two individuals, one</b> of whom <b>had a mound in the middle of his field and the other</b> of whom <b>had a ditch in the middle of his field,</b> each one suffering from his own predicament. <b>The owner of the ditch,</b> noticing the other’s mound of dirt, <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Who will give me this mound</b> of dirt suitable for filling in my ditch; I would even be willing to pay <b>for</b> it with <b>money,</b> and <b>the owner of the mound,</b> noticing the other’s ditch, <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Who will give me this ditch for money,</b> so that I may use it to remove the mound of earth from my property?
At a later point, <b>one day, they</b> happened to have <b>met one another. The owner of the ditch said to the owner of the mound: Sell me your mound</b> so I can fill in my ditch. The mound’s owner, anxious to rid himself of the excess dirt on his property, <b>said to him: Take it for free; if only</b> you had done so sooner. Similarly, Ahasuerus himself wanted to destroy the Jews. As he was delighted that Haman had similar aspirations and was willing to do the job for him, he demanded no money from him.
§ The verse states: <b>“And the king removed his ring</b> from his hand” (Esther 3:10). <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The removal of</b> Ahasuerus’s <b>ring</b> for the sealing of Haman’s decree <b>was more effective than the forty-eight prophets and the seven prophetesses who prophesied on behalf of the Jewish people. As, they were all unable to return</b> the Jewish people <b>to the right way, but the removal of</b> Ahasuerus’s <b>ring returned them to the right way,</b> since it brought them to repentance.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Forty-eight prophets and seven prophetesses prophesied on behalf of the Jewish people, and they neither subtracted from nor added onto what is written in the Torah,</b> introducing no changes or additions to the mitzvot <b>except for the reading of the Megilla,</b> which they added as an obligation for all future generations.
The Gemara asks: <b>What exposition</b> led them to determine that this was a proper mode of action? On what basis did they add this mitzva? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said</b> that they reasoned as follows: <b>If,</b> when recalling the exodus from Egypt, in which the Jews were delivered <b>from slavery to freedom, we recite songs</b> of praise, the Song of the Sea and the hymns of <i>hallel</i>, then, in order to properly recall the miracle of Purim and commemorate God’s delivering us <b>from death to life,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that we must sing God’s praise by reading the story in the Megilla?
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> our obligation should be at least as great as when we recall the exodus from Egypt, and <b>let us also recite <i>hallel</i></b> on Purim. The Gemara answers: <i>Hallel</i> is not said on Purim, <b>because <i>hallel</i> is not recited on a miracle</b> that occurred <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael. The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to <b>the exodus from Egypt</b> as well, <b>which was a miracle</b> that occurred <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>how are we able to recite songs</b> of praise?
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Prior to</b> the time when <b>the Jewish people entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>all lands were</b> deemed <b>fit</b> for <b>songs</b> of praise <b>to be recited</b> for miracles performed within their borders, as all lands were treated equally. But <b>after the Jewish people entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, that land became endowed with greater sanctity, <b>and all the</b> other <b>lands were no longer</b> deemed <b>fit</b> for <b>songs</b> of praise <b>to be recited</b> for miracles performed within them.
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> an alternative answer as to why <i>hallel</i> is not recited on Purim: <b>The reading of</b> the Megilla itself <b>is</b> an act of reciting <b><i>hallel</i>. Rava said</b> a third reason why <i>hallel</i> is not recited on Purim: <b>Granted</b> that <i>hallel</i> is said <b>there,</b> when recalling the exodus from Egypt, as after the salvation there, they could recite the phrase in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“Give praise, O servants of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 113:1); after their servitude to Pharaoh ended with their salvation, they were truly servants of the Lord <b>and not servants of Pharaoh. But</b> can it be said <b>here,</b> after the limited salvation commemorated on Purim: <b>“Give praise, O servants of the Lord,”</b> which would indicate that after the salvation the Jewish people were only servants of the Lord <b>and not servants of Ahasuerus?</b> No, even after the miracle of Purim, <b>we were still the servants of Ahasuerus,</b> as the Jews remained in exile under Persian rule, and consequently the salvation, which was incomplete, did not merit an obligation to say <i>hallel</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> this is <b>difficult. Isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: <b>After the Jewish people entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, that land became endowed with greater sanctity, <b>and all the</b> other <b>lands were no longer</b> deemed <b>fit</b> for <b>songs</b> of praise <b>to be recited</b> for miracles performed within them. Therefore, there should be no <i>hallel</i> obligation on Purim for the miracle performed outside of the land of Israel, and Rav Naḥman’s and Rava’s alternative explanations are incorrect. The Gemara answers: They understood differently, as it can be argued that <b>when</b> the people <b>were exiled</b> from Eretz Yisrael, the other lands <b>returned to their initial suitability,</b> and were once again deemed fit for reciting <i>hallel</i> on miracles performed within them.
With regard to the statement that forty-eight prophets and seven prophetesses prophesied on behalf of the Jewish people, the Gemara asks: <b>Is there no one else? Isn’t it written</b> with regard to Samuel’s father, Elkanah: <b>“And there was a certain [<i>eḥad</i>] man from Ramathaim-zophim”</b> (I Samuel 1:1), which is expounded as follows to indicate that Elkanah was a prophet: He was <b>one [<i>eḥad</i>] of two hundred [<i>mata’im</i>] prophets [<i>tzofim</i>] who prophesied on behalf of the Jewish people.</b> If so, why was it stated here that there were only forty-eight prophets?
The Gemara answers: In fact, <b>there were more</b> prophets, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Many prophets arose for the Jewish people,</b> numbering <b>double the</b> number of Israelites <b>who left Egypt. However,</b> only a portion of the prophecies were recorded, because only <b>prophecy that was needed for</b> future <b>generations was written</b> down in the Bible for posterity, <b>but that which was not needed,</b> as it was not pertinent to later generations, <b>was not written.</b> Therefore, the fifty-five prophets recorded in the Bible, although not the only prophets of the Jewish people, were the only ones recorded, due to their eternal messages.
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> another explanation of the verse “And there was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim”: <b>A man who comes from two heights [<i>ramot</i>] that face [<i>tzofot</i>] one another. Rabbi Ḥanin said</b> an additional interpretation: <b>A man who descends from people who stood at the height of [<i>rumo</i>] the world.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And who are these</b> people? The Gemara answers: These are the <b>sons of Korah, as it is written: “But the sons of Korah did not die”</b> (Numbers 26:11), and with regard to them <b>it is taught in the name of our teacher,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: A high <b>place was set aside for them in Gehenna,</b> as the sons of Korah repented in their hearts, and were consequently not propelled very far down in Gehenna when the earth opened to swallow Korah and his followers; <b>and they stood on</b> this high place and sung to the Lord. They alone stood at the height of the lower world.
§ The Gemara asks with regard to the prophetesses recorded in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who were the seven prophetesses?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Abigail, Huldah, and Esther.</b> The Gemara offers textual support: <b>Sarah, as it is written:</b> “Haran, <b>the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah”</b> (Genesis 11:29). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Iscah is</b> in fact <b>Sarah. And why was she called Iscah? For she saw [<i>sakhta</i>] by means of divine inspiration, as it is stated: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice”</b> (Genesis 21:12). <b>Alternatively,</b> Sarah was also called <b>Iscah, for all gazed [<i>sokhin</i>] upon her beauty.</b>
<b>Miriam</b> was a prophetess, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly: <b>“And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took</b> a timbrel in her hand” (Exodus 15:20). The Gemara asks: Was she the sister only of Aaron, <b>and not the sister of Moses?</b> Why does the verse mention only one of her brothers? <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rav said: For she prophesied when she was the sister of Aaron,</b> i.e., she prophesied since her youth, even before Moses was born, <b>and she would say: My mother is destined to bear a son who will deliver the Jewish people</b> to salvation. <b>And at the time when</b> Moses <b>was born the entire house was filled with light,</b> and <b>her father stood and kissed her on the head,</b> and <b>said to her: My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled.</b>
<b>But once</b> Moses <b>was cast into the river, her father arose and rapped her on the head, saying to her: My daughter, where is your prophecy</b> now, as it looked as though the young Moses would soon meet his end. <b>This is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written</b> with regard to Miriam’s watching Moses in the river: <b>“And his sister stood at a distance to know</b> what would be done to him” <b>(</b>Exodus 2:4), i.e., <b>to know what would be with the end of her prophecy,</b> as she had prophesied that her brother was destined to be the savior of the Jewish people.
<b>Deborah</b> was a prophetess, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly: <b>“And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth”</b> (Judges 4:4). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“the wife of Lappidoth”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>For she used to make wicks for the Sanctuary,</b> and due to the flames [<i>lappidot</i>] on these wicks she was called the wife of Lappidoth, literally, a woman of flames.
With regard to Deborah, it says: <b>“And she sat under a palm tree”</b> (Judges 4:5). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> and unique with regard to her sitting <b>“under a palm tree”</b> that there is a need for it to be written? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Avshalom said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>being alone together</b> with a man. Since men would come before her for judgment, she established for herself a place out in the open and visible to all, in order to avoid a situation in which she would be secluded with a man behind closed doors. <b>Alternatively,</b> the verse means: <b>Just as a palm tree has only one heart,</b> as a palm tree does not send out separate branches, but rather has only one main trunk, <b>so too, the Jewish people in that generation had only one heart,</b> directed <b>to their Father in Heaven.</b>
<b>Hannah</b> was a prophetess, <b>as it is written: “And Hannah prayed and said, My heart rejoices in the Lord, my horn is exalted in the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 2:1), and her words were prophecy, in that she said: <b>“My horn is exalted,” and not: My pitcher is exalted.</b> As, with regard to <b>David and Solomon, who were anointed</b> with oil <b>from a horn, their kingship continued,</b> whereas with regard to <b>Saul and Jehu, who were anointed</b> with oil <b>from a pitcher, their kingship did not continue.</b> This demonstrates that Hannah was a prophetess, as she prophesied that only those anointed with oil from a horn will merit that their kingships continue.
Apropos the song of Hannah, the Gemara further explains her words: <b>“There is none sacred as the Lord; for there is none beside You [<i>biltekha</i>]”</b> (I Samuel 2:2). <b>Rav Yehuda bar Menashya said: Do not read</b> it as <b><i>biltekha</i>,</b> “beside You,” <b>but rather</b> read it as <b><i>levalotekha</i>,</b> to outlast You. <b>As the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is unlike the attribute of flesh and blood.</b> It is an attribute of man that <b>his handiwork outlasts him</b> and continues to exist even after he dies, <b>but the Holy One, Blessed be He, outlasts His handiwork,</b> as He exists eternally.
Hannah further said: <b>“Neither is there any rock [<i>tzur</i>] like our God”</b> (I Samuel 2:1). This can be understood as saying that <b>there is no artist [<i>tzayyar</i>] like our God.</b> How is He better than all other artists? <b>Man fashions a form upon a wall, but is unable to endow it with breath and a soul,</b> or fill it with <b>innards and intestines, whereas the Holy One, Blessed be He, fashions a form</b> of a fetus <b>inside the form</b> of its mother, rather than on a flat surface, <b>and endows it with breath and a soul</b> and fills it with <b>innards and intestines.</b>
<b>Abigail</b> was a prophetess, <b>as it is written: “And it was so, as she rode on the donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain”</b> (I Samuel 25:20). The Gemara asks: Why does it say: <b>“By the covert [<i>beseter</i>] of the mountain”? It should have said: From the mountain.</b>
The Gemara answers that in fact this must be understood as an allusion to something else. <b>Rabba bar Shmuel said: Abigail,</b> in her attempt to prevent David from killing her husband Nabal, came to David and questioned him <b>on account of</b> menstrual <b>blood that comes from the hidden parts [<i>setarim</i>]</b> of a body. How so? <b>She took</b> a blood-stained cloth <b>and showed it to him,</b> asking him to rule on her status, whether or not she was ritually impure as a menstruating woman. <b>He said to her: Is blood shown at night?</b> One does not examine blood-stained cloths at night, as it is difficult to distinguish between the different shades by candlelight. <b>She said to him:</b> If so, you should also remember another <i>halakha</i>: <b>Are</b> cases of <b>capital law tried at night?</b> Since one does not try capital cases at night, you cannot condemn Nabal to death at night. David <b>said to her:</b>

Daf 14b

Nabal, your husband, <b>is a rebel against the throne,</b> as David had already been anointed as king by the prophet Samuel, and Nabal refused his orders. <b>And</b> therefore <b>there is no need to try him,</b> as a rebel is not accorded the ordinary prescriptions governing judicial proceedings. Abigail <b>said to him:</b> You lack the authority to act in this manner, as <b>Saul is still alive.</b> He is the king in actual practice, and <b>your seal [<i>tivakha</i>] has not</b> yet <b>spread across the world,</b> i.e., your kingship is not yet known to all. Therefore, you are not authorized to try someone for rebelling against the monarchy. David accepted her words and <b>said to her:</b> “And <b>blessed be your discretion and blessed be you who have kept me this day from coming to bloodguiltiness [<i>damim</i>]”</b> (I Samuel 25:33).
The Gemara asks: The plural term <b><i>damim</i>,</b> literally, bloods, <b>indicates two.</b> Why did David not use the singular term <i>dam</i>? <b>Rather, this teaches that</b> Abigail <b>revealed her thigh,</b> and he lusted after her, <b>and he went three parasangs by the fire</b> of his desire for her, and <b>said to her: Listen to me,</b> i.e., listen to me and allow me to be intimate with you. Abigail then <b>said to him: “Let this not be a stumbling block for you”</b> (I Samuel 25:31). <b>By inference,</b> from the word <b>“this,”</b> it can be understood that <b>there is someone else</b> who will in fact be a stumbling block for him, <b>and what is</b> this referring to? <b>The incident involving Bathsheba. And in the end this is what was,</b> as indeed he stumbled with Bathsheba. This demonstrates that Abigail was a prophetess, as she knew that this would occur. This also explains why David blessed Abigail for keeping him from being responsible for two incidents involving blood that day: Abigail’s menstrual blood and the shedding of Nabal’s blood.
Apropos Abigail, the Gemara explains additional details in the story. Abigail said to David: <b>“Yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bond of life</b> with the Lord your God” (I Samuel 25:29), and <b>when she parted from him she said to him: “And when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, and you shall remember your handmaid”</b> (I Samuel 25:31).
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>this</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: While a woman is engaged in conversation</b> she also holds <b>the spindle,</b> i.e., while a woman is engaged in one activity she is already taking steps with regard to another. Abigail came to David in order to save her husband Nabal, but at the same time she indicates that if her husband dies, David should remember her and marry her. And indeed, after Nabal’s death David took Abigail for his wife. <b>Some say</b> that Rav Naḥman referred to a different saying: <b>The goose stoops</b> its head <b>as it goes</b> along, <b>but its eyes look on from afar</b> to find what it is looking for. So too, Abigail acted in similar fashion.
<b>Huldah</b> was a prophetess, <b>as it is written: “So Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam and Achbor</b> and Shaphan and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess” (II Kings 22:14) as emissaries of King Josiah. The Gemara asks: <b>But if Jeremiah was found there, how could she prophesy?</b> Out of respect for Jeremiah, who was her superior, it would have been fitting that she not prophesy in his presence. The Sages of <b>the school of Rav say in the name of Rav: Huldah was a</b> close <b>relative of Jeremiah, and he did not object to her</b> prophesying in his presence.
The Gemara asks: <b>But how could Josiah himself ignore Jeremiah and send</b> emissaries <b>to</b> Huldah? The Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Sheila say: Because women are</b> more <b>compassionate,</b> and he hoped that what she would tell them would not be overly harsh.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> a different answer: <b>Jeremiah was not there</b> at the time, because <b>he went to bring back the ten tribes</b> from their exile. <b>And from where do we derive that he brought them back? As it is written: “For the seller shall not return to that which he has sold”</b> (Ezekiel 7:13), i.e., Ezekiel prophesied that in the future the Jubilee Year would no longer be in effect. Now <b>is it possible that the Jubilee had</b> already been <b>annulled?</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year apply only when all of the tribes of Israel are settled in their respective places, which could not have happened since the exile of the ten tribes more than a century earlier, <b>but the prophet is prophesying that it will cease</b> only in the future. <b>Rather, this teaches that Jeremiah brought back</b> the ten tribes from their exile.
<b>And Josiah the son of Amon ruled over the</b> ten tribes, <b>as it is written: “Then he said: What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel”</b> (II Kings 23:17). <b>Now what connection did Josiah,</b> king of Judea, <b>have with the altar at Bethel,</b> a city in the kingdom of Israel? <b>Rather, this teaches that Josiah ruled over the</b> ten tribes of Israel. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Proof that the tribes returned may be adduced <b>from</b> the verse <b>here: “Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I would return the captivity of My people”</b> (Hosea 6:11), which indicates that they returned to their places.
<b>Esther</b> was also a prophetess, <b>as it is written: “And it came to pass on the third day that Esther clothed herself in royalty”</b> (Esther 5:1). <b>It should have said:</b> Esther clothed herself in <b>royal garments. Rather,</b> this alludes to the fact <b>that she clothed herself with a divine</b> spirit of <b>inspiration. It is written here: “And she clothed herself,” and it is written elsewhere: “And the spirit clothed Amasai”</b> (I Chronicles 12:19). Just as there the reference is to being enclothed by a spirit, so too Esther was enclothed by a spirit of divine inspiration.
An additional point is mentioned with regard to the prophetesses. <b>Rav Naḥman said: Haughtiness is not befitting a woman.</b> And a proof to this is that <b>there were two haughty women, whose names were</b> identical to the names of <b>loathsome</b> creatures. <b>One,</b> Deborah, <b>was called a hornet,</b> as her Hebrew name, Devorah, means hornet; <b>and one,</b> Huldah, <b>was called a marten,</b> as her name is the Hebrew term for that creature. From where is it known that they were haughty? <b>With regard to</b> Deborah, <b>the hornet, it is written: “And she sent and called Barak”</b> (Judges 4:6), <b>but she herself did not go to him.</b> And <b>with regard to</b> Huldah, <b>the marten, it is written: “Say to the man</b> that sent you to me” (II Kings 22:15), <b>but she did not say: Say to the king.</b>
Furthermore, <b>Rav Naḥman said: Huldah was a descendant of Joshua.</b> An allusion to this <b>is written here:</b> “Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, <b>the son of Harhas [<i>ḥarḥas</i>]”</b> (II Kings 22:14), <b>and it says elsewhere</b> with regard to Joshua: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance <b>in Timnath-heres [<i>ḥeres</i>]”</b> (Judges 2:9), therefore intimating that there is a certain connection between them.
<b>Rav Eina the Elder raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> <b>to Rav Naḥman’s</b> teaching. The <i>baraita</i> indicates that Huldah was in fact a descendant of Rahab, and seemingly not of Joshua: <b>Eight prophets, who were</b> also <b>priests, descended from Rahab the prostitute, and they are: Neriah;</b> his son <b>Baruch; Seraiah; Mahseiah; Jeremiah;</b> his father, <b>Hilkiah;</b> Jeremiah’s cousin <b>Hanamel; and</b> Hanamel’s father, <b>Shallum. Rabbi Yehuda said: So too, Huldah the prophetess was a descendant of Rahab the prostitute,</b> as <b>it is written here</b> with regard to Huldah: <b>“The son of Tikvah,” and it is written elsewhere</b> in reference to Rahab’s escape from the destruction of Jericho: <b>“This cord of [<i>tikvat</i>] scarlet thread”</b> (Joshua 2:18).
Rav Naḥman responded to Eina the Elder and <b>said to him: Eina the Elder, and some say</b> that he said to him: <b>Blackened pot,</b> i.e., my colleague in Torah, who has toiled and blackened his face in Torah study, <b>from me and from you the matter may be concluded,</b> i.e., the explanation lies in a combination of our two statements. <b>For</b> Rahab <b>converted and married Joshua,</b> and therefore Huldah descended from both Joshua and Rahab. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But did Joshua have any descendants? But isn’t it written</b> in the genealogical list of the tribe of Ephraim: <b>“Nun his son, Joshua his son”</b> (I Chronicles 7:27)? The listing does not continue any further, implying that Joshua had no sons. The Gemara answers: Indeed, <b>he did not have sons,</b> but <b>he did have daughters.</b>

Daf 15a

The Gemara asks in reference to the eight prophets descended from Rahab: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>them, it is explicit,</b> i.e., the four sons recorded in the list were certainly prophets, as the Bible states this explicitly: Jeremiah was a prophet, his student Baruch was one of the sons of the prophets, his cousin Hanamel came to him at the word of God (see Jeremiah, chapter 32), and Seraiah was his student. <b>But as for their fathers,</b> Hilkiah, Neriah, Shallum, and Mahseiah, <b>from where do we derive</b> that they were prophets?
The Gemara answers: <b>As</b> taught by <b>Ulla, as Ulla said: Wherever one’s name and his father’s name</b> are mentioned <b>with regard to prophecy, it is known that he was a prophet the son of a prophet,</b> and therefore his father’s name is also mentioned. And wherever <b>his name</b> is mentioned <b>but not his father’s name, it is known that he was a prophet but not the son of a prophet.</b> Similarly, wherever <b>his name and the name of his city are specified, it is known that he was from that</b> particular <b>city,</b> and wherever <b>his name</b> is mentioned <b>but not the name of his city, it is known that he was from Jerusalem.</b>
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> With regard to <b>anyone whose actions and the actions of his ancestors are obscured</b> and not explained, <b>and the verse mentioned one of them favorably, for example,</b> the way in which Zephaniah the prophet is introduced: <b>“The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah”</b> (Zephaniah 1:1), <b>it is known that</b> not only <b>was he a righteous man,</b> he was also <b>the son of a righteous man. And</b> conversely, <b>whenever the verse mentioned one of them unfavorably, for example,</b> in the verse that introduces Ishmael as the one who killed Gedaliah, which states: <b>“And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama”</b> (Jeremiah 41:1), <b>it is known that</b> not only <b>was he a wicked man,</b> he was also <b>the son of a wicked man.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said: Malachi</b> the prophet <b>is</b> in fact <b>Mordecai, and why was he called Malachi?</b> To indicate <b>that he was second to the king [<i>melekh</i>],</b> as Mordecai was appointed such, as is recorded at the end of the Megilla. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Baruch, the son of Neriah; Seraiah, the son of Mahseiah; Daniel; Mordecai; Bilshan; Haggai; Zechariah; and Malachi; all prophesied in the second year of</b> the reign of <b>Darius.</b> The fact that the <i>baraita</i> mentions Mordecai and Malachi separately indicates that they were two different people. The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Malachi is</b> in fact <b>Ezra. And the Rabbis say</b> otherwise: <b>Malachi was his</b> real <b>name,</b> and it was not merely another name for Ezra or another prophet. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> It <b>stands to reason</b> that indeed, they are one and the same person, <b>like</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said that Malachi is Ezra,</b> since there is a similarity between them, <b>as it is stated in Malachi’s prophecy: “Judah has dealt treacherously, and a disgusting thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctity of the Lord which he loved, and has married the daughter of a strange god”</b> (Malachi 2:11).
<b>And who</b> was the one that <b>removed the foreign women</b> who were married to Jews? It was <b>Ezra, as it is written: “And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra: We have broken faith with our God, and have married foreign women</b> of the peoples of the land” (Ezra 10:2). It therefore appears that Malachi was one of Ezra’s names, as the Bible describes them both as confronting an intermarriage epidemic.
To complete the discussion about the prophetesses, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught: There were four women of extraordinary beauty in the world: Sarah, and Abigail, Rahab, and Esther. And according to the one who said</b> that <b>Esther was greenish</b> in color, lacking natural beauty, only that a cord of divine grace was strung around her, <b>remove Esther</b> from the list <b>and insert Vashti</b> in her place, for she was indeed beautiful.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rahab aroused impure thoughts by her name,</b> i.e., the mere mention of her name would inspire lust for her; <b>Yael, by her voice; Abigail, by remembering her; Michal, the daughter of Saul, by her appearance.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who says Rahab, Rahab, immediately experiences a seminal emission</b> due to the arousal of desire caused by Rahab’s great beauty. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him: I say: Rahab, Rahab, and it does not affect me.</b> Rabbi Yitzchak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>When I said this,</b> I was specifically referring <b>to one who knows her</b> personally <b>and recognizes her</b> beauty. Only for one who has met Rahab in person is the mere mention of her name capable of arousing lust.
§ The Gemara returns to its explanation of the verses of the book of Esther. The verse states: <b>“When Mordecai perceived all that was done,</b> Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and bitter cry” (Esther 4:1). The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> Mordecai <b>say</b> when he cried out? <b>Rav said:</b> He said that <b>Haman has risen above Ahasuerus,</b> for he saw that Haman had become even stronger than Ahasuerus himself, and that he controlled all affairs of the empire. <b>And Shmuel said: The upper King has prevailed over the lower king,</b> saying this euphemistically and insinuating just the opposite. In other words, it would appear that Ahasuerus, the lower king, has prevailed over the higher King, God in Heaven, Who desires good for the Jewish people.
The verse states: <b>“Then the queen was exceedingly distressed” [<i>vatitḥalḥal</i>]</b> (Esther 4:4). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>vatitḥalḥal</i>? Rav said:</b> This means <b>that she began to menstruate</b> out of fear, as the cavities, <i>ḥalalim</i>, of her body opened. <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya said: Her bowels were loosened,</b> also understanding the verse as referring to her bodily cavities.
The verse states: <b>“Then Esther called for Hathach,</b> one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her” (Esther 4:5). <b>Rav said: Hathach is</b> in fact the prophet <b>Daniel. And why was he called Hathach? Because he was cut down [<i>ḥatakh</i>] from his greatness</b> during Ahasuerus’s reign, as he was demoted from his high position. Previously he had served as a senior minister, and now he had become Esther’s steward. <b>And Shmuel</b> expounded the name Hathach as derived from <i>ḥatakh</i> in the opposite sense, as he <b>said:</b> Daniel was called Hathach <b>because all the affairs of the kingdom were decided [<i>neḥtakhin</i>] by his word.</b>
The verse continues to relate that Esther sent Hathach to Mordecai after hearing about the decree: <b>“To know what this [<i>zeh</i>] was, and why it [<i>zeh</i>] was”</b> (Esther 4:5). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that Esther <b>sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Mordecai, saying: <b>Perhaps the Jews have transgressed the five books of the Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to the two tablets: <b>“On this [<i>zeh</i>] side and on the other [<i>zeh</i>] side were they written”</b> (Exodus 32:15).
The verse states: <b>“And they told Esther’s words to Mordecai”</b> (Esther 4:12), <b>but he,</b> Hathach himself, <b>did not go to</b> tell <b>him</b> directly. The Gemara explains: <b>From here</b> we see that <b>one does not bring back a sad report.</b> If one has nothing positive to say, it is best for him to remain silent. This explains why Hathach himself did not report the information to Mordecai, and Esther’s words had to be delivered by other messengers.
Esther sent a message to Mordecai: <b>“Go, gather together all the Jews</b> who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night and day; I also and my maidens will fast likewise, and so will I go in to the king, <b>not according to the custom”</b> (Esther 4:16). <b>Rabbi Abba said: It will not be according to</b> my usual <b>custom, for every day until now</b> when I submitted myself to Ahasuerus it was <b>under compulsion, but now</b> I will be submitting myself to him <b>of my</b> own free <b>will.</b> And Esther further said: <b>“And if I perish, I perish”</b> (Esther 4:16). What she meant was: <b>Just as I was lost to my father’s house</b> ever since I was brought here, <b>so too, shall I be lost to you,</b> for after voluntarily having relations with Ahasuerus, I shall be forever forbidden to you.
There is a dispute with regard to the meaning of the verse: <b>“So Mordecai passed [<i>vaya’avor</i>]”</b> (Esther 4:17). <b>Rav said:</b> This means <b>that he passed the first day of Passover as a fast day,</b> understanding the word <i>vaya’avor</i> in the sense of sin [<i>aveira</i>], as by doing so he transgressed the obligation to rejoice on the Festival. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It means <b>that he crossed over [<i>avar</i>] a stream</b> in order to bring the message to all.
The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass on the third day, that Esther clothed herself in royalty”</b> (Esther 5:1). The Gemara asks: <b>It should have said:</b> Esther clothed herself in <b>royal garments. Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: This teaches that she clothed herself with</b> a <b>divine</b> spirit of <b>inspiration,</b> as <b>it is written here: “And she clothed herself,” and it is written elsewhere: “And the spirit clothed Amasai”</b> (I Chronicles 12:19). Just as there the reference is to the spirit of divine inspiration, so too here, the term royalty is referring to the spirit of divine inspiration.
Apropos a statement that Rabbi Elazar said that Rabbi Ḥanina said, the Gemara records other such statements: <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One should never regard the blessing of an ordinary person [<i>hedyot</i>] as light in your eyes, as two</b> of the <b>great men of</b> their <b>generations received blessings from ordinary people and</b> those blessings <b>were fulfilled in them. And they were David and Daniel. David, for Araunah blessed him, as it is written: “And Araunah said to the king,</b> May the Lord your God accept you” (II Samuel 24:23), and it was fulfilled. <b>Daniel, for Darius blessed him, as it is written: “Your God Whom you serve continually, He will rescue you” (</b>Daniel 6:17), and this too was fulfilled when Daniel was saved from the lions’ den.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One should not regard the curse of an ordinary person as light in your eyes, for Abimelech cursed Sarah,</b> saying: <b>“Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes</b> to all that are with you” (Genesis 20:16), <b>and</b> indeed <b>this was fulfilled in her descendant,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,</b> so that he could not see” (Genesis 27:1). Abimelech’s curse of covered eyes was fulfilled through her son Isaac’s blindness.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is unlike the attribute of</b> a man of <b>flesh and blood; for</b> it is <b>the attribute of flesh and blood</b> that <b>a man places the pot on the fire and then puts in the water. However, the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> first <b>puts in the water and then places the pot on the fire, to fulfill that which is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens”</b> (Jeremiah 10:13), which he explains as follows: First God set the multitudes of water in place, and afterward He created the heavens to hold the water.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever reports a saying in the name of he who said it brings redemption to the world. As it is stated</b> with respect to the incident of Bigthan and Teresh: <b>“And Esther reported it to the king in the name of Mordecai”</b> (Esther 2:22), and this eventually brought redemption, as Mordecai was later rewarded for saving the king’s life, paving the way for the miraculous salvation.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> When <b>a righteous man</b> passes from this earth and is <b>lost,</b> he <b>is lost</b> only <b>for</b> the rest of <b>his generation,</b> who is now deprived of him, not for the righteous individual himself. This is <b>similar to a man who has lost a pearl.</b> The pearl does not care if it is lost, as <b>wherever it is</b> found, <b>it is</b> still <b>a pearl; it is lost only to its owner.</b>
Haman said: <b>“Yet all this avails me nothing”</b> (Esther 5:13). <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: When Haman saw Mordecai sitting at the king’s gate he said: Yet all this avails me nothing.</b> This may be understood <b>as</b> was suggested <b>by Rav Ḥisda, for Rav Ḥisda said: This one,</b> Mordecai, <b>came as</b> one with the heritage of <b>a rich man [<i>perozebuli</i>],</b> whereas <b>that one,</b> Haman, <b>came</b>

Daf 15b

<b>as</b> one with the heritage of <b>a poor man [<i>perozeboti</i>],</b> as Mordecai had been Haman’s slave master and was aware of Haman’s lowly lineage. <b>Rav Pappa said: And he was called: The slave who was sold for</b> a loaf of <b>bread.</b>
Haman’s previously quoted statement: <b>“Yet all this avails me nothing”</b> (Esther 5:13), <b>teaches that all the treasures of that wicked one were engraved on his heart, and when he saw Mordecai sitting at the king’s gate, he said:</b> As long as Mordecai is around, <b>all this</b> that I wear on my heart <b>avails me nothing.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will be a crown on the head of each and every righteous man. As it is stated: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory,</b> and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of His people” (Isaiah 28:5). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“for a crown of glory [<i>tzevi</i>], and for a diadem [<i>velitzefirat</i>] of beauty”?</b> A crown <b>for those that do His will [<i>tzivyono</i>] and</b> a diadem <b>for those that await [<i>velamtzapin</i>] His glory.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this extends <b>to all</b> such individuals. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the residue of his people,” to whoever regards himself as a remainder,</b> i.e., small and unimportant like residue. But whoever holds himself in high esteem will not merit this.
Apropos the quotation from Isaiah, the Gemara explains the following verse, which states: “And for a spirit of justice to him that sits in judgment and for strength to them that turn back the battle to the gate” (Isaiah 28:6). <b>“And for a spirit of justice”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who brings his</b> evil <b>inclination to trial</b> and forces himself to repent. <b>“To him that sits in judgment”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who judges an absolutely true judgment. “And for strength”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who triumphs over his</b> evil <b>inclination. “Them that turn back the battle”;</b> this is referring to those <b>that give and take</b> in their discussion of <i>halakha</i> <b>in the battle of</b> understanding <b>the Torah. “To the gate”;</b> this is referring to <b>the Torah scholars who arrive early and stay late</b> at the darkened gates <b>of the synagogues and study halls.</b>
The Gemara continues with an episode associated with a verse in Isaiah. <b>The Attribute of Justice said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, how are these,</b> referring to the Jewish people, <b>different from those,</b> the other nations of the world, such that God performs miracles only on behalf of the Jewish people? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> it: <b>The Jewish people occupied themselves with Torah,</b> whereas <b>the</b> other <b>nations of the world did not occupy themselves with Torah.</b>
The Attribute of Justice <b>said to Him: “These also reel through wine, and stagger through strong drink;</b> the priest and the prophet reel through strong drink, they are confused because of wine, they stagger because of strong drink; they reel in vision, <b>they stumble [<i>paku</i>] in judgment [<i>peliliyya</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 28:7). The word <b><i>paku</i></b> in this context is referring <b>only to Gehenna, as it is stated: “That this shall not be a cause of stumbling [<i>puka</i>] to you”</b> (I Samuel 25:31), <b>and</b> the word <b><i>peliliyya</i></b> here is referring <b>only to judges, as it is stated: “And he shall pay as the judges determine [<i>bifelilim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:22). The response of the Attribute of Justice was essentially that the Jewish people have also sinned and are consequently liable to receive punishment.
§ The Gemara returns to its explanation of the verses of the Megilla. The verse states with regard to Esther: <b>“And she stood in the inner court of the king’s house”</b> (Esther 5:1). <b>Rabbi Levi said: Once she reached the chamber of the idols,</b> which was in the inner court, <b>the Divine Presence left her. She</b> immediately <b>said: “My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?”</b> (Psalms 22:2). <b>Perhaps</b> it is because <b>You judge an unintentional sin as one</b> performed <b>intentionally, and</b> an action <b>done due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond one’s control as</b> one done <b>willingly.</b>
<b>Or perhaps</b> You have left me <b>because</b> in my prayers <b>I called</b> Haman <b>a dog, as it is stated: “Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one from the hand of the dog”</b> (Psalms 22:21). <b>She</b> at once <b>retracted and called him</b> in her prayers <b>a lion, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“Save me from the lion’s mouth”</b> (Psalms 22:22).
The verse states: <b>“And so it was, that when the king saw Esther the queen</b> standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand” (Esther 5:2). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three ministering angels happened to join her at that time: One that raised up her neck,</b> so that she could stand erect, free of shame; <b>one that strung a cord</b> of divine <b>grace around her,</b> endowing her with charm and beauty; <b>and one that stretched the</b> king’s <b>scepter.</b>
<b>How much</b> was it stretched? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The scepter <b>was two cubits, and he made it twelve</b> cubits. <b>And some say</b> that he made it <b>sixteen</b> cubits, <b>and</b> yet <b>others say twenty-four</b> cubits. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> He made it <b>sixty</b> cubits. <b>And similarly you find with the arm of Pharaoh’s daughter,</b> which she stretched out to take Moshe. <b>And so too, you find with the teeth of the wicked, as it is written: “You have broken the teeth of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 3:8), with regard to which <b>Reish Lakish said: Do not read</b> it as <b>“You have broken [<i>shibbarta</i>],” but</b> as: <b>You have enlarged [<i>sheribavta</i>]. Rabba bar Oferan said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, who heard it from his teacher, who</b> in turn heard it <b>from his teacher:</b> The scepter was stretched <b>two hundred</b> cubits.
The verse states: <b>“Then the king said to her” (Esther 5:3), to Esther the queen, “What is your wish, even to half the kingdom, it shall be performed”</b> (Esther 5:6). The Gemara comments that Ahasuerus intended only a limited offer: Only <b>half the kingdom, but not the whole kingdom, and not something that would serve as a barrier to the kingdom,</b> as there is one thing to which the kingdom will never agree. <b>And what is that? The building of the Temple;</b> if that shall be your wish, realize that it will not be fulfilled.
The verse states that Esther requested: “If it seem good unto the king, <b>let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet</b> that I have prepared for him” (Esther 5:4). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What did Esther see to invite Haman</b> to the banquet? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: She hid a snare for him, as it is stated: “Let their table become a snare before them”</b> (Psalms 69:23), as she assumed that she would be able to trip up Haman during the banquet.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: She learned</b> to do <b>this from</b> the Jewish teachings of <b>her father’s house, as it is stated: “If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat”</b> (Proverbs 25:21). <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> She invited him <b>in order</b> that he be near her at all times, <b>so that he would not take counsel and rebel</b> against Ahasuerus when he discovered that the king was angry with him.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> She invited Haman <b>so that it not be found out that she was a Jew,</b> as had she distanced him, he would have become suspicious. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> She did this <b>so that the Jewish people would not say: We have a sister in the king’s house, and</b> consequently <b>neglect their</b> prayers for divine <b>mercy. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> She acted in this manner, <b>so that</b> Haman would <b>always be on hand for her,</b> as that would enable her to find an opportunity to cause him to stumble before the king. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said</b> that Esther said to herself: <b>Perhaps the Omnipresent will take notice</b> that all are supporting Haman and nobody is supporting the Jewish people, <b>and He will perform for us a miracle.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> She said to herself: <b>I will act kindly toward him</b> and thereby bring the king to suspect that we are having an affair; she did so <b>in order that</b> both <b>he and she would be killed.</b> Essentially, Esther was willing to be killed with Haman in order that the decree would be annulled. <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> Ahasuerus <b>was a fickle king,</b> and Esther hoped that if he saw Haman on multiple occasions, eventually he would change his opinion of him. <b>Rabban Gamliel said: We still need</b> the words of Rabbi Eliezer <b>HaModa’i</b> to understand why Esther invited Haman to her banquet. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer HaModa’i says: She made the king jealous of him and she made the</b> other <b>ministers jealous of him,</b> and in this way she brought about his downfall.
<b>Rabba says:</b> Esther invited Haman to her banquet in order to fulfill that which is stated: <b>“Pride goes before destruction”</b> (Proverbs 16:18), which indicates that in order to destroy the wicked, one must first bring them to pride. It can be understood according to <b>Abaye and Rava, who both say</b> that she invited Haman in order to fulfill the verse: <b>“When they are heated, I will make feasts for them,</b> and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep” (Jeremiah 51:39). The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba bar Avuh</b> once <b>happened upon Elijah</b> the Prophet and <b>said to him: In accordance with whose understanding did Esther see</b> fit to <b>act in this manner?</b> What was the true reason behind her invitation? <b>He,</b> Elijah, <b>said to him:</b> Esther was motivated by all the reasons previously mentioned and did so <b>for all</b> the reasons previously stated by <b>the <i>tanna’im</i> and all</b> the reasons stated by <b>the <i>amora’im</i>.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons”</b> (Esther 5:11). The Gemara asks: <b>And how many</b> sons did he in fact have that are referred to as <b>“the multitude of his sons”? Rav said:</b> There were <b>thirty</b> sons; <b>ten</b> of them <b>died</b> in childhood, <b>ten of them were hanged</b> as recorded in the book of Esther, <b>and ten</b> survived and were forced to <b>beg at</b> other people’s <b>doors.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: Those that begged at</b> other people’s <b>doors</b> numbered <b>seventy, as it is written: “Those that were full, have hired themselves out for bread”</b> (I Samuel 2:5). <b>Do not read it as: “Those that were full” [<i>seve’im</i></b>]; <b>rather,</b> read it as <b>seventy [<i>shivim</i>],</b> indicating that there were seventy who “hired themselves out for bread.”
<b>And Rami bar Abba said: All of</b> Haman’s sons together numbered <b>two hundred and eight, as it is stated: “And the multitude [<i>verov</i>] of his sons.”</b> The numerical value of the word <i>verov</i> equals two hundred and eight, alluding to the number of his sons. The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> in fact, <b>the numerical value [<i>gimatriyya</i>] of</b> the word <b><i>verov</i> equals two hundred and fourteen,</b> not two hundred and eight. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The word <b><i>verov</i> is written</b> in the Bible without the second <i>vav</i>, and therefore its numerical value equals two hundred and eight.
The verse states: <b>“On that night the sleep of the king was disturbed”</b> (Esther 6:1). <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said:</b> The verse alludes to another king who could not sleep; <b>the sleep of the King of the universe,</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>was disturbed. And the Sages say:</b> The sleep of <b>the higher ones,</b> the angels, <b>was disturbed, and</b> the sleep of <b>the lower ones,</b> the Jewish people, <b>was disturbed. Rava said:</b> This should be understood <b>literally: The sleep of King Ahasuerus</b> was disturbed.
And this was the reason Ahasuerus could not sleep: <b>A thought occurred to him</b> and <b>he said</b> to himself: <b>What is this before us that Esther has invited Haman? Perhaps they are conspiring against that man,</b> i.e., against me, <b>to kill him. He</b> then <b>said again</b> to himself: <b>If this is so, is there no man who loves me and would inform me</b> of this conspiracy? <b>He</b> then <b>said again</b> to himself: <b>Perhaps there is some man who has done a favor for me and I have not</b> properly <b>rewarded him, and due to that</b> reason <b>people refrain from revealing to me</b> information regarding such plots, as they see no benefit for themselves. <b>Immediately</b> afterward, the verse states: <b>“And he commanded the book of remembrances of the chronicles to be brought”</b> (Esther 6:1).
The verse states: <b>“And they were read</b> before the king” (Esther 6:1). The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> passive form: “And they were read,” <b>teaches that they were read</b> miraculously <b>by themselves.</b> It further says: <b>“And it was found written [<i>katuv</i>]”</b> (Esther 6:2). The Gemara asks: Why does the Megilla use the word <i>katuv</i>, which indicates that it was newly written? <b>It should have said: A writing [<i>ketav</i>]</b> was found, which would indicate that it had been written in the past. The Gemara explains: This <b>teaches</b>

Daf 16a

<b>that Shimshai,</b> the king’s scribe who hated the Jews (see Ezra 4:17), <b>was erasing</b> the description of Mordecai’s saving the king, <b>and</b> the angel <b>Gavriel was writing</b> it again. Therefore, it was indeed being written in the present. <b>Rabbi Asi said: Rabbi Sheila, a man of the village of Timarta, taught: If something written</b> down <b>below</b> in this world <b>that is for the benefit of the Jewish people cannot be erased, is it not all the more so</b> the case <b>that something written</b> up <b>above</b> in Heaven cannot be erased?
The verse states that Ahasuerus was told with regard to Mordecai: <b>“Nothing has been done for him”</b> (Esther 6:3). <b>Rava said: It is not because they love Mordecai</b> that the king’s servants said this, <b>but rather because they hate Haman.</b>
The verse states: “Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had <b>prepared for him”</b> (Esther 6:4). A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This should be understood to mean: On the gallows that <b>he had prepared for himself.</b>
The verse relates that Ahasuerus ordered Haman to fulfill his idea of the proper way to honor one who the king desires to glorify by parading him around on the king’s horse while wearing the royal garments: “And do so to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate, let nothing fail of all that you have spoken” (Esther 6:10). The Gemara explains that when Ahasuerus said to Haman: <b>“And do so to Mordecai,”</b> Haman <b>said to him</b> in an attempt to evade the order: <b>Who is Mordecai?</b> Ahasuerus <b>said to him: “The Jew.”</b> Haman then <b>said to him: There are several</b> men named <b>Mordecai among the Jews.</b> Ahasuerus then <b>said to him:</b> I refer to the one <b>“who sits at the king’s gate.”</b>
Haman <b>said to him:</b> Why award him such a great honor? <b>It would</b> certainly <b>be enough for him</b> to receive <b>one village [<i>disekarta</i>]</b> as an estate, <b>or one river</b> for the levy of taxes. Ahasuerus <b>said to him: This too you must give him. “Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken,”</b> i.e., provide him with all that you proposed and spoke about in addition to what I had said.
The Gemara describes what occurred as Haman went to follow the king’s orders, as the verse states: <b>“Then Haman took the apparel and the horse”</b> (Esther 6:11). When <b>he went, he found</b> Mordecai <b>as the Sages were sitting before him, and he was demonstrating to them the <i>halakhot</i> of the handful,</b> i.e., the scooping out of a handful of flour from the meal-offering in order to burn it on the altar. <b>Once Mordecai saw him coming toward him with his horse’s</b> reins <b>held in his hands, he became frightened,</b> and <b>he said to the Sages: This evil man has come to kill me. Go away from him so that you should not get burnt from his coals,</b> i.e., that you should not suffer harm as well. <b>At that moment Mordecai wrapped himself</b> in his prayer shawl <b>and stood up to pray. Haman came</b> over to where they were <b>and sat down before them and waited until Mordecai finished his prayer.</b>
In the interim, as he waited, Haman <b>said to</b> the other Sages: <b>With what were you occupied? They said to him: When the Temple is standing, one who pledges a meal-offering would bring a handful of fine flour and achieve atonement with it. He said to them: Your handful of fine flour has come and cast aside my ten thousand pieces of silver,</b> which I had pledged toward the destruction of the Jewish people. When Mordecai finished praying, <b>he said to</b> Haman: <b>Wicked man,</b> when <b>a slave buys property, to whom belongs the slave and to whom belongs the property?</b> As I once bought you as a slave, what silver can be yours?
Haman <b>said to him: Stand up, put on these garments and ride on this horse, for the king wants you</b> to do so. Mordecai <b>said to him: I cannot</b> do so <b>until I enter the bathhouse</b> [<b><i>bei vanei</i></b>] <b>and trim my hair, for it is not proper conduct to use the king’s garments in this state</b> that I am in now.
In the meantime, <b>Esther sent</b> messengers and <b>closed all the bathhouses and all</b> the shops of <b>the craftsmen,</b> including the bloodletters and barbers. When Haman saw that there was nobody else to do the work, <b>he</b> himself <b>took</b> Mordecai <b>into the bathhouse and washed him, and</b> then <b>he went and brought scissors [<i>zuza</i>] from his house and trimmed his hair.</b> While <b>he was trimming</b> his hair <b>he injured himself and sighed.</b> Mordecai <b>said to him: Why do you sigh?</b> Haman <b>said to him: The man whom the king had</b> once <b>regarded above all his</b> other <b>ministers is now made a bathhouse attendant</b> [<b><i>balanei</i></b>] <b>and a barber.</b> Mordecai <b>said to him: Wicked man, were you not</b> once <b>the barber of the village of Kartzum?</b> If so, why do you sigh? You have merely returned to the occupation of your youth. It <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Haman was the barber of the village of Kartzum for twenty-two years.</b>
<b>After</b> Haman <b>trimmed his hair,</b> Haman <b>dressed</b> Mordecai in <b>the</b> royal <b>garments.</b> Haman then <b>said to him: Mount</b> the horse <b>and ride.</b> Mordecai <b>said to him: I am unable, as my strength has waned from the days of fasting</b> that I observed. Haman then <b>stooped down</b> before him <b>and</b> Mordecai <b>ascended</b> on him. <b>As he was ascending</b> the horse, Mordecai <b>gave</b> Haman <b>a kick.</b> Haman <b>said to him: Is it not written for you: “Do not rejoice when your enemy falls”</b> (Proverbs 24:17)? Mordecai <b>said to him: This</b> statement <b>applies</b> only to <b>Jews, but with regard to you it is written: “And you shall tread upon their high places”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:29).
The verse states: <b>“And he proclaimed before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor”</b> (Esther 6:11). <b>As</b> Haman <b>was taking</b> Mordecai <b>along the street of Haman’s house,</b> Haman’s <b>daughter was standing on the roof and saw</b> the spectacle. <b>She thought</b> to herself that <b>the one who is riding</b> on the horse must be <b>her father, and the one walking before him</b> must be <b>Mordecai. She</b> then <b>took a chamber pot</b> full of feces <b>and cast its</b> contents <b>onto the head of her father,</b> whom she mistakenly took as Mordecai. When Haman <b>raised his eyes</b> in disgust afterward, and looked up at his daughter, <b>she saw that he was her father.</b> In her distress, <b>she fell from the roof to the ground and died.</b>
<b>And this is as it is written: “And Mordecai returned to the king’s gate”</b> (Esther 6:12). <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This means <b>that he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting</b> over the troubles of the Jewish people. Simultaneously, <b>“but Haman hastened to his house, mourning, and having his head covered”</b> (Esther 6:12). <b>“Mourning”; over</b> the death of <b>his daughter. “And having his head covered”; due to what had happened to him,</b> as his head was full of filth.
The following verse states: <b>“And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends</b> everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him: If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, then you will not prevail over him, but you shall fall before him” (Esther 6:13). The Gemara comments: At the beginning of the verse <b>it calls them “his friends,” and</b> in the continuation of the verse <b>it calls them “his wise men.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whoever says something wise, even if</b> he is <b>from the nations of the world, is called</b> a <b>wise</b> man.
The Gemara explains that their wise remark, which earned them their distinction, is contained in their advice: <b>“If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews [<i>Yehudim</i>],</b> then you will not prevail over him” (Esther 6:13). The word <i>Yehudim</i> can also refer to people from the tribe of Judah. Haman’s wise men thereby <b>said to him: If he descends from the other tribes, you can</b> still <b>prevail over him, but if he</b> descends <b>from the tribe of</b> either <b>Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, or Manasseh, you cannot prevail over him.</b> With regard to <b>Judah,</b> the proof of this is <b>as it is written: “Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies”</b> (Genesis 49:8), indicating that Judah will emerge victorious over his enemies. And the proof that Haman cannot prevail over <b>the others</b> that were mentioned is <b>as it is written with regard to them: “Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your might”</b> (Psalms 80:3).
The wise men continued: <b>“But you shall fall [<i>nafol tippol</i>] before him”</b> (Esther 6:13). <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: Why are these two fallings,</b> <i>nafol</i> and <i>tippol</i>, mentioned here? The wise men <b>said to</b> Haman: <b>This</b> Jewish <b>nation is compared</b> in the Bible <b>to the dust</b> of the earth <b>and it is</b> also <b>compared to the stars</b> in heaven. This teaches you that <b>when they descend, they descend to the dust, and when they rise, they rise to the stars.</b> Accordingly, when Mordecai is on the rise, you will be utterly incapable of prevailing over him.
The next verse states: <b>“The king’s chamberlains came, and they hastened [<i>vayavhilu</i>]</b> to bring Haman” (Esther 6:14). <b>This teaches that they brought him in disarray [<i>behala</i>],</b> not even giving him a chance to wash himself from the filth.
During the banquet Esther said to Ahasuerus: <b>“For we are sold, I and my people,</b> to be destroyed, to be slain, and to be annihilated. But if we had been sold merely for bondmen and bondwomen, I would have held my tongue, <b>since the affliction [<i>tzar</i>] would not have been worth [<i>eino shoveh</i>] the damage to the king”</b> (Esther 7:4). The Gemara explains that <b>she said to him: This adversary [<i>tzar</i>] is not concerned [<i>eino shoveh</i>] about the damage</b> that he is constantly causing <b>to the king. First he was jealous of Vashti and killed her,</b> as it has been explained that Memucan, who suggesting killing Vashti, was Haman; <b>now he is jealous of me and desires to kill me.</b>
The verse states: <b>“Then said the king Ahasuerus and said to Esther the queen”</b> (Esther 7:5). The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need it to say <b>“said”</b> and again <b>“said”? Rabbi Abbahu said: At first</b> he spoke to her <b>through the translator,</b> who would interpret on his behalf, because he thought that she was a common woman of lowly ancestry. <b>Once she told him that she came from the house of Saul, immediately</b> it says: <b>“And said to Esther the queen.”</b> Ahasuerus himself spoke to her, as if she had royal lineage, she was a woman befitting his status.
The next verse states: <b>“And Esther said: An adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman”</b> (Esther 7:6). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that she was</b> in fact <b>pointing toward Ahasuerus,</b> indicating that in fact he was an adversary and enemy, <b>and an angel came and pushed her hand toward Haman.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And the king arose</b> from the banquet of wine <b>in his wrath</b> and went into the palace garden” (Esther 7:7), and the next verse states: <b>“Then the king returned out of the palace garden</b> to the place of the wine drinking” (Esther 7:8). The Gemara comments: The verses here <b>compare his returning to his arising: Just as his arising</b> was <b>in wrath, so too, his returning</b> was <b>in wrath.</b> And why did he return in wrath? <b>For</b> when <b>he went</b> out <b>he found ministering angels who appeared to him as people and they were uprooting trees from the garden, and he said to them: What are you doing? They said to him: Haman commanded us</b> to do this.
And when <b>he entered his house</b> he saw that <b>“Haman was falling upon the bed”</b> (Esther 7:8). The Gemara asks: Why does it say <b>“was falling” [<i>nofel</i>]</b> in the present tense, implying that he was currently falling? <b>It should have said “fell” [<i>nafal</i>]</b> in the past tense. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This teaches that an angel came and pushed him down on it,</b> and every time he would try to stand up, the angel would push him down again. Ahasuerus <b>said: Woe unto</b> me <b>in the house and woe</b> unto me <b>outside,</b> as the verse continues: <b>“Then the king said: Will he even force the queen before me in the house?”</b> (Esther 7:8).
<b>“And Harbonah,</b> one of the chamberlains, <b>said</b> before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman” (Esther 7:9). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Harbonah was also wicked and involved in that plot,</b> as he too wanted Mordecai executed. <b>Once he saw that his plot had not succeeded, he immediately fled</b> and joined Mordecai’s side. <b>And this is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “It hurls itself at him, and does not spare; he would fain flee out of its hand”</b> (Job 27:22), indicating that when God sends calamity upon a wicked person, his friends immediately flee from him.
The verse states: <b>“Then the king’s wrath was assuaged [<i>shakhakha</i>]”</b> (Esther 7:10). The Gemara asks: <b>Why are there two assuagings here?</b> The term <i>shakhakha</i> is used rather than <i>shaka</i> and indicates doubled wrath. There was <b>one</b> assuaging of the wrath <b>of the King of the universe, and one</b> of the wrath <b>of Ahasuerus. And some say:</b> Ahasuerus’s wrath burned within him for two reasons; <b>one due to</b> Haman’s involvement with <b>Esther, and one due to</b> his involvement with <b>Vashti,</b> and now they were both assuaged.
Before continuing its midrashic interpretation of the rest of the book of Esther, the Gemara expounds a verse concerning Joseph that relates to the Megilla: <b>“To all of them he gave each man changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave</b> three hundred pieces of silver, and <b>five changes</b> of clothing” (Genesis 45:22). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it possible that in the</b> very <b>thing from which that righteous man</b> Joseph <b>had suffered,</b> as his father’s show of favoritism toward him aroused the enmity of his brothers,

Daf 16b

<b>he</b> himself <b>should stumble</b> by showing favoritism to Benjamin? <b>As Rava bar Meḥaseyya said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: Due to</b> the weight of <b>two sela of fine wool that Jacob</b> gave to Joseph, which he <b>added to</b> what he gave <b>Joseph beyond</b> what he gave <b>the rest of his brothers,</b> as he made him his special coat, <b>the story progressed and our forefathers went down to Egypt.</b> How then could Joseph have displayed similar favoritism toward Benjamin? <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said: He</b> was not showing favoritism. Rather, he <b>intimated to him that a descendant was destined to issue from him who would go out from the presence of the king</b> wearing <b>five royal garments, as it is stated: “And Mordecai went forth</b> from the presence of the king <b>in royal apparel of sky blue</b> and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a wrap of fine linen and purple” (Esther 8:15).
The Gemara elaborates on certain elements in the story of Joseph and his brothers. The verse states with regard to Joseph: <b>“And he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck [<i>tzavarei</i></b>] and wept” (Genesis 45:14). The wording of the verse gives rise to a question, as the word <i>tzavarei</i> is plural, meaning necks: <b>How many necks did Benjamin have,</b> such that the verse should use the plural <i>tzavarei</i> rather than the singular <i>tzavar</i>? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This intimates <b>that</b> Joseph <b>cried over the two Temples that were destined to be in the</b> tribal <b>territory of Benjamin and were destined to be destroyed.</b> The same verse continues: <b>“And Benjamin wept on his neck”</b> (Genesis 45:14); <b>he cried over the tabernacle of Shiloh that was destined to be in the</b> tribal <b>territory of Joseph and was destined to be destroyed.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin”</b> (Genesis 45:12). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Joseph <b>said to</b> his brothers as follows: <b>Just as I</b> certainly <b>harbor no</b> resentment <b>in my heart toward my brother Benjamin, for he was not</b> even <b>present when I was sold, so too, I harbor no</b> resentment <b>toward you.</b> The verse continues: <b>“That it is my mouth [<i>ki fi</i>] that speaks to you”</b> (Genesis 45:12), i.e., <b>As my mouth [<i>kefi</i>] is, so is my heart.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And to his father he sent after this manner ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 45:23). The Gemara asks: <b>What are “the good things of Egypt”</b> that are mentioned but not specified here? <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: He sent him aged wine, which the elderly find pleasing.</b>
Following Jacob’s death, it states concerning Joseph: <b>“And his brothers even went and fell down before him”</b> (Genesis 50:18). <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: When the fox is in its hour, bow down to it,</b> i.e., if a fox is appointed king, one must bow down before and submit oneself to it.
The Gemara expresses astonishment at the use of this parable: Are you calling Joseph <b>a fox? What, was he inferior to his brothers</b> such that in relation to them you call him a fox? <b>Rather, if such a statement was stated, it was stated as follows,</b> not in connection with this verse, but rather in connection with a different verse. The verse states: <b>“And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed”</b> (Genesis 47:31). With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: When the fox is in its hour, bow down to it,</b> as Jacob had to bow down before his son Joseph, who had reached greatness.
It says with regard to Joseph’s remarks to his brothers: <b>“And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts”</b> (Genesis 50:21). <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that he spoke to them words that are acceptable to the heart,</b> and alleviated their fears. This is what he said: <b>If ten lights could not put out one light,</b> as all of you were unable to do me harm, <b>how can one light put out ten lights?</b>
§ The Gemara returns to its explanation of the Megilla. The verse states: <b>“The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor”</b> (Esther 8:16). <b>Rav Yehuda said: “Light”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that they once again studied. <b>And similarly it says: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>“Gladness” [<i>simḥa</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>the Festivals</b> that they once again observed. <b>And similarly it says: “And you shall be glad [<i>vesamakhta</i>] on your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). <b>“Joy” [<i>sasson</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>circumcision,</b> as they once again circumcised their sons. <b>And similarly it says: “I rejoice [<i>sas</i>] at Your word”</b> (Psalms 119:162), which the Sages understood as referring to David’s rejoicing over the mitzva of circumcision.
<b>“Honor”; this is</b> referring to <b>phylacteries,</b> which they once again donned. <b>And similarly it says: “And all peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the Lord; and they will be afraid of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great said: This</b> is referring to <b>the phylacteries worn on the head.</b> Haman had banned the fulfillment of all the mitzvot mentioned, but upon Haman’s demise the Jews returned to their observance.
The verse states: “And in Shushan the capital the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. <b>And Parshandatha…</b>and Vaizatha, <b>the ten sons of Haman”</b> (Esther 9:6–10). <b>Rav Adda from Jaffa said:</b> When reading the Megilla, the names of <b>the ten sons of Haman and</b> the word <b>“ten” must be said in one breath. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>their souls all departed together. Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The letter <b><i>vav</i> in</b> the name <b>“Vaizatha”</b> is a lengthened <i>vav</i> and <b>must be elongated as a pole, like a steering oar of a ship [<i>liberot</i>]. What is the reason</b> for this? To indicate that <b>they were all hanged on one pole.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Sheila, a man of the village of Timarta, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: All</b> of <b>the songs</b> in the Bible <b>are written</b> in the form of <b>a half brick arranged upon a whole brick and a whole brick arranged upon a half brick,</b> i.e., each line of the song is divided into a stitch of text, referred to as a half brick, which is separated by a blank space, referred to as a whole brick, from the concluding stitch of that line of text.
The next line of the song inverts the sequence. <b>This is the principle for all songs in the Bible except</b> for <b>this song,</b> referring to the list of Haman’s sons, <b>and</b> the song listing <b>the kings of Canaan</b> who were defeated by Joshua. These two songs are written in the form of <b>a half brick arranged upon a half brick and a whole brick arranged upon a whole brick,</b> i.e., one stitch of text over another, and one blank space over another. <b>What is the reason</b> that these two songs are written in this anomalous fashion? <b>So that they should never rise from their downfall.</b> Just as a wall that is built in this manner will not stand, so too, these individuals should have no resurgence.
The verse states: <b>“And the king said to Esther the queen: The Jews have slain</b> and destroyed five hundred men <b>in Shushan the capital,</b> and also the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition and it shall be granted to you; and what more do you request, and it shall be done” (Esther 9:12). <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: This teaches that an angel came and slapped him on his mouth,</b> so that he was unable to finish what he was saying; he started with a complaint about what the Jews were doing, but ended on an entirely different note.
The verse states: <b>“But when she came before the king, he said with a letter”</b> (Esther 9:25). Why does it say: <b>“He said”? It should have said: “She said,”</b> as it was Esther who changed the decree. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She said to</b> Ahasuerus: <b>Let it be said by</b> word of <b>mouth,</b> indicating that <b>that which is written in the letter</b> should also be ordered verbally.
With regard to what is stated: <b>“Words of peace and truth”</b> (Esther 9:30), <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi</b> said: This <b>teaches that</b> a Megilla scroll <b>requires scoring,</b> i.e., that the lines for the text must be scored onto the parchment, <b>as the Torah itself,</b> i.e., as is done in a Torah scroll.
The verses say: “The matters of the fasts and their cry. <b>And the decree of Esther confirmed</b> these matters of Purim” (Esther 9:31–32). The Gemara asks: Should we say that <b>“the decree of Esther” indeed</b> confirmed these matters of Purim, but <b>“the matters of the fasts”</b> did <b>not?</b> But didn’t the fasts also contribute to the miracle? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> These two verses, <b>“The matters of the fasts</b> and their cry. <b>And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim,”</b> should be read as one.
The verse states: <b>“For Mordecai the Jew was second to the king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the majority of his brethren”</b> (Esther 10:3). The Gemara comments: The verse indicates that Mordecai was accepted only <b>“By the majority of his brethren,” but not by all his brethren.</b> This <b>teaches that some</b> members <b>of the Sanhedrin parted from him,</b> because he occupied himself with community needs, and was therefore compelled to neglect his Torah study. They felt that this was a mistake and that he should have remained active on the Sanhedrin.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Studying Torah is greater than saving lives, as initially,</b> when listing the Jewish leaders who came to Eretz Yisrael, <b>Mordecai was mentioned after four</b> other people, <b>but at the end</b> he was listed <b>after five.</b> This is taken to indicate that his involvement in governmental affairs instead of in Torah study lowered his stature one notch. The Gemara proves this: <b>At first it is written: “Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan”</b> (Ezra 2:2); <b>but in the end</b> in a later list <b>it is written: “Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahmani, Mordecai, Bilshan”</b> (Nehemiah 7:7).
<b>Rav said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Marta</b> said: <b>Studying Torah is greater</b> and more important <b>than building the Temple.</b> A proof of this is that <b>for as long as Baruch ben Neriah was alive</b> in Babylonia, <b>Ezra,</b> who was his disciple, <b>did not leave him and go up</b> to Eretz Yisrael to build the Temple.
<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta said: Studying Torah is</b> greater and <b>more</b> important <b>than honoring one’s father and mother,</b> and a proof of this is <b>that for all those years that our father Jacob spent in the house of Eber</b> and studied Torah there <b>he was not punished</b> for having neglected to fulfill the mitzva of honoring one’s parents. <b>As the Master said:</b>

Daf 17a

<b>Why were the years of Ishmael mentioned</b> in the Torah? For what purpose were we told the life span of that wicked man? <b>In order to reckon through them the years of Jacob. As it is written: “And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years”</b> (Genesis 25:17). <b>How much older was Ishmael than Isaac? Fourteen years. As it is written: “And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram”</b> (Genesis 16:16). <b>And it is written: “And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him”</b> (Genesis 21:5). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to Jacob and Esau: <b>“And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them”</b> (Genesis 25:26). Based on these verses, <b>how old was Ishmael when Jacob was born? Seventy-four. How many of his years remained</b> then until his death? <b>Sixty-three,</b> as Ishmael died at the age of a hundred and thirty-seven.
<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Jacob our father was sixty-three years old at the time he was blessed by his father, and at that same time Ishmael died.</b> How is it known that these two events occurred at the same time? <b>As it is written: “When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed</b> Jacob…<b>then Esau went to Ishmael and took for a wife Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael,</b> Abraham’s son, <b>the sister of Nebaioth”</b> (Genesis 28:6–9). <b>From the fact that</b> it <b>is stated: “the daughter of Ishmael,” do I not know that she was the sister of Nebaioth?</b> For what purpose then does the verse say this explicitly? <b>This teaches that Ishmael betrothed her</b> to Esau <b>and</b> in the meantime he <b>died, and Nebaioth her brother married her off.</b> Therefore, special mention is made of Nebaioth. Consequently, it is understood that Jacob was sixty-three years old when he received his blessing and left his father’s house.
If we calculate these <b>sixty-three</b> years <b>and</b> the <b>fourteen until Joseph was born, this</b> means that Jacob should have been <b>seventy-seven</b> at the time of Joseph’s birth. <b>And it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh”</b> (Genesis 41:46). <b>This</b> indicates that Jacob should have then been at least <b>a hundred and seven</b> years old when Joseph was thirty. Add the <b>seven</b> years <b>of plenty and</b> the <b>two of famine,</b> and <b>this</b> would then indicate that Jacob should have been <b>a hundred and sixteen</b> years old when he arrived in Egypt in the second year of the famine.
<b>But it is written: “And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life? And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years”</b> (Genesis 47:8–9). Jacob indicated that he was a hundred and thirty when he arrived in Egypt, <b>which is</b> different from the <b>hundred and sixteen</b> years calculated previously. Where are the missing fourteen years from Jacob’s lifetime?
<b>Rather, learn from here</b> that the fourteen years that Jacob spent in the house of Eber are not counted here. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Jacob was</b> studying <b>in the house of Eber for fourteen years</b> while <b>in hiding</b> from his brother Esau. If we were to calculate the life spans recorded in the Torah, we would find that <b>Eber died</b> when Jacob was seventy-nine years old, <b>two years after Jacob our father went down to Aram-naharaim,</b> to the house of Laban. When Jacob <b>left</b> after completing his studying <b>there,</b> he <b>then went</b> immediately <b>to Aram-naharaim.</b> Therefore, <b>when</b> Jacob <b>stood at the well</b> upon his arrival in Aram-naharaim, <b>he was seventy-seven years old.</b>
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Jacob <b>was not punished</b> for the fourteen years that he was in the house of Eber, during which time he failed to fulfill the mitzva of honoring one’s parents? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It turns out that Joseph was away from his father for twenty-two years, just as Jacob our father was away from his</b> own <b>father</b> for that same period of time. According to the previous calculation, however, the <i>baraita</i> is difficult, as <b>Jacob</b> was absent for <b>thirty-six</b> years. Rather, conclude from here that <b>the fourteen</b> years <b>that he was in the house of Eber are not counted,</b> as he was not punished for them.
The Gemara raises an objection: But <b>ultimately,</b> Jacob was in <b>Laban’s house for</b> only <b>twenty years.</b> Why, then, is he faulted for being away from his father for twenty-two years? <b>Rather,</b> he was punished <b>because on his journey</b> back from Aram-naharaim <b>he tarried</b> another <b>two years</b> before returning home to his parents, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Jacob <b>left Aram-naharaim and came to Sukkot, and spent eighteen months there, as it is stated: “And Jacob journeyed to Sukkot, built himself a house, and made booths [<i>sukkot</i>] for his cattle”</b> (Genesis 33:17). The Gemara understands this verse to mean that first he made booths [<i>Sukkot</i>], to live in during the summer, and then he built a house in the winter, and afterward he again made booths [<i>sukkot</i>] during the next summer, indicating that he must have been there for eighteen months. <b>He then was in Bethel for six months, and he brought offerings,</b> totaling two years in all. In this way, all the various calculations of years are reconciled.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who reads the Megilla out of order,</b> reading a later section first, and then going back to the earlier section, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. If <b>he read it by heart,</b> or <b>if he read it in</b> Aramaic <b>translation</b> or <b>in any</b> other <b>language</b> that he does not understand, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>However, for those who speak a foreign language, one may read</b> the Megilla <b>in</b> that <b>foreign language. And one who speaks a foreign language who heard</b> the Megilla read in <b><i>Ashurit</i>,</b> i.e., in Hebrew, <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>If one read</b> the Megilla <b>at intervals,</b> pausing and resuming, <b>or</b> while <b>he is dozing off, he has fulfilled his obligation. If one was writing</b> a Megilla, <b>or expounding upon it, or correcting it,</b> and he read all its words as he was doing so, the following distinction applies: <b>If he had intent</b> to fulfill his obligation with that reading <b>he has fulfilled his obligation, but if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>If</b> one reads from a Megilla that <b>was written</b> not with ink but <b>with <i>sam</i> or with <i>sikra</i> or with <i>komos</i> or with <i>kankantom</i>,</b> or from a Megilla that was written not on parchment but <b>on <i>neyar</i> or on <i>diftera</i>,</b> a kind of unprocessed leather, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. He does not fulfill his obligation <b>unless</b> he reads from a Megilla that <b>is written in <i>Ashurit</i>,</b> i.e., in the Hebrew language and using the Hebrew script, <b>upon parchment and with ink.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna that one who reads the Megilla out of order has not fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rava said: The verse states</b> concerning Purim: “That they should unfailingly observe these two days <b>according to their writing, and according to their appointed times</b> every year” (Esther 9:27), and the word “times” is referring to the two days of Purim, the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar. And we learn by way of analogy: <b>Just as their appointed times cannot be out of order,</b> as the fifteenth of Adar cannot possibly come before the fourteenth, <b>so too, their writing must not be out of order.</b>
The Gemara rejects this derivation: <b>Is reading written here at all?</b> It is “<b>observing”</b> that <b>is written</b> here in this verse, not reading, <b>as it is written: “That they should unfailingly observe these two days</b> according to their writing, and according to their appointed times.” <b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from here, as it is written: “And that these days should be remembered and observed</b> throughout every generation” (Esther 9:28). <b>Remembering is juxtaposed to observing,</b> indicating: <b>Just as observing cannot be out of order,</b> as was derived from the words “That they should unfailingly observe these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed times,” <b>so too, remembering,</b> by reading the Megilla, <b>may not be out of order.</b>
§ The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <i>halakha</i> of not reading out of order applies <b>also to <i>hallel</i>, and also to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, and</b> also <b>to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> meaning that to fulfill one’s obligation he must recite the text of each of these in order.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>hallel</i></b> may not be recited out of order? <b>Rabba said: As it is written</b> in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“From the rising of the sun until its setting</b> the Lord’s name is to be praised” (Psalms 113:3). Just as the sunrise and sunset cannot be reversed, so too, <i>hallel</i> may not be recited out of order. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is derived from the verse in <i>hallel</i> that states: <b>“This is the day that the Lord has made”</b> (Psalms 118:24); just as the day follows a certain order, so too, <i>hallel</i> must be recited in its proper order.
<b>Rav Avya said:</b> It is derived from the verse in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“Blessed be the name of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 113:2), indicating that the blessing of God must “be” just as it is written. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> who said: It is derived from <b>here,</b> the end of the aforementioned verse: <b>“From now and for evermore”</b> (Psalms 113:2), i.e., it should be like time, which cannot be reversed.
From where do we know one has not fulfilled his obligation of <b>reciting the <i>Shema</i></b> if he recited it out of order? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The recital of the <i>Shema</i> must be as it is written,</b> i.e., in Hebrew; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> It may be recited <b>in any language.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>The verse states:</b>

Daf 17b

<b>“And</b> these words…<b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), teaching that these words, the words of the <i>Shema</i>, always <b>“shall be” as they are,</b> i.e., in the Hebrew language. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Sages, what is the reason</b> for their opinion? <b>The verse states: “Hear,</b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4), which could also be translated, “Understand, O Israel,” indicating that you may recite these words <b>in any language that you hear,</b> i.e., understand.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>as well, isn’t it</b> indeed <b>written, “hear”?</b> What does he learn from this word, if not that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited in any language? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> word <b>is necessary</b> to teach something else: <b>Make heard to your ears what your mouth is saying,</b> i.e., the <i>Shema</i> must be recited audibly, not merely thought in one’s heart. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Sages</b> know this? The Gemara explains: They <b>hold like the one who said</b> that if <b>one recites the <i>Shema</i> but does not make it audible to his ears, he has</b> nevertheless <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Sages as well, isn’t it</b> indeed <b>written, “And</b> these words <b>shall be”?</b> What do they learn from this, if not that the <i>Shema</i> must be recited in Hebrew? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> word <b>is necessary</b> to teach <b>that one must not recite</b> the words of the <i>Shema</i> <b>out of order,</b> but they “shall be” as they are, in the proper order. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi learn <b>that one must not recite</b> the <i>Shema</i> <b>out of order?</b> The Gemara answers: He derives it from the fact that the verse does not say just: <b>Words,</b> but <b>“the words,”</b> referring to specific words, which teaches that they must be recited in their proper order without any variation. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Sages</b> learn from the phrase “the words”? The difference between <b>words</b> and <b>“the words” is inconsequential according to them.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the dispute: <b>Shall we say that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintains</b> that <b>the entire Torah may be recited in any language? As, if it enters your mind</b> to say that the entire Torah <b>may be recited only in the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew, and not in any other language, <b>why do I</b> need the Torah <b>to write “and</b> these words <b>shall be”</b> with respect to the <i>Shema</i>? Why would I think that the <i>Shema</i> is different from the rest of the Torah?
The Gemara rejects this argument: There is no proof from here, as even if the Torah must generally be recited in Hebrew <b>it is</b> nevertheless <b>necessary</b> to specify the matter here, since without such specification <b>it might have entered your mind</b> to say that in this context <b>“hear”</b> means understand, <b>as</b> maintained by <b>the Sages,</b> and that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited in any language. Therefore <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah, <b>“and</b> these words <b>shall be,”</b> to teach us that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited only in the original Hebrew.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> then <b>that the Sages maintain</b> that <b>the entire Torah must be recited</b> specifically <b>in the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew? <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> to say that the entire Torah <b>may be recited in any language, why do I</b> need the Torah <b>to write “hear”</b> with respect to the <i>Shema</i>? Why would one think that the <i>Shema</i> is different from the rest of the Torah?
The Gemara rejects this argument: Even if the Torah may generally be recited in any language, <b>it was</b> nevertheless <b>necessary</b> to specify the matter here. Without such specification <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that the words <b>“and</b> these words <b>shall be”</b> teach that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited only in Hebrew, <b>as</b> asserted by <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Therefore <b>the Merciful One writes</b> the word <b>“hear”</b> in the Torah, to teach us that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited in any language.
§ The <i>baraita</i> cited previously taught that the <i>halakha</i> against reciting a text out of order applies to the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> as well. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaPakuli arranged the eighteen blessings</b> of the <i>Amida</i> prayer <b>before Rabban Gamliel in their</b> fixed <b>order in Yavne,</b> which indicates that there is a specific order to these blessings that must not be changed. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say that it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: A hundred and twenty Elders,</b> i.e., the Men of the Great Assembly, and <b>among them several prophets, established</b> the <b>eighteen blessings</b> of the <i>Amida</i> <b>in their</b> fixed <b>order,</b> which also shows that the order of these blessings may not be changed.
The Gemara proceeds to explain this order: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one says</b> the blessing of <b>the Patriarchs,</b> the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i>? <b>As it is stated: “Ascribe to the Lord, mighty ones”</b> (Psalms 29:1), which means that one should mention before the Lord the mighty ones of the world, i.e., the Patriarchs. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one</b> then <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>mighty deeds? As it is stated</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength”</b> (Psalms 29:1). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one</b> then <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>holiness? As it is stated</b> in the next verse: <b>“Give to the Lord the glory due to His name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness”</b> (Psalms 29:2).
The Gemara continues: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute <b>to say</b> the blessing of <b>understanding after</b> the blessing of <b>holiness? As it is stated: “They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall revere the God of Israel”</b> (Isaiah 29:23), and adjacent to that verse it is written: <b>“They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding”</b> (Isaiah 29:24). This shows that it is proper for the theme of understanding to follow the theme of God’s holiness. <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute <b>to say</b> the blessing of <b>repentance after</b> the blessing of <b>understanding? As it is written: “And they will understand with their heart, repent, and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10-11), showing that the theme of repentance properly follows the theme of understanding.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the sequence of blessings is based on this verse, <b>let</b> us <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> blessing of <b>healing should be said after</b> the blessing of <b>repentance.</b> Why, then, is the next blessing in the <i>Amida</i> the blessing of forgiveness and not the blessing of healing? The Gemara explains: <b>This cannot enter your mind, as it is written: “And let him return to the Lord, and He will have compassion upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon”</b> (Isaiah 55:7), which shows that the theme of repentance should be followed by that of forgiveness.
The Gemara poses a question: <b>But what did you see to rely on this</b> verse? <b>Rely on the other</b> verse, which juxtaposes repentance to healing. The Gemara answers: <b>Another verse,</b> in which it is <b>written: “Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, Who redeems your life from the pit”</b> (Psalms 103:3–4), proves that the theme of healing should follow that of forgiveness. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that</b> verse coming <b>to say that</b> the blessings of <b>redemption and healing</b> should be placed following the blessing of <b>forgiveness? But isn’t it written: “Repent, and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10), which suggests that repentance should be followed by healing? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is referring <b>not</b> to <b>the</b> literal <b>healing from illness, but rather</b> to <b>the</b> figurative <b>healing of forgiveness,</b> and therefore this verse too supports the sequence of forgiveness following repentance.
The Gemara continues: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute <b>to say</b> the blessing of <b>redemption as the seventh</b> blessing? <b>Rava said: Since</b> there is a tradition that the Jewish people are <b>destined to be redeemed in the seventh</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle, <b>consequently, they fixed</b> redemption <b>as the seventh</b> blessing. <b>But didn’t the Master say</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the sixth</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle in the days of the arrival of the Messiah, heavenly <b>sounds</b> will be heard; <b>in the seventh</b> year there will be <b>wars; and upon the conclusion of the seventh</b> year, in the eighth year, <b>the son of David,</b> the Messiah, <b>will come?</b> The redemption will take place not during the seventh year but after it. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, the <b>war</b> that takes place during the seventh year <b>is also the beginning of the redemption</b> process, and it is therefore correct to say that Israel will be redeemed in the seventh year.
The Gemara continues: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>healing as the eighth</b> blessing? <b>Rabbi Aḥa said: Since circumcision was assigned to the eighth</b> day of life, and circumcision <b>requires healing, consequently, they established</b> healing <b>as the eighth</b> blessing.
<b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says the blessing of</b> bountiful <b>years as the ninth</b> blessing? <b>Rabbi Alexandri said:</b> This blessing was instituted <b>in reference to those who raise the prices</b> of food. We pray for rain so that the price of produce will not rise as a result of shortages, <b>as it is written: “Break the arm of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 10:15), referring to the wicked, who practice deception and extort the poor. <b>And when David expressed this</b> request, <b>he expressed it in the ninth</b> psalm. Although today it is considered the tenth psalm, the first and second psalms are actually counted as one, and therefore this is the ninth psalm. Therefore, the blessing of the years was fixed as the ninth blessing.
The Gemara asks: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>the ingathering of</b> the <b>exiles after the blessing of the years? As it is written: “And you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to My people Israel; for they will soon be coming”</b> (Ezekiel 36:8), which indicates that the ingathering of the exiles will follow after Eretz Yisrael is blessed with bountiful produce. <b>And once the exiles have been gathered, judgment will be meted out to the wicked, as it is stated: “And I will turn my hand against you and purge away your dross as with lye”</b> (Isaiah 1:25), <b>and</b> immediately after <b>it is written: “And I will restore your judges as at first”</b> (Isaiah 1:26). For this reason the blessing of the restoration of judges comes after the blessing of the ingathering of the exiles.
<b>And once judgment is meted out to the wicked, the transgressors,</b> i.e., the heretics and sectarians, <b>will cease to be.</b> Consequently, the next blessing is that of the heretics, <b>and one includes evildoers with them, as it is stated: “And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together,</b> and they that forsake the Lord <b>shall cease to be”</b> (Isaiah 1:28). The “transgressors and sinners” are the evildoers, and “they that forsake the Lord” are the heretics.
<b>And once the heretics cease to be, the horn,</b> i.e., the glory, <b>of the righteous will be exalted, as it is written: “All the horns of the wicked will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted”</b> (Psalms 75:11). Therefore, after the blessing of the heretics, one says the blessing about the righteous. <b>And he includes the righteous converts along with the righteous, as it is stated: “You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the elder”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), <b>and adjacent to this</b> it is stated: <b>“And if a stranger sojourns with you”</b> (Leviticus 19:33). An “elder” is one with Torah wisdom and a “stranger” is one who has converted to Judaism.
<b>And where will the horns</b> of the righteous <b>be exalted? In Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they who love you shall prosper”</b> (Psalms 122:6). “They who love you” are the righteous. Therefore, the blessing of the rebuilding of Jerusalem is placed after the blessing of the righteous.
<b>And once Jerusalem is rebuilt,</b> the Messiah, scion of the house of <b>David, will come, as it is stated:</b>

Daf 18a

<b>“Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek the Lord their God and David their king”</b> (Hosea 3:5), and consequently, the blessing of the kingdom of David follows the blessing of the building of Jerusalem. <b>And once</b> the scion of <b>David comes,</b> the time for <b>prayer will come, as it is stated: “I will bring them to My sacred mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer”</b> (Isaiah 56:7). Therefore, the blessing of hearing prayer is recited after the blessing of the kingdom of David.
<b>And after prayer comes, the</b> Temple <b>service will arrive, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar”</b> (Isaiah 56:7). The blessing of restoration of the Temple service follows the blessing of hearing prayer. <b>And when the</b> Temple <b>service comes,</b> with it will also <b>come thanksgiving, as it is stated: “Whoever sacrifices a thanks-offering honors Me”</b> (Psalms 50:23), which teaches that thanksgiving follows sacrifice. Therefore, the blessing of thanksgiving follows the blessing of restoration of the Temple service.
<b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says the Priestly Benediction after</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving? As it is written: “And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from sacrificing the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings”</b> (Leviticus 9:22), teaching that the Priestly Benediction follows the sacrificial service, which includes the thanks-offering.
The Gemara asks: But the cited verse indicates that Aaron blessed the people and then sacrificed the offerings. Should we not then <b>say</b> the Priestly Benediction <b>before the</b> blessing of the Temple <b>service?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And he came down from sacrificing the sin-offering.” Is it written</b> that he came down <b>to sacrifice</b> the offerings, implying that after blessing the people Aaron came down and sacrificed the offerings? No, <b>it is written, “from sacrificing,”</b> indicating that the offerings had already been sacrificed.
The Gemara asks: If, as derived from this verse, the Priestly Benediction follows the sacrificial service, the Priestly Benediction should be <b>said</b> immediately <b>after</b> the blessing of restoration of <b>the</b> Temple <b>service,</b> without the interruption of the blessing of thanksgiving. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “Whoever sacrifices a thanks-offering</b> honors Me,” from which we learn that thanksgiving follows sacrifice, as already explained.
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see to rely on this</b> verse and juxtapose thanksgiving with sacrifice? <b>Rely</b> rather <b>on the other</b> verse, which indicates that it is the Priestly Benediction that should be juxtaposed with the sacrificial service. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> to have the blessing of thanksgiving immediately following the blessing of the sacrificial service, since the sacrificial <b>service and thanksgiving,</b> which are closely related conceptually, <b>are one matter.</b>
<b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says</b> the blessing beginning with the words: <b>Grant peace, after the Priestly Benediction? As it is written</b> immediately following the Priestly Benediction: <b>“And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them”</b> (Numbers 6:27). The Priestly Benediction is followed by God’s blessing, and <b>the blessing of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is peace, as it is stated: “The Lord blesses His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11).
The Gemara returns to the <i>baraita</i> cited at the beginning of the discussion: <b>Now, since</b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>a hundred and twenty Elders, including many prophets, established the</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer in its</b> fixed <b>order, what</b> is it that <b>Shimon HaPakuli arranged</b> in a much later period of time, as related by Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara answers: Indeed, the blessings of the <i>Amida</i> prayer were originally arranged by the hundred and twenty members of the Great Assembly, but over the course of time the people <b>forgot them, and</b> Shimon HaPakuli then <b>arranged them again.</b>
The Gemara comments: These nineteen blessings are a fixed number, and <b>beyond this it is prohibited</b> for one <b>to declare the praises of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> by adding additional blessings to the <i>Amida</i>. As <b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can declare all His praise?”</b> (Psalms 106:2)? It means: <b>For whom is it fitting to utter the mighty acts of the Lord?</b> Only <b>for one who can declare all His praise.</b> And since no one is capable of declaring all of God’s praises, we must suffice with the set formula established by the Sages.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>one who excessively declares the praises of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> his fate <b>is</b> to be <b>uprooted from the world,</b> as it appears as if he had exhausted all of God’s praises. <b>As it is stated: “Shall it be told to Him when I speak? If a man says</b> it, <b>he would be swallowed up”</b> (Job 37:20). The Gemara interprets the verse as saying: Can all of God’s praises be expressed when I speak? If a man would say such a thing, he would be “swallowed up” as punishment.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yehuda, a man of Kefar Gibboraya, and some say</b> he was <b>a man of Kefar Gibbor Ĥayil, taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For You silence is praise”</b> (Psalms 65:2)? <b>The</b> best <b>remedy of all is silence,</b> i.e., the optimum form of praising God is silence. The Gemara relates: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Israel to Babylonia, <b>he said: In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say</b> an adage: If <b>a word is</b> worth one <b><i>sela</i>, silence is</b> worth <b>two.</b>
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>If one read</b> the Megilla <b>by heart he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>remembrance</b> and another instance of the term <b>remembrance. It is written here,</b> with regard to the Megilla: <b>“That these days should be remembered”</b> (Esther 9:28), <b>and it is written elsewhere: “And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in the book,</b> and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: That I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens” (Exodus 17:14). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to Amalek, remembrance is referring specifically to something written <b>in a book,</b> as it is stated, “in the book,” <b>so too here,</b> the Megilla remembrance is through being written <b>in a book.</b>
The Gemara raises a question: <b>But from where</b> do we know <b>that this remembrance</b> that is stated with regard to Amalek and to the Megilla involves <b>reading</b> it out loud from a book? <b>Perhaps</b> it requires <b>merely looking into</b> the book, reading it silently. The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Remember</b> what Amalek did to you” (Deuteronomy 25:17). One <b>might</b> have thought that it suffices for one to remember this silently, <b>in his heart.</b> But this cannot be, since <b>when it says</b> subsequently: <b>“You shall not forget”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:19), <b>it is</b> already <b>referring to forgetting from the heart. How,</b> then, <b>do I uphold</b> the meaning of <b>“remember”?</b> What does this command to remember add to the command to not forget? Therefore, it means that the remembrance must be expressed out loud, <b>with the mouth.</b>
§ It was taught further in the mishna: <b>If one read</b> the Megilla <b>in</b> Aramaic <b>translation he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> the Megilla <b>was written in</b> the original <b>biblical text,</b> i.e., in Hebrew, <b>and he read it in</b> Aramaic <b>translation,</b> then <b>this is</b> the same as reading it <b>by heart,</b> as he is not reading the words written in the text, and the mishna has already stated that one does not fulfill his obligation by reading the Megilla by heart. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well, as it is referring to a case in which the Megilla <b>was written</b> not in the original Hebrew but <b>in</b> Aramaic <b>translation, and he read it</b> as written, <b>in</b> Aramaic <b>translation.</b>
§ The mishna continues: <b>However, for those who speak a foreign language, one may read</b> the Megilla <b>in</b> that <b>foreign language.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t you say</b> in the mishna: <b>If he read it in any</b> other <b>language he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? The Gemara cites the answer of <b>Rav and Shmuel, who both say:</b> When the mishna says: A foreign language, it is referring specifically to <b>the Greek foreign language,</b> which has a unique status with regard to biblical translation.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If we say that</b> the Megilla <b>was written in <i>Ashurit</i>,</b> i.e., in Hebrew, <b>and he read it in Greek, this is</b> the same as reading it <b>by heart,</b> and the mishna teaches that one does not fulfill his obligation by reading by heart. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The mishna is dealing with a case in which the Megilla <b>was written in the Greek foreign language</b> and was also read in that language.
Apropos statements in this line of tradition, the Gemara adds: <b>And Rabbi Aḥa</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, called Jacob El,</b> meaning God? <b>As it is stated:</b> “And he erected there an altar, <b>and he called it El, God of Israel”</b> (Genesis 33:20). It is also possible to translate this as: And He, i.e., the God of Israel, called him, Jacob, El. Indeed, it must be understood this way, <b>as if it enters your mind</b> to say that the verse should be understood as saying that <b>Jacob called the altar El, it should have</b> specified the subject of the verb and written: <b>And Jacob called it</b> El. <b>But</b> since the verse is not written this way, the verse must be understood as follows: <b>He called Jacob El; and who called him El? The God of Israel.</b>
The Gemara returns to discussing languages for reading the Megilla and <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav and Shmuel, who said that one may read the Megilla in Greek but not in other foreign languages. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one read</b> the Megilla <b>in Coptic [<i>Giptit</i>], <i>Ivrit</i>, Elamite, Median, or Greek, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, indicating that one cannot fulfill his obligation by reading the Megilla in Greek.
The Gemara answers: The clause in the mishna that teaches that the Megilla may be read in a foreign language to one who speaks that foreign language <b>is comparable only to that</b> which was taught in a different <i>baraita</i>: If one reads the Megilla <b>in Coptic to Copts,</b> in <b><i>Ivrit</i> to <i>Ivrim</i>, in Elamite to Elamites, or in Greek to Greeks, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Megilla may be read in any language, provided the listener understands that language.
The Gemara asks: But <b>if so,</b> that one who reads the Megilla in a foreign language that he speaks fulfills his obligation, <b>why did Rav and Shmuel establish the</b> ruling of the <b>mishna as</b> referring specifically <b>to Greek? Let them interpret it</b> as referring <b>to any foreign language</b> that one speaks. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, the mishna</b> is to be understood <b>like the <i>baraita</i>,</b> that one who reads the Megilla in a language that he speaks fulfills his obligation; <b>and that which was stated</b> in the name of <b>Rav and Shmuel was said</b> as a <b>general</b> statement, not relating to the mishna but as an independent ruling, as follows: <b>Rav and Shmuel both say: The Greek language is acceptable for everyone,</b> i.e., anyone who reads the Megilla in Greek has fulfilled his obligation, even if he does not understand Greek.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>teach</b> that if one reads the Megilla in <b>Greek to Greeks</b> he has fulfilled his obligation? This implies that reading in Greek, <b>yes,</b> this is acceptable for Greeks, but <b>for everyone</b> else, <b>no,</b> it is not. The Gemara answers: Rav and Shmuel disagree with this statement of the <i>baraita</i>, because they <b>agree with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 8b): <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even</b> for <b>books</b> of the Bible, the Sages <b>did not permit them to be written</b> in any foreign language <b>other than Greek,</b> indicating that Greek has a special status, and is treated like the original Hebrew.
The Gemara asks: But if this was the intention of Rav and Shmuel, <b>let them state</b> explicitly: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> Why did Rav and Shmuel formulate their statement as if they were issuing a new ruling? The Gemara answers: <b>Had they said</b> simply <b>that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, I would have said</b> that <b>this applies</b> only <b>to the other books</b> of the Bible, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the Megilla, of which it is written: “According to their writing,” I would say</b> that one does <b>not</b> fulfill his obligation if he reads it in Greek. Therefore they stated their own opinion to <b>teach us</b> that even in the case of the Megilla one fulfills his obligation if he reads it in Greek.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one who speaks a foreign language who heard</b> the Megilla being read <b>in <i>Ashurit</i>,</b> i.e., in Hebrew, <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it so that <b>he does not understand what they are saying?</b> Since he does not understand Hebrew, how does he fulfill his obligation? The Gemara answers: <b>It is just as it is</b> with <b>women and uneducated people;</b> they too understand little Hebrew, but nevertheless they fulfill their obligation when they hear the Megilla read in that language.
<b>Ravina strongly objects to</b> the premise of the question raised above, i.e., that someone who does not understand the original, untranslated language of the Megilla cannot fulfill his obligation. <b>Is that to say</b> that even <b>we,</b> the Sages, who are very well acquainted with Hebrew, <b>know</b> for certain the meaning of the obscure words <b><i>ha’aḥashteranim benei haramakhim</i></b> (Esther 8:10), often translated as: “Used in the royal service, bred from the stud”? <b>But</b> nevertheless, we fulfill the <b>mitzva of reading</b> the Megilla <b>and publicizing the miracle</b> of Purim by reading these words as they appear in the original text. <b>Here too,</b> one who speaks a foreign language who hears the Megilla being read in Hebrew fulfills the <b>mitzva of reading</b> the Megilla <b>and publicizing the</b> Purim <b>miracle,</b> even if he does not understand the words themselves.
§ The mishna continues: <b>If one reads</b> the Megilla <b>at intervals</b> [<b><i>seirugin</i></b>] <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara relates that <b>the Sages did not know what is</b> meant by the word <b><i>seirugin</i>.</b> One day <b>they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saying to the Sages who were entering the house intermittently</b> rather than in a single group: <b>How long are you going to enter <i>seirugin seirugin</i>?</b> As she lived in Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s house and certainly heard the most proper Hebrew being spoken, they understood from this that the word <i>seirugin</i> means at intervals.
It is similarly related that <b>the Sages did not know what is</b> meant by the word <b><i>ḥalogelogot</i>,</b> which appears in various <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i>. One day <b>they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saying to a certain man who was scattering purslane: How long will you go on scattering your <i>ḥalogelogot</i>?</b> And from this they understood that <i>ḥalogelogot</i> is purslane.
Likewise, <b>the Sages did not know what is</b> meant by <i>salseleha</i> in the verse: “Get <b><i>wisdom…salseleha</i> and it will exalt you”</b> (Proverbs 4:7–8). One day <b>they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house talking to a certain man who was twirling his hair, saying to him: How long will you go on twirling</b> [<b><i>mesalsel</i></b>] <b>your hair?</b> And from this they understood that the verse is saying: Turn wisdom around and around, and it will exalt you.
The Gemara relates additional examples: <b>The Sages did not know what is</b> meant by the word <i>yehav</i> in the verse: <b>“Cast upon the Lord your <i>yehav</i>”</b> (Psalms 55:23). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: One time I was traveling with a certain Arab</b> [<b><i>Tayya’a</i></b>] <b>and I was carrying a load, and he said to me: Take your <i>yehav</i> and throw it on my camel,</b> and I understood that <i>yehav</i> means a load or burden.
And similarly, <b>the Sages did not know what is</b> meant by the word <i>matatei</i> in the verse: <b>“And I will <i>tatei</i> it with the <i>matatei</i> of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23). One day <b>they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saying to her friend: Take a <i>tateita</i> and <i>tati</i> the house,</b> from which they understood that a <i>matatei</i> is a broom, and the verb <i>tati</i> means to sweep.
On the matter of reading the Megilla with interruptions, <b>the Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one reads the Megilla at intervals,</b> pausing and resuming at intervals, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.

Daf 18b

But if he reads it <b>out of order,</b> i.e., if he changes the order of the words or verses of the Megilla, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Mona said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: Even</b> when he reads it <b>at intervals, if he pauses</b> and interrupts his reading long <b>enough</b> for one <b>to finish</b> reading <b>the whole</b> Megilla during that time, <b>he must go back to the beginning</b> and start again. <b>Rav Yosef said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Mona,</b> who <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef:</b> When Rabbi Mona said: Long <b>enough</b> for one <b>to finish</b> reading <b>the whole</b> Megilla, did he mean <b>from</b> the verse <b>where he is</b> now <b>until the end? Or perhaps</b> he meant long enough to read the entire Megilla <b>from the beginning until the end. He said to him:</b> Rabbi Mona meant <b>from the beginning until the end,</b> as <b>if</b> it were <b>so</b> that he meant from where he paused until the end of the Megilla, <b>you would be subjecting your statement to the</b> varying <b>circumstances</b> of each case. There would be no standard principle to determine the length of a permitted pause; in each case, depending on where one stopped, it would take a different amount of time to finish the Megilla until the end. And the Sages did not institute measures that are not standardized.
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said: Rav said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Mona, but Shmuel said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Mona.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>This is how they taught</b> the opinions of the Sages <b>in Sura.</b> However, <b>in Pumbedita they taught</b> it slightly differently, <b>like this: Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Mona, but Shmuel said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Mona. Rav Beivai taught the opposite: Rav said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Mona, but Shmuel said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Mona.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said: Grasp</b> the version of <b>Rav Beivai in your hand,</b> i.e., accept it as the most authoritative one. It appears to be correct, as we know that <b>Shmuel takes into consideration</b> even an <b>individual</b> dissenting opinion when it is more stringent than the majority opinion. The Gemara proves its assertion about Shmuel: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 41a) with regard to a different matter, the case of a widow whose husband died childless and who was waiting for one of his surviving brothers to perform the required levirate marriage with her or, alternatively, to release her with the <i>ḥalitza</i> ceremony: In a case where <b>a woman</b> was <b>waiting for her brother-in-law and</b> in the meantime one of her deceased husband’s <b>brothers betrothed</b> this woman’s <b>sister, they said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira: We say to</b> this brother: <b>Wait</b> before marrying your betrothed <b>until your older brother acts,</b> performing the levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>. The reason for this is that before levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i> is performed, all the brothers are considered, by rabbinic decree, to have a quasi-marital connection with the widow. Consequently, just as one may not marry his wife’s sister, he may not marry the sister of a woman who is waiting for him to perform levirate marriage. The Sages, however, disagree with Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and maintain that only the oldest of the brothers is considered bound to the widow, as he is the primary candidate to perform these acts. Consequently, the widow has no connection at all with the other brothers. 
And <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b> This demonstrates that Shmuel takes into consideration the opinion of a single Sage against the majority when that minority opinion is more stringent than the majority opinion.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the scribe</b> who wrote the Megilla <b>omitted letters or</b> even complete <b>verses</b> when he wrote it, <b>and the reader read</b> these missing items <b>as a translator</b> would do <b>when translating,</b> i.e., he recited the missing parts by heart, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. Missing material in a Megilla and reading words or verses by heart do not invalidate the reading.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a Megilla <b>contains letters that are blurred or torn,</b> the following distinction applies: <b>If their imprint is</b> still <b>visible,</b> the Megilla <b>is fit</b> for reading, <b>but if not, it is unfit.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that even the omission of several letters invalidates the Megilla. The Gemara resolves the contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i>: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> second <i>baraita</i>, which says that a Megilla with blurred or torn letters is unfit, is referring to a case where this is so throughout <b>the whole of</b> the Megilla; whereas <b>this</b> first <i>baraita</i>, which says that a Megilla is fit even if whole verses are missing, is referring to a case where the missing material is <b>in</b> only <b>part of it.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the reader</b> of the Megilla <b>omitted one verse, he may not say: I will</b> continue to <b>read the whole of</b> the Megilla in order, <b>and afterward I will</b> go back and <b>read that verse</b> that I omitted. <b>Rather, he must</b> go back and <b>read from that verse</b> that he omitted and continue from there to the end of the Megilla. Similarly, <b>if one enters a synagogue and encounters a congregation that has</b> already <b>read half</b> of the Megilla, <b>he may not say: I will read</b> the second <b>half of</b> the Megilla with <b>the congregation,</b> and <b>afterward I will</b> go back and <b>read</b> the first <b>half. Rather, he must</b> go back and <b>read it</b> in its proper order <b>from the beginning until the end.</b>
§ It is taught in the mishna: If one read the Megilla <b>while he is dozing off, he has fulfilled his</b> obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of</b> the case of <b>dozing off? Rav Ashi said:</b> It is referring to a situation in which one is <b>asleep yet not</b> fully <b>asleep, awake yet not</b> fully <b>awake. If someone calls him he answers. And he is</b> in a mental state in which <b>he does not know</b> how <b>to provide</b> an answer that requires logical <b>reasoning, but when people remind him</b> about something that has happened, <b>he remembers</b> it.
§ The mishna continues: <b>If one was writing</b> a Megilla, <b>or expounding upon it, or correcting</b> it, and he read all its words as he was doing so, <b>if he had intent</b> to fulfill his obligation with that reading <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If he was articulating each verse</b> of the Megilla and then <b>writing it down, what of it</b> that <b>he intended</b> to fulfill his obligation with that reading, since he recited those words <b>by heart? Rather,</b> it must be that <b>he</b> first <b>wrote each verse</b> in the Megilla <b>and</b> then <b>read it out.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But does one</b> really <b>fulfill</b> his obligation in this way? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥelbo say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of the one who says</b> that the Megilla must be read <b>in its entirety</b> in order to fulfill one’s obligation. <b>And</b> moreover, he said that <b>even according to the one who said</b> that one need not read the entire Megilla, but only from <b>“There was a certain Jew”</b> (Esther 2:5) and onward, the Megilla itself <b>must</b> nevertheless <b>be written in its entirety.</b> How, then, can it be suggested that one who is reading each verse as he writes it can fulfill his obligation by reading from a Megilla that is not yet written to the end?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> this is a case in <b>which a</b> complete <b>Megilla is lying before him</b> and he is copying from it, <b>and he was reading from</b> that complete Megilla <b>verse by verse and</b> then <b>writing</b> each verse <b>in</b> his new copy. The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say that</b> this <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is prohibited to write</b> even <b>a single letter</b> of the Bible when <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written text.</b> Since it was necessary to explain the mishna as addressing a case in which one was copying a Megilla out of a written text lying before him, this supports Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling. The Gemara rejects this: This is not a proof, <b>as perhaps</b> the mishna is merely dealing with a case <b>where this is what happened to be</b> what occurred, that one happened to be copying the text from an existing Megilla, but it is not a requirement to do this.
The Gemara examines Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s statement. With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is prohibited to write</b> even <b>a single letter</b> of the Bible when <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written text.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said:</b> One Adar there was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Meir, who went to intercalate the year in Asia</b> Minor, as, owing to persecutory decrees, he could not do this in Eretz Yisrael. <b>And there was no</b> Megilla <b>there</b> when Purim arrived, <b>so he wrote</b> a Megilla <b>by heart and read</b> from <b>it.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Rabbi Meir is different, as in him is fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“And let your eyelids look straight before you”</b> (Proverbs 4:25), and with regard to this verse, <b>Rami bar Ḥama said to Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti: What is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“and let your eyelids</b> [<b><i>afapekha</i>],”</b> from the root <i>a-p-p</i>, <b>“look straight</b> [<b><i>yaishiru</i></b>] <b>before you”? He said to him: This is referring to the words of the Torah,</b> which are difficult to remember exactly, <b>and with regard to which it is written: “Will you glance upon it fleetingly</b> [<b><i>hata’if</i> ],</b> from the root <i>a-p-p</i>, <b>with your eyes? It is already gone”</b> (Proverbs 23:5), <b>but nevertheless they remain exact</b> [<b><i>meyusharin</i></b>] in the memory of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> since he knows them all by heart.
It was related that <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> once <b>found Rav Ḥananel writing</b> Torah <b>scrolls,</b> but he was <b>not</b> copying them <b>from a written text,</b> as he knew it all by heart. <b>He said to him: It is fitting</b> for <b>the entire Torah to be written by your mouth,</b> i.e., relying on your memory, <b>but this is what the Sages said: It is prohibited to write</b> even <b>a single letter</b> of the Bible when <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written text.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said</b> to him: <b>The entire Torah is fitting to be written by your mouth,</b> it may be concluded <b>by inference that</b> the words of the Torah <b>were exact in his memory,</b> i.e., that Rav Ḥananel enjoyed total mastery of the text. <b>But didn’t</b> we say that <b>Rabbi Meir wrote</b> a Megilla without copying from a text due to similar proficiency? The Gemara answers: <b>A time of exigent circumstances is different;</b> since there was no other option available, he was permitted to rely on his expertise, but otherwise this must not be done.
It was further related that <b>Abaye permitted</b> the scribes of <b>the house of ben Ḥavu to write phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i></b> when they were <b>not</b> copying <b>from a</b> pre-existing <b>text.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did he issue this allowance? The Gemara explains: <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the following <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of our master,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> may be written</b> when they are <b>not</b> copied <b>from a written text, and they do not require scoring,</b> i.e., the parchment is not required to have lines etched in it.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> as follows: <b>Phylacteries do not require scoring,</b> whereas <b><i>mezuzot</i> require scoring.</b> And unlike biblical books, <b>both these and those,</b> phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, may be <b>written</b> when the scribe is <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written text. What is the reason</b> for this exception? <b>These</b> short texts <b>are well known</b> to all scribes, and therefore it is permitted to write them by heart.
§ The mishna teaches: If one reads from a Megilla that <b>was written with <i>sam</i></b> or with <i>sikra</i> or with <i>komos</i> or with <i>kankantom</i>, he has not fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara identifies these writing materials: <b><i>Sam</i></b> is what is called in Aramaic <b><i>samma</i>.</b> With regard to <b><i>sikra</i>, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Its name</b> in Aramaic is <b><i>sikreta</i>,</b> a type of red paint. <b><i>Komos</i></b> is what is called <b><i>koma</i>,</b> a tree resin.

Daf 19a

<b><i>Kankantom</i></b> is what is called in Aramaic <b><i>ḥarta de’ushkafei</i>,</b> a black dye used by shoemakers. <b><i>Diftera</i></b> is hide <b>that was processed with salt and flour, but not with gallnuts. <i>Neyar</i></b> is known in Aramaic as <b><i>maḥaka</i>,</b> paper made from reeds.
§ It was taught in the mishna: He does not fulfill his obligation <b>unless</b> the Megilla <b>is written in <i>Ashurit</i>.</b> The Gemara explains the reason for this: <b>As it is written</b> concerning the Megilla: <b>“According to their writing and according to their time”</b> (Esther 9:27), i.e., the way it was originally written.
The mishna concludes: He does not fulfill his obligation unless the Megilla is written <b>“upon parchment and with ink.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: It is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of <b>writing</b> and another instance of <b>writing. It is written here</b> in the book of Esther: <b>“Then Esther the queen,</b> the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, <b>wrote</b> all the acts of power, to confirm this second letter of Purim” (Esther 9:29), <b>and it is written there: “Then Baruch answered them: He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink on the parchment”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18). Just as there the writing was with ink on parchment, so too here, a Megilla must be written with ink on parchment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a resident of an</b> unwalled <b>town who went to a walled city,</b> where the Megilla is read on the fifteenth of Adar, and conversely, <b>a resident of a walled city who went to an</b> unwalled <b>town</b> where it is read on the fourteenth, the following distinction applies: <b>If he is destined to return to his</b> original <b>place, he reads</b> it <b>according to</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>his</b> own <b>place, and if not,</b> i.e., if he is not destined to return to his place, <b>he reads with them,</b> the residents of his current location.
Beginning <b>from where must a person read the Megilla in order to fulfill his obligation? Rabbi Meir says:</b> He must read <b>all of it. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He need read only <b>from</b> “There was <b>a certain Jew”</b> (Esther 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yosei says: From “After these things”</b> (Esther 3:1).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava said: They taught</b> the mishna that one who is destined to return to his own place reads according to the <i>halakha</i> governing his own place <b>only</b> with regard to <b>one who is destined to return</b> to his own place <b>on the night of the fourteenth</b> of Adar. <b>But if he is not destined to return on the night of the fourteenth, although</b> he does intend to return to his own place eventually, <b>he reads with</b> the residents of his current location. <b>Rava said: From where do I say this? As it is written: “Therefore the Jews of unwalled towns, who dwell in the unwalled towns,</b> make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting” (Esther 9:19). <b>Since it is</b> already <b>written: “The Jews of unwalled towns,” why do I</b> need it <b>to write</b> further, <b>“who dwell in the unwalled towns”?</b> It comes to <b>teach us this: That one who is in an unwalled town</b> even <b>for the day is</b> also <b>called one who</b> lives <b>in an unwalled town.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> proof for a resident of a walled city who is temporarily located in <b>an unwalled town.</b> But <b>from where do we</b> derive the opposite case, that one from an unwalled town who is temporarily in <b>a walled city</b> is governed by a similar <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning: Since one who is in an unwalled town for the day is called someone from an unwalled town,</b> so too conversely, <b>one who is in a walled city for a day is called someone from a walled city.</b>
<b>And Rava said</b> further: <b>Someone from a village, where</b> the Megilla is read on the Monday or Thursday prior to Purim (2a), <b>who went to a town, reads</b> the Megilla <b>with</b> the residents of the town, even if he had already read it in his own place. He does so <b>in all circumstances,</b> whether or not he will be returning to his own village. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>This</b> villager <b>should</b> actually have <b>read</b> at the same time <b>as the residents of the towns, but the Sages showed leniency toward the</b> people of the <b>villages</b> and allowed them to advance their reading of the Megilla to the previous day of assembly <b>so that they</b> would be free to <b>supply water and food to their brethren in the cities</b> on the day of Purim. <b>This,</b> however, <b>applies</b> only <b>when</b> the villager <b>is in his place,</b> in the village, <b>but when he is in a town, he is required to read like the residents of the town,</b> and not like the villagers.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A resident of a walled city who went to</b> an unwalled <b>town, in all circumstances,</b> whether or not he will be returning to his own city, <b>reads</b> the Megilla <b>according to</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>his</b> permanent <b>place.</b> The Gemara first questions the text of the <i>baraita</i> as it is currently worded: <b>Can it enter your mind that the resident of a walled city</b> always reads in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> governing his own place, even if he is currently situated in an unwalled town? But doesn’t <b>the matter depend on whether</b> or not <b>he will be returning</b> on Purim to his hometown, as stated in the mishna? Therefore, it is clear that the <i>baraita</i> must be emended. <b>Rather, is it not</b> to be changed to: <b>A resident of a village</b> who went to an unwalled town? The <i>baraita</i> therefore teaches that a resident of a village who is visiting in a town must read the Megilla according to the <i>halakha</i> governing his own place, the village, unlike Rava’s teaching.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>But did you not emend</b> the reading in the <i>baraita</i>? Since you admit that the <i>baraita</i> in any event requires revision, change it further and <b>teach: He reads</b> the Megilla <b>with</b> the residents of the town. This wording in the <i>baraita</i> would then support the opinion of Rava.
§ The mishna teaches that three Sages disagree about the question: Beginning <b>from where must a person read the Megilla</b> in order to fulfill his obligation? <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there is a fourth opinion as well: <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai says:</b> One must start to read from <b>“On that night”</b> (Esther 6:1).
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And all of</b> these <i>tanna’im</i>, in arriving at their respective opinions, <b>were expounding the same verse.</b> As it is stated: <b>“Then Esther the queen,</b> the daughter of Abihail, <b>and Mordecai the Jew, wrote about all the acts of power</b> to confirm this second letter of Purim” (Esther 9:29). <b>The one who said</b> that the Megilla must be read <b>in its entirety</b> interprets “acts of power” as referring to <b>the power of Ahasuerus,</b> and so the Megilla must be read from the beginning, where the power of Ahasuerus is recounted.
<b>And the one who said</b> that it needs to be read <b>from “There was a certain Jew”</b> explains that “acts of power” is referring to <b>the power of Mordecai. And the one who said</b> that it needs to be read <b>from “After these things”</b> maintains that “acts of power” is referring to <b>the power of Haman. And the one who said</b> that it needs to be read <b>from “On that night”</b> understands that the expression is referring to <b>the power of the miracle,</b> which began on that night when Ahasuerus could not sleep, and therefore one must begin reading the Megilla from there.
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> The four Sages derived their respective opinions <b>from here:</b> “Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, <b>and of that which they saw concerning this matter, and that which had befallen them,</b> the Jews ordained...that they would keep these two days” (Esther 9:26–27).
Rav Huna continued: <b>The one who said</b> that the Megilla must be read <b>in its entirety</b> explains the verse as follows: “They saw” refers to what <b>Ahasuerus saw, in that he used the vessels of the Temple. “Concerning this matter”</b> was <b>because he had calculated seventy years</b> from the Babylonian exile <b>and</b> the Jews <b>were</b> still <b>not redeemed,</b> and he consequently thought that they would never enjoy deliverance. <b>“And that which had befallen them”</b> is referring to the fact <b>that he had killed Vashti.</b> Since the Megilla was written and continues to be read in order to inform future generations of all these events and what had happened to the people who were involved, and these are detailed at the beginning of the Megilla, it must be read in its entirety.
<b>And the one who said</b> that the Megilla needs to be read <b>from “There was a certain Jew”</b> interprets this verse as follows: <b>That which Mordecai “saw” in that he acted</b> so <b>zealously concerning Haman. “Concerning this matter”</b> was <b>because Haman had made himself</b> an object of <b>idol worship. “And that which had befallen them”</b> is referring to the fact <b>that a miracle took place.</b> Therefore one must read the Megilla from “There was a certain man,” where all this is recounted.
<b>And the one who said</b> that it needs to be read <b>from “After these things”</b> interprets the verse in this way: <b>That which Haman “saw” in that he became incensed with all the Jews. “Concerning this matter”</b> was <b>because “Mordecai did not bow down, nor prostrate himself before him”</b> (Esther 3:2). <b>“And that which had befallen them”</b> is referring to the fact that <b>“he and his sons were hanged on the gallows”</b> (Esther 9:25). Accordingly, the Megilla must be read from the first mention of Haman.
<b>And the one who said</b> that the Megilla must be read <b>from “On that night”</b> offers the following explanation: <b>That which Ahasuerus “saw”</b> in that he commanded <b>to bring the book of chronicles</b> before him. <b>“Concerning this matter”</b> was <b>because Esther had invited Haman</b> along <b>with him</b> to the banquet she made. <b>“And that which had befallen them”</b> is referring to the fact <b>that a miracle took place.</b> And therefore one must read the Megilla from “On that night the king could not sleep and he commanded to bring the book of chronicles.”
<b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of the one who says</b> that the Megilla must be read <b>in its entirety. And</b> moreover, <b>even according to the one who said</b> that it need be read only from <b>“There was a certain Jew”</b> and onward, the Megilla itself <b>must</b> nevertheless <b>be written in its entirety.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> further that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b>Megilla is referred to as a “book”</b> (Esther 9:32), <b>and it is</b> also <b>referred to as a “letter”</b> (Esther 9:29). <b>It is called a book,</b> indicating a comparison to the book of the Torah, i.e., to a Torah scroll, to teach us <b>that if one sewed</b> its parchment sheets together <b>with flax threads</b> the Megilla <b>is unfit,</b> just as a Torah scroll sewn in this manner is unfit. <b>And it is called a letter</b> to teach us <b>that if one stitched</b> the Megilla sheets together <b>with</b> only <b>three threads of sinew,</b> in the manner of a letter, the Megilla <b>is fit</b> for use, as it does not have to be completely stitched like a Torah scroll. <b>Rav Naḥman said: This is</b> true <b>provided that</b> the stitches are <b>made in three parts.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: If one reads from a Megilla that was written together with</b> the rest of <b>the Writings he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as it must be evident that one is reading specifically from the Megilla rather than simply reading ordinary passages from the Bible. <b>Rava said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case where the parchment of the Megilla <b>is not a little shorter or longer</b> than the parchment of the other biblical books on the scroll and are consequently not plainly discernible among them. <b>But if it is a little shorter or longer</b> than the other sheets of parchment of the other biblical books, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and one may read from such a scroll.
It was related that <b>Levi bar Shmuel was</b> once <b>reading before Rav Yehuda from a Megilla</b>

Daf 19b

<b>that was written together with</b> the rest of <b>the Writings.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The Sages <b>have said: If one reads from a Megilla that was written together with</b> the rest of <b>the Writings he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: If one reads from a Megilla that was written together with</b> the rest of <b>the Writings he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But they hit</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>on its head,</b> i.e., immediately after reporting this ruling they added a qualification that removed much of its force: <b>They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with respect <b>to</b> reading the Megilla for <b>a congregation.</b> An individual who reads the Megilla in private fulfills his obligation even if the Megilla was written together with the rest of the Writings. Only when it is read in public must it be from a Megilla that is a separate scroll.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>leaving</b> a space without <b>stitches,</b> i.e., that the parchment sheets of a Torah scroll must not be sewn all the way to the edge, but rather a small margin must be left at the top and at the bottom, <b>is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai,</b> i.e., it was not written in the Torah but was received in the framework of the Oral Law. <b>But they</b> immediately <b>hit</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>on its head,</b> explaining that this <i>halakha</i> is not due to the special sanctity of a Torah scroll; rather, <b>they said</b> that it is <b>only so that it not rip.</b> If the scroll is wound too forcefully, the sheets of parchment will begin to spread apart since they are not sewn together at their extremities, and the one who is winding will cease to wind it so forcefully. If the stitching went all the way to the end there would be no such warning and the stitches would cause the parchment to rip.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Had there been left</b> open <b>a crack</b> so much as <b>the size of small sewing needle in the cave in which Moses and Elijah stood</b> when God’s glory was revealed to them, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock” (Exodus 33:22), and: “And he came there to a cave…and, behold, the Lord passed by” (I Kings 19:9–11), <b>they would not have been able to endure due to the</b> intense <b>light</b> that would have entered that crack, <b>as it is stated: “For no man shall see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20).
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God; <b>and on them was written according to all the words which the Lord spoke with you in the mountain”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:10)? <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed Moses</b> on the mountain all <b>the inferences</b> that can be derived from the words of <b>the Torah; and</b> all <b>the inferences</b> that can be derived from the words <b>of the Scribes,</b> the early Sages; <b>and</b> also <b>all</b> the new <i>halakhot</i> <b>that the Scribes were destined to introduce</b> in the future in addition to the laws of the Torah. <b>And what is it</b> specifically that the Scribes would introduce in addition to the laws of the Torah? <b>The reading of the Megilla.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Everyone is fit to read the Megilla, except for a deaf person, an imbecile, and a minor. Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says that a minor is fit</b> to read the Megilla.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> that <b>taught</b> that the reading of <b>a deaf person, even after the fact, no,</b> it is not valid? <b>Rav Mattana said: It is Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in a mishna elsewhere (<i>Berakhot</i> 15a): <b>If one recites the <i>Shema</i> but does not make it audible to his ears, he has</b> nevertheless <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: He has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. Rabbi Yosei’s statement implies that one who does not hear what he is saying does not fulfill his obligation. Presumably the <i>halakhot</i> for <i>Shema</i> recitation and Megilla reading are equivalent.
The Gemara questions the assumption on which the previous discussion is based: <b>But from where</b> do you know that the mishna, which states that a deaf person may not read the Megilla, reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and that it means to say that <b>even after the fact, no,</b> one does not fulfill his obligation if the Megilla is read by a deaf person? <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> it should be understood as saying that a deaf person <b>may not</b> read <b><i>ab initio</i>, but after the fact</b> his reading <b>is valid.</b>
The Gemara rejects this proposal: <b>This should not enter your mind, as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a deaf person, an imbecile, and a minor together, implying that <b>a deaf person is similar to an imbecile or a minor.</b> Therefore, it may be inferred that <b>just as</b> the readings of <b>an imbecile and a minor</b> are <b>not</b> valid <b>even after the fact, so too, even after the fact, no,</b> the reading of <b>a deaf person</b> is not valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> it is not so that all three cases are equivalent. Perhaps with regard to the imbecile and the minor, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>as it is, and</b> with regard to a deaf person, <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>as it is.</b> Although all three cases are taught together, this may be merely because in all three cases he may not read <i>ab initio</i>; there may be a difference between them with regard to their status after the fact. It is possible that the mishna means that the reading of a deaf person is valid after the fact, and is citing the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. The Gemara rejects this: It is impossible to say that the anonymous first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna is Rabbi Yehuda, as <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: Rabbi Yehuda says that a minor is fit, it may be inferred that the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>was not</b> taught by <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>But perhaps</b> the mishna <b>in its entirety was</b> taught by <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> after all, but the first clause of the mishna was taught anonymously, whereas the latter clause was taught explicitly in the name of Rabbi Yehuda. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Are</b> the two parts of the mishna <b>comparable,</b> that they can be associated with a single Sage? <b>The first clause</b> of the mishna comes <b>to disqualify</b> the reading of a minor, <b>whereas the latter clause</b> comes <b>to declare</b> a minor <b>fit.</b> These two contradictory opinions therefore cannot be understood as the statement of a single Sage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the mishna <b>in its entirety</b> expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> after all. <b>And it is teaching</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>two</b> different <b>types of minors, and</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete,</b> lacking some words of elaboration, <b>and is teaching the following: Everyone is fit to read the Megilla except for a deaf person, an imbecile, and a minor. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Only <b>with regard to a minor who has not reached</b> the age of <b>training</b> in mitzvot. <b>But a minor who has reached</b> the age of <b>training</b> in mitzvot may read the Megilla <b>even <i>ab initio</i>, as Rabbi Yehuda says that a minor</b> who has reached that requisite age <b>is fit</b> to read the Megilla.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this interpretation of the mishna: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you establish</b> the mishna? You established it as being <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and you understand the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda to be that a deaf person is disqualified from reading the Megilla <i>ab initio</i>, but <b>after the fact</b> his reading is valid.
<b>But</b> then <b>that which Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, taught</b> will present a difficulty, as he taught a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A deaf person who can speak but cannot hear may set aside <i>teruma</i></b> even <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> although he cannot hear himself reciting the blessing that is recited before setting aside <i>teruma</i>. Upon <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i> based? <b>If</b> you say it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that cannot be, as you have established that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that if one recites something and does not hear it, <b>after the fact, yes,</b> his action is valid, but he should <b>not</b> do so <b><i>ab initio</i>. And if</b> you say it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> this is even more difficult, as he maintains that <b>even after the fact, no,</b> his action is not valid. Who, then, is the Sage who would say that a deaf person may set aside <i>teruma</i> even <i>ab initio</i>?
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>Rather, what</b> then do you propose to say, that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> that Rabbi Yehuda permits a deaf person to read <b>even <i>ab initio</i>,</b> whereas Rabbi Yosei would disqualify him even after the fact? <b>But</b> then <b>whose is</b> the opinion that is represented in <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person should not recite the Grace after Meals in his heart,</b> i.e., inaudibly, <b>but if he recited</b> it in this manner, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. It is the opinion of <b>neither Rabbi Yehuda nor Rabbi Yosei.</b> As, <b>if</b> it follows the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it should be permitted <b>even <i>ab initio</i>,</b> and <b>if</b> it follows the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> then <b>even after the fact, no,</b> this should not be valid.

Daf 20a

The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> you can indeed say that the <i>baraita</i> about <i>teruma</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and that Rabbi Yehuda permits a deaf person to read <b>even <i>ab initio</i>,</b> while Rabbi Yosei disqualifies a deaf person even after the fact. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> that teaches that one should not recite the Grace after Meals in his heart, but if he did he has fulfilled his obligation, is <b>not difficult,</b> as that <i>baraita</i> was taught by Rabbi Yehuda as well. The explanation for this is that in <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, about <i>teruma</i>, he was teaching <b>his own</b> opinion, that it is permitted even <i>ab initio</i>, whereas in <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, concerning the Grace after Meals, he was teaching the opinion <b>of his master,</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, that one is required to hear what he is saying when he recites blessings.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: One who recites the <i>Shema</i> must make it audible to his ears, as it is stated: “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God; the Lord is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4), the word “hear” indicating that you should <b>allow your ears to hear</b> the words <b>you are expressing with your mouth. Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> This is not necessary, as it is also stated there: “And these words, <b>which I command you this day shall be in your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), indicating that “these <b>words,”</b> the words of the Shema, go <b>after the intent of the heart,</b> as it is unnecessary to pronounce them out loud. We see that according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as cited by Rabbi Yehuda, the words must be audible to one’s ears <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara proposes a second solution: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> point and cited this <i>baraita</i>, <b>you</b> can <b>even say that Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with his teacher,</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, that a deaf person is disqualified <i>ab initio</i>, and it is only after the fact that his reading is valid. <b>And as for that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, taught</b> stating that a deaf person may set aside <i>teruma</i> even <i>ab initio</i>, this was taught in accordance with the other opinion cited in the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that everything depends on the intent of one’s heart, and that it is not necessary to pronounce words audibly, even <i>ab initio</i>.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says that a minor is fit</b> to read the Megilla. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> I can offer proof to my opinion, as when <b>I was a minor I</b> myself <b>read</b> the Megilla <b>before Rabbi Tarfon and the</b> other <b>Elders in Lod. They said to him</b> in response: <b>One cannot bring a proof from</b> the testimony of <b>a minor.</b> Since at the time of the supposed incident you were a minor, you are not qualified now to testify about it.
<b>It is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> When <b>I was a minor I read</b> the Megilla <b>before Rabbi Yehuda. They said to him: One cannot bring a proof</b> that an act is permitted <b>from the</b> behavior of the very <b>one who permits</b> it. We know that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that a minor is fit to read the Megilla, and the fact that he acted in accordance with his own opinion does not prove that this is the accepted <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let them say to him,</b> as the Sages said to Rabbi Yehuda in the previous <i>baraita</i>, that <b>one cannot bring a proof from</b> the testimony of a <b>minor.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They said one</b> thing to him <b>and</b> then <b>another;</b> i.e., they rejected him with a twofold argument: <b>One</b> objection is that <b>you were a minor</b> at that time, and therefore your testimony is disqualified. <b>And furthermore, even</b> if <b>you had been an adult</b> at that time and you had testified that you saw some other minor read the Megilla before Rabbi Yehuda, <b>one cannot bring a proof</b> that an act is permitted <b>from the</b> behavior of the very <b>one who permits</b> it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not read the Megilla, nor perform a circumcision, nor immerse</b> himself in a ritual bath, <b>nor sprinkle</b> water of purification to purify people and objects that had contracted ritual impurity through contact with a corpse until after sunrise. <b>And also a woman who observes a</b> clean <b>day for</b> each <b>day</b> she experiences a discharge, i.e., a woman who experienced one or two days of non-menstrual bleeding, and must now wait until a day has passed without any discharge of blood before regaining ritual purity, she too <b>may not immerse herself until the sun has risen. And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> activities that are supposed to be performed during the day, <b>if one did them after daybreak,</b> i.e., after the appearance of the first light of the sun, even before sunrise, <b>they are valid,</b> as at this point it is already considered daytime.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> taught in the mishna that the Megilla may be read only during the day? The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states: “And that these days should be remembered and kept”</b> (Esther 9:28). The word “days” indicates <b>during the day, yes,</b> but <b>at night, no.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>repeat it during the day.</b> The Gemara rejects this: There is no proof from here, <b>as when</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the Megilla may be read only during the day, it was referring to <b>the daytime</b> reading, but the nighttime reading is not considered here at all.
§ The mishna continues: <b>And one may not perform a circumcision</b> until after sunrise, <b>as it is written: “And on the eighth day he shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3). This indicates that the circumcision must be during the day, not at night.
§ It is further taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not immerse</b> himself in a ritual bath, <b>or sprinkle</b> waters of purification until after sunrise. This too is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And the pure person shall sprinkle upon the impure</b> on the third day <b>and on the seventh day;</b> and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be pure at evening” (Numbers 19:19), which teaches that the sprinkling must take place during the day and not at night. <b>And immersion is likened to sprinkling,</b> as it too is mentioned in the verse, “and bathe himself in water,” so that whatever is invalid with respect to sprinkling is also invalid with respect to immersion.
§ The mishna states: <b>And also a woman who observes a day for a day may not immerse herself until the sun has risen.</b> The Gemara asks: This <b>is obvious. What is different about a woman who observes a day for a day,</b> who must immerse herself in a ritual bath, <b>from all the others who are obligated to immerse themselves,</b> as it was already taught that one may not immerse himself in a ritual bath until it is day?
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> nevertheless <b>necessary</b> to mention separately the case of a woman who observes a day for a day. As, <b>it might enter your mind to say that</b> this woman’s bleeding <b>should be treated like the first emission of a <i>zav</i>,</b> a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like secretion, in that just as a man attains the status of a full-fledged <i>zav</i> once he has three such emissions, so too, a woman attains the status of a full-fledged <i>zava</i> once she experiences three days of bleeding. <b>And the first emission of a <i>zav</i> is likened to one who experienced a seminal discharge, as it is written: “This is the <i>halakha</i> of him that has an issue and of him whose semen goes from him”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). From this it is learned: <b>Just as one who experienced a seminal discharge immerses on the</b> same <b>day</b> that he had the discharge, <b>so too, that one,</b> the <i>zav</i>, <b>may immerse himself on the</b> same <b>day</b> that he had the emission.
<b>And</b> although <b>this one,</b> i.e., a woman who observes a day for a day, <b>cannot immerse on the</b> same <b>day</b> that she experienced the bleeding, <b>as it is written: “All the days of her issue shall be to her as the bed of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:26), which teaches that she remains the entire day of her issue in her impure state and must wait until the day is over before she can immerse herself, nevertheless, one might have said that <b>at least during the night</b> following the day of her issue <b>she should</b> be able to <b>perform a partial observation,</b> i.e., she should verify that part of the night has gone by without bleeding, <b>and</b> then <b>immerse herself</b> at night, without waiting until morning. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>since she is required to count</b> one day of purity after her day of impurity,

Daf 20b

and <b>counting</b> can only be done <b>during the day</b> and not at night, as it says: “And she shall count for herself seven days” (Leviticus 15:28), she cannot immerse herself until after sunrise, although here she has to count only one day.
§ The mishna concludes: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> things, <b>if one did them after daybreak they are valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived, that from daybreak it is already considered daytime? <b>Rava said: As the verse states: “And God called the light</b> [or] <b>day”</b> (Genesis 1:5), meaning: <b>To that which was becoming lighter and lighter he called day.</b> The Hebrew word <i>or</i> is not to be understood in its usual sense of light, but as a verbal noun: that which is becoming lighter and lighter. It teaches that as soon as light begins to appear in the sky it is called daytime.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this interpretation: <b>However, if</b> it is <b>so</b> that Rava’s interpretation of this phrase is correct, the following phrase: <b>“And the darkness</b> [<b><i>ḥoshekh</i></b>] <b>He called night”</b> (Genesis 1:5), should be interpreted in a similar fashion: <b>That which was becoming darker and darker He called night,</b> so that immediately after sunset it would be considered nighttime. But don’t <b>we maintain</b> that <b>until the stars come out it is not nighttime?</b> We are forced to say that <i>ḥoshekh</i> literally means darkness, and similarly, <i>or</i> in the first part of the verse literally means light.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Zeira said:</b> We derive this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“So we labored in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared”</b> (Nehemiah 4:15), where “rising of the morning” means daybreak, <b>and</b> the next verse <b>states: “So that in the night they may be a guard to us;</b> and labor in the day” (Nehemiah 4:16). This demonstrates that the day begins with the dawn.
The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <b>What</b> need is there for the additional verse introduced by the words <b>“and it states”?</b> Why does the first proof-text not suffice? The Gemara explains: The second verse comes to deflect the following possible objection: <b>You might say that</b> even <b>after “the rising of the morning” it is not</b> yet considered <b>day, and that from</b> the time <b>when the sun sets it is</b> already considered <b>night, and</b> in this particular incident it happened that <b>they began</b> their work <b>early,</b> before the official beginning of daytime, <b>and remained</b> working <b>late,</b> after the official end of daytime. Therefore, Rabbi Zeira continued and said: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> is stated in the next verse: <b>“So that in the night they may be a guard to us; and labor in the day.”</b> The entire time during which they worked is referred to as “day,” which proves that the day begins at daybreak.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although it is preferable to fulfill a particular day’s mitzva at the earliest possible hour, <b>the entire day is a valid</b> time <b>for reading the Megilla; for reciting <i>hallel</i>; for sounding the <i>shofar</i></b> on Rosh HaShana; <b>for taking the <i>lulav</i></b> and the other species on Sukkot; <b>for the additional prayer</b> recited on Shabbat and other occasions; <b>and for the additional offerings</b> sacrificed in the Temple on these occasions.
<b>And</b> the entire day is also a valid time <b>for the confession over the bulls</b> brought by the Sanhedrin or by the High Priest to atone for mistakes they had made in their instruction to the people; <b>for the declaration</b> made on the last day of Passover in the fourth and seventh year of the Sabbatical cycle, stating that one’s obligations <b>with regard to tithes</b> have been properly fulfilled (see Deuteronomy 26:12–15); <b>and for the confession</b> of sins made by the High Priest <b>on Yom Kippur</b> over the special offerings brought on that day.
The entire day is also a valid time <b>for placing hands</b> on the head of an offering; <b>for slaughtering</b> an offering; <b>for waving</b> those offerings that require waving in the Temple; <b>for bringing</b> meal-offerings <b>near</b> to the altar; <b>for scooping out a fistful</b> of flour from a meal-offering in order to burn it on the altar; <b>and for burning</b> the fistful of flour on the altar; <b>for pinching</b> the necks of the turtledoves and young pigeons sacrificed as offerings in the Temple; <b>and for receiving</b> the blood of an offering in a vessel; <b>and for sprinkling</b> blood on the altar and on the curtain separating between the Holy and the Holy of Holies.
<b>And</b> the entire day is also a valid time <b>for giving a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>] to drink</b> from the bitter waters (see Numbers 5:11–31); <b>for breaking the neck</b> of the heifer as part of the procedure followed when a corpse is found outside a town and it is not known who caused his death (see Deuteronomy 21:1–9); <b>and for</b> all the steps in the <b>purification process of the leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:1–20).
Correspondingly, all the mitzvot that must be performed at night may be performed anytime during the night: <b>The entire night is</b> a valid time for <b>reaping the <i>omer</i></b> of barley on the night following the first day of Passover, <b>for burning the fats</b> of offerings that had been brought during the preceding day, <b>and</b> for burning <b>the limbs</b> of burnt-offerings. <b>This is the principle: Something that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>during the day is valid</b> if performed anytime during <b>the entire day; something that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>at night is valid</b> if performed anytime during <b>the entire night.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that these mitzvot were commanded to be performed specifically during the day? With regard to reading the Megilla, <b>the verse states: “That these days should be remembered and kept”</b> (Esther 9:28). <b>For reciting the <i>hallel</i>,</b> the proof is from <b>that which is written</b> in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“From the rising of the sun to its setting,</b> the Lord’s name is to be praised” (Psalms 113:3). <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The proof is from another verse in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“This is the day that the Lord has made”</b> (Psalms 118:24), implying that it is to be recited during the day and not at night.
<b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for taking the <i>lulav</i>, as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day</b> the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). Daytime is also the time <b>for sounding the <i>shofar</i>, as it is written: “It is a day of sounding the <i>shofar</i> to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1). Likewise, the time <b>for</b> the <b>additional offerings</b> is day, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to these offerings: “To sacrifice an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and libations, <b>each on its own day”</b> (Leviticus 23:37). <b>And</b> this is also so <b>for the additional prayer,</b> because <b>the Sages made it equivalent to</b> those <b>additional offerings.</b>
<b>And</b> daytime is the time for <b>the confession over the bulls, as</b> this is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of <b>atonement</b> in this context and another instance of <b>atonement</b> in the context of <b>Yom Kippur. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to Yom Kippur,</b> the verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin-offering that is his, <b>and atone for himself and for his household”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). <b>The verse speaks of atonement</b> achieved through <b>words,</b> i.e., the atonement here is not referring to the sacrifice of offerings and the sprinkling of blood, but rather to atonement achieved through confession. <b>And the atonement</b> of Yom Kippur <b>is</b> only <b>during the day, as it is written:</b> “For <b>on that day will He atone for you”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). Just as the atonement on Yom Kippur must take place during the day, so must the other cases of atonement, over other bulls brought as sin-offerings, take place during the day.
<b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for the declaration with regard to tithes, as it is written</b> in the formula of this declaration: <b>“And you shall say before the Lord your God, I have removed the sacred things out of my house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13–15); <b>and juxtaposed to</b> that passage it is written: <b>“This day the Lord your God has commanded you</b> to do” (Deuteronomy 26:16), implying during the day and not at night.
<b>For placing hands</b> on the head of an offering <b>and for slaughtering</b> an offering, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And he shall lay</b> his hand upon the head of his offering, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), comparing the laying of hands to slaughtering. <b>And it is written with regard to slaughtering: “On the day that you slaughter”</b> (Leviticus 19:6), meaning during the day and not at night. <b>And for waving</b> the offerings that require waving, it is derived <b>as it is written: “And on the day you wave the <i>omer</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:12).
<b>And</b> with regard <b>to bringing</b> the meal-offerings <b>near</b> the altar, <b>it is likened to waving, as it is written: “And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, and shall wave</b> the offering before the Lord, <b>and sacrifice</b> it upon the altar” (Numbers 5:25). The words “sacrifice it” are referring to bringing the offering near the altar. <b>And for scooping out a fistful</b> of flour, <b>and for pinching</b> the necks of the bird-offerings, <b>and for burning</b> the fistful of flour on the altar, <b>and for sprinkling</b> the blood, these are derived <b>as it is written:</b> “This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the guilt-offering, and of the consecration-offering, and of the sacrifice of the peace-offering; which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on <b>the day that he commanded the children of Israel</b> to present their offerings” (Leviticus 7:37–38).
<b>And</b> with regard <b>to giving the <i>sota</i> to drink</b> from the bitter waters, this <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“Torah”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“Torah.” It is written here</b> with respect to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall execute upon her all this Torah”</b> (Numbers 5:30), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to judgment: <b>“According to the Torah, which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment,</b> which they shall tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11).

Daf 21a

<b>Just as judgment</b> may be done only <b>by day, so too here,</b> the <i>sota</i> is given the bitter waters to drink only <b>by day.</b>
<b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for breaking the neck of the heifer,</b> as the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Atonement is written with regard to</b> the heifer, teaching that it is treated <b>like sacred</b> offerings, and it has already been established that all actions relating to offerings must be performed during the day. <b>And for purifying the leper,</b> it is derived <b>as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing”</b> (Leviticus 14:2).
It was taught in the mishna: <b>“The entire night is a valid</b> time for <b>reaping the <i>omer</i>,” as the Master said</b> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: The <b>reaping</b> of the <i>omer</i> <b>and the counting</b> of the <i>omer</i> must be performed <b>at night, whereas bringing</b> the <i>omer</i> offering to the Temple must be done <b>during the day. And for burning the fats and limbs</b> of the offerings, it is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to them: “Which shall be burning upon the altar <b>all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 6:2).
§ The mishna states: <b>This is the principle: Something that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>during the day is valid</b> if <b>performed</b> any time during <b>the entire day.</b> The Gemara asks: As the mishna has seemingly mentioned all daytime mitzvot explicitly, the words: <b>This is the principle, are to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: This principle comes <b>to include the arranging of the vessels</b> of frankincense alongside the shewbread in the Temple, <b>and the removal of</b> those <b>vessels</b> at the end of the week, as the verse does not specify the time when these procedures should be performed.
<b>And</b> this mishna would consequently be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: If one removed the old</b> shewbread and frankincense <b>in the morning and arranged the new</b> ones <b>toward the evening,</b> i.e., at the end of the day, <b>there is nothing</b> wrong <b>with this,</b> as it suffices if the changeover is made any time over the course of the same day. The Sages, however, maintain that the new ones must be set in place immediately after the old ones have been removed.
<b>And,</b> according to Rabbi Yosei, <b>how do I uphold</b> that which is written with regard to the shewbread: “He shall set it in order <b>before the Lord continually”</b> (Leviticus 24:8), implying that the bread must be on the table at all times? It means only <b>that the table should not be</b> an entire day <b>without the bread,</b> but if there is bread on the table for even a part of the day, it is considered as being there “continually.”
§ The mishna concludes: <b>Something that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>at night may be performed the entire night.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does this principle come <b>to add</b> that has not already been mentioned explicitly?
The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to include the eating of the Paschal offering,</b> and consequently this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: It is stated here: “On that night,” and it is stated further on: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:12). <b>Just as there,</b> when God passed through the land of Egypt, it was <b>until midnight, so too here,</b> the Paschal offering may be eaten only <b>until midnight.</b> The mishna, which asserts that the Paschal offering may be eaten all night, is not in accordance with Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who reads the Megilla</b> may position himself as he wishes, either <b>standing or sitting.</b> Whether <b>one</b> person <b>reads</b> the Megilla or <b>two</b> people <b>read it</b> together, <b>they have fulfilled</b> their obligation. In <b>a place where</b> the people <b>are accustomed to recite a blessing</b> over the reading, <b>one should recite a blessing. And</b> in a place where it is customary <b>not to recite a blessing, one should not recite a blessing.</b>
The mishna records several laws governing public Torah readings. <b>On Mondays and Thursdays</b> during the morning service <b>and on Shabbat during the afternoon service, three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah; <b>one may neither decrease</b> the number of readers <b>nor add to them. And one does not conclude with</b> a reading from the <b>Prophets</b> [<i>haftara</i>] on these occasions. Both <b>the one who begins</b> the reading <b>and the one who concludes the</b> reading from <b>the Torah recite a blessing;</b> one recites <b>before</b> the beginning of the reading <b>and</b> one recites <b>after its</b> conclusion, but the middle reader does not recite a blessing.
<b>On</b> the days of the <b>New Moon and on the intermediate days of a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah; <b>one may neither decrease</b> the number of readers <b>nor add to them. And one does not conclude with</b> a reading from the <b>Prophets.</b> Both <b>the one who begins</b> the reading <b>and the one who concludes</b> the reading from <b>the Torah recite a blessing.</b> The first reader recites a blessing <b>before</b> the beginning of the reading, <b>and</b> the last reader recites a blessing <b>after its</b> conclusion, but the middle readers do not recite a blessing.
The mishna formulates a general principle with regard to the number of people who read from the Torah on different occasions. <b>This is the principle: Any</b> day <b>on which there is an additional offering</b> sacrificed in the Temple <b>and that is not a Festival,</b> i.e., the New Moon and the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah; <b>on a Festival, five</b> people read; <b>on Yom Kippur, six</b> people read; and <b>on Shabbat, seven</b> people read. <b>One may not decrease</b> the number of readers, <b>but one may add to them. And</b> on these days <b>one concludes with</b> a reading from the <b>Prophets.</b> Both <b>the one who begins</b> the reading <b>and the one who concludes the</b> reading from <b>the Torah recite a blessing;</b> one recites <b>before</b> the beginning of the reading <b>and</b> one recites <b>after its</b> conclusion, but the middle readers do not recite a blessing.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that one may read the Megilla while sitting. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <b>is not the case with regard to</b> reading <b>the Torah,</b> as one must stand when reading the Torah. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “But as for you, stand here with Me,</b> and I will speak to you all the commandments and the statutes” (Deuteronomy 5:28), which indicates that the Torah must be received while standing. <b>And Rabbi Abbahu said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it would be impossible to utter it,</b> in deference to God. The phrase “with Me” indicates that, <b>as it were, even the Holy One, Blessed be He, was standing</b> at the giving of the Torah.
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu</b> also <b>said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the teacher should not sit on a couch and teach his disciple</b> while he is sitting <b>on the ground?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “But as for you, stand here with Me,”</b> which indicates that the teacher and his disciples should be in the same position.
With regard to Torah study while standing, <b>the Sages taught: From the days of Moses until</b> the time of <b>Rabban Gamliel, they would study Torah only while standing,</b> as learning from one’s teacher is comparable to receiving the Torah at Sinai, during which the Jewish people stood. <b>When Rabban Gamliel died, weakness descended to the world, and they would study Torah while sitting. And this is as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 49a): <b>When Rabban Gamliel died, honor</b> for <b>the Torah ceased,</b> as standing while learning is an expression of honor for the Torah.
The Gemara points out an apparent contradiction with regard to this very issue. <b>One verse says: “And I sat [<i>va’eshev</i>] on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:9), <b>and another verse says: “And I stood on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:10). The Gemara cites several possible resolutions. <b>Rav said:</b> Moses would <b>stand and learn</b> the Torah from God, and then <b>sit and review</b> what he had learned. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> Moses was <b>not standing or sitting, but rather bowing. Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The term <b><i>yeshiva</i> is nothing more than an expression of remaining</b> in one place, <b>as it is stated: “And you dwelled [<i>vateshvu</i>] in Kadesh for many days”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:46). <b>Rava said:</b> Moses studied <b>easy</b> material while <b>standing and difficult</b> material while <b>sitting.</b>
We learned in the mishna: If <b>one</b> person <b>reads</b> the Megilla or <b>two</b> people <b>read it</b> together, <b>they have fulfilled</b> their obligation.

Daf 21b

<b>It was taught:</b> This <b>is not the case with regard to</b> reading <b>the Torah,</b> which may be read only by a single person. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Megilla</i> 3:20): When reading from <b>the Torah, one</b> person <b>reads and one may translate</b> the reading into Aramaic for the congregation, <b>provided that there are not one</b> person <b>reading and two</b> people <b>translating,</b> because two voices cannot be heard simultaneously. <b>And</b> when reading from <b>the Prophets, one</b> person <b>reads and two may translate,</b> as there is less of a need to ensure that everyone hears the precise translation, as the Prophets do not teach <i>halakha</i>. This is the case <b>provided that there are not two</b> people <b>reading and two translating. And</b> when reciting <b><i>hallel</i> and</b> reading <b>the Megilla, even ten</b> people <b>may read and ten may translate.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Megilla may be read by several people at once? <b>Since</b> the Megilla <b>is cherished</b> by the congregation, <b>they will pay</b> close <b>attention and hear it,</b> and they will not become distracted by the different voices.
§ We learned in the mishna: In <b>a place where</b> the people <b>are accustomed to recite a blessing</b> over the reading, <b>one should recite a blessing. Abaye said: They taught</b> that the matter depends upon local custom <b>only</b> with regard to the blessing that is recited <b>after</b> the reading of the Megilla. <b>But</b> as for the blessing that is recited <b>before</b> the reading, it is <b>a mitzva to recite the blessing</b> according to all opinions, as <b>Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: With regard to all the mitzvot, one recites a blessing over them prior to [<i>over</i>] their performance.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that</b> the word <b><i>over</i> is the language of precedence? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said that the verse states: “And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran [<i>vaya’avor</i>] the Cushite”</b> (II Samuel 18:23), i.e., Ahimaaz overtook the Cushite. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “And he passed [<i>avar</i>] before them”</b> (Genesis 33:3). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “And their king passed [<i>vaya’avor</i>] before them and the Lord at their head”</b> (Micah 2:13).
The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing is recited before</b> the reading of the Megilla? The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Sheshet from Katrazya</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>before Rav Ashi, and he recited</b> three <b>blessings,</b> alluded to by the letters <b><i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>ḥet</i>:</b> Concerning the reading [<i>mikra</i>] of the Megilla; Who has performed miracles [<i>nissim</i>] for our fathers; and Who has given us life [<i>sheheḥeyanu</i>].
The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing is recited after</b> the reading of the Megilla in places where it is customary to recite such a blessing? The Gemara answers that the following blessing is recited: <b>Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, the God Who pleads our cause, and Who judges our claim, and Who avenges our vengeance, and Who punishes our foes, and Who brings retribution to our enemies. Blessed are You, Lord, Who, on behalf of Israel, exacts punishment from all of their foes. Rava said:</b> The conclusion of the blessing is as follows: Blessed are you, Lord, <b>the God who brings salvation. Rav Pappa said: Therefore,</b> since there are two opinions on the matter, <b>we should say both of them: Blessed are you, Lord, Who, on behalf of Israel, exacts punishment from all their foes; the God Who brings salvation.</b>
We learned in the mishna: <b>On Mondays and</b> on <b>Thursdays</b> during the morning service <b>and on Shabbat during the afternoon service, three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. The Gemara asks: <b>Corresponding to what were these three</b> readers instituted? <b>Rav Asi said: They correspond</b> to the three sections of the Bible: <b>Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings. Rava said: They correspond to</b> the three components of the Jewish people: <b>Priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b>
The Gemara raises a question: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rav Shimi taught: One may not decrease</b> to fewer than <b>ten</b> the number of <b>verses</b> read during a public Torah reading <b>in the synagogue,</b> and a generic verse, e.g., <b>“And</b> God <b>spoke</b> to Moses saying,” <b>is included in the count, to what do these ten</b> verses <b>correspond?</b> Why specifically the number ten?
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> They <b>correspond to the ten idlers that are in the synagogue,</b> i.e., ten men who have the leisure not to work, and instead sit in the synagogue and are available to attend to communal needs. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> They <b>correspond to the Ten Commandments that were spoken to Moses at Sinai. Rabbi Levi said:</b> They <b>correspond to the ten</b> psalms of <b>praise</b> that <b>David said in the book of Psalms. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They correspond to the ten utterances with which the world was created.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are these</b> ten utterances? Presumably, they are the utterances introduced by the words <b>“and</b> God <b>said”</b> in the story of Creation in the first chapter of <b>Genesis.</b> However, <b>there are</b> only <b>nine of these</b> utterances and not ten. The Gemara answers: The expression: <b>“In the beginning”</b> (Genesis 1:1) <b>is also</b> considered <b>an utterance, as it is written: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth”</b> (Psalms 33:6), which indicates that the first utterance of Creation was the general creation of the entire universe.
<b>Rava said:</b> Since ten verses must be read, if <b>the first</b> of the three readers called to the Torah <b>read four</b> verses, <b>he is praiseworthy;</b> if <b>the second one read four</b> verses, <b>he is praiseworthy;</b> and if <b>the third one read four</b> verses, <b>he is praiseworthy.</b>
Rava explains: <b>If the first</b> of the three readers called to the Torah <b>read four</b> verses, <b>he is praiseworthy</b> because the first in a series is privileged, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 8a): One <b>removes</b> the funds <b>from the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber,</b> in order to use them for purchasing communal offerings and attending to other needs of the Temple, <b>with three</b> large <b>baskets,</b> each measuring <b>three <i>se’a</i>. On</b> the baskets <b>is written,</b> respectively, <b><i>alef</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>gimmel</i>,</b> in order <b>to know which of them was removed first,</b> in order <b>to sacrifice</b> offerings purchased with money <b>from</b> that basket <b>first, as it is a mitzva</b> to use the money collected with <b>the first</b> basket before the money collected with the others.
If <b>the middle one read four</b> verses, <b>he is</b> also <b>praiseworthy,</b> as the middle position is also dignified, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “The seven lamps <b>shall give light in front of the candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:2); <b>this teaches that</b> the priest <b>turns the front</b> of each lamp <b>toward</b> the <b>western lamp</b> of the candelabrum, i.e., the middle lamp, <b>and</b> the <b>western lamp</b> faces <b>toward the Divine Presence. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is derived <b>from here that the middle one is</b> especially <b>praiseworthy.</b>
<b>And if the last one</b> called to the Torah <b>read four</b> verses, <b>he</b> too <b>is praiseworthy, due to</b> the principle that <b>one elevates</b> to a higher level of <b>sanctity and does not downgrade.</b> If the last reader reads more verses than did the first two, this is an elevation in sanctity. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa happened</b> to come <b>to the synagogue of</b> the place called <b>Avi Gover, and the first person</b> called to the Torah <b>read four</b> verses, <b>and Rav Pappa praised him.</b>
We learned in the mishna that <b>one may neither decrease</b> the number of readers <b>nor add to them.</b> The one who begins the reading and the one who concludes the reading from the Torah each recite a blessing. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The one who begins</b> the reading <b>recites a blessing before</b> reading from the Torah, <b>and the one who concludes</b> the reading <b>recites a blessing after</b> the reading.
The Gemara comments: <b>And now that all</b> who read from the Torah <b>recite blessings</b> both <b>before and after</b> reading from the Torah, <b>this is the reason that the Sages instituted</b> this policy: It is <b>a decree due to</b> both <b>those who enter</b> the synagogue in middle of the reading and do not hear the first reader’s initial blessing <b>and due to those who leave</b> the synagogue early and do not hear the final reader’s concluding blessing, lest they come to the erroneous conclusion that one blessing suffices.
We learned in the mishna: <b>On</b> the days of the <b>New Moon and on the intermediate days of a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>Ulla bar Rav raised a dilemma before Rava: The</b> Torah <b>portion</b> read <b>on the New Moon</b> consists of three short consecutive paragraphs (Numbers 28:1–8, 9–10, 11–15). <b>How does one read it</b> in order to divide it among four readers? With regard to the first paragraph, which includes the verse: <b>“Command the children of Israel and say to them, My offering, the provision</b> of My sacrifices made by fire” (Numbers 28:2), and <b>which is eight verses, what shall we do?</b>
If you say that <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> readers <b>should read three verses each, there will remain</b> only <b>two</b> more <b>verses</b> until the end of the paragraph, and <b>one may not leave fewer than three verses</b> before the end of <b>a paragraph</b> at the conclusion of a reading. If you say that the first two readers <b>should read four</b> verses <b>each</b> and complete the first paragraph, then <b>seven</b> verses <b>will be left</b> until the end of entire portion; the second paragraph of <b>“And on Shabbat day”</b> (Numbers 28:9) <b>is two</b> verses, and the third paragraph of <b>“And on the beginnings of your months”</b> (Numbers 28:11) <b>is five</b> verses. <b>What shall we do</b> with them? If the third reader <b>reads</b> the <b>two</b> verses <b>from this</b> paragraph <b>and one of those</b> verses in the following paragraph, this is improper due to the principle that

Daf 22a

<b>one may not begin</b> a new <b>paragraph</b> and read <b>fewer than three verses</b> from it. And if you say <b>he should read two</b> verses <b>from this</b> paragraph, i.e., the entire second paragraph, <b>and</b> then <b>three</b> verses <b>from that</b> final paragraph, <b>only two</b> verses will <b>remain</b> from the final paragraph. This is problematic because one may not conclude a reading with fewer than three verses left until the end of a paragraph and because the fourth reader will not have a sufficient number of verses to read.
Rava <b>said to him: I have not heard</b> a solution for <b>this</b> problem from my teachers. However, <b>with regard to a similar</b> problem <b>I heard</b> a solution from them, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ta’anit</i> 26a): <b>On Sunday,</b> the non-priestly watches would read two paragraphs from the Torah: <b>“In the beginning”</b> (Genesis 1:1–5) <b>and “Let there be a firmament”</b> (Genesis 1:6–8). <b>And it is taught in that regard</b> that the paragraph <b>“In the beginning”</b> was read <b>by two</b> readers and the paragraph <b>“Let there be a firmament” by one</b> reader.
<b>And we discussed</b> this ruling and raised difficulties with <b>it: Granted,</b> the paragraph <b>“Let there be a firmament”</b> was read <b>by one</b> reader, <b>as it</b> consists of <b>three verses. But</b> how was the paragraph <b>“In the beginning”</b> read <b>by two?</b> It consists of only <b>five verses, and it was taught</b> in a mishna (23b): <b>One who reads from the Torah should not</b> read <b>fewer than three verses.</b>
<b>And it was stated with regard to</b> that mishna that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about how to divide the verses. <b>Rav said:</b> The second reader <b>repeats</b> the last verse that the first reader had recited, so that each of them reads three verses. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The first reader <b>divides</b> the third verse and reads half of it, and the second reader begins with the second half of that verse, as though each half were its own verse.
The Gemara explains the opinions of Rav and Shmuel. <b>Rav said</b> that the second reader <b>repeats</b> the last verse that the first reader recited. <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he did not state</b> that the first reader <b>divides</b> the third verse, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds</b> that <b>any verse that Moses did not divide, we may not divide.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Does Shmuel say</b> that <b>we may divide</b> a verse into two parts? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥananya Kara,</b> the Bible expert, <b>say: I had great distress with Rabbi Ḥanina the Great;</b> there were many times I had to ask his permission to divide a verse, <b>and he permitted me to divide</b> it <b>only for the</b> benefit of <b>schoolchildren, since they</b> need <b>to be taught</b> in this manner, as it is difficult for children to learn long verses all at once? In other cases, however it is prohibited to divide a verse.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of schoolchildren, <b>what is the reason</b> that it is permitted to divide a verse? <b>Because it is not possible</b> to teach the children without doing so. <b>Here, too,</b> when a paragraph of five verses must be divided between two readers, <b>it is not possible</b> to divide them without dividing the middle verse.
The Gemara now examines the opinion of Shmuel. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The first reader <b>divides</b> the third verse and reads half of it. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he did not state</b> that the second reader <b>repeats</b> the last verse recited by the first reader, in accordance with the opinion of Rav? The Gemara answers: It is because of a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that was instituted <b>due to those who enter and those who leave</b> the synagogue between the readings. These individuals might erroneously conclude that since the reading they heard consisted of three verses, the reading they missed consisted of only two verses. Therefore, the middle verse is divided into two parts, so that all will realize that no reader recites only two verses.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinions of Rav and Shmuel from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Two</b> people may <b>read a paragraph of six verses, but</b> a paragraph <b>of five</b> verses may be read only by <b>a single</b> reader. If <b>the first</b> one <b>read three</b> verses, <b>the second</b> one <b>reads</b> the remaining <b>two</b> verses <b>from this paragraph</b> and then <b>one</b> verse <b>from another,</b> i.e., the following, <b>paragraph. And some say</b> that it does not suffice to read one verse from the next paragraph; rather, he must read <b>three</b> verses, as <b>one may not begin</b> a new <b>paragraph</b> and read <b>fewer than three verses</b> from it.
<b>And if it is so,</b> if it is permissible to do as Rav and Shmuel suggested, <b>according to the one who said</b> that the second reader <b>repeats</b> a verse that the previous reader recited, i.e., Rav, <b>let him repeat</b> the verse in this case as well. <b>And according to the one who said</b> that the second reader <b>divides</b> the verse, i.e., Shmuel, <b>let him divide</b> the verse in this case as well.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>it is different, as it is possible to</b> solve the problem <b>in this</b> manner by reading additional verses. On the New Moon, however, the next paragraph deals with an entirely different subject, and consequently it cannot be included in the Torah reading. Therefore, Rav and Shmuel presented alternate solutions.
With regard to the dispute cited in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced by the phrase: <b>Some say,</b> which maintains that at least three verses must be read from the next paragraph. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Just as one may not begin</b> a new <b>paragraph</b> and read <b>fewer than three verses</b> from it, <b>so too, one may not leave fewer than three verses</b> before the end of <b>a paragraph</b> at the conclusion of a reading.
The Gemara challenges this statement: This <b>is obvious. Now,</b> if with regard to <b>the beginning</b> of a paragraph, where <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is lenient</b> and holds that it is sufficient to read one verse from the next paragraph, the opinion introduced with the phrase: <b>Some say, is stringent,</b> then with regard to <b>leaving</b> verses at the end of a paragraph, where even <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is stringent</b> and holds that one may not conclude a reading with fewer than three verses remaining until the end of a paragraph, is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that the opinion introduced with: <b>Some say, is stringent?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say: Entering</b> in the middle of the Torah reading <b>is common,</b> and therefore one should not conclude a reading after having read fewer than three verses of a paragraph, but <b>leaving</b> in the middle of the Torah reading, whereby one <b>abandons a Torah scroll and leaves, is not common,</b> and therefore one may conclude a reading with fewer than three verses left in the paragraph, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>teaches us</b> that the second opinion cited in the <i>baraita</i> is also concerned that people may leave in the middle of the Torah reading, and consequently one may not conclude a reading with fewer than three verses left in the paragraph.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, what is different</b> about <b>leaving</b> fewer than three verses at the end of a paragraph, <b>which</b> is <b>not</b> permitted <b>due to</b> concern about <b>those who leave</b> the synagogue in the middle of the Torah reading? In the case of <b>beginning</b> a paragraph without reading at least three verses, he should <b>also</b> hold that there is a rabbinic <b>decree due to those who enter,</b> lest the latecomer think that the previous reader read fewer than three verses. The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> in answer to this question that <b>one who enters</b> in the middle of the Torah reading <b>asks</b> how the Torah was read until then, and those present will explain to him that the reader started in the previous paragraph. Therefore, he will not erroneously think that the reader recited fewer than three verses.
<b>Rabba, son of Rava, sent</b> a messenger <b>to</b> ask <b>Rav Yosef: What is the <i>halakha</i></b> with regard to dividing a small Torah portion? Rav Yosef <b>sent him</b> the following answer: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>one repeats</b> a verse, in accordance with the opinion of Rav, <b>and</b> it is <b>the middle</b> reader who <b>repeats</b> it, and not the last reader, so that it will not be necessary to leave fewer than three verses until the end of the paragraph.
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> day <b>on which there is an additional offering</b> sacrificed in the Temple and that is not a Festival, four people read from the Torah. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: On <b>a public fast, how many</b> people read from the Torah? Does the mishna mean to say that only on <b>the New Moon and</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, when there is an additional offering, four</b> people read; <b>but here,</b> on a public fast day, <b>when there is no additional offering, no,</b> only three people read? <b>Or perhaps here, too, there is an additional prayer,</b> as on public fast days the prayer: <i>Aneinu</i>, is inserted into the <i>Amida</i> prayer, and so too an additional reader is called to read from the Torah.
The Gemara attempts to adduce a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> we learned in the mishna: <b>On</b> the days of the <b>New Moon and on the intermediate days of a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>Doesn’t</b> this indicate that <b>on a public fast,</b> only <b>three</b> people read? The Gemara responds: <b>Say the first clause</b> of the mishna: <b>On Mondays and Thursdays</b> during the morning service <b>and on Shabbat during the afternoon service, three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>Doesn’t</b> this indicate that on <b>a public fast, four</b> people read from the Torah? <b>Rather,</b> it must be concluded that <b>nothing can be derived from this</b> mishna with regard to a public fast day, as the mishna does not mean to indicate the <i>halakha</i> in every possible case.
A different proof is now suggested. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following incident: <b>Rav</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to Babylonia on a public fast. He stood and read from</b> a Torah <b>scroll.</b> When <b>he began</b> to read, <b>he recited a blessing,</b> but when <b>he concluded, he did not recite a blessing. Everyone</b> else <b>fell on their faces,</b> i.e., bowed down on the floor, during the <i>Taḥanun</i> supplication, as was the custom, <b>but Rav did not fall on his face.</b>
The Gemara attempts to clarify the <i>halakha</i> based upon Rav’s conduct. <b>Now, Rav</b> must have <b>read</b> the portion that is designated for <b>an Israelite,</b> as he was neither a priest nor a Levite, and therefore he was the third person to read from the Torah. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is the reason</b> that when <b>he concluded</b> his reading <b>he did not recite a blessing? Was it not because another</b> person <b>was to read after him,</b> and since only the last reader recites a blessing, Rav did not recite a blessing upon completion of his portion? This would indicate that four readers are called to the Torah on public fasts.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, Rav read</b> the first reading, which is generally designated for <b>priests.</b> He was the leading Torah authority of his generation, and one who holds this position is called to read from the Torah even before a priest, <b>as Rav Huna would read</b> the first reading, which is generally designated for <b>priests,</b> and Rav would do the same.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted, Rav Huna read</b> the portion designated for <b>priests, as even Rav Ami and Rav Asi,</b> who were <b>the most esteemed priests in Eretz Yisrael, were subordinate to Rav Huna,</b> and he was considered the undisputed rabbinic leader of the Jewish people. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>Rav, there was Shmuel, who was a priest, and</b> Rav had <b>elevated</b> him <b>above himself,</b> showing Shmuel deference in all matters of honor. Consequently, Rav was not the singular leader of his generation and would not have read the first reading in place of a priest.
The Gemara answers: In fact, <b>Shmuel was also subordinate to Rav,</b> as Rav was indeed the leading authority in Babylonia, <b>and it was Rav who showed</b> Shmuel <b>honor</b> of his own volition, in order to appease him for having cursed him. <b>And he did this</b> only when Shmuel was <b>in his presence,</b> but <b>when he was not in his presence,</b> Rav <b>did not do this,</b> and therefore Rav would read first from the Torah when Shmuel was not present.
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to assume that <b>Rav read</b> first <b>from</b> the portion that is generally designated for <b>priests, because if it enters your mind to say</b> that <b>he read</b> third, <b>from</b> the portion designated for <b>an</b> ordinary <b>Israelite, what is the reason he recited a blessing before</b> reading his portion? Only the first reader recites a blessing before reading from the Torah. The Gemara rejects this argument: This incident took place <b>after it was instituted</b> that all those called to read from the Torah recite a blessing.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, he should also have recited a blessing after</b> his reading, as the rabbinic enactment requires those who read from the Torah to recite blessings both before and after their reading. The Gemara answers: The reason that the Sages required all the readers to recite blessings both before and after their readings was to prevent misunderstandings on the part of both those who enter the synagogue in the middle of the reading and those who leave early. But <b>it was different where Rav was present, as</b> people <b>would enter</b> the synagogue in the middle of the reading,

Daf 22b

but <b>they would not leave</b> early, out of deference to Rav, and therefore it was not necessary for him to recite a blessing after he finished his portion. In any event, the incident with Rav does not provide conclusive proof as to the number of readers on a public fast day.
The Gemara tries to adduce another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is the</b> general <b>principle: Any</b> day <b>on which</b> labor is permitted and prolonging the prayer service would constitute <b>a deprivation of labor for the masses, for example, a public fast day and the Ninth of Av,</b> only <b>three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah, so as not to lengthen the prayer service unnecessarily.
<b>But</b> any day <b>on which</b> prolonging the prayer service would <b>not</b> constitute <b>a deprivation of labor for the masses, for example,</b> the days of <b>the New Moon,</b> when it is customary for women to refrain from work, <b>and on the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> when one may not perform labor unless refraining from labor will cause him to lose money, <b>four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that on a public fast day three people read from the Torah.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Didn’t we learn in the mishna as follows: This is the principle: Any day on which there is an additional offering</b> sacrificed in the Temple <b>and</b> it <b>is not a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah? <b>What is added</b> by the formulation of this principle? <b>Does it not</b> come <b>to add a public fast and the Ninth of Av,</b> when there is an addition to the prayer service, and therefore four people read from the Torah?
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rav Ashi, who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna? It is not the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the following <i>baraita</i> <b>and not Rabbi Yosei. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the Ninth of Av <b>occurs on a Monday or a Thursday,</b> days on which there is always a Torah reading, <b>three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>And</b> the last <b>one</b> of them <b>concludes</b> with a reading from the Prophets [<i>haftara</i>]. If it falls <b>on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, one</b> person <b>reads</b> from the Torah, <b>and</b> the same <b>one concludes</b> with a reading from the Prophets. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Three</b> people <b>always read</b> from the Torah on the Ninth of Av, <b>and</b> the last <b>one concludes</b> with a reading from the Prophets. All agree that no more than three people read from the Torah on the Ninth of Av and other public fast days.
The Gemara responds: <b>However,</b> if only three people read from the Torah on these days, the statement: <b>This is the principle,</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as the mishna has already specifically mentioned every case included in the principle. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is not difficult; it comes <b>to add the New Moon and</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Aren’t these</b> days <b>taught explicitly</b> in the mishna: <b>On the New Moon and on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah?
The Gemara answers: The principle was not intended to add to what is stated explicitly in the mishna. The mishna <b>merely gives a mnemonic</b> by which to remember the number of readers on each day. It expresses the following: <b>Do not say that a Festival and the intermediate days of the Festival are the same</b> with regard to their sanctity, and therefore the same numbers of readers are called to the Torah on these days. <b>Rather, hold this rule</b> firmly <b>in your hand:</b> On <b>any</b> day <b>when there is an additional element</b> of the laws of the day, <b>an extra person is added</b> to the number of those who read from the Torah.
<b>Therefore, on the New Moon and</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival,</b> when <b>there is an additional offering, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>On a Festival, when</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>perform labor, five</b> people read from the Torah. <b>On Yom Kippur, when</b> performance of prohibited labor <b>is punishable by <i>karet</i>, six</b> people read from the Torah. On <b>Shabbat, when there is a prohibition</b> to perform labor that is punishable by <b>stoning, seven</b> people read.
The Gemara cited an incident involving Rav, and now it returns to examine <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to Babylonia on a public fast. He stood and read from a</b> Torah <b>scroll.</b> When <b>he began</b> to read, <b>he recited a blessing,</b> but when <b>he concluded, he did not recite a blessing. Everyone</b> else <b>fell on their faces,</b> i.e., bowed down on the floor, during the <i>taḥanun</i> supplication, as was the custom, <b>but Rav did not fall on his face.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason that Rav did not fall on his face?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It was a stone floor, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Nor shall you install any figured stone in your land, to bow down upon it”</b> (Leviticus 26:1), that, <b>upon it,</b> i.e., any type of figured stone, <b>you shall not bow down in your land,</b> i.e., anywhere in your land other than in the Temple; <b>but you shall bow down upon the stones of the Temple.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla,</b> as <b>Ulla said: The Torah prohibited</b> bowing down <b>only</b> upon <b>a stone floor.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> was it <b>specifically Rav</b> who did not bow down? <b>All of</b> the other people present were <b>also</b> prohibited from bowing down on the stone floor. The Gemara answers: The stone section of the floor was only <b>in front of Rav,</b> as the rest of the floor was not paved.
The Gemara comments: If so, Rav <b>should have gone to</b> where the rest of <b>the congregation</b> was standing <b>and fallen on his face</b> there. The Gemara responds: <b>He did not want to trouble the congregation</b> to make room for him. <b>And if you wish, say</b> the following: <b>Rav would stretch out his arms and legs</b> and fully prostrate himself on the ground, whereas the others would merely bend their bodies as a symbolic gesture but would not prostrate themselves on the ground. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla said: The Torah prohibited</b> bowing down upon a stone floor <b>only</b> when it is done with <b>outstretched arms and legs.</b>
The Gemara challenges this response: Rav <b>should have fallen on his face without stretching out his arms and legs.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He did not</b> want to <b>change his</b> usual <b>custom</b> of full prostration, and where he was standing he could not fully prostrate himself in his usual manner because there the floor was of stone.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different reason as to why Rav did not fall on his face: <b>An important person is different, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: An important person is not permitted to fall on his face</b> in public <b>unless</b> he knows that <b>he will be answered like Joshua bin Nun</b> in his time, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord said to Joshua: Get up;</b> why do you lie upon your face?” (Joshua 7:10). It is a disgrace for a distinguished person to fall on his face and have his prayers unanswered. Consequently, Rav did not prostrate himself in public.
Apropos Rav’s practice of prostrating himself, the Gemara continues with a discussion of different forms of bowing. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> indicates falling <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face,</b> with one’s face toward the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means bowing <b>upon one’s knees, as it is stated</b> with regard to Solomon: He finished praying and “he rose from before the altar of the Lord, <b>from kneeling [<i>mikkeroa</i>] upon his knees”</b> (I Kings 8:54). Finally, <b><i>hishtaḥava’a</i>, that is</b> bowing with one’s <b>arms and legs spread</b> in total submission, <b>as it is stated</b> that Jacob asked, in response to Joseph’s dream: <b>“Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground?”</b> (Genesis 37:10).
The Gemara relates that <b>Levi</b> once <b>demonstrated</b> the form of <b><i>kidda</i></b> that was performed by the High Priest <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. This bowing was especially difficult, as it involved bending from the waist until his head reached the ground, supporting his body with his thumbs, and then rising at once. In the course of his demonstration, Levi dislocated his hip and <b>became lame.</b>
The Gemara asks: Was it <b>this that caused</b> Levi to become lame? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: A person should never speak impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High, as a great man</b> once <b>spoke impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High and he became lame? And who was he? Levi.</b> The reason Levi became lame was because of the way he spoke to God (see <i>Ta’anit</i> 25a), not due to having performed <i>kidda</i>. The Gemara answers: Both <b>this and that caused</b> Levi to become lame. Since he spoke impertinently toward God, he was worthy of punishment, and he therefore suffered an injury while exerting himself to perform <i>kidda</i>.
On the topic of bowing, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said: I saw Abaye</b>

Daf 23a

<b>and Rava, who would bend</b> their heads and not actually prostrate themselves on the ground.
We learned in the mishna: <b>On a Festival, five</b> people read; <b>on Yom Kippur, six</b> people read; and on Shabbat, seven people read. One may not decrease the number of readers, but one may add to them. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not Rabbi Yishmael and not Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On a Festival, five</b> people read from the Torah; <b>and on Yom Kippur, six</b> people read; <b>and on Shabbat, seven</b> people read. <b>One may not decrease or add to</b> the required number of readers. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva</b> disagrees and <b>says: On a Festival, five</b> people read from the Torah; <b>and on Yom Kippur, seven</b> people read; <b>and on Shabbat, six</b> people read. <b>One may not decrease</b> these numbers, <b>but one may add to them.</b>
<b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna? <b>If</b> you say it is <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> it is <b>difficult</b> due to the ruling with regard to <b>adding,</b> as the mishna states that one may add additional readers but Rabbi Yishmael holds that one may not do so. <b>If</b> you say it is <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it is <b>difficult</b> due to the ruling concerning the days on which there are <b>six and seven</b> readers.
<b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, as it was taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael: On a Festival, five</b> people read from the Torah; <b>on Yom Kippur, six</b> people read; <b>on Shabbat, seven</b> people read. <b>One may not decrease these</b> numbers <b>but one may add to them.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
The Gemara comments: If so, <b>there is a contradiction</b> between the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> as expressed in the mishna, and the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> himself, as recorded in the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>Two <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> students of Rabbi Yishmael, expressed different opinions <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On a Festival, one is slow to arrive</b> at the synagogue because one is busy preparing for the festive meal, <b>and one is quick to leave</b> in order to eat; <b>on Yom Kippur, one is quick to arrive</b> at the synagogue <b>and slow to leave; and on Shabbat, one is quick to arrive,</b> as the meal has been prepared before Shabbat, <b>and quick to leave</b> in order to eat the Shabbat meal? <b>Let us say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Akiva, who holds</b> that <b>an additional man</b> reads from the Torah on Yom Kippur, which prolongs the service on that day. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> one leaves the synagogue late because <b>the order of the day,</b> i.e., the prayer service, <b>is</b> very <b>long,</b> as it includes many supplications and confessions.
A question is raised with regard to the number of readers on different days. <b>Corresponding to what</b> were <b>these three, five, and seven,</b> readers instituted? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani and one</b> other Sage <b>who was with him disagree about this. And who was</b> that other scholar? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi. And some say</b> that this was a matter of dispute between <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi and one</b> other scholar <b>who was with him. And who was</b> that other scholar? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani. One said:</b> These numbers <b>correspond</b> to the number of Hebrew words in the three verses of <b>the Priestly Benediction. And one said:</b> These numbers <b>correspond to the three guards of the door</b> (II Kings 25:18), <b>five of</b> the officers <b>who saw the king’s face</b> (II Kings 25:19), <b>and the seven</b> officers <b>who saw the king’s face</b> (Esther 1:14).
Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>three, five, and seven</b> people who read from the Torah correspond to the <b>three guards of the door, five of</b> the officers <b>who saw the king’s face,</b> and <b>the seven</b> officers <b>who saw the king’s face.</b> When Rav Yosef taught this, <b>Abaye said to him: What is the reason that until now the Master did not explain</b> the matter <b>to us</b> in this way? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I did not know that you needed this</b> information, as I thought that you were already familiar with the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Have you</b> ever <b>asked me something and I did not tell you?</b>
<b>Ya’akov of Mina said to Rav Yehuda: Corresponding to whom were these six</b> readers <b>on Yom Kippur</b> instituted? Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The number six <b>corresponds to the six</b> people <b>who stood to Ezra’s right and the six</b> people <b>who stood to his left, as it is stated: “And Ezra the Scribe stood upon a platform of wood, which they had made for the purpose, and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand, and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadanah, Zechariah, Meshullam”</b> (Nehemiah 8:4).
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>Those</b> that stood to his left <b>were seven</b> and not six. The Gemara responds: <b>Zechariah is</b> the same as <b>Meshullam,</b> that is to say, they are not two separate people, but rather one person with two names. <b>And why was he called Meshullam? Because he was perfect [<i>mishlam</i>] in his actions.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:11): <b>All</b> people <b>count toward the quorum of seven</b> readers, <b>even a minor and even a woman. However, the Sages said</b> that <b>a woman should not read the Torah, out of respect for the congregation.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the reader who <b>concludes [<i>maftir</i>]</b> the Torah reading and reads from the Prophets [<i>haftara</i>], <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; does he <b>count toward the quorum of seven</b> readers? <b>Rav Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba</b> disagreed about this matter. <b>One said: He counts, and one said: He does not count. The one who said</b> that <b>he counts</b> toward the seven readers holds that opinion <b>because he reads</b> from the Torah.
<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>he does not count</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla said: For what</b> reason <b>must</b> the one <b>who concludes</b> with a reading from <b>the Prophets read from the Torah first?</b> It is <b>due to respect for the Torah,</b> so that those present should not conclude that he was called up only to read from the Prophets because the honor due the Torah and the honor due the Prophets are equal. <b>And since</b> he reads only <b>out of respect for the Torah, he is not included in the quorum</b> of seven readers.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>The one who concludes with</b> a reading from <b>the Prophets may not</b> read <b>fewer than twenty-one verses, corresponding to the seven who read from the Torah.</b> Each one who reads from the Torah must read at least three verses, for a total of at least twenty-one verses. <b>And if it is so,</b> that the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> does not count toward the quorum of seven readers, and he is an eighth reader, the minimum number of verses that must be read from the Torah <b>is twenty-four</b> and not twenty-one. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> reads from the Torah first only <b>due to respect for the Torah,</b>

Daf 23b

<b>it is not necessary</b> to <b>also</b> add corresponding verses in the <i>haftara</i>.
<b>Rava strongly objects to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> there is the <i>haftara</i> that begins with the words: <b>“Add your burnt offerings”</b> (Jeremiah 7:21–28), <b>which does not have twenty-one verses, and</b> nevertheless <b>we read it.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as the topic is completed</b> in fewer than twenty-one verses, and it is not necessary to begin another topic merely to complete the number of verses.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>where the topic is not completed,</b> we do <b>not</b> read fewer than twenty-one verses? <b>Didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Abba say: Many times I stood before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> as a translator, <b>and when we had read ten verses he would say to us: Stop.</b> This indicates that a <i>haftara</i> need not be twenty-one verses. The Gemara answers: <b>In a place where there is a translator,</b> who translates each verse into Aramaic and adds additional explanation, <b>it is different.</b> In that case, it is not necessary for the <i>haftara</i> to consist of twenty-one verses, so as not to overburden the congregation, <b>as Rav Taḥalifa bar Shmuel taught: They taught</b> that twenty-one verses must be read from the <i>haftara</i> <b>only</b> in <b>a place where there is no translator; but in a place where there is a translator, one may stop</b> even before that.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing [<i>poresin</i>]</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>; nor does one pass before the ark</b> to repeat the <i>Amida</i> prayer; <b>nor do the</b> priests <b>lift their hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction; <b>nor is the Torah read</b> in public; <b>nor does one conclude with</b> a reading from <b>the Prophets</b> [<i>haftara</i>] in the presence of fewer than ten men.
<b>And one does not observe</b> the practice of <b>standing up and sitting down</b> for the delivery of eulogies at a funeral service; <b>nor does one recite the mourners’ blessing or comfort mourners</b> in two lines after the funeral; <b>or</b> recite the <b>bridegrooms’ blessing; and one does not invite</b> others to recite Grace after Meals, i.e., conduct a <i>zimmun</i>, <b>with the name</b> of God, <b>with fewer than ten</b> men present. If one consecrated <b>land</b> and now wishes to redeem it, the land must be assessed by <b>nine</b> men <b>and one priest,</b> for a total of ten. <b>And similarly,</b> assessing the value of <b>a person</b> who has pledged his own value to the Temple must be undertaken by ten people, one of whom must be a priest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that ten people are needed in each of these cases, derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:32), which indicates that <b>any expression of sanctity may not be</b> recited in a quorum of <b>fewer than ten</b> men.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the verse may this <b>be inferred?</b> The Gemara responds that it must be understood <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: It is inferred</b> by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>] between the words <b>“among,” “among.” Here, it is written: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel,” and there,</b> with regard to Korah’s congregation, <b>it is written “Separate yourselves from among this congregation”</b> (Numbers 16:21). Just as with regard to Korah the reference is to ten men, so too, the name of God is to be hallowed in a quorum of ten men.
The connotation of ten associated with the word “among” in the portion of Korah is, in turn, <b>inferred</b> by means of another verbal analogy between the word <b>“congregation”</b> written there and the word <b>“congregation”</b> written in reference to the ten spies who slandered Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is written there: “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation?”</b> (Numbers 14:27). Consequently, <b>just as there,</b> in the case of the spies, it was a congregation of <b>ten</b> people, as there were twelve spies altogether, and Joshua and Caleb were not included in the evil congregation, <b>so too, here,</b> in the case of Korah, the reference is to a congregation of <b>ten</b> people. The first several items mentioned in the mishna are expressions of sanctity, and they consequently require a quorum of ten.
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>And one does not observe</b> the practice of <b>standing up and sitting down</b> for the delivery of eulogies at a funeral service <b>with fewer than ten</b> men present. As this is not an expression of sanctity, it is therefore necessary to explain why a quorum is required. The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the leader of the funeral procession <b>is required to say: Stand, dear</b> friends, <b>stand; sit down, dear</b> friends, <b>sit down,</b> when there are <b>fewer than ten it is not proper conduct</b> to speak in such a dignified style.
We also learned in the mishna that <b>one does not recite the mourners’ blessing and the bridegrooms’ blessing</b> with fewer than ten men present. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the mourners’ blessing? The blessing</b> recited <b>in the square</b> next to the cemetery. Following the burial, those who participated in the funeral would assemble in the square and bless the mourners that God should comfort them, <b>as Rabbi Yitzḥak said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The mourners’ blessing</b> is recited only <b>with ten</b> men present, <b>and mourners</b> themselves <b>are not included in the count. The bridegrooms’ blessing</b> is also recited only <b>with ten</b> men present, <b>and bridegrooms</b> themselves <b>are included in the count.</b> Consequently, only nine other men are needed.
We learned further in the mishna: <b>And one does not invite</b> others to recite Grace after Meals, i.e., conduct a <i>zimmun</i>, in order to thank God <b>for</b> one’s <b>nourishment, with the name</b> of God, <b>with fewer than ten</b> men present. <b>Since one is required to say: Let us bless our Lord,</b> in the presence of <b>fewer than ten</b> it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to mention the name of God.
§ If one consecrated <b>land</b> and now wishes to redeem it, the land must be assessed by <b>nine</b> Israelites <b>and one priest,</b> for a total of ten. <b>And similarly,</b> assessing the value of <b>a person</b> who has pledged his own value to the Temple must be undertaken by ten people, one of whom must be a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that consecrated land must be assessed by ten people, one of whom is a priest, derived?
<b>Shmuel said:</b> The word <b>priest</b> is <b>written ten</b> times <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that addresses the redemption of consecrated property, indicating that ten people are required to assess the value of such property (Leviticus, chapter 27). <b>One</b> instance of the word is needed <b>for itself,</b> to indicate that a priest must participate in the assessment. <b>And one</b> instance is needed <b>to exclude</b> all non-priests from fulfilling that role. <b>And</b> all <b>the other</b> instances of the word <b>are restrictions following</b> other <b>restrictions,</b> and there is a general hermeneutical principle that <b>one restriction after another</b> serves <b>only to amplify.</b> Therefore, each additional time the word priest is repeated, it extends the criteria applied to appraisers, so as to allow non-priests to participate. Consequently, the assessment may be carried out by <b>nine</b> ordinary <b>Israelites and one priest.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> on the basis of this principle, <b>say</b> that the first usage of the term is restrictive and requires a priest for the assessment; the second usage amplifies and allows for a non-priest; the third usage again requires a priest; the fourth usage allows for a non-priest; and so on. Consequently, the assessment must be carried out by <b>five priests and five</b> ordinary <b>Israelites.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult,</b> as the derivation has not been sufficiently explained.
We learned in the mishna: <b>And similarly,</b> assessing the value of <b>a person</b> who has pledged his own value to the Temple must be undertaken by ten people, one of whom must be a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>Can a person become consecrated</b> and thereby require redemption?
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to one who says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> and thereby pledges to donate a sum of money equivalent to his own monetary value to the Temple treasury, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> the court <b>assesses him as</b> though he were <b>a slave</b> in order to determine the amount he is obligated to donate to the Temple treasury. <b>And a slave is compared to land, as it is written</b> with regard to slaves: <b>“And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). Consequently, the same criteria that apply to assessing consecrated land apply to assessing the monetary value of an individual.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who reads from the Torah</b> in the synagogue <b>should not read fewer than three verses. And</b> when it is being translated, <b>he should not read to the translator more than one verse</b> at a time, so that the translator will not become confused.

Daf 24a

<b>And with regard to the Prophets,</b> one may read to the translator <b>three</b> verses at a time. With respect to the Torah, an incorrect translation might lead to an error in practice, but this concern does not apply to the Prophets. <b>If the three</b> verses <b>constitute three</b> separate <b>paragraphs,</b> that is to say, if each verse is a paragraph in itself, <b>one must read</b> them to the translator <b>one by one.</b>
<b>One may skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Torah. How far may he skip? As far as</b> he can, provided that <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation while the reader is still rolling the scroll to the new location. The reader may not cause the congregation to wait for him after the translator has finished, as that would be disrespectful to the congregation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Corresponding to what were these three verses,</b> i.e., the minimal Torah reading, instituted? <b>Rav Asi said:</b> They <b>correspond to the Torah, Prophets, and Writings.</b>
We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> when it is being translated, <b>one should not read to the translator more than one verse</b> at a time. <b>And with regard to the Prophets,</b> he may read to the translator <b>three</b> verses at a time. <b>If the three</b> verses <b>constitute three</b> separate <b>paragraphs, he must read</b> them to the translator <b>separately, for example,</b> the verses: <b>“For thus says the Lord, You were sold for naught”</b> (Isaiah 52:3); <b>“For thus says the Lord God, at first My people went down to Egypt”</b> (Isaiah 52:4); <b>“Now therefore what have I here, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 52:5). These are three adjacent verses, each one constituting an independent paragraph.
§ We learned further in the mishna: <b>One may skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Torah.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 68b): On Yom Kippur, the High Priest <b>reads</b> the section beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), and then he reads the section beginning with the verse: <b>“Only on the tenth day”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). <b>Doesn’t he skip</b> from the first section to the second section?
<b>Abaye said: This</b> is <b>not difficult. Here, where</b> it says that one may not skip in the Torah, <b>the translator will conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading. <b>There, where</b> it is permitted to skip, <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading.
The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to that</b> issue: <b>One may skip while</b> reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip while</b> reading <b>the Torah. How far may he skip? As far as</b> he can, provided that <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading. This applies to reading the Prophets; it therefore proves <b>by inference that</b> while reading <b>the Torah</b> one may <b>not</b> skip <b>at all.</b>
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> it is <b>not difficult</b> for a different reason: <b>Here,</b> where it says that the High Priest skipped from one section to another, it was permitted because the two sections address <b>one topic. There,</b> where the mishna says one may not skip while reading the Torah, it is where the two sections address <b>two</b> distinct <b>topics. And so it is</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may skip</b> from one section to another while reading <b>the Torah</b> if the two sections address <b>one topic, and in</b> the <b>Prophets</b> one may skip even if the two sections address <b>two</b> distinct <b>topics.</b> Both <b>here and there,</b> with regard to the Torah and the Prophets, one may skip only if <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not skip from prophet to prophet,</b> i.e., from one book of Prophets to another, even if the selections address the same topic. <b>However, one may skip</b> from one <b>prophet</b> to another <b>among the twelve</b> books of Prophets, which are grouped together, <b>provided that he does not skip from the end of the book to the beginning,</b> i.e., that he does not read a later section and then an earlier section.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The one who concludes with</b> a reading from <b>the Prophets</b> [<i>haftara</i>] <b>is</b> also <b>the one</b> who is honored to <b>recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>, and he passes before the ark</b> to repeat the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>and</b> if he is a priest <b>he lifts his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. <b>And if</b> the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> <b>is a minor,</b> who may read the <i>haftara</i> but is not qualified to lead the congregation in prayer, <b>his father or teacher</b> is honored to <b>pass</b> before the ark <b>in his place.</b>
<b>A minor may read the Torah</b> in public <b>and</b> also <b>translate</b> the text for the congregation into Aramaic, <b>but he may not recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>, and he may not pass before the ark</b> to lead the congregation in prayer, <b>and he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction.
<b>One whose limbs are exposed [<i>poḥe’aḥ</i>] may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i> and translate</b> the Torah reading into Aramaic, <b>but he may not read from the Torah</b> out of respect for the Torah; <b>he may not pass before the ark</b> to lead the congregation in prayer; <b>and he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction out of respect for the congregation.
One who is <b>blind may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>, and he may</b> also <b>translate</b> the Torah reading into Aramaic. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who has not seen the luminaries,</b> the sun, moon, and stars, <b>in his life,</b> i.e., he was blind from birth, <b>may not recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>.</b> The first of the blessings before <i>Shema</i> is the blessing over the luminaries, and one who has never seen them cannot recite the blessing at all.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> is honored with these other roles? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> a desire to grant him <b>honor.</b> Since even minors are qualified to read the <i>haftara</i>, it was considered an insult for a person to be called up to read the <i>haftara</i> rather than be called up as one of those needed to read the Torah. Since he was willing to serve in this role, he is granted other, more honorable roles in the synagogue. <b>Rabba bar Shimi said</b> a different reason: It is <b>due to</b> a concern that <b>they will come to quarrel,</b> as the individual who read the <i>haftara</i> will quarrel with the individual honored to lead the congregation in prayer.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them where</b> the one who passes before the ark <b>does so free</b> of charge. In that case, there is still a need to grant the one who read the <i>haftara</i> honor, but it is not likely that they will quarrel.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And if</b> the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> <b>is a minor, his father or teacher</b> is honored to <b>pass</b> before the ark <b>in his place. If you say</b> that the reason the reader of the <i>haftara</i> passes before the ark is <b>due to</b> a concern that they will <b>quarrel, will a minor engage in quarreling?</b> He has no valid claim to the right to pass before the ark. Consequently, the concern for strife must not be the reason for the <i>halakha</i> stated in the mishna.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Rather, what</b> is the reason; is it <b>due to honor? Does a minor have honor</b> that is slighted when he reads the <i>haftara</i> and therefore must be assuaged? <b>Rather,</b> according to Rav Pappa <b>it is</b> a display of <b>honor</b> to <b>his father and his teacher.</b>

Daf 24b

<b>Here, also,</b> according to Rabba bar Shimi, <b>it is</b> to prevent <b>his father or teacher</b> from <b>quarreling.</b>
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>One whose limbs are exposed [<i>poḥe’aḥ</i>] may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i></b> and translate the Torah reading into Aramaic, but he may not read from the Torah. <b>Ulla bar Rav raised a dilemma before Abaye: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>a minor whose limbs are exposed</b> may <b>read from the Torah?</b> Can it be argued that a minor’s bare limbs do not fall under the category of nakedness, and therefore it is permitted for him to read the Torah despite the fact that parts of his body are exposed?
Abaye <b>said to him: And</b> according to this reasoning, <b>raise the dilemma</b> with regard to a minor who is totally <b>naked. What is the reason that</b> a minor who is <b>naked may not</b> read the Torah? It is <b>due to respect for the public. Here, too,</b> a <i>poḥe’aḥ</i> may not read from the Torah <b>due to respect for the public.</b>
The mishna continues: One who is <b>blind may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>,</b> and he may also translate the Torah reading into Aramaic. Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who has not seen the luminaries in his life may not recite the first of the blessings before <i>Shema</i>, which is the blessing over the luminaries. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>they said to Rabbi Yehuda: Many have seen</b> enough with their mind <b>to expound upon the</b> Divine <b>Chariot, although they have never</b> actually <b>seen it.</b> Similarly, even one who has never seen the luminaries may recite the blessing.
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> counter this argument? He can say that <b>there,</b> with regard to the Chariot, <b>the matter depends upon the heart’s comprehension, and one can concentrate</b> his mind <b>and understand</b> the Chariot even if he has never actually seen it. But <b>here,</b> with regard to the luminaries, the blessing is recited <b>due to the benefit</b> one derives from them, <b>and</b> one who is blind <b>does not derive</b> any <b>benefit</b> from them, and therefore he may not recite a blessing over them.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain that even a blind man <b>derives benefit</b> from the luminaries, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: All of my life I was troubled by this verse,</b> which I did not understand: <b>“And you shall grope at noon as the blind man gropes in the darkness”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:29). I was perplexed: <b>What</b> does it <b>matter to a blind</b> person <b>whether</b> it is <b>dark or light?</b> He cannot see in any event, so why does the verse speak about a blind man in the darkness?
I continued to ponder the matter <b>until</b> the following <b>incident occurred to me. I was once walking in the absolute darkness of the night, and I saw a blind man who was walking on</b> his <b>way with a torch in his hands. I said to him: My son, why do you</b> need <b>this torch</b> if you are blind? <b>He said to me: As long as I have a torch in my hand, people see me and save me from the pits and the thorns and the thistles.</b> Even a blind man derives at least indirect benefit from the light, and therefore he may recite the blessing over the heavenly luminaries.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A priest who has blemishes on his hands may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. Because of his blemish, people will look at his hands, and it is prohibited to look at the hands of the priests during the Priestly Benediction. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one whose hands were colored with <i>satis</i>,</b> a blue dye, <b>may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction <b>because the congregation will look at him.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The blemishes that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> disqualify a priest from reciting the Priestly Benediction include any blemishes found <b>on his face, hands, and feet,</b> but not blemishes that are not visible to others. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> If <b>his hands are spotted</b> with white blotches, <b>he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest’s <b>hands are spotted, he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. Similarly, if his hands are <b>curved</b> inward <b>or bent</b> sideways, <b>he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction.
Apropos the previous discussion, <b>Rav Asi said:</b> A priest <b>from Haifa or Beit She’an may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction, as he does not know how to properly pronounce the guttural letters. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not allow the people of Beit She’an, nor the people of Beit Haifa, nor the people of Tivonin to pass before the ark</b> in order to lead the service <b>because they pronounce <i>alef</i> as <i>ayin</i> and <i>ayin</i> as <i>alef</i>,</b> and they thereby distort the meaning of the prayers.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> once <b>said to Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>If you were a Levite, you would be disqualified from</b> singing on <b>the platform</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>because your voice is thick.</b> Offended by this remark, Rabbi Shimon <b>went and told his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, what Rabbi Ḥiyya had said. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>say to him: When you</b> study and <b>reach</b> the verse: <b>“And I will wait upon [<i>veḥikkiti</i>] the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 8:17), <b>will you not be a maligner and a blasphemer?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, who was from Babylonia, was unable to differentiate between the letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>heh</i>, and he would therefore pronounce the word <i>veḥikkiti</i> as <i>vehikkiti</i>, which means: And I will strike.
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> A priest <b>whose eyes</b> constantly <b>run</b> with tears <b>may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t there a certain</b> priest with this condition <b>in the neighborhood of Rav Huna, and he would spread his hands</b> and recite the Priestly Benediction? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> priest <b>was a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town.</b> Since the other residents were accustomed to seeing him, he would not draw their attention during the Priestly Benediction. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One whose eyes run should not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction, <b>but if he is a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town, he is permitted</b> to do so.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who is blind in one eye may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction because people will gaze at him. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t there a certain</b> priest who was blind in one eye <b>in the neighborhood of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and he would lift his hands</b> and recite the Priestly Benediction? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> priest <b>was a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town,</b> and therefore he would not attract attention during the Priestly Benediction. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is blind in one eye may not lift his hands</b> and recite the Priestly Benediction, <b>but if he is a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town, he is permitted</b> to do so.
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: One whose hands are colored should not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If most of the townspeople are engaged in this occupation,</b> dyeing, <b>he is permitted</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction, as the congregation will not pay attention to his stained hands.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says: I will not pass before the ark</b> to lead the prayer service <b>in colored</b> garments, <b>may not pass</b> before the ark to lead the prayer service <b>even in white</b> garments. There is concern that one who insists on wearing clothing of a specific color during his prayers is a heretic and therefore unfit to lead the service. Similarly, if one says: <b>I will not pass</b> before the ark <b>wearing sandals, he may not pass</b> before it <b>even barefoot,</b> as he is not acting in accordance with the teachings of the Sages.
<b>One who constructs his phylacteries</b> in <b>a round</b> shape exposes himself to <b>danger</b> during times of persecution, when foreign governments impose a ban on the mitzva of phylacteries, <b>and</b> yet he does <b>not</b> fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> to don phylacteries, as phylacteries must be square. <b>If one placed</b> the phylacteries worn on the head <b>on his forehead,</b> and not in its proper place above his hairline, <b>or</b> if he placed the phylacteries worn on the arm <b>on his palm,</b> and not on his biceps, <b>this is the way of the heretics,</b> i.e., those who reject the tradition of the Sages with regard to the proper placement of the phylacteries. If <b>one plated</b> his phylacteries <b>with gold or placed</b> the phylacteries worn on the arm <b>on</b> the outside of <b>his sleeve [<i>unkeli</i>], this is the way of the outsiders,</b> i.e., those who do not take part in the traditions of the Jewish people.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that one who wishes to pray only with white clothes or barefoot is not permitted to lead the prayer? <b>We are concerned that perhaps he has been imbued with heresy,</b> as these are the practices of idolaters. He is therefore barred from leading the service.
We learned in the mishna: <b>One who constructs his phylacteries</b> in <b>a round</b> shape exposes himself to <b>danger and</b> does <b>not</b> fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> to don phylacteries. The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> in this mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The requirement that <b>phylacteries</b> must be <b>square is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. And Rava said</b> about this: Square means <b>along their seams and their diagonals [<i>alakhsonan</i>],</b> i.e., they must be perfectly square. It would seem that all this was already stated in the mishna, which says that round phylacteries are disqualified.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is possible to understand that <b>the mishna</b> is referring to phylacteries <b>that one constructed</b> to be round <b>like a nut,</b> i.e., in the shape of a ball. However, the mishna does not indicate that the phylacteries must be square, as it does not address the case of phylacteries that are rounded but not a true sphere.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one says</b> in his prayers:

Daf 25a

<b>May the good bless You, this is a path of heresy,</b> as heretics divide the world into two domains, good and evil. If one says the following in his prayers: Just as <b>Your mercy is extended to a bird’s nest,</b> as You have commanded us to send away the mother before taking her chicks or eggs (see Deuteronomy 22:6–7), so too extend Your mercy to us; <b>or: May Your name be mentioned with the good;</b> or: <b>We give thanks, we give thanks,</b> twice, he is suspected of heretical beliefs and they <b>silence him.</b>
If <b>one modifies</b> the text while reading the laws of <b>forbidden sexual relations,</b> i.e., he introduces euphemisms out of a sense of propriety, <b>they silence him.</b> Similarly, if <b>one says</b> while translating the verse: <b>“And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21): And <b>you shall not give</b> any of your seed <b>to impregnate an Aramean woman, he is silenced with rebuke.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna cites three instances where the communal prayer leader is silenced. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted,</b> they silence one who repeats: <b>We give thanks, we give thanks, as it appears like</b> he is acknowledging and praying to <b>two authorities. And,</b> granted, <b>they also</b> silence one who says: <b>May Your name be mentioned with the good,</b> as this formulation <b>indicates</b> one is thanking God only <b>for the good and not for the bad, and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Berakhot</i> 54a): <b>One is obligated to bless</b> God <b>for the bad just as he blesses</b> Him <b>for the good. However,</b> in the case of one who recites: Just as <b>Your mercy is extended to a bird’s nest, what is the reason</b> that they silence him?
<b>Two <i>amora’im</i> in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>disagree</b> about <b>this</b> question, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin and Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida. One said</b> that this was <b>because</b> one who says this <b>engenders jealousy among God’s creations,</b> as it appears as though he is indicating that God favored one creature over all others. <b>And one said</b> that saying this is prohibited <b>because one transforms the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed be He, into</b> expressions of <b>mercy, and they are nothing but decrees</b> of the King that must be fulfilled without inquiring into the reasons behind them.
The Gemara relates that <b>a particular</b> individual <b>descended</b> before the ark as prayer leader <b>in the presence of Rabba,</b> and <b>said</b> in his prayers: <b>You have shown mercy to birds,</b> as expressed through the mitzva to chase away the mother bird before taking eggs from its <b>nest; have mercy and pity upon us. You have shown mercy</b> to animals, as expressed through the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>and its offspring</b> on the same day; <b>have mercy and pity upon us. Rabba said: How much does this rabbi know to appease</b> the Lord, <b>his Master! Abaye said to him: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>they silence him?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabba,</b> too, held in accordance with this mishna but merely acted this way because <b>he wanted to hone Abaye’s</b> intellect. Rabba did not make his statement to praise the rabbi, but simply to test his nephew and student, Abaye, and to encourage him to articulate what he knows about the mishna.
With regard to additions to prayers formulated by the Sages, the Gemara relates that <b>a particular</b> individual <b>descended</b> before the ark as prayer leader <b>in the presence of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b> He extended his prayer and <b>said: God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome, the powerful, and the strong, and the fearless.</b>
When he finished, Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: Have you concluded</b> all of <b>the praises of your Master? Even these three</b> praises <b>that we recite:</b> The great, the mighty, and the awesome, <b>had Moses our teacher not written them in the Torah</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and had the members of the Great Assembly not come and incorporated them</b> into the <i>Amida</i> prayer (see Nehemiah 9:32), <b>we would not</b> be permitted to <b>recite them. And you went on and recited all of these. It is comparable to a man who possessed many thousands of golden dinars, yet they were praising him for</b> owning <b>a thousand silver</b> ones. <b>Isn’t that deprecatory toward him?</b> All of the praises one can lavish upon the Lord are nothing but a few silver dinars relative to many thousands of gold dinars. Reciting a litany of praise does not enhance God’s honor.
Tangentially, the Gemara cites an additional statement by Rabbi Ḥanina, concerning principles of faith. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven.</b> Man has free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear</b> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God asks man to fear Him indicates that it is in man’s ability to do so.
The Gemara notes: This proves <b>by inference that fear</b> of Heaven <b>is a minor matter,</b> as the verse is formulated as though God is not asking anything significant. Can it in fact be maintained that fear of Heaven is a minor matter? The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed, for Moses our teacher,</b> fear of Heaven <b>is a minor matter. It is comparable to one who is asked for a large vessel and he has</b> one; <b>it seems to him like a small vessel</b> because he owns it. However, one who is asked for just <b>a small</b> vessel and he does not have one, <b>it seems to him like a large vessel.</b> Therefore, Moses could say: What does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear, because in his eyes it was a minor matter.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: One who</b> repeats himself while reciting <i>Shema</i> and <b>says: Listen</b> Israel, <b>listen</b> Israel, <b>is like one who says: We give thanks, we give thanks.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection:</b> It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> and repeats it, it is reprehensible.</b> One may infer: <b>It is reprehensible,</b> but <b>they do not silence him.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> case, where one repeats <i>Shema</i> and it is reprehensible but they do not silence him, is referring to <b>one who recites and repeats each individual word.</b> In so doing, he ruins the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. However, <b>that</b> case, where Rabbi Zeira holds that they silence one who repeats <i>Shema</i>, is referring to <b>one who recites and repeats an entire verse,</b> as it appears that he is worshipping separate authorities.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And perhaps initially he did not focus his attention</b> on the recitation of <i>Shema</i> and therefore had to repeat it, <b>and now he focused his attention.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Can one have</b> that degree of <b>familiarity with Heaven,</b> to the extent that he can take his words lightly and say them however he likes? <b>If he did not focus his attention, we beat him with a blacksmith’s hammer until he focuses his attention,</b> as conduct of that sort is unacceptable.
We learned in the mishna: If <b>one modifies</b> the text while reading the laws of <b>forbidden sexual relations, they silence him. Rav Yosef taught</b> that this is referring to one who says: <b>The shame of his father and the shame of his mother,</b> instead of: “The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:7).
We learned in the mishna: If <b>one says,</b> while translating the verse: <b>“And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21): And you shall not give any of your seed to impregnate an Aramean woman, he is silenced with rebuke. A Sage <b>from the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> One who translates the verse in this manner maintains that <b>the verse speaks of a Jew who has relations with a gentile woman and fathered from her a son</b> who will be raised to engage in <b>idol worship.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The incident of Reuben,</b> about which it says: “And Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine” (Genesis 35:22), <b>is read</b> from the Torah in public <b>but not translated,</b> so that the uneducated not come to denigrate Reuben. <b>The incident of Tamar</b> (Genesis, chapter 38) <b>is read</b> in public <b>and</b> also <b>translated. The first</b> report of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf,</b> i.e., the Torah’s account of the incident itself (Exodus 32:1–20), <b>is read and translated, but the second</b> narrative, i.e., Aaron’s report to Moses of what had taken place (Exodus 32:21–24) <b>is read but not translated.</b> The verses constituting <b>the Priestly Benediction</b> (Numbers 6:24–26) <b>and the incident of David and Amnon</b> (II Samuel, chapter 13) are <b>read, but not translated.</b>
<b>One may not conclude</b> the Torah reading <b>with</b> by reading from the Prophets <b>the</b> account of the Divine <b>Chariot</b> (Ezekiel, chapter 1), so as not to publicize that which was meant to remain hidden. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> it. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One may not conclude with</b> section from the Prophets beginning with: <b>“Make known to Jerusalem</b> her abominations” (Ezekiel 16:2), because it speaks derogatively of the Jewish people.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (3:31): <b>There are</b> portions of the Bible that are <b>read and translated; there are</b> portions that <b>are read but not translated; and there are</b> portions that <b>are neither read nor translated. The following are read and translated:</b> The Hebrew acronym <b><i>bet</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>tav</i>; <i>ayin</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>; <i>nun</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>heh</i></b> comprise <b>a mnemonic</b> for the sections included in this category, as the Gemara will explain.
The Gemara enumerates the sections indicated by the letters of the mnemonic. The section <b>of the act of Creation [<i>bereshit</i>],</b> alluded to by the letter <i>bet</i>, <b>is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> Why might one think otherwise? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that if the story of the Creation is read in public people <b>will come to ask</b> questions that should not be asked, for instance: <b>What is above and what is below,</b>

Daf 25b

<b>what was before</b> Creation <b>and what is after,</b> i.e., what will be at the end of time, <b>therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the act of Creation is read in public.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The incident of Lot and his two daughters is read and translated.</b> The name Lot begins with a <i>lamed</i>, the second letter of the mnemonic. The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> Why might one think otherwise? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of Abraham,</b> as Lot was his nephew, and therefore the incident casts shame upon Abraham as well, <b>therefore</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The incident of Tamar,</b> beginning with a <i>tav</i>, <b>and Judah is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of Judah, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that there is no such concern. On the contrary, the story <b>is to his credit, as he confessed</b> to his sin.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The first</b> report <b>of the incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf [<i>egel</i>] is read and translated.</b> <i>Egel</i> begins with the letter <i>ayin</i>, the next letter of the mnemonic. The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of the Jewish people, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us that all the more so is it amenable to them</b> that the matter be publicized, <b>so that they will achieve atonement</b> through their shame.
The <i>Tosefta</i> states: <b>The curses [<i>kelalot</i>] and blessings are read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned that perhaps the congregation will become dismayed</b> by the many curses, <b>therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The warnings and punishments [<i>onashin</i>],</b> alluded to in the first <i>nun</i> of the mnemonic mentioned above, <b>are read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that if this section is read aloud, people <b>will come to act out of fear</b> and keep the mitzvot due to the fear of punishment rather than love of God, <b>therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.
It is further taught: <b>The incident of Amnon and Tamar,</b> alluded to in the second <i>nun</i> in the mnemonic mentioned above, <b>is read and translated.</b> Additionally, <b>the incident of Absalom is read and translated,</b> alluded to in the <i>shin</i> of the mnemonic, the third letter of his name. The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of David, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this section is read and translated.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The incident of the concubine [<i>pilegesh</i>] in Gibeah is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this section is read and translated.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: The section of: <b>“Make known [<i>hoda</i>] to Jerusalem her abominations”</b> (Ezekiel 16:2) <b>is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: This is needed <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who held that this chapter may not be read as a <i>haftara</i>, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident with regard to a certain man who was reading</b> the <i>haftara</i> <b>in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> and he read the section of: <b>“Make known to Jerusalem her abominations.”</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Before you examine the abominations of Jerusalem, go and examine the abominations of your</b> own <b>mother.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>they examined his</b> lineage <b>and found him to have a stain of illegitimacy.</b> His mother had engaged in illicit sexual relations, and therefore he was of questionable lineage.
The <i>Tosefta</i> also states: <b>And these</b> sections are <b>read but are not translated.</b> The acrostic composed of the letters <b><i>reish</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>bet</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>nun</i></b> is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the sections included in this category, as the Gemara will explain. The <i>Tosefta</i> states that <b>the incident of Reuben is read but not translated.</b> The name Reuben begins with a <i>reish</i>, the first letter of the mnemonic. And there was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, who went to</b> the village of <b>Kavul, and the sexton of the synagogue was reading: “And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt</b> in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it” (Genesis 35:22). Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to the translator: Stop, translate only the end</b> of the verse. <b>And the Sages praised him</b> for this.
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The second</b> narrative of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf is read but not translated.</b> <i>Egel</i>, the Hebrew word for calf, begins with an <i>ayin</i>, the second letter in the mnemonic. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the second</b> narrative of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf?</b> Aaron’s account of what had taken place, <b>from “And Moses said</b> to Aaron” (Exodus 32:21) <b>until “And Moses saw”</b> (Exodus 32:25).
With regard to Aaron’s account, the Gemara cites that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A person should always be careful in</b> the way he formulates <b>his responses,</b> as sometimes the explanation that a person provides for his actions is worse than the original action itself, <b>as,</b> for example, <b>based on Aaron’s response to Moses, the skeptics renounced</b> their religious beliefs. <b>It is stated</b> in Aaron’s response: <b>“And I cast it into the fire and this calf came forth”</b> (Exodus 32:24). This formulation implies that the calf came from the fire by itself, suggesting that it had divine power and substance.
We learned in the mishna: The verses constituting <b>the Priestly Benediction [<i>birkat kohanim</i>]</b> are <b>read but not translated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains that it is <b>because it is written:</b> “May the Lord <b>lift up</b> His countenance to you” (Numbers 6:26). Listeners may understand this to mean that God shows unfair favoritism to the Jewish people.
We also learned in the mishna: <b>The incident of David and Amnon is neither read nor translated.</b> David’s name begins with a <i>dalet</i>, the next letter in the mnemonic; <i>nun</i>, the last letter of the mnemonic, is the third letter in Amnon’s name. The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t you say</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>the incident of Amnon and Tamar is</b> both <b>read and translated?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of the mishna applies <b>where</b> Amnon’s name <b>is written: Amnon, son of David. That</b> statement of the <i>Tosefta</i> applies <b>where it is written</b> simply as <b>Amnon.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of the verses that are written in the Torah in a coarse manner are read in a refined manner. For example,</b> the term <b>“shall lie with her</b> [<b><i>yishgalena</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:30) is read as though it said <b><i>yishkavena</i>,</b> which is a more refined term. The term <b>“with hemorrhoids [<i>bafolim</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:27) is read <b><i>bateḥorim</i>.</b> The term <b>“doves’ dung [<i>ḥiryonim</i>]”</b> (II Kings 6:25) is read <b><i>divyonim</i>.</b> The phrase <b>“to eat their own excrement [<i>ḥoreihem</i>] and drink their own urine [<i>meimei shineihem</i>]”</b> (II Kings 18:27) is read with more delicate terms: <b>To eat their own excrement [<i>tzo’atam</i>] and drink their own urine [<i>meimei ragleihem</i>].</b>
The term <b>“into latrines [<i>lemoḥra’ot</i>]”</b> (II Kings 10:27) is read as the more refined <b><i>lemotza’ot</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: <i>Lemoḥara’ot</i></b> is read <b>as it is written because it is</b> used here as an expression of <b>contempt for idol worship,</b> and it is therefore permissible to use an indelicate term.
Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman said: All mockery</b> and obscenity <b>is forbidden except for mockery of idol worship, which is permitted, as it is written: “Bel bows down, Nevo stoops”</b> (Isaiah 46:1). The prophet mocks these idols by describing them as crouching in order to defecate. Additionally, <b>it is written: “They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden”</b> (Isaiah 46:2). <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> This principle that one is permitted to mock idol worship is derived <b>from here: “The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread for the calves of Beth-aven; for its people shall mourn over it, and its priests shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it”</b> (Hosea 10:5). <b>Do not read</b> it is as <b>“its glory [<i>kevodo</i>],” rather</b> read it as <b>its burden [<i>keveido</i>],</b> meaning that it is unable to restrain itself from defecating.
<b>Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ said in the name of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika: It is permitted for a Jew to say to a gentile: Take your idol and put it in your <i>shin tav</i>,</b> i.e., <i>shet</i>, buttocks. <b>Rav Ashi said: One whose reputation is tarnished,</b> i.e., he is known as a philanderer, <b>it is permitted to humiliate him</b> by calling him <b><i>gimmel sin</i>,</b> an acronym for <i>girta sarya</i>, son of a putrid harlot. <b>One whose reputation is commendable, it is permitted to</b> publicly <b>praise him, and one who praises him, blessings will rest upon his head.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Residents of a town who sold the town square,</b> which was at times used for public prayer and therefore attained a certain degree of sanctity, may use the proceeds of the sale only to purchase something of a greater degree of sanctity. They may therefore <b>purchase a synagogue with the proceeds</b> of the sale. If they sold <b>a synagogue, they may purchase an ark</b> in which to house sacred scrolls. If they sold <b>an ark, they may purchase wrapping cloths</b> for the sacred scrolls. If they sold <b>wrapping cloths,</b>

Daf 26a

<b>they may purchase scrolls</b> of the Prophets and the Writings. If they sold <b>scrolls</b> of the Prophets and Writings, <b>they may purchase a Torah</b> scroll.
<b>However,</b> the proceeds of a sale of a sacred item may not be used to purchase an item of a lesser degree of sanctity. Therefore, <b>if they sold a Torah</b> scroll, <b>they may not</b> use the proceeds to <b>purchase scrolls</b> of the Prophets and the Writings. If they sold <b>scrolls</b> of the Prophets and Writings, <b>they may not purchase wrapping cloths.</b> If they sold <b>wrapping cloths, they may not purchase an ark.</b> If they sold <b>an ark, they may not purchase a synagogue.</b> If they sold <b>a synagogue, they may not purchase a town square.</b>
<b>And similarly,</b> the same limitation applies <b>to</b> any <b>surplus funds</b> from the sale of sacred items, i.e., if after selling an item and purchasing something of a greater degree of sanctity there remain additional, unused funds, the leftover funds are subject to the same principle and may be used to purchase only something of a degree of sanctity greater than that of the original item.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <b>Residents of a town who sold the town square</b> may purchase a synagogue with the proceeds. Concerning this mishna, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the statement of Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei, cited unattributed. However, the Rabbis say: The town square does not have any sanctity.</b> Therefore, if it is sold, the residents may use the money from the sale for any purpose.
<b>And Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei, what is his reason</b> for claiming that the town square has sanctity? <b>Since the people pray in</b> the town square <b>on</b> communal <b>fast days and on</b> non-priestly <b>watches,</b> it is defined as a place of prayer and as such has sanctity. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> why do they disagree? They maintain <b>that</b> use of the town square <b>is merely an irregular occurrence.</b> Consequently, the town square is not to be defined as a place of prayer, and so it has no sanctity.
§ The mishna states: If they sold <b>a synagogue, they may purchase an ark.</b> The Gemara cites a qualification to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a synagogue of a village,</b> which is considered the property of the residents of that village. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a synagogue of a city, since</b> people <b>come to it from the</b> outside <b>world,</b> the residents of the city <b>are not able to sell it, because it is</b> considered to be the property <b>of the public</b> at large and does not belong exclusively to the residents of the city.
<b>Rav Ashi said: This synagogue of Mata Meḥasya, although</b> people <b>from the</b> outside <b>world come to it, since they come at my discretion,</b> as I established it, and everything is done there in accordance with my directives, <b>if I wish, I can sell it.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani’s statement, from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a synagogue of bronze workers [<i>tursiyyim</i>] that was in Jerusalem, which they sold to Rabbi Eliezer, and he used it for all his</b> own <b>needs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t</b> the synagogue <b>there</b> one <b>of cities,</b> as Jerusalem is certainly classified as a city; why were they permitted to sell it? The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> one <b>was a small synagogue, and</b> it was the bronze workers <b>themselves</b> who <b>built it.</b> Therefore, it was considered exclusively theirs, and they were permitted to sell it.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to leprosy of houses: “And I put the plague of leprosy <b>in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34), from which it may be inferred: <b>“Your possession,”</b> i.e., a privately owned house, <b>can become ritually impure with leprosy, but</b> a house in <b>Jerusalem cannot become ritually impure with leprosy,</b> as property there belongs collectively to the Jewish people and is not privately owned. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard</b> this distinction stated <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the site of the Temple alone,</b> but not with regard to the entire city of Jerusalem.
The Gemara explains: From Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, it is apparent that only the site of the Temple cannot become ritually impure, <b>but synagogues and study halls</b> in Jerusalem <b>can become ritually impure. Why</b> should this be true given <b>that they are</b> owned by the <b>city?</b> The Gemara answers: Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard</b> this distinction stated <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a sacred site,</b> which includes the Temple, synagogues, and study halls.
<b>With regard to what</b> principle do the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree? The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to the tribes,</b> i.e., it was never assigned to any particular tribe, but rather it belongs collectively to the entire nation. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: Jerusalem was apportioned to the tribes,</b> and it is only the site of the Temple itself that belongs collectively to the entire nation.
The Gemara notes: They each follow a different opinion <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>:</b>
One <i>tanna</i> holds that Jerusalem was apportioned to the tribes, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> part of the Temple <b>was in the</b> tribal <b>portion of Judah? The Temple mount, the</b> Temple <b>chambers, and the</b> Temple <b>courtyards. And what was in the</b> tribal <b>portion of Benjamin? The Entrance Hall, the Sanctuary, and the Holy of Holies.</b>
<b>And a strip</b> of land <b>issued forth from the portion of Judah and entered into the portion of Benjamin, and upon</b> that strip <b>the altar was built, and</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin, the righteous, would agonize over it every day</b> desiring <b>to absorb it</b> into its portion, due to its unique sanctity, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ blessing to Benjamin: <b>“He covers it throughout the day,</b> and he dwells between his shoulders” (Deuteronomy 33:12). The phrase “covers it” is understood to mean that Benjamin is continually focused upon that site. <b>Therefore, Benjamin was privileged by becoming the host [<i>ushpizekhan</i>] of the</b> Divine Presence, as the Holy of Holies was built in his portion.
<b>And this</b> other <b><i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to the tribes, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not rent out houses in Jerusalem, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the houses <b>do not belong to</b> those occupying them. Rather, as is true for the entire city, they are owned collectively by the nation. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says: Even beds may not</b> be hired out. <b>Therefore,</b> in the case of the <b>hides of</b> the renter’s <b>offerings</b> that the innkeepers take in lieu of payment, the <b>innkeepers</b> are considered to be <b>taking them by force,</b> as they did not have a right to demand payment.
Apropos the topic of inns, the Gemara reports: <b>Abaye said: Learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is proper etiquette</b> for <b>a person to leave</b> his wine <b>flask and</b> the <b>hide</b> of the animal that he slaughtered <b>at his inn,</b> i.e., the inn where he stayed, as a gift for the service he received.
§ The Gemara returns its discussion of the mishna: <b>Rava said: They taught</b> that there is a limitation on what may be purchased with the proceeds of the sale of a synagogue <b>only when the seven representatives of the town</b> who were appointed to administer the town’s affairs <b>had not sold</b> the synagogue <b>in an assembly of the residents of the town. However,</b> if <b>the seven representatives of the town had sold</b> it <b>in an assembly of the residents of the town,</b> then <b>even</b>

Daf 26b

<b>to drink beer with</b> the proceeds <b>seems well</b> and is permitted. The seven representatives have the authority to annul the sanctity of the synagogue, and therefore the proceeds of its sale do not retain any sanctity.
The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina had a certain</b> piece of land on which stood <b>a mound</b> of the ruins <b>of a synagogue. He came before Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to sowing</b> the land? <b>He said to him: Go, purchase it from the seven representatives of the town in an assembly of the residents of the town, and</b> then you may <b>sow it.</b>
<b>Rami bar Abba was</b> once <b>building a synagogue. There was a certain old synagogue</b> that <b>he wished to demolish, and bring bricks and beams from it, and bring them to there,</b> to construct a new synagogue. <b>He sat and considered that which Rav Ḥisda</b> said, <b>as Rav Ḥisda said: One should not demolish a synagogue until one has built another synagogue.</b> Rami bar Abba reasoned that Rav Ḥisda’s ruling <b>there</b> is <b>due to</b> a concern of <b>negligence,</b> as perhaps after the first synagogue is demolished, people will be negligent and a new one will never be built. However, in <b>a case like this,</b> where the new synagogue is to be built directly from the materials of the old one, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He came before Rav Pappa</b> to ask his opinion, <b>and he prohibited him</b> from doing so. <b>He</b> then came <b>before Rav Huna, and he</b> also <b>prohibited him</b> from doing so.
<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>this synagogue, exchanging it</b> for a different building <b>or selling it</b> for money <b>is permitted,</b> but <b>renting it</b> out <b>or mortgaging it is prohibited. What is the reason</b> for this? When a synagogue is rented out or mortgaged, it <b>remains in its sacred state.</b> Therefore, it is prohibited to rent it out or mortgage it, because it will then be used for a non-sacred purpose. However, if it is exchanged or sold, its sanctity is transferred to the other building or to the proceeds of the sale, and therefore the old synagogue building may be used for any purpose.
The same <i>halakha</i> is <b>also</b> true of the <b>bricks</b> of a synagogue; <b>exchanging them or selling them is permitted,</b> but <b>renting them out is prohibited.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This applies to old</b> bricks that have already been part of a synagogue, <b>but as for new</b> bricks that have only been designated to be used in a synagogue, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it</b> if they are rented out for a non-sacred purpose.
<b>And even according to the one who said</b> that mere <b>designation is significant,</b> i.e., although a certain object was not yet used for the designated purpose, the halakhic ramifications of using it for that purpose already take hold, <b>this applies</b> only in a case where it was created from the outset for that purpose, <b>for example, one who weaves a garment</b> to be used as shrouds <b>for a corpse. However, here</b> the bricks are <b>comparable to</b> already <b>spun</b> thread that was then designated to be used <b>to weave</b> burial shrouds. Concerning such designation, where nothing was specifically created for the designated purpose, <b>there is no one who said</b> that the designation is significant.
<b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about</b> whether it is permitted to give away a synagogue as <b>a gift</b> to then be used for a non-sacred purpose. <b>One</b> of them <b>prohibited</b> it, <b>and</b> the other <b>one permitted</b> it. <b>The one who prohibits</b> it says: Is it possible that <b>with this</b> act of giving alone <b>its sanctity is removed?</b> This cannot be the case. Since the synagogue was not exchanged for anything else, there is nothing to which the sanctity may be transferred. Consequently, the synagogue remains sacred. <b>And the one who permitted</b> it does so because he reasons that <b>if</b> the donor <b>did not</b> receive any <b>benefit from</b> giving the synagogue, <b>he would not have given it.</b> Therefore, <b>the gift has reverted to being like a sale,</b> and the sanctity is transferred to the benefit received.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Articles</b> used in the performance <b>of a mitzva may be thrown out</b> after use. Although these items were used in the performance of a mitzva, they are not thereby sanctified. However, <b>articles</b> associated with the <b>sanctity</b> of God’s name, i.e. articles on which God’s name is written, and articles that serve an article that has God’s name written on it, even after they are no longer used, <b>must be interred</b> in a respectful manner. <b>And these</b> items <b>are</b> considered <b>articles of a mitzva: A <i>sukka</i>; a <i>lulav</i>; a <i>shofar</i>;</b> and <b>ritual fringes. And these</b> items <b>are</b> considered <b>articles of sanctity: Cases</b> of <b>scrolls,</b> i.e. of Torah scrolls; <b>phylacteries; and <i>mezuzot</i>; and a container for a Torah scroll; and a cover for phylacteries; and their straps.</b>
<b>Rava said: Initially, I used to say</b> that <b>this lectern</b> in the synagogue upon which the Torah is read <b>is</b> only <b>an article of an article</b> of sanctity, as the Torah scroll does not rest directly upon the lectern but rather upon the cloth that covers it. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that once an article of an article of sanctity is no longer used, <b>it is permitted</b> to throw it out. However, <b>once I saw that the Torah scroll is</b> sometimes <b>placed</b> directly <b>upon</b> the lectern without an intervening cloth. <b>I said</b> that <b>it is an article</b> used directly for items <b>of sanctity, and</b> as such <b>it is prohibited</b> to simply discard it after use.
<b>And Rava</b> similarly <b>said: Initially, I used to say</b> that <b>this curtain,</b> which is placed at the opening to the ark as a decoration, <b>is</b> only <b>an article of an article</b> of sanctity, as it serves to beautify the ark but is not directly used for the Torah scroll. However, <b>once I saw that</b> sometimes the curtain <b>is folded over and a Torah scroll is placed upon it. I said</b> that <b>it is an article</b> used directly for items <b>of sanctity and</b> as such <b>it is prohibited</b> to simply discard it after use.
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>this ark that has fallen apart, constructing a smaller ark</b> from its materials <b>is permitted,</b> as both have the same level of sanctity, but to use the materials to construct <b>a lectern is prohibited</b> because the lectern has a lesser degree of sanctity. <b>And Rava</b> similarly <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>this curtain</b> used to decorate an ark <b>that has become worn out, to fashion it</b> into <b>a wrapping cloth for</b> Torah <b>scrolls is permitted,</b> but to fashion it into a wrapping cloth <b>for</b> a scroll of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah <b>is prohibited.</b>
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>these cases for</b> storing scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah <b>and sacks for</b> storing Torah <b>scrolls, they are</b> classified as <b>articles of sanctity.</b> Therefore, <b>they are to be interred</b> when they are no longer in use. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that since <b>these</b> items <b>are not made for the honor</b> of the scrolls but rather <b>are made merely to</b> provide <b>protection,</b> they should not be classified as articles of sanctity, Rava therefore <b>teaches us</b> that although they are indeed made to protect the scrolls, they also provide honor and are therefore to be classified as articles of sanctity.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain synagogue of the Jews of Rome that opened out into a room in which a corpse was lying,</b> thereby spreading the ritual impurity of the corpse throughout the synagogue. <b>And the priests wished to enter</b> the synagogue <b>in order to pray there.</b> However, it was prohibited for them to do so because a priest may not come in contact with ritual impurity of a corpse. <b>They came and spoke to Rava,</b> about what to do. <b>He said to them: Lift up the ark and put it down</b> in the opening between the two rooms, <b>as it is a wooden utensil that is designated to rest</b> in one place and not be moved from there, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>a wooden utensil that is designated to rest is not susceptible to ritual impurity, and</b> therefore it <b>serves as a barrier to</b> prevent <b>ritual impurity</b> from spreading.
<b>The Rabbis said to Rava: But isn’t</b> the ark <b>sometimes moved when a Torah scroll is</b> still <b>resting inside it, and</b> therefore <b>it is</b> a utensil that <b>is moved</b> both <b>when it is full and when it is empty;</b> such a utensil is susceptible to ritual impurity and cannot prevent ritual impurity from spreading. He said to them: <b>If so,</b> if it is as you claim, then <b>it is not possible</b> to remedy the situation.
<b>Mar Zutra said:</b> With regard to <b>wrapping cloths of</b> Torah <b>scrolls that have become worn out, they may be made into shrouds for a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>], and this is their</b> most appropriate manner for being <b>interred.</b>
<b>And Rava said: A Torah scroll that became worn out is interred</b> and buried <b>next to a Torah scholar, and</b> in this regard, a Torah scholar is defined <b>even</b> as <b>one who</b> only <b>studies the <i>halakhot</i></b> in the Mishna and the <i>baraitot</i> but is not proficient in their analysis. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: And</b> when it is buried, it is first placed <b>in an earthenware vessel, as it is stated: “And put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for many days”</b> (Jeremiah 32:14).
§ <b>And Rav Pappi said in the name of Rava:</b> To convert a building <b>from a synagogue into a study hall</b> is <b>permitted,</b> but <b>from a study hall into a synagogue</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> as he holds that a study hall has a higher degree of sanctity than a synagogue. <b>And Rav Pappa in the name of Rava teaches the opposite,</b> as he holds that a synagogue has a higher degree of sanctity than a study hall. <b>Rav Aḥa said:</b>

Daf 27a

<b>It stands to reason</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It is permitted</b> for <b>a synagogue to be made</b> into <b>a study hall.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that the opinion of Rav Pappi is correct.
§ <b>Bar Kappara interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt with fire”</b> (II Kings 25:9)? He explained: <b>“The house of the Lord”; this is the Holy Temple. “The king’s house”; these are the king’s palaces [<i>palterin</i>]. “And all the houses of Jerusalem”; as</b> understood in <b>its literal sense.</b> With regard to the final phrase: <b>“And every great house he burnt with fire,” Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> disagree about the meaning of “great house”: <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> It is referring to <b>a place where the Torah is made great,</b> i.e., the study hall; <b>and</b> the other <b>one said:</b> It is referring to <b>a place where prayer is made great,</b> i.e., the synagogue.
The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>The one who said</b> that the reference is to where the <b>Torah</b> is made great bases his opinion on a verse that describes Torah study as great, <b>as it is written: “The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, to make Torah great and glorious”</b> (Isaiah 42:21). <b>And the one who said</b> that the reference is to where <b>prayer</b> is made great bases his opinion on a verse that describes prayer as great, <b>as it is written: “Tell me,</b> I pray you, all <b>the great things that Elisha has done”</b> (II Kings 8:4), <b>and that which Elisha did,</b> i.e., restored a boy to life, <b>he did through prayer.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is the one who said</b> that “great house” is referring to <b>a place where the Torah is made great, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> elsewhere: <b>It is permitted</b> for <b>a synagogue to be made</b> into <b>a study hall.</b> This ruling indicates that he holds that a study hall has a higher degree of sanctity than a synagogue. It is therefore reasonable that he assumes that “great house” is referring specifically to a study hall. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that he was the one who said the term is referring to a place where the Torah is made great.
§ The mishna states: <b>However,</b> if <b>they sold a Torah</b> scroll, <b>they may not</b> use the proceeds to <b>purchase scrolls</b> of the Prophets and the Writings. Similarly, the proceeds of the sale of any sacred item may not be used to purchase an item of a lesser degree of sanctity. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether it is permitted <b>to sell an old Torah scroll</b> in order <b>to purchase a new one?</b> The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: On the one hand, <b>since</b> the proceeds <b>are not raised</b> to a higher degree of sanctity by doing so, maybe <b>it is prohibited; or, perhaps</b> in this case, <b>since there is no</b> possibility of <b>raising</b> it to <b>another, higher</b> degree of sanctity, it <b>seems well</b> and should be permitted?
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the mishna: <b>However, if they sold a Torah</b> scroll, <b>they may not</b> use the proceeds to <b>purchase scrolls</b> of the Prophets and the Writings. One may infer: <b>It is</b> only <b>scrolls</b> of the Prophets and the Writings <b>that may not</b> be purchased with the proceeds, <b>but</b> to purchase a new <b>Torah</b> scroll <b>with</b> the proceeds of an old <b>Torah</b> scroll <b>seems well</b> and is permitted. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>The mishna</b> discusses the <i>halakha</i> that applies only <b>after the fact</b> that a Torah scroll was sold. Perhaps it is only in that case where the proceeds may be used to purchase another Torah scroll. <b>When the dilemma was raised to us,</b> it was with respect to permitting the sale of one Torah scroll in order to purchase another <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A Torah scroll may be rolled up in wrapping cloths</b> that are used for scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah. <b>And</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah may be rolled up <b>in wrapping cloths</b> that are used for scrolls <b>of the Prophets or Writings,</b> since in each case the wrapping cloths are being used for something with a greater degree of sanctity. <b>However,</b> a scroll of <b>the Prophets or Writings may not</b> be rolled up <b>in wrapping cloths</b> that are used for scrolls <b>of one of the five</b> books of the Torah, and scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah <b>may not</b> be rolled up <b>in wrapping cloths</b> that are used <b>for a Torah scroll.</b>
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: A Torah scroll may be rolled up in wrapping cloths</b> that are used for scrolls <b>of one of the five</b> books of the Torah. One may infer: A Torah scroll may be rolled up only in <b>wrapping cloths</b> that are used for scrolls <b>of one of the five</b> books of the Torah; but to roll it up in <b>wrapping cloths of</b> another <b>Torah scroll, no,</b> it is not permitted. By extension, one Torah scroll may certainly not be sold in order to purchase another.
The Gemara rejects the proof: If this inference is valid, one should be able to <b>say the latter clause</b> and make a similar inference from it. The latter clause teaches: <b>And</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah <b>may not</b> be rolled up <b>in wrapping cloths</b> that are used for <b>a Torah scroll.</b> It may be inferred from this that it is prohibited only to roll up scrolls of one of the five books of the Torah in wrapping cloths that are used for a Torah scroll, <b>but</b> to roll up one <b>Torah</b> scroll <b>in</b> the wrapping cloths of another <b>Torah</b> scroll <b>seems well.</b> By extension, one should be permitted to sell a Torah scroll to purchase another. <b>Rather,</b> perforce one must conclude that <b>no</b> inference beyond its basic meaning <b>can be deduced from</b> the <i>baraita</i>, as the inferences are contradictory.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:12): <b>A Torah scroll may be placed upon</b> another <b>Torah</b> scroll, <b>and a Torah</b> scroll may be placed <b>upon</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah, <b>and</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah may be placed <b>upon</b> scrolls of <b>the Prophets or Writings. However,</b> scrolls of <b>the Prophets or Writings may not</b> be placed <b>upon</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah, <b>and</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah <b>may not be placed upon a Torah</b> scroll. From the first clause, it is apparent that one Torah scroll may be used for the sake of another. By extension, it should be permitted to sell one Torah scroll to purchase another.
The Gemara rejects this proof: Can <b>you say</b> a proof from the <i>halakha</i> <b>of placing</b> one Torah scroll upon another? The <i>halakha</i> of <b>placing</b> scrolls upon one another <b>is different, because it is impossible</b> to place them in any other way, as they must be laid one atop the other when placed in the ark. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that it is indeed permitted when in an unavoidable situation, <b>how</b> could we <b>furl</b> a Torah scroll at all? <b>Does</b> one <b>sheet</b> of parchment <b>not rest upon another? Rather, since it is impossible</b> to furl the scroll in any other way, <b>it is permitted. Here too, since it is impossible</b> to place the scrolls in the ark in any other way, <b>it is permitted.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: A person may not sell an old Torah scroll</b> in order <b>to purchase a new one.</b>
The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>There,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, it is prohibited <b>because of</b> a concern for <b>negligence.</b> The old one might be sold and a new one never bought. However, <b>when we speak,</b> it is of a case <b>where</b> the new scroll <b>is</b> already <b>written and waiting to be redeemed</b> immediately with the proceeds of the sale. Therefore, the question remains: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case?
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Meir: A Torah scroll may be sold only</b> if the seller needs the money in order <b>to study Torah or to marry a woman.</b>
<b>Learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that exchanging one entity of <b>Torah,</b> i.e., a Torah scroll, <b>for</b> another entity of <b>Torah,</b> i.e., Torah study, <b>seems well,</b> and by extension, it should be permitted to sell one Torah scroll to purchase another. The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Perhaps</b> Torah <b>study is different, as the study</b> of Torah <b>leads to action,</b> i.e., the fulfillment of the mitzvot, and perhaps it is only due to its great importance of Torah study that it is permitted to sell a Torah scroll for it. Similarly, marrying <b>a woman is also</b> of utmost importance, as it is stated with regard to Creation: <b>“He created it not a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18). This indicates that marrying and having children fulfills a primary goal of Creation. <b>But</b> selling an old <b>Torah</b> in order to buy a new <b>Torah</b> might <b>not</b> be permitted.
On the same topic, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not sell a Torah scroll, even if he does not need it. Furthermore, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Even</b> if a person <b>has nothing to eat, and</b> out of his need <b>he sold a Torah scroll or</b> he sold <b>his daughter</b> to be a maidservant, <b>he never sees a sign of blessing</b> from the proceeds of either sale. Clearly, it is never appropriate to sell a Torah scroll for any purpose.
The mishna states: <b>And similarly,</b> the same limitation applies <b>to</b> any <b>surplus funds</b> from the sale of sacred items. <b>Rava said: They taught</b> that the surplus funds have sanctity <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the community <b>sold</b> a sacred object and then used the proceeds to purchase something with a greater degree of sanctity, <b>and there was</b> money <b>left over. However, if</b> the community <b>collected</b> money from its members in order to purchase a sacred object, <b>and there was</b> extra money <b>left over</b> beyond the price of the object, that extra money <b>is permitted</b> to be used for any purpose, as the money was never sanctified.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> of the mishna <b>said? When they did not</b> explicitly <b>stipulate</b> that they would do with the surplus funds as they see fit. <b>However,</b> if <b>they made</b> such <b>a stipulation,</b> then <b>even</b> to use the money <b>for a <i>dukhsusya</i> is permitted.</b> The Gemara will explain the meaning of the term <i>dukhsusya</i>.
Abaye explains the challenge: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this stipulation? <b>If we say that they sold</b> a sacred object <b>and</b> after using the proceeds to purchase another sacred object <b>there was</b> money <b>left over,</b> then even <b>when they made a stipulation, of what</b> avail <b>is it?</b> How can a stipulation desanctify the money? <b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to a case <b>where they collected</b> money to purchase a sacred object <b>and there was</b> money <b>left over</b> after they made the purchase. In such a case, <b>the reason</b> that it is permitted to use the extra money for any purpose is <b>that they made</b> an explicit <b>stipulation. However, if they did not make a stipulation, no,</b> it would not be permitted.
Rava rejects this argument: <b>Actually,</b> you can explain that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where they sold</b> a sacred object <b>and there was</b> money <b>left over</b> after purchasing a new one, <b>and this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> of the mishna <b>said?</b> In a case <b>where the seven representatives of the town did not</b> explicitly <b>stipulate</b> that they could use the money as they see fit, <b>in an assembly of the residents of the town. However, if the seven representatives of the town made</b> such <b>a stipulation in an assembly of the residents of the town,</b> then <b>even</b> to use the money <b>for a <i>dukhsusya</i> would also be permitted.</b>
<b>Abaye said to one of the Sages who would arrange the Mishna before Rav Sheshet: Did you hear</b> anything <b>from Rav Sheshet</b> with regard to <b>what</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>dukhsusya</i></b> is? <b>He said to him: This is what Rav Sheshet said:</b> It is <b>the town horseman</b> who would serve the townspeople as a sentry and for public dispatches.
The Gemara introduces a parenthetical comment: <b>Abaye said: Accordingly,</b> one can learn from this incident that with regard to <b>this young Torah scholar who has heard something and does not know the meaning</b> of it, <b>he should inquire</b> of its meaning <b>before</b> somebody <b>who is frequently before the Sages, as it is impossible that</b> such a person <b>did not hear</b> something about it <b>from</b> some <b>great man.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> In the case of <b>residents of a town who</b> collectively <b>went to another town and,</b> while there, the charity collectors in that town <b>made them pledge</b> a certain sum for <b>charity, they must give</b> the promised sum to the town’s charity collector, so as not to be suspected of reneging. <b>But when they go</b> home, their money is returned to them, and <b>they bring it</b> back <b>with them, and with it they finance the poor of their</b> own <b>town.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>residents of a town who</b> collectively <b>went to another town and,</b> while there, the local charity collectors <b>made them pledge</b> a certain sum for <b>charity, they must give</b> the promised sum to the town’s charity collector. <b>But when they go</b> home, their money is returned to them, and <b>they bring it</b> back <b>with them. But</b> in the case of <b>an individual who went</b> from his hometown <b>to another town and,</b> while there, the local charity collectors <b>made him pledge</b> a certain sum for <b>charity, he should give it to the poor of that town.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna</b> once <b>decreed a fast day.</b> On the day of the fast, <b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai and all the people of his town came to</b> Rav Huna. A certain sum of <b>charity was imposed upon them and they gave</b> it. <b>When they wanted to go</b> home, <b>they said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>May our Master give to us</b> the charity that we gave, <b>and we will go</b> back, <b>and with it we will finance the poor of our own town.</b>
<b>He said to them: It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the money is returned when the people leave, <b>said? When there is no</b>

Daf 27b

<b>town scholar</b> supervising the handling of the community’s needs, in the town in which the charity was collected. <b>However,</b> if <b>there is a town scholar there,</b> the money <b>should be given to the town scholar,</b> and he may use it as he sees fit. Since, in this case, the money had been given to Rav Huna, the use of the money should be up to his discretion. Rav Huna added: <b>And all the more so</b> in this instance, <b>as both my poor</b> in my town <b>and your</b> poor in your town <b>rely upon me</b> and my collections of charity. Rav Huna was also in charge of distributing charity for the surrounding area. It was certainly proper to leave the money with him, so that he could distribute it among all those in need.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>They may not sell</b> a sacred object <b>belonging to the community to an individual,</b> even if the object will still be used for the same purpose, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> by doing so <b>they downgrade its</b> degree of <b>sanctity,</b> as an item used by fewer people is considered to have a lower degree of sanctity than one used by many; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: If so,</b> by your logic, it should <b>also not</b> be permitted to sell a sacred object <b>from a large town to a small town.</b> However, such a sale is certainly permitted, and therefore it must also be permitted to sell such an object to an individual.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>The Rabbis are saying well to Rabbi Meir,</b> as they provided a rational argument for their opinion. How could Rabbi Meir counter their claim? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Meir</b> holds that when a sacred object is transferred <b>from a large town to a small town,</b> there is no significant downgrade in the degree of sanctity, <b>as at the outset it was sacred</b> for a community and <b>now too it is sacred</b> for a community. But when it is transferred <b>from a community to an individual,</b> there is a significant downgrade in the degree of sanctity, as <b>there is no</b> longer <b>the</b> degree of <b>sanctity</b> that existed beforehand.
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> how could they respond to Rabbi Meir’s claim? <b>If there is</b> cause <b>to be concerned</b> about the decrease in the number of people who will use the object when it is transferred from a community to an individual, then <b>in a case like this as well,</b> where the object is transferred to a smaller community, <b>there</b> should be cause <b>to be concerned</b> about this <b>due to</b> the principle expressed in the verse: <b>“In the multitude of people is the king’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). The verse teaches that the larger the assembly involved in a mitzva, the greater the honor to God. However, it is apparent that this principle does not prevent the sale of a synagogue to a smaller community, and therefore it should not prevent the selling of a synagogue to an individual.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>They may sell a synagogue only with a stipulation that if</b> the sellers so <b>desire it,</b> the buyers <b>will return it</b> to them; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They may sell a synagogue with a permanent sale</b> for any usage, <b>except</b> the following <b>four things,</b> which would be an affront to the synagogue’s previous sanctity: <b>For a bathhouse,</b> where people stand undressed; <b>or for a tannery [<i>burseki</i>],</b> due to the foul smell; <b>for immersion,</b> i.e., to be used as a ritual bath, where people also stand undressed; <b>or for a lavatory. Rabbi Yehuda says: They may sell</b> a synagogue <b>for</b> the generic purpose of <b>serving as a courtyard, and</b> then <b>the buyer may</b> then <b>do</b> with it <b>as he wishes,</b> even if that is one of the above four purposes.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Meir, how may</b> those who purchased the synagogue <b>live in it? Isn’t</b> living there <b>tantamount</b> to taking <b>interest?</b> If the sellers demand the synagogue’s return, the payment given for it would be returned to the buyers. Accordingly, in a broad view of things, that sum of money may be considered as a loan that was given from the buyers to the sellers, until the synagogue was demanded back. The buyers benefited from giving that loan by being able to live in the synagogue building. However, gaining any benefit from a loan is prohibited as interest.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Meir stated</b> his opinion <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said: Uncertain interest,</b> i.e., a transaction that will not certainly result in a situation of interest, <b>is permitted.</b>
In the case of the mishna, the sale might never be undone, and then there would be no loan to speak of. It should therefore be permitted as a case of uncertain interest, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one had a debt of one hundred dinars against his fellow, and</b> the borrower <b>made</b> a conditional <b>sale of his field</b> because he did not have any money to repay the loan, stipulating that if he later comes into the possession of money with which to repay the loan, the field reverts back to his ownership, then <b>as long as the seller</b> of the field <b>consumes the produce</b> of that field, such an arrangement <b>is permitted.</b> If the <b>buyer consumes the produce,</b> the arrangement is <b>prohibited,</b> as if the sale were to be reverted, then the money given for it would be considered a loan from the buyer to the seller, and therefore any benefit the buyer gains due to that loan should be prohibited as interest.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the <b>buyer consumes the produce, it is permitted.</b> Since it is possible that the sale might never be undone, in which case there would be no loan to speak of, it is a case of uncertain interest, which is permitted. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Baitos ben Zunen, who made</b> a conditional <b>sale of his field</b> in a similar arrangement <b>under the direction of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, and the buyer was consuming the produce</b> in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Do you seek to bring <b>a proof from there?</b> In that case, it was actually <b>the seller who was consuming the produce and not the buyer.</b>
The Gemara analyses the dispute: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The permissibility of <b>an uncertain interest</b> agreement <b>is the</b> practical difference <b>between them.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>uncertain interest is permitted and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>uncertain interest is prohibited.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> a different explanation of the dispute: <b>According to everyone, uncertain interest is prohibited, and here</b> it is the question of the permissibility of <b>interest</b> given <b>on the condition that it will be returned</b> that <b>is</b> the practical difference <b>between them.</b> In addition to the arrangement described in the <i>baraita</i>, the parties in this case agreed that the buyer would consume the produce; if the sale would later be reverted, then the buyer would reimburse the seller for the value of the produce. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>interest</b> that is given <b>on condition that it will be returned is permitted;</b> this is because even if the sale is reverted and the sale becomes a loan retroactively, the buyer-lender will not benefit from that loan since he reimbursed the seller-borrower for the value of the produce. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is prohibited.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>And the Rabbis say: They may sell a synagogue with a permanent sale.</b> However, it may not be sold if it will be used for activities that would be an affront to the synagogue’s previous sanctity. The Gemara considers a related <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: It is permitted for a person to urinate within four cubits of</b> where one has just offered <b>a prayer,</b> i.e., one may urinate even in the same place as he prays.
<b>Rav Yosef said: What is he teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They may sell</b> a synagogue for the generic purpose of serving <b>as a courtyard, and the buyer may</b> then <b>do with it as he wishes,</b> even if he wishes to make it into a lavatory. <b>And even the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda, <b>say</b> their ruling <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a synagogue whose sanctity is permanent. However,</b> with regard to the <b>four cubits</b> of where one happened to stand in prayer, <b>whose sanctity is not permanent, no,</b> even the Rabbis would be lenient.
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: One who prayed should distance himself four cubits</b> from where he was standing, <b>and</b> only then <b>may he urinate. And one who urinated should distance himself four cubits, and</b> only then <b>may he pray.</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Granted,</b> the second clause of the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>one who urinated should distance himself four cubits and</b> only then <b>may he pray,</b> makes sense, as <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Berakhot</i> 22b): <b>How far must one distance</b> oneself <b>from</b> urine <b>and excrement? Four cubits.</b>
<b>But</b> the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>one who prayed should distance</b> himself <b>four cubits</b> from where he was standing <b>and</b> only then <b>may he urinate, why should I</b> require this? How could there be such a <i>halakha</i>? <b>If that is so, you have sanctified all the streets of the city of Neharde’a,</b> for people have certainly prayed on every one of its streets. According to this <i>halakha</i>, it should be prohibited to urinate everywhere. The Gemara answers: Emend and <b>teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as saying not that one should distance himself four cubits, but that <b>one should wait the time</b> it takes to walk four cubits.
The Gemara addresses the emended version of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> its second clause, that <b>one who urinated waits the time it takes to walk four cubits</b> and only then may he pray, makes sense. This is <b>due to the droplets</b> of urine that may still be issuing from him; he should wait until they cease entirely. <b>However,</b> with regard to the first clause, that <b>one who prayed should wait the time it takes to walk four cubits</b> and only then may he urinate, <b>why should I</b> require this? <b>Rav Ashi said: Because</b> for <b>all</b> the time it takes to walk <b>four cubits, his prayer is</b> still <b>arranged in his mouth, and his lips are</b> still <b>articulating</b> them.
§ The Gemara cites a series of Sages who explained the reasons they were blessed with longevity and provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device, indicating the order in which the Sages are cited: <b><i>Zayin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>nun</i>.</b> <i>Zayin</i> for Rabbi Zakkai; <i>lamed</i> for Rabbi Elazar; <i>peh</i> for Rabbi Perida; <i>nun</i> for Rabbi Neḥunya.
The Gemara presents the first incident: <b>Rabbi Zakkai was</b> once <b>asked by his disciples: In</b> the merit of <b>which</b> virtue <b>were you</b> blessed with <b>longevity? He said to them: In</b> all <b>my days, I never urinated within four cubits of</b> a place that had been used for <b>prayer. Nor did I</b> ever <b>call my fellow by a nickname. And I never neglected</b> the mitzva of <b>sanctifying the day</b> of Shabbat over wine. I was meticulous about this mitzva to the extent that <b>I had an elderly mother,</b> and <b>once,</b> when I did not have wine, <b>she sold the kerchief that was on her head, and</b> from the proceeds <b>she brought me</b> wine upon which to do the mitzva of <b>sanctifying the day.</b>
<b>It was taught</b> concerning Rabbi Zakkai: <b>When</b> his mother <b>died, she left him three hundred barrels of wine. When he died, he left his sons three thousand barrels of wine.</b> Since they were so meticulous in the mitzva of sanctifying the day of Shabbat with wine, God rewarded them with wealth and an abundance of wine.
In a related incident, it once happened that <b>Rav Huna was girded with</b> a piece of <b>straw [<i>rita</i>] and was standing before Rav.</b> Rav <b>said to him: What is this?</b> Why are you dressed in this way? <b>He said</b> to him: <b>I had no</b> wine for <b>sanctifying</b> the day of Shabbat, <b>so I pawned my belt [<i>hemyanai</i>], and with</b> the proceeds <b>I brought</b> wine for <b>sanctifying</b> the day. Rav <b>said to him: May it be</b> God’s <b>will</b> that <b>you be enveloped in silk [<i>shira’ei</i>]</b> in reward for such dedication.
<b>When Rabba, his son, was married, Rav Huna,</b> who <b>was a short man, was lying on</b> his <b>bed,</b> and owing to his diminutive size he went unnoticed. <b>His daughters and daughters-in-law came</b> into the room and <b>removed and threw their</b> silk <b>garments upon him until he was</b> entirely <b>enveloped in silk.</b> With this, Rav’s blessing was fulfilled to the letter. When <b>Rav heard</b> about this, <b>he became angry</b> with Rav Huna, and <b>said: What is the reason</b> that <b>when I blessed you, you did not</b> respond in kind and <b>say to me: And likewise to</b> the <b>Master?</b> Had you done so, I would have also benefitted from the blessing.
The Gemara discusses the second occasion where a Sage explained his longevity: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua was</b> once <b>asked by his disciples: In</b> the merit of <b>which</b> virtue <b>were you</b> blessed with <b>longevity? He said to them: In</b> all <b>my days, I never made a shortcut through a synagogue. Nor did I</b> ever <b>stride over</b> the <b>heads of</b> the <b>sacred people,</b> i.e., I never stepped over people sitting in the study hall in order to reach my place, so as not to appear scornful of them. <b>And I never raised my hands</b> in the Priestly Benediction <b>without</b> reciting <b>a blessing</b> beforehand.
On the third occasion, <b>Rabbi Perida was</b> once <b>asked by his disciples: In</b> the merit of <b>which</b> virtue <b>were you</b> blessed with <b>longevity? He said to them: In</b> all <b>my days, no person</b> ever arrived <b>before me to the study hall,</b> as I was always the first to arrive.

Daf 28a

<b>And I never recited</b> Grace after Meals <b>in the presence of a priest,</b> but rather I gave him the privilege to lead. <b>And I never ate from an animal whose</b> priestly <b>portions,</b> i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, <b>had not</b> already <b>been set aside.</b>
Another example of Rabbi Perida’s meticulous behavior is based on that <b>which Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is prohibited to eat</b> meat <b>from an animal whose</b> priestly <b>portions have not been set aside. And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who eats</b> meat <b>from an animal whose</b> priestly <b>portions have not been set aside is</b> regarded <b>as if he were eating untithed produce.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his</b> opinion. Rather, it is permitted to eat meat from such an animal. Nevertheless, Rabbi Perida acted stringently and did not eat from it.
The Gemara considers another of Rabbi Perida’s actions: He said: <b>And I never blessed</b> Grace after Meals <b>in the presence of a priest,</b> but rather I gave him the privilege to lead.
<b>Is this to say that</b> doing so <b>is</b> especially <b>virtuous? But</b> hasn’t <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any Torah scholar who</b> allows someone else <b>to bless</b> Grace after Meals <b>in his presence,</b> i.e., to lead for him, <b>even</b> if that person is <b>a High Priest who is an ignoramus,</b> then <b>that Torah scholar is liable to</b> receive the <b>death penalty</b> for belittling his own honor? This is <b>as it is stated: “All those who hate me, love death”</b> (Proverbs 8:36). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“those who hate Me [<i>mesan’ai</i>],” rather</b> read it as though it said: <b>Those who make Me hated [<i>masni’ai</i>].</b> The honor due to a Torah scholar is representative of the honor of God in the world. Therefore, by belittling his own honor, he causes others to fail to respect God, which can ultimately develop into hate. If so, why did Rabbi Perida consider his behavior to be so deserving of praise?
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> Rabbi Perida <b>says this,</b> he was speaking <b>of</b> people of <b>equal</b> stature. He was particular to honor the priesthood only when the priest was also a Torah scholar.
The Gemara discusses the fourth Sage who was blessed with longevity: <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana was</b> once <b>asked by his disciples: In</b> the merit of <b>which</b> virtue <b>were you</b> blessed with <b>longevity? He said to them: In</b> all <b>my days, I never attained veneration at</b> the expense of <b>my fellow’s degradation. Nor did my fellow’s curse</b> ever <b>go up with me upon my bed.</b> If ever I offended someone, I made sure to appease him that day. Therefore, when I went to bed I knew that no one had any grievances against me. <b>And I was</b> always <b>openhanded with my money.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the meaning of his statement: Rabbi Neḥunya said: <b>I never attained veneration at</b> the expense of <b>my fellow’s denigration.</b> This is referring to conduct <b>such as that of Rav Huna, who was carrying a hoe over his shoulder</b> as he returned from his work. <b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai came and,</b> out of respect for his teacher, <b>took the hoe from him</b> to carry it for him. Rav Huna <b>said to him: If you are accustomed to carry</b> such objects <b>in your own city,</b> you may <b>carry it; but if not,</b> then <b>for me to be venerated through your denigration is not pleasing for me.</b>
Rabbi Neḥunya also said: <b>Nor did</b> I ever allow the resentment caused by <b>my fellow’s curse</b> to <b>go up with me upon my bed.</b> This is referring to conduct <b>such as that of Mar Zutra. When he would go to bed</b> at night, <b>he would</b> first <b>say: I forgive anyone who has vexed me.</b>
Lastly, Rabbi Neḥunya said: <b>And I was</b> always <b>openhanded with my money.</b> This is referring to conduct such as <b>that which the Master said: Job was openhanded with his money, as he would</b> always <b>leave</b> at least <b>a <i>peruta</i> of his money with the shopkeeper.</b> He never demanded the change from his transactions.
On a similar occasion, <b>Rabbi Akiva asked Rabbi Neḥunya the Great; he said to him: In</b> the merit of <b>which</b> virtue <b>were you</b> blessed with <b>longevity?</b> Rabbi Neḥunya’s <b>attendants [<i>gavzei</i>] came and</b> started <b>beating</b> Rabbi Akiva, for they felt that he was acting disrespectfully by highlighting Rabbi Neḥunya’s old age. Rabbi Akiva ran away from them, and <b>he climbed up and sat upon the top of a date palm.</b> From there, <b>he said to</b> Rabbi Neḥunya: <b>My teacher,</b> I have a question about the verse concerning the daily offering that states “one lamb” (Numbers 28:4). <b>If it is stated “lamb”</b> in the singular, <b>why is it</b> also <b>stated “one”;</b> isn’t this superfluous? Upon hearing Rabbi Akiva’s scholarly question, Rabbi Neḥunya <b>said to</b> his attendants: <b>He is</b> clearly <b>a young Torah scholar, let him be.</b>
Rabbi Neḥunya then addressed Rabbi Akiva’s questions. With regard to the second question, <b>he said to him:</b> The word <b>“one”</b> teaches that the lamb should be <b>the unique one of its flock,</b> i.e., only the best quality lamb should be used.
With regard to the original question, Rabbi Neḥunya <b>said to him: In</b> all <b>my days I never accepted gifts. Nor was I</b> ever <b>inflexible</b> by exacting <b>a measure</b> of retribution against those who wronged me. <b>And I was</b> always <b>openhanded with my money.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>I never accepted gifts;</b> this is referring to conduct <b>such as that of Rabbi Elazar. When they would send him gifts from the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, he would not take</b> them, <b>and when they would invite him, he would not go</b> there, as he considered hospitality to be a type of gift. <b>He</b> would <b>say to them: Is it not pleasing to you that I should live, as it is written: “He that hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27)? In contrast, it was reported about <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> that <b>when they would send him</b> gifts <b>from the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, he would not accept</b> them, <b>but when they would invite him, he would go</b> there. <b>He said: They are honored by my</b> presence; therefore my visiting is not considered like I am taking a gift from them.
He also said: <b>Nor was I</b> ever <b>inflexible</b> in exacting <b>a measure</b> of retribution against those who wronged me. This is referring to conduct such as that <b>which Rava said: Anyone who overlooks</b> exacting <b>a measure</b> of retribution against those who wronged him, <b>all his transgressions are removed from him, as it is stated: “He pardons iniquity and overlooks transgression”</b> (Micah 7:18), which is homiletically read as saying: <b>For whom does He pardon iniquity? For he who overlooks transgressions</b> that others have committed against him.
In a similar incident, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi once <b>asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: In</b> the merit of <b>which</b> virtue <b>were you</b> blessed with <b>longevity? He said to him:</b> Why do you ask me, <b>are you wearied of my</b> long <b>life?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: My teacher, it is Torah and</b> so <b>I must learn</b> it. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa <b>said to him: In</b> all <b>my days I never gazed at the likeness of a wicked man, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is prohibited for a person to gaze in the image of the likeness of a wicked man, as it is stated</b> that the prophet Elisha said to Jehoram king of Israel: <b>“Were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judea, I would not look toward you, nor see you”</b> (II Kings 3:14).
<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> One who gazes at the likeness of an evil man, <b>his eyes become dim, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see”</b> (Genesis 27:1). This happened <b>because he gazed at the wicked Esau.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Did this cause</b> Isaac’s blindness? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak say: A curse of an ordinary person should not be lightly regarded in your eyes, because Abimelech cursed Sarah, and</b> although he was not a righteous man, his curse <b>was</b> nevertheless <b>fulfilled,</b> albeit <b>in her descendant. As it is stated</b> that Abimelech said to Sarah with regard to the gift that he gave to Abraham: <b>“Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes”</b> (Genesis 20:16). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“a covering [<i>kesut</i>]</b> of the eyes,” but <b>rather</b> read it as: <b>A blindness [<i>kesiat</i>] of the eyes.</b> Abimelech’s words were a veiled curse for Sarah to suffer from blindness. While she herself did not suffer, the curse was apparently fulfilled in the blindness of her son, Isaac.
According to Rabbi Yitzḥak, Abimelech’s curse was the cause of Isaac’s blindness, and it was not, as Rabbi Elazar suggested, the fact he gazed at Esau. The Gemara explains: Both <b>this and that</b> jointly <b>caused it. Rava said:</b> The prohibition against gazing at the likeness of a wicked person is derived <b>from here: “It is not good to raise the face of the wicked”</b> (Proverbs 18:5).
<b>At the time of</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa’s <b>departure</b> from this world, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: My teacher, bless me. He said to him: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that you</b> live to <b>reach to half of my days.</b> When Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi heard this, he asked in astonishment: Are you saying that <b>to the entirety of</b> your days I should <b>not</b> reach? Why? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa <b>said to him: Shall those who come after you</b> just <b>tend cattle?</b> If you live as long as me, your sons will never be able to succeed you in the position of Nasi. As such, they will never achieve greatness in Torah, and it will be as if they just tended cattle throughout their lives. It is therefore better that your life not be so prolonged, so that they have the opportunity to rise to eminence.
<b>Avuh bar Ihi and Minyamin bar Ihi</b> both spoke on this topic: <b>One</b> of them <b>said: May</b> a blessing <b>come to me for I never gazed at</b> a wicked <b>gentile. And</b> the other <b>one said: May</b> a blessing <b>come to me for I never formed a partnership with</b> a wicked <b>gentile,</b> so as not to have any association with a wicked person.
The Gemara presents a similar incident: <b>Rabbi Zeira was</b> once <b>asked by his disciples: In</b> the merit of <b>which</b> virtue <b>were you</b> blessed with <b>longevity? He said to them: In</b> all <b>my days, I was never angry inside my house</b> with members of my household who acted against my wishes. <b>Nor did I</b> ever <b>walk ahead of someone who was a greater</b> Torah scholar <b>than me. Nor did I</b> ever <b>meditate</b> upon words of Torah <b>in filthy alleyways,</b> as doing so is a disgrace to the Torah. <b>Nor did I</b> ever <b>walk four cubits without</b> meditating on words of <b>Torah or without</b> wearing <b>phylacteries. Nor did I</b> ever <b>sleep in a study hall, neither a deep sleep or a brief nap. Nor did I</b> ever <b>rejoice when my fellow stumbled. Nor did I</b> ever <b>call my fellow by his derogatory nickname [<i>ḥanikhato</i>]. And some say</b> that he said: I never called my fellow by <b>his nickname [<i>ḥakhinato</i>],</b> i.e., even one that is not derogatory.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And Rabbi Yehuda said further: A synagogue that fell into ruin</b> still may not be used for a mundane purpose. Therefore, <b>one may not eulogize in it. And nor may one stretch out</b> and repair <b>ropes in it.</b> The wide expanse of the synagogue would have been particularly suitable for this. <b>And nor may one spread</b> animal <b>traps within it. And nor may one spread out produce upon its roof</b> to dry. <b>And nor may one make it</b> into <b>a shortcut.</b>
The <i>halakha</i> that a synagogue in disrepair still may not be used for mundane purposes is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And I will bring desolation to your sanctuaries”</b> (Leviticus 26:31). The fact that the word “sanctuaries” appears after the word “desolation” indicates that <b>their sanctity</b> remains upon them <b>even when they are desolate.</b>
However, if <b>grass sprang up</b> of its own accord <b>in</b> the ruined synagogue, although it is not befitting its sanctity, <b>one should not pick</b> it, <b>due to</b> the <b>anguish</b> that it will bring to those who see it. It will remind them of the disrepair of the synagogue and the need to rebuild it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>synagogues: One may not act inside them with frivolity.</b> Therefore, <b>one may not eat in them; nor may one drink in them;</b>

Daf 28b

<b>and one may not adorn oneself inside them; nor may one wander about inside them; nor may one enter them in the sun</b> for protection <b>from the sun, or in the rain</b> to find shelter <b>from the rain; nor may one offer a eulogy inside them for an individual,</b> which is a private event. <b>However, one may read</b> the Bible <b>inside them, and one may study</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>inside them, and one may offer a eulogy inside them for</b> a Torah scholar, if <b>the public</b> attends the eulogy.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> does this apply? <b>When</b> the synagogues are <b>occupied</b> by the people using them. <b>But when they are in</b> a state of <b>ruin, they should be left alone</b> so that <b>grass will sprout up inside them. And</b> that grass <b>should not be picked</b> and removed, <b>due to</b> the <b>anguish</b> that it will bring to those who see it. It will remind them of the disrepair of the synagogue and the need to rebuild it.
The Gemara asks: Why did Rabbi Yehuda discuss the <i>halakha</i> about <b>grass? Who mentioned</b> anything <b>about it?</b> The Gemara explains: The text of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: And</b> among the other things that may be done in synagogues, <b>they should</b> also be sure to <b>sweep them and</b> to <b>sprinkle</b> their floors with water, <b>in order that grass not sprout up in them. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> does this apply? <b>When</b> the synagogues are <b>occupied</b> by the people using them, <b>but when they are in</b> a state of <b>ruin, they should be left alone</b> so that grass <b>will sprout up inside them.</b> If <b>grass did sprout up, it should not be removed, due to</b> the <b>anguish</b> that this will bring to those who see it.
<b>Rav Asi said: Synagogues in Babylonia are built</b> from the outset <b>with a stipulation</b> that they not have the full sanctity of a synagogue, in order that it be permitted to use them for the community’s general needs. <b>But nevertheless,</b> one <b>should not act inside them with frivolity.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>this?</b> One should not make business <b>calculations</b> in a synagogue.
<b>Rav Asi said:</b> With regard to <b>a synagogue in which</b> people <b>make</b> business <b>calculations, they will</b> eventually <b>keep a corpse inside it overnight.</b> The Gemara questions the wording of this dictum: <b>Can it</b> really <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>they will</b> ever actually <b>keep a corpse inside it overnight?</b> Could it really be that <b>there will not be any other alternative? Rather,</b> Rav Asi means that as a punishment for acting with frivolity people in the community will die, including those who have no family, and so <b>ultimately they will</b> have to <b>keep a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>] overnight</b> in the synagogue.
§ The <i>baraita</i> taught: <b>And one may not adorn oneself inside them. Rava said:</b> The prohibition applies only to laypeople, but <b>Torah scholars and their disciples are permitted</b> to do so, <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b><i>Bei</i> of the Sages,</b> which is used to describe a study hall? It is a shortened form of <b>house [<i>beita</i>] of the Sages.</b> In order to facilitate the constant presence of the Torah scholars in the study hall, it is permitted for them to use the hall as though it were their home.
The <i>baraita</i> continued: <b>And nor may one enter them in the sun</b> for protection <b>from the sun, or in the rain</b> to find shelter <b>from the rain.</b> The Gemara explains: This <b>is similar to that</b> case of <b>Ravina and Rav Adda bar Mattana. They were standing and asking a question of Rava,</b> when <b>a shower [<i>zilḥa</i>] of rain began</b> to fall upon them. <b>They</b> all <b>entered the synagogue, saying: Our having entered the synagogue is not due to the rain,</b> that we stay dry; <b>rather, it is due to</b> the fact that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> we were discussing <b>requires clarity like the day the north wind [<i>istena</i>]</b> blows and the sky is perfectly clear. Therefore, we are entering the synagogue for the sake of studying Torah, which is certainly permitted.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: If a person needs to summon an individual from</b> inside <b>a synagogue, what</b> should he do, since it is not permitted to enter a synagogue just for that purpose? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If he is a young Torah scholar, let him recite a <i>halakha</i></b> upon entering the synagogue; <b>and if he is a <i>tanna</i></b> who memorizes large numbers of <i>mishnayot</i>, <b>let him recite</b> various <b><i>mishnayot</i>; and if he is an expert in</b> the <b>Bible, let him recite a verse; and if</b> he is <b>not</b> able to do even this, <b>let him say to a child: Recite for me a verse</b> that you have learned today. <b>Alternatively, he should remain</b> in the synagogue <b>for a short</b> time <b>and</b> only afterward <b>stand up</b> and leave.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And one may offer a eulogy inside them for</b> a Torah scholar if <b>the public</b> attends the eulogy. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of a eulogy for the public? Rav Ḥisda depicted</b> a case: <b>For example, a eulogy</b> for a Torah scholar <b>at which Rav Sheshet is present.</b> Owing to his presence, many people will come. <b>Rav Sheshet</b> himself <b>depicted</b> another case: <b>For example, a eulogy at which Rav Ḥisda is present.</b>
The Gemara offers another example: <b>Rafram</b> once <b>eulogized his daughter-in-law inside a synagogue. He said: Due to my honor and</b> the honor <b>of the deceased, everyone will come</b> to the eulogy. It will consequently be a public event, and it is therefore permitted to hold it in a synagogue. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> once <b>eulogized a certain Sage inside a synagogue. He said: Whether due to my honor, or whether due to the honor of the deceased, everyone will come</b> to the eulogy.
<b>Reish Lakish</b> once <b>eulogized a certain young Torah scholar who was frequently</b> present <b>in Eretz Yisrael and who used to study <i>halakha</i> in the twenty-fourth row</b> of the study hall. He sat so far back because he was not one of the principal scholars. Nevertheless, when he died, Reish Lakish <b>said: Alas, Eretz Yisrael has lost a great man.</b>
In contrast, there was <b>a certain man who used to study <i>halakha</i>, the <i>Sifra</i>, and the <i>Sifrei</i>, and the <i>Tosefta</i>, and he died.</b> People <b>came and said to Rav Naḥman: Let the Master eulogize him. He said</b> to them: <b>How can I eulogize him?</b> Should I say: <b>Alas, a basket filled with books is lost?</b> This would not be true. Although the man studied many areas of Torah, he was not proficient in them.
The Gemara compares the conduct of Reish Lakish in Eretz Yisrael to that of Rav Naḥman in Babylonia. <b>Come</b> and <b>see what</b> the difference is <b>between the harsh</b> scholars <b>of Eretz Yisrael and the saintly ones of Babylonia.</b> Although Reish Lakish was known for his harsh nature, he was still more respectful than Rav Naḥman, who was known for his saintliness.
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Avot</i> 1:13): <b>And one who makes use of the crown [<i>taga</i>]</b> of Torah learning <b>will perish</b> from the world. <b>Reish Lakish taught: This</b> is referring to <b>one who</b> allows himself to be <b>served by one who studies <i>halakhot</i>,</b> which is <b>the crown of the Torah.</b>
<b>And Ulla said:</b> It is better that <b>a person should be served by one who studies four</b> orders of the Mishna, <b>and he should not</b> allow himself to <b>be served by one who teaches</b> to others <b>four</b> orders of the Mishna, <b>as in that</b> case <b>of Reish Lakish. He was traveling along the road</b> when <b>he reached</b> a deep <b>puddle of water. A certain man came</b> and <b>placed him upon his shoulders and</b> began <b>transferring him</b> to the other side. Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Have you read</b> the Bible? <b>He said to him: I have read</b> it. He then asked: <b>Have you studied</b> the Mishna? He answered him: <b>I have studied four orders of the Mishna.</b> Reish Lakish then <b>said to him: You have hewn</b> these <b>four mountains and</b> yet <b>you bear the weight of the son of Lakish upon your shoulders?</b> It is inappropriate for you to carry me; <b>throw the son of Lakish into the water.</b>
The man <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>It is pleasing for me to serve the Master</b> in this way. Reish Lakish said to him: <b>If so, learn from me this matter that Rabbi Zeira said.</b> In this way you will be considered my disciple, and it will then be appropriate for you to serve me. <b>Jewish women were strict upon themselves in that even if they see a spot of</b> menstrual <b>blood</b> that is only the size <b>of a mustard seed they wait on its account seven clean</b> days before immersing themselves in a ritual bath to purify themselves.
<b>The school of Eliyahu taught: Anyone who studies <i>halakhot</i></b> every day, <b>he is guaranteed that he is destined for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “His ways [<i>halikhot</i>] are eternal”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6): <b>Do not read</b> the verse as <b><i>halikhot</i> [ways]; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>halakhot</i>.</b> Consequently, the verse indicates that the study of the <i>halakhot</i> brings one to eternal life.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 29a

<b>One interrupts</b> his <b>Torah study to carry out the dead</b> for burial <b>and to escort a bride</b> to her wedding. <b>They said about Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, that he would interrupt</b> his <b>Torah study to carry out the dead</b> for burial <b>and to escort a bride</b> to her wedding. The Gemara qualifies this ruling: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Only <b>where there are not sufficient</b> numbers of other people available to perform these mitzvot and honor the deceased or the bride appropriately. <b>However,</b> when <b>there are sufficient</b> numbers, additional people <b>should not interrupt</b> their Torah study to participate.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how many</b> people <b>are</b> considered <b>sufficient? Rav Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: Twelve thousand men and</b> another <b>six thousand</b> men to blow <b>horns</b> as a sign of mourning. <b>And some say</b> a different version: <b>Twelve thousand men, among whom are six thousand</b> men with <b>horns. Ulla said: For example,</b> enough <b>to make a procession of people</b> all the way <b>from the</b> town <b>gate [<i>abbula</i>] to the place of burial.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet said: As</b> the Torah <b>was given, so it</b> should be <b>taken away,</b> i.e., the same honor that was provided when the Torah was given at Mount Sinai should be provided when the Torah is taken through the passing away of a Torah scholar. <b>Just as</b> the Torah <b>was given in the presence of six hundred thousand</b> men, <b>so too its taking</b> should be done <b>in the presence of six hundred thousand</b> men. The Gemara comments: <b>This applies to someone who read</b> the Bible <b>and studied</b> <i>halakhot</i> for himself. <b>But for someone who taught</b> others, <b>there is no limit</b> to the honor that should be shown to him.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Come and see how beloved the Jewish people are before the Holy One, Blessed be He. As every place they were exiled, the Divine Presence</b> went <b>with them. They were exiled to Egypt,</b> and <b>the Divine Presence</b> went <b>with them, as it is stated: “Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt?”</b> (I Samuel 2:27). <b>They were exiled to Babylonia,</b> and <b>the Divine Presence</b> went <b>with them, as it is stated: “For your sake I have sent to Babylonia”</b> (Isaiah 43:14). <b>So too, when, in the future, they will be redeemed, the Divine Presence will be with them, as it is stated: “Then the Lord your God will return with your captivity”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:3). <b>It does not state: He will bring back,</b> i.e., He will cause the Jewish people to return, <b>but rather</b> it says: <b>“He will return,”</b> which <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will return</b> together <b>with them from among the</b> various <b>exiles.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Where in Babylonia</b> does the Divine Presence reside? <b>Abaye said: In the</b> ancient <b>synagogue of Huzal and in the synagogue that was destroyed and rebuilt in Neharde’a. And do not say</b> that the Divine Presence resided <b>here and there,</b> i.e., in both places simultaneously. <b>Rather, at times</b> it resided <b>here</b> in Huzal <b>and at times there</b> in Neharde’a. <b>Abaye said: I have</b> a blessing <b>coming to me, for whenever I am</b> within <b>a distance of a parasang</b> from one of those synagogues, <b>I go in and pray there,</b> due to the special honor and sanctity attached to them. It was related that <b>the father of Shmuel and Levi were</b> once <b>sitting in the synagogue that was destroyed and rebuilt in Neharde’a. The Divine Presence came</b> and <b>they heard a loud sound,</b> so <b>they arose and left.</b>
It was further related that <b>Rav Sheshet was</b> once <b>sitting in the synagogue that was destroyed and rebuilt in Neharde’a,</b> and <b>the Divine Presence came but he did not go out. The ministering angels came and were frightening him</b> in order to force him to leave. Rav Sheshet turned to God and <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> if one is <b>wretched and</b> the other is <b>not wretched, who should defer to whom?</b> Shouldn’t the one who is not wretched give way to the one who is? Now I am blind and wretched; why then do you expect me to defer to the angels? God then turned to the angels and <b>said to them: Leave him.</b>
The verse states: <b>“Yet I have been to them as a little sanctuary</b> in the countries where they have come” (Ezekiel 11:16). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This</b> is referring to <b>the synagogues and study halls in Babylonia. And Rabbi Elazar said: This</b> is referring to <b>the house of our master,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>in Babylonia,</b> from which Torah issues forth to the entire world.
<b>Rava interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Lord, You have been our dwelling place</b> in all generations” (Psalms 90:1)? <b>This</b> is referring to <b>the synagogues and study halls. Abaye said: Initially, I used to study</b> Torah <b>in</b> my <b>home and pray in the synagogue. Once I heard</b> and understood <b>that which</b> King <b>David says: “Lord, I love the habitation of Your house”</b> (Psalms 26:8), <b>I would</b> always <b>study</b> Torah <b>in the synagogue,</b> to express my love for the place in which the Divine Presence resides.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar says: In the future, the synagogues and the study halls in Babylonia will be</b> transported and <b>reestablished in Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “Surely, like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come”</b> (Jeremiah 46:18). There is a tradition that these mountains came to Sinai at the giving of the Torah and demanded that the Torah should be given upon them. <b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred through an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> argument: <b>Just as Tabor and Carmel, which came only momentarily to study Torah, were</b> relocated and <b>established in Eretz Yisrael</b> in reward for their actions, <b>all the more so</b> should <b>the synagogues and study halls</b> in Babylonia, <b>in which the Torah is read and disseminated,</b> be relocated to Eretz Yisrael.
<b>Bar Kappara interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Why do you look askance [<i>teratzdun</i>], O high-peaked mountains,</b> at the mountain that God has desired for His abode” (Psalms 68:17)? <b>A Divine Voice issued forth and said to</b> all the mountains that came and demanded that the Torah be given upon them: <b>Why do you seek [<i>tirtzu</i>]</b> to enter into <b>a legal dispute [<i>din</i>] with</b> Mount <b>Sinai? You are all blemished in comparison to</b> Mount <b>Sinai,</b> as <b>it is written here: “High-peaked [<i>gavnunnim</i>]” and it is written there,</b> with regard to the blemishes that disqualify a priest: <b>“Or crookbacked [<i>gibben</i>] or a dwarf”</b> (Leviticus 21:20). <b>Rav Ashi said: Learn from</b> this that <b>one who is arrogant is</b> considered <b>blemished.</b> The other mountains arrogantly insisted that the Torah should be given upon them, and they were therefore described as blemished.
§ The mishna teaches that even if a synagogue fell into ruin, <b>it may not be made</b> into <b>a <i>kappendarya</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b><i>kappendarya</i>? Rava said: A shortcut, as</b> implied by <b>its name.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> do you mean by adding: <b>As</b> implied by <b>its name?</b> It is <b>like one who said: Instead of going around the</b> entire row of <b>houses [<i>makkifna addari</i>]</b> to get to the other side, thereby lengthening my journey, <b>I will enter this</b> house and walk through it to the other side. The word <i>kappendarya</i> sounds like a contraction of <i>makkifna addari</i>. This is what Rava meant by saying: As implied by its name.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: If</b> a public <b>path had initially</b> passed through that location, before the synagogue was built, <b>it is permitted</b> to continue to use it as a shortcut, for the honor due to a synagogue cannot annul the public’s right of access to the path.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> With regard to <b>one who enters</b> a synagogue <b>without intending to make it</b> into <b>a shortcut,</b> when he leaves <b>he is permitted to make it</b> into <b>a shortcut</b> for himself, by leaving through the exit on the other side of the building. <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>one who enters a synagogue to pray, he is permitted to make it</b> into <b>a shortcut</b> for himself by leaving through a different exit, and it is fitting to do so, <b>as it is stated: “And when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the appointed seasons, he that enters by way of the north gate to bow down shall go forth by the way of the south gate”</b> (Ezekiel 46:9). This indicates that it is a show of respect not to leave through the same entrance through which one came in; it is better to leave through the other side.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>grass sprang up in</b> a ruined synagogue, although it is not befitting its sanctity, <b>one should not pick</b> it, <b>due to</b> the <b>anguish</b> that it will cause to those who see it. It will remind them of the disrepair of the synagogue and the need to rebuild it. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not pick</b> the grass <b>and feed</b> it to one’s animals, <b>but he may pick</b> it <b>and leave</b> it there? The Gemara answers: <b>When we learned</b> the prohibition against picking the grass in <b>the mishna as well, we learned</b> only that it is prohibited to <b>pick</b> it and <b>feed</b> it to one’s animals, but it is permitted to leave it there.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a cemetery, one may not act with frivolity; one may not graze an animal</b> on the grass growing <b>inside it; and one may not direct a water channel</b> to pass <b>through it; and one may not gather grass inside it</b> to use the grass as feed for one’s animals; <b>and if one gathered</b> grass for that purpose, <b>it should be burnt on the spot, out of respect for the dead.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: With regard to the phrase: Out of respect for the dead, <b>to which</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i> does it refer? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to the last clause,</b> that if one gathered grass that it should be burnt out of respect for the dead, then one could ask: <b>Since</b> the grass <b>is burnt on the spot,</b> and not publicly, <b>what respect for the dead is there</b> in this act? <b>Rather,</b> the phrase must be referring <b>to the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, and it explains why it is prohibited to act with frivolity.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On four <i>Shabbatot</i> during and surrounding the month of Adar, a Torah portion of seasonal significance is read. When <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat,</b> the congregation <b>reads the portion of <i>Shekalim</i></b> on that Shabbat. If the New Moon <b>occurs during</b> the middle of <b>the week, they advance</b> the reading of that portion <b>to the previous</b> Shabbat, <b>and,</b> in such a case, <b>they interrupt</b> the reading of the four portions <b>on the following Shabbat,</b> which would be the first Shabbat of the month of Adar, and no additional portion is read on it.
<b>On the second</b> Shabbat, the Shabbat prior to Purim, they read the portion: <b>“Remember</b> what Amalek did” (Deuteronomy 25:17–19), which details the mitzva to remember and destroy the nation of Amalek. <b>On the third</b> Shabbat, they read the portion of <b>the Red Heifer [<i>Para</i>]</b> (Numbers 19:1–22), which details the purification process for one who became ritually impure through contact with a corpse. <b>On the fourth</b> Shabbat, they read the portion: <b>“This month [<i>haḥodesh</i>] shall be for you”</b> (Exodus 12:1–20), which describes the offering of the Paschal lamb. <b>On the fifth</b> Shabbat, <b>they resume the</b> regular weekly <b>order</b> of readings and no special portion is read.
<b>For all</b> special days, the congregation <b>interrupts</b> the regular weekly order of readings, and a special portion relating to the character of the day is read. This applies <b>on the New Moons, on Hanukkah, and on Purim, on fast days, and on the</b> non-priestly <b>watches, and on Yom Kippur.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:1): <b>On the first of Adar they make</b> a public <b>announcement concerning</b> the forthcoming collection of half-<b>shekels.</b> The money is used for the communal offerings in the Temple in the coming year.

Daf 29b

<b>And</b> a public announcement is made <b>concerning</b> the need to uproot any instances of <b>diverse kinds</b> that have grown in the fields.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> an announcement is made <b>concerning</b> the need to uproot <b>diverse kinds, as</b> the beginning of the month of Adar <b>is a time of sowing.</b> Instances of diverse kinds are already noticeable, and therefore it is a fitting time to deal with the matter. <b>But</b> with regard to the announcement <b>concerning the</b> half-<b>shekels, from where do we</b> derive that it should be made at this point in the year?
<b>Rabbi Tavi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiyya said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “This is the burnt-offering of each New Moon in its renewal</b> throughout the months of the year” (Numbers 28:14). <b>The Torah says:</b> There is a month in which you must begin to <b>renew and bring the</b> daily and additional <b>offering from</b> animals purchased with <b>the new collections</b> of half-shekels collected that year. Each year a collection is made with which to finance the purchase of communal offerings for the following year. Offerings during that year may be purchased only from collections made for that year.
Elsewhere it is derived through a verbal analogy that the yearly cycle begins with the month of Nisan. <b>And since</b> starting from and <b>during</b> the month of <b>Nisan</b> the offerings <b>must be brought from the new collections</b> of half-shekels, it is necessary to make the collection in the preceding month, i.e., in Adar. Therefore, <b>they advance</b> the reading of <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>and they read</b> it <b>on the first of Adar, in order that</b> the people <b>will</b> be reminded to <b>bring the</b> half-<b>shekels to the Temple</b> in good time.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the mishna taught? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, for if</b> someone would suggest that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> one could counter: <b>Didn’t he say</b> that <b>two weeks</b> is a sufficient period of preparation? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>We</b> begin to <b>inquire into the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover thirty days before Passover. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> We begin to inquire only <b>two weeks</b> before Passover. As such, it should be sufficient to announce the collection of half-shekels from two weeks before Nisan, and there should be no need to advance the announcement to the beginning of Adar, as stated in the mishna.
<b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> it is possible that even he agrees that the announcement concerning the collection of the half-shekels should be made on the first of Adar, <b>since the Master said: On the fifteenth</b> of Adar money-changing <b>tables</b> for collecting the half-shekels <b>are set up throughout the country, and on the twenty-fifth</b> of Adar <b>they are set up in the Temple. Because of</b> the possibility to donate the half-shekels at <b>the tables</b> already from the fifteenth, <b>they advance</b> the reading of <i>Shekalim</i> to inform people of that possibility <b>and read it</b> two weeks earlier, on the first of Adar.
§ The Gemara clarifies which passage is read: <b>What is</b> this <b>portion of <i>Shekalim</i>? Rav said:</b> It is the portion of <b>“Command the children of Israel, and say to them: My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings made by fire” (Numbers 28), which details the daily and additional offerings. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It is the portion of <b>“When you take the count”</b> (Exodus 30:11–16).
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” this is</b> the reason <b>that it is called the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>, for</b> the obligation to give half-<b>shekels is written in</b> that portion. <b>However, according to one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings,” why should that portion be read? <b>Is there anything written</b> about the half-<b>shekels here?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes. What is the reason</b> that they are collected in Adar? <b>As per</b> the explanation <b>of Rabbi Tavi,</b> the half-shekels are collected to be used for the coming year’s daily and additional offerings. Therefore, reading the portion concerning those offerings will serve well as a reminder for people to donate.
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“Command the children of Israel:</b> My offering, the provision of My offerings,” it is logical to read that portion, <b>because the offerings</b> that will be purchased with the half-shekels <b>are written there, as per</b> the explanation <b>of Rabbi Tavi. However, according to one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,”</b> why should that portion be read? <b>Is</b> anything about <b>the offerings written</b> in that portion? The collection of half-<b>shekels for</b> use in the construction of <b>the sockets</b> of the Tabernacle <b>are</b> the only thing <b>written</b> in that portion. What does that have to do with the collection of half-shekels for the purchase of offerings that is held in the month of Adar?
The Gemara answers: The selection of that portion is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of the portion <b>that Rav Yosef taught:</b> The three instances of the word: Contribution, in that portion teach that <b>there were three contributions</b> of half-shekels: The contribution <b>of the altar</b> is <b>for</b> the purchase of communal offerings to be sacrificed on <b>the altar; and</b> the contribution <b>of the sockets</b> is <b>for</b> constructing <b>the sockets; and</b> the contribution <b>of the Temple maintenance</b> is <b>for the Temple maintenance.</b> Therefore, according to Rav Yosef, it is understandable why the portion of “When you take the count” is read. It deals explicitly with the collection of half-shekels.
The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” this is what is different</b> about <b>this New Moon</b> of Adar <b>and other New Moons</b> when they occur on Shabbat. On the New Moon of Adar, “When you take the count” is read because it describes the collection of half-shekels. On other New Moons, when they occur on Shabbat, the portion of “Command the children of Israel” is read because it mentions the additional offerings brought on Shabbat and the New Moon.
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>“Command</b> the children of Israel, and say to them: <b>My offering,” what is different</b> about the portion read on the New Moon of Adar and the portion read on other New Moons when they occur on Shabbat, for the same portion is read in all cases? The Gemara answers: They are <b>different: For</b> on other <b>New Moons,</b> when they occur on Shabbat, <b>six</b> people <b>read from</b> the regular weekly portion <b>of the matter of the day and one</b> reads <b>from</b> the portion for <b>the New Moon, whereas now,</b> on the New Moon of Adar, if it occurs on Shabbat, <b>all</b> seven read from the portion of <b>the New Moon.</b>
The Gemara asks: This answer <b>works out well according to the one who said that</b> when the mishna states that on the fifth Shabbat, we resume the regular order of readings. The intention is that <b>one resumes the</b> regular weekly <b>order</b> of Torah <b>portions.</b> This implies that on the previous four <i>Shabbatot</i>, the regular portion was not read at all. Rather, only the special portions delineated in the mishna were read. Therefore, it makes sense to say that all seven people read from the special portion.
<b>However, according to the one who says</b> that the mishna’s intention is that <b>one resumes the</b> regular <b>order of concluding</b> readings from the Prophets [<b><i>haftarot</i></b>], <b>and</b> on the previous <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>one also reads from</b> the regular portion <b>of the matter of the day, then</b> the original question stands: <b>What is different</b> about the portion read on the New Moon of Adar and the portion read on other New Moons when they occur on Shabbat?
The Gemara answers: They are <b>different: For whereas</b> on other <b>New Moons,</b> when they occur on Shabbat, <b>six</b> people <b>read from</b> the regular weekly portion <b>of the matter of the day and one</b> reads <b>from</b> the portion for <b>the New Moon, now,</b> on the New Moon of Adar, if it occurs on Shabbat, <b>three</b> people read from the regular weekly portion <b>of the matter of the day and four read from</b> the portion for <b>the New Moon.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:1): When <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat, they read the</b> Torah <b>portion of <i>Shekalim</i>, and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest</b> (II Kings 12:1–17). <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <i>Shekalim</i> is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” this is</b> the reason <b>that they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest: Because it is comparable</b> in content <b>to</b> the Torah reading, <b>as it is written</b> in the story of Jehoiada: <b>“The money of his assessment of persons”</b> (II Kings 12:5), which is referring to his collection of the half-shekels, and the <i>haftara</i> should always contain a theme similar to the Torah reading.
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>“My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings” is read as the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>is</b> the <i>haftara</i> <b>comparable</b> to that portion? <b>It is comparable, as per</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Tavi:</b> It is appropriate to read the portion about offerings because the collection of half-shekels is for that purpose.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If the New Moon of Adar <b>occurs on</b> the Shabbat on which <b>the portion</b> to be read for the regular weekly reading <b>is adjacent to</b> the portion read as <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>whether</b> on the Shabbat <b>preceding</b> the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> will be read as part of the weekly reading <b>or following it,</b> then <b>they read and repeat</b> <i>Shekalim</i> on both <i>Shabbatot</i>, one time as the special portion <i>Shekalim</i> and the other as part of the regular order.
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that the portion of <b>“When you take the count”</b> is read as <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>this is</b> how it is possible: <b>That</b> portion <b>could occur at that time</b> in the yearlong cycle of the order of readings. In the regular order of reading, “When you take the count” is often read during the beginning of Adar.
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that the portion of <b>“Command</b> the children of Israel, and say to them, <b>My offering”</b> is read as <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>does</b> that portion <b>ever occur at that time</b> of the year? That portion usually occurs much later in the year, in the summer. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it sometimes occurs that this portion is read during the beginning of Adar, <b>for the people of the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>who complete</b> the cycle of reading <b>the Torah</b> not in one year but <b>in three years.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel: When the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat, they read</b> the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said:</b> When <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat,</b> the congregation <b>takes out three Torah scrolls</b> from the ark <b>and reads from them.</b> From the first <b>one,</b> they read the portion of the regular weekly reading <b>of the matter of the day; and</b> from the second <b>one</b> they read the portion <b>for the New Moon; and</b> from the third <b>one</b> they read <i>Shekalim</i>, which begins with <b>“When you take the count.” And Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> further <b>said:</b> When <b>the New Moon of Tevet,</b> which always falls during Hanukkah, <b>occurs on Shabbat, they bring three Torah scrolls and read from them.</b> From the first <b>one,</b> they read <b>the</b> portion of the regular cycle of reading <b>of the matter of the day; and</b> from the second <b>one,</b> they read the portion <b>for the New Moon; and</b> from the third <b>one,</b> they read the portion <b>for Hanukkah.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa to state the <i>halakha</i> in both cases, <b>as, if it had been stated</b> only <b>with regard to</b> the New Moon of Tevet, one could have mistakenly thought that only <b>with regard to that</b> case <b>does Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> Nappaḥa <b>state</b> that three Torah scrolls are used. <b>But with regard to</b> the New Moon of Adar, one might think that <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said</b> that <b>the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> is</b> the portion of <b>“My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings,” <b>and two Torah</b> scrolls will therefore <b>suffice,</b> since the same portion is used both for the portion for the New Moon and for the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>. Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that three Torah scrolls are used even on the New Moon of Adar.
The Gemara asks: <b>But,</b> based on that logic, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak just <b>say</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with respect to this</b> case of the New Moon of Adar, <b>and there would be no need</b> to state <b>that</b> case of the New Moon of Tevet. The Gemara answers: Indeed, <b>one was stated from the other by inference,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa stated the <i>halakha</i> explicitly only with regard to the New Moon of Adar, and it was inferred that the same is true of the New Moon of Tevet.
§ An amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> When <b>the New Moon of Tevet occurs on a weekday,</b> what Torah portion is read? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> Nappaḥa <b>said: Three</b> people <b>read</b> from the portion <b>for the New Moon, and one</b> reads from the portion <b>for Hanukkah. And Rav Dimi of Haifa said: Three read</b> from the portion <b>for Hanukkah, and one</b> reads from the portion <b>for the New Moon.</b>
<b>Rabbi Mani said: It stands to reason</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, for</b> it is already an established principle that when <b>a frequent</b> practice <b>and an infrequent</b> practice conflict, the <b>frequent</b> practice <b>takes precedence</b> over the infrequent practice. Since the portion for the New Moon is read more frequently than the portion for Hanukkah, it should be given greater prominence.
<b>Rabbi Avin said: It stands to reason</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Dimi,</b> for the following reason: <b>What caused the fourth</b> person <b>to come</b> and read from the Torah? <b>The New Moon,</b> as on the other days of Hanukkah only three people read from the Torah. <b>Therefore,</b> it is only logical that <b>the fourth person should read</b> from the portion <b>for the New Moon.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rav Yosef said: We do not concern ourselves</b> with making the portion for <b>the New Moon</b> the primary reading. Rather, three people read from the portion for Hanukkah, and only the fourth reads the portion for the New Moon. <b>And Rabba said: We do not concern ourselves with</b> making the portion for <b>Hanukkah</b> the primary reading. Rather, three people read from the portion for the New Moon, and only the fourth reads the portion for Hanukkah. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we do not concern ourselves with</b> making the portion for <b>Hanukkah</b> the primary reading, <b>and</b> therefore the portion for <b>the New Moon is primary.</b>
§ An amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> If the Shabbat on which the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> is to be read <b>occurs on</b> the Shabbat in which the regular weekly portion is <b>“And you shall command”</b> (Exodus 27:20–30:10), what should be done? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: Six</b> people <b>read from</b> the portion <b>“And you shall command,” until</b> but not including the weekly portion of <b>“When you take the count”</b> (Exodus 27:20–30:10), <b>and one</b> person reads the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> <b>from “When you take the count,” until</b> but not including the verse: <b>“And you shall make</b> a copper laver” (Exodus 30:11–16). <b>Abaye said:</b>

Daf 30a

Since <i>Shekalim</i> is read from the portion in the Torah immediately following the regular weekly Torah reading, people <b>will</b> mistakenly <b>say</b> that <b>they</b> merely extended the regular reading and then <b>halted there,</b> and they will not realize that the last reading was actually for the sake of <i>Shekalim</i>.
<b>Rather, Abaye said: Six</b> people <b>read from “And you shall command” until</b> but not including <b>“And you shall make</b> a copper laver,” which concludes with the portion used for <i>Shekalim</i>. <b>And</b> then <b>one</b> person <b>repeats and reads</b> <i>Shekalim</i> <b>from “When you take the count” until</b> but not including <b>“And you shall make</b> a copper laver.” The repetition of this portion serves to highlight the fact it was read for the sake of <i>Shekalim</i>.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> is to be read <b>occurs on</b> the Shabbat on which <b>the portion</b> to be read for the regular weekly reading <b>is adjacent to</b> <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>whether</b> on the Shabbat <b>preceding</b> that Shabbat <b>or following it,</b> then <b>they read and repeat</b> <i>Shekalim</i>.
<b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, it works out well,</b> for the conclusion of the <i>baraita</i>, that we repeat <i>Shekalim</i>, supports his opinion. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> could have <b>said to you: And according to Abaye, does it</b> really <b>work out well?</b> The reference of the <i>baraita</i> to a case where the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> is read <b>precedes</b> the Shabbat on which that portion will be read as part of the weekly reading <b>works out well,</b> since it can indeed occur. However, with regard to the reference to that Shabbat <b>following</b> the Shabbat on which that portion is read as part of the weekly reading, under <b>what circumstances</b> can this case <b>be found?</b> It never occurs like that.
<b>Rather,</b> perforce, <b>what have you to say?</b> That when the <i>baraita</i> refers to repeating <i>Shekalim</i> when the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> is read follows the Shabbat on which it is read as the regular weekly reading, it means that <b>one repeats it</b> by reading it <b>on</b> two successive <b><i>Shabbatot</i>.</b> Similarly, <b>here too,</b> when the <i>baraita</i> refers to repeating <i>Shekalim</i> when the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> is read precedes the Shabbat on which it is read as the regular weekly reading, it means that <b>one repeats it</b> by reading it <b>on</b> two successive <b><i>Shabbatot</i>.</b>
The Gemara considers a similar case: If the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> is to be read <b>occurs on</b> the Shabbat on which the regular portion <b>itself</b> begins with <b>“When you take the count,”</b> what should be done? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: Six</b> people <b>read from “And you shall make</b> a copper laver” <b>until</b> but not including the portion of <b>“And he assembled”</b> (Exodus 30:17–34:35). This is the entire regular weekly portion of “When you take the count” without the opening passage, which is also the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>. <b>And</b> then <b>one</b> person goes back and <b>reads</b> the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> <b>from “When you take the count” until</b> but not including <b>“And you shall make</b> a copper laver.”
<b>Abaye strongly objects to this: Now</b> people <b>will</b> mistakenly <b>say</b> that <b>they are reading</b> the regular weekly portion <b>out of sequence,</b> and they will not realize that the last reading was actually for the sake of the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>. <b>Rather, Abaye said: Six</b> people <b>read</b> the entire portion of “When you take the count” <b>until</b> but not including the portion of <b>“And he assembled”</b> (Exodus 30:11–34:35), <b>and</b> then <b>one</b> person <b>repeats and reads</b> the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> <b>from “When you take the count” until</b> but not including <b>“And you shall make</b> a copper laver.”
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye:</b> If the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> is to be read <b>occurs on</b> the Shabbat on which the regular portion <b>itself</b> is <b>“When you take the count,”</b> the first part of that portion <b>is read</b> once as part of the weekly reading <b>and</b> then <b>repeated</b> as the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>.
§ The mishna states: If the New Moon of Adar <b>occurs during</b> the middle of <b>the week,</b> the congregation <b>advances</b> the reading of <i>Shekalim</i> <b>to the previous week.</b> With regard to this, an amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> With regard to when <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Friday, Rav said:</b> The congregation <b>advances</b> the reading of the portion to the previous week. <b>And Shmuel said: They defer</b> the reading of the portion to the following day, and it is read on the coming Shabbat.
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>Rav said: They advance</b> the reading to the previous week, <b>as, if</b> one would read the portion only on the following day, <b>there will be less than the</b> required number of <b>days,</b> i.e., two weeks, that the announcement needs to precede the setting up of <b>the</b> money-changing <b>tables</b> on the fifteenth. <b>And Shmuel said: They defer</b> the reading of the portion to the following day. As for Rav’s argument, Shmuel could have <b>said to you: Ultimately,</b> in such a year <b>the fifteenth</b> of Adar also <b>occurs on a Friday, and</b> therefore <b>the</b> money-changing <b>tables will not be brought out until Sunday.</b> Consequently, there will still be a full two weeks between the announcement and the setting of the tables. <b>Therefore, they</b> can <b>defer</b> the reading to the following day.
The Gemara offers various proofs for Rav’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If the New Moon <b>occurs during</b> the middle of <b>the week, they advance</b> the reading of that portion <b>to the previous</b> Shabbat, <b>and</b> in such a case <b>they interrupt</b> the reading of the four portions <b>on the following Shabbat.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>What; is it not</b> that this is referring <b>even</b> to a case when the New Moon occurs <b>on Friday?</b> This would prove Rav’s opinion. <b>No;</b> it is referring <b>specifically</b> to a case where it occurs <b>during</b> the middle <b>of the week.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is the first Shabbat</b> of the four <i>Shabbatot</i> on which the special portions are read? The Shabbat of <b>whichever</b> week <b>during which the New Moon of Adar occurs, and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if it occurs <b>on Friday.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the case when it occurs <b>even on Friday is similar to</b> the case where it occurs <b>during</b> the middle of the week, and <b>just as</b> when it occurs <b>during</b> the middle of the week, <b>they advance</b> the reading to the previous Shabbat, <b>so too,</b> when it occurs on <b>Friday, they advance</b> the reading to the previous Shabbat? This would therefore prove Rav’s opinion.
<b>Shmuel said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> should be emended, and instead of saying: During which the New Moon occurs, it should say: <b>On which</b> the New Moon occurs, i.e., on Shabbat itself. <b>And so the school of Shmuel taught: On which</b> the New Moon occurs.
The Gemara suggests: This dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the reading of the four special portions, <b>they interrupt the flow of <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> i.e., there is a Shabbat in which no special portion is read; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: They do not interrupt the flow</b> of <i>Shabbatot</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: When do I say that they do not interrupt the flow</b> of <i>Shabbatot</i>? <b>When</b> the New Moon of Adar <b>occurs on Friday,</b> since I hold that in that case <i>Shekalim</i> is read on the following day, and therefore the four portions are read on four consecutive weeks. <b>However, when</b> the New Moon of Adar <b>occurs during the week, one advances and reads</b> <i>Shekalim</i> <b>on the previous Shabbat, although it is</b> still the month of <b>Shevat,</b> and therefore on one of the <i>Shabbatot</i> in Adar there will be no reading. It would appear, then, that Shmuel holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, whereas Rav holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
§ The mishna states: <b>On the second</b> Shabbat of Adar, the Shabbat prior to Purim, they read the portion of <b>“Remember [<i>zakhor</i>]</b> what Amalek did” (Deuteronomy 25:17–19). The portion of <i>Zakhor</i> is associated with Purim because according to tradition, Haman was a descendant of Amalek, and so the victory over him and his supporters was a victory against Amalek. With regard to this, an amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> With regard to when <b>Purim occurs on a Friday, Rav said:</b> The congregation <b>advances</b> the reading of <b>the portion of <i>Zakhor</i></b> to the previous Shabbat. <b>And Shmuel said: They defer</b> it to the Shabbat following Purim.
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>Rav said: They advance</b> it to the previous Shabbat, <b>in order that the observance</b> of Purim <b>should not precede the remembrance</b> of the destruction of Amalek, which is achieved through reading the portion of <i>Zakhor</i>. <b>And Shmuel said: They defer</b> its reading. And as for Rav’s argument, Shmuel could have <b>said to you: Since there are the walled</b> cities <b>that observe</b> Purim <b>on the fifteenth,</b> at least with regard to them, <b>the observance and the remembrance come together</b> on the same day, and that is sufficient.
The Gemara offers various proofs for Rav’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>On the second</b> Shabbat they read the portion of <b><i>Zakhor</i>.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Is it not</b> the case that <b>when the New Moon</b> of Adar <b>occurs on Shabbat, Purim occurs on Friday, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches: On the second</b> Shabbat they read the portion of <b><i>Zakhor</i>?</b> This supports Rav’s opinion that in all cases the portion is read before Purim. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> There is no proof, because one could argue as follows: <b>What is</b> the intention of the mishna when it is referring to <b>the second</b> Shabbat? It could mean <b>the second</b> Shabbat on which a special portion is read, which, if Purim occurs on Friday, occurs only <b>after the interruption</b> of the previous Shabbat, during which no portion was read.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is the second Shabbat</b> on which a special portion is read? The Shabbat of <b>whichever</b> week <b>during which Purim occurs, and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if it occurs <b>on Friday.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>even</b> if Purim occurs <b>on Friday,</b> the case <b>is similar to</b> the case when it occurs <b>during</b> the middle of the week, and therefore, <b>just as</b> when it occurs <b>during</b> the middle of the week <b>we advance</b> the reading to the previous Shabbat, <b>so too,</b> when it occurs on <b>Friday, we</b> should <b>advance</b> the reading to the previous Shabbat? This <i>baraita</i> would therefore prove Rav’s opinion.
<b>Shmuel said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> should be emended, and instead of saying: During which Purim occurs, it should say: <b>On which</b> Purim occurs, i.e., on Shabbat itself. <b>And so the school of Shmuel taught: On which</b> Purim occurs.
With regard to when Purim <b>occurs on Shabbat itself, Rav Huna said: Everyone agrees,</b> i.e., both Rav and Shmuel, that <b>they do not advance</b> the reading of the portion of <i>Zakhor</i> to the previous Shabbat, but it is read on that Shabbat. <b>And Rav Naḥman said:</b> Even in this case there <b>is still a dispute,</b> for Rav maintains that in all cases the remembrance of the destruction of Amalek, which is achieved through reading the portion of <i>Zakhor</i>, must always precede the observance of Purim. <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>Purim occurs on Shabbat, one advances and reads</b> the portion of <b><i>Zakhor</i> on the previous Shabbat,</b> as Rav Naḥman understood Rav’s opinion.
§ The mishna states: <b>On the third</b> Shabbat, they read the portion of <b>the Red Heifer [<i>Para</i>]</b> (Numbers 19:1–22). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is the third Shabbat? Whichever</b> Shabbat occurs <b>immediately after Purim.</b> It <b>was</b> also <b>stated: Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The Shabbat that is immediately</b> before <b>the New Moon of Nisan.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as they refer to different cases: <b>This</b> statement of Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, is referring to a case <b>where the New Moon of Nisan occurs on Shabbat</b> itself. In that case, the portion of <i>HaḤodesh</i> is read then, and therefore the portion of <i>Para</i> is read on the preceding Shabbat. <b>And that</b> statement of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the New Moon of Nisan <b>occurs during the middle of the week.</b> Therefore, <i>HaḤodesh</i> is read on the Shabbat immediately preceding the New Moon, and <i>Para</i> is read on the Shabbat before that one, which is the Shabbat that is adjacent to Purim and after it.
§ The mishna states: <b>On the fourth</b> Shabbat, they read the portion of <b>“This month [<i>haḥodesh</i>] shall be for you”</b> (Exodus 12:1–20). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat, they read “When you take the count”</b> as the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>. <b>And they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada</b> the priest (II Kings 12:1–27). <b>And which is the first Shabbat?</b> The Shabbat of <b>whichever</b> week <b>during which the New Moon of Adar occurs, and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if it occurs <b>on Friday. On the second</b> Shabbat, they read the portion of <b><i>Zakhor</i>, and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> of <b>“I remembered</b> that which Amalek did” (I Samuel 15:1–34). <b>And which is the second Shabbat?</b> The Shabbat of <b>whichever</b> week <b>during which Purim occurs, and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if it occurs <b>on Friday.</b>
<b>On the third</b> Shabbat, they read the portion of <b>the Red Heifer [<i>Para</i>], and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“Then will I sprinkle</b> clean water <b>upon you”</b> (Ezekiel 36:25–38). <b>And which is the third Shabbat? That which is adjacent to Purim and after it. On the fourth</b> Shabbat, they read the portion of <b>“This month [<i>haḥodesh</i>]</b> shall be for you,” <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“Thus says the Lord God: In the first month, on the first day of the month”</b> (Ezekiel 45:18–46:18).

Daf 30b

<b>And which is the fourth Shabbat?</b> The Shabbat of <b>whichever</b> week <b>during which the New Moon of Nisan occurs, and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if it occurs <b>on Friday.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>On the fifth</b> Shabbat, <b>we resume the</b> regular weekly <b>order.</b> The Gemara clarifies the mishna’s intent: <b>To the order</b> of <b>what</b> does one resume? <b>Rabbi Ami said: One resumes the</b> regular weekly <b>order of</b> Torah <b>portions.</b> Rabbi Ami holds that on the weeks on which the special portions are read, the regular weekly Torah portion is not read at all, and therefore the cycle is resumed only on the fifth Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: One resumes the</b> regular weekly <b>order of the <i>haftarot</i>.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya holds that even on the <i>Shabbatot</i> on which the special portions are read, the regular weekly portion is still read; the special portion is read by the last reader as the <i>maftir</i>. However, the <i>haftara</i> of the regular cycle is entirely replaced with a portion from the Prophets that parallels the special portion. As such, it is the cycle of <i>haftarot</i> that is resumed on the fifth Shabbat.
<b>Abaye said: It stands to reason</b> that one should rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>For all</b> special days, <b>we interrupt</b> the regular order of readings, and a special portion relating to the character of the day is read. This applies <b>to the New Moons, to Hanukkah, and to Purim, to fast days, and to</b> non-priestly <b>watches, and to Yom Kippur.</b>
Abaye explains his proof: <b>Granted, according to the one who said that one resumes the</b> regular weekly <b>order of</b> Torah <b>portions, this</b> statement in the mishna <b>is</b> referring to the fact <b>that there is</b> a reading of the weekly Torah <b>portion on weekdays.</b> If one of the special days listed in the mishna occurs on Monday or Thursday, the weekly Torah reading is replaced by the special portion for that day. <b>However, according to one who said</b> that <b>one resumes the</b> regular weekly <b>order of <i>haftarot</i>,</b> what could the mishna mean when it says that the regular cycle is interrupted? <b>Is there a <i>haftara</i> on weekdays?</b> The mishna therefore supports Rabbi Ami’s opinion.
<b>And the other one,</b> Rabbi Yirmeya, would counter: <b>This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> On days when there is a <i>haftara</i>, the reference in the mishna is to the order of the <i>haftarot</i>. On weekdays, when there is no <i>haftara</i>, the reference is to the order of the Torah readings. Therefore, no proof can be deduced from the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>But on fast days, why do I</b> need to have any <b>interruption</b> of the regular order of Torah readings? <b>Let us read in the morning</b> the regular weekly portion <b>of the matter of the day, and in the afternoon</b> service let us read the portion <b>of a fast day.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna, for Rav Huna said: From the morning</b> of communal fasts, <b>a gathering</b> is held in the synagogue. The community leaders examine the conduct of the townspeople and admonish those whose behavior is found wanting. Therefore, there is no time in the morning to read the Torah portion for fast days.
The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> the community <b>do</b> on a public fast day? <b>Abaye said: From the morning until the middle of the day,</b> the community gathers in the synagogue, and the leaders <b>examine the affairs of the town</b> to determine whether and how the people’s conduct needs to be improved. <b>From the middle of the day until the evening, a quarter of the day</b> is spent <b>reading</b> from the Torah <b>and reading the <i>haftara</i>, and a quarter of the day</b> is spent <b>praying, as it is stated: “And they read in the book of the Torah of the Lord their God one quarter of the day, and a quarter of the day they confessed, and they prostrated themselves</b> before the Lord their God” (Nehemiah 9:3).
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> perhaps <b>I should reverse</b> the order, and the first half of the day should be spent reading from the Torah and praying, and the second half of the day should be spent examining the affairs of the townspeople. The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel due to the transgression of the exiles gathered around me, and I sat appalled until the evening offering”</b> (Ezra 9:4), <b>and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“And at the evening offering I arose from my fast,</b> and having rent my garment and my mantle; I fell on my knees, and I spread out my hands to the Lord my God” (Ezra 9:5). This indicates that the first half of a public fast should be dedicated to an inspection of the community’s behavior, and the rest of the day should be devoted to prayer.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>On</b> the first day of <b>Passover,</b> the congregation <b>reads from the portion of the Festivals of Leviticus</b> (Leviticus 22:26–23:44). <b>On <i>Shavuot</i></b> they read the portion of <b>“Seven weeks”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:9–12). <b>On Rosh HaShana</b> they read the portion of “And <b>on the seventh month on the first of the month”</b> (Leviticus 23:23–25). <b>On Yom Kippur</b> they read the portion of <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16). <b>On the first Festival day of <i>Sukkot</i> they read from the portion of the Festivals of Leviticus</b> (Leviticus 22:26–23:44), <b>and on the other days of <i>Sukkot</i></b> they read selections <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the offerings of <i>Sukkot</i></b> (Numbers 29:12–39).
<b>On</b> each day of <b>Hanukkah</b> they read selections <b>from</b> the portion of the dedication of the altar by <b>the</b> tribal <b>princes</b> (Numbers 7). <b>On Purim</b> they read the portion of <b>“And Amalek came”</b> (Exodus 17:8–16). <b>On the New Moon</b> they read the portion of <b>“And in the beginnings of your months”</b> (Numbers 28:11–15). <b>And in the</b> non-priestly <b>watches</b> they read <b>the act of Creation</b> (Genesis 1:1–2:3). The Jewish people were divided into twenty-four watches. Each week, it would be the turn of a different watch to send representatives to Jerusalem to be present in the Temple to witness the sacrificial service. Those remaining behind would fast during the week, from Monday to Thursday, offer special prayers, and read the account of Creation from the Torah. <b>On fast days,</b>

Daf 31a

they read the portion of <b>blessings and curses</b> (Leviticus, chapter 26). <b>One should not interrupt</b> the reading of the <b>curses</b> by having two different people read them. <b>Rather, one person reads all of them.</b>
<b>On Mondays, and on Thursdays,</b> and <b>on Shabbat during the afternoon</b> service, <b>they read in accordance</b> with the regular weekly <b>order,</b> i.e., they proceed to read the first section of the Torah portion that follows the portion that was read on the previous Shabbat morning. <b>However,</b> these readings <b>are not counted</b> as a progression <b>in the reckoning</b> of reading the Torah portions, i.e., they do not proceed on Monday to read the section that immediately follows the section read on Shabbat during the afternoon, and then the following section on Thursday. Rather, until the reading on the following Shabbat morning, they return to and read the same first section of the Torah portion that follows the portion that was read on the previous Shabbat morning.
On Festivals and holidays, they read a portion relating to the character of the day, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44), which indicates that part of <b>the mitzva</b> of the Festivals is <b>that</b> the people <b>should read</b> the portion relating to them, <b>each one in its</b> appointed <b>time.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On</b> the first day of <b>Passover,</b> the congregation <b>reads from the portion of the Festivals</b> (Leviticus 22:26–23:44), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the account of the <b>Passover</b> celebrated at <b>Gilgal</b> (Joshua 5:2–14). The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays,</b> in the Diaspora, <b>when there are two</b> Festival <b>days of Passover, on the first day</b> they read as the <i>haftara</i> the account of the <b>Passover</b> celebrated <b>at Gilgal, and on the next day</b> they read <b>from</b> the account of the <b>Passover</b> observed <b>by Josiah</b> (II Kings 23).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And on</b> the <b>other days of Passover, one collects and reads</b> from various Torah portions of <b>matters</b> relating <b>to Passover.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are these</b> portions? <b>Rav Pappa said: A mnemonic</b> for them is <b><i>mem</i>, <i>alef</i>, <i>peh vav</i>.</b> Each letter stands for a different reading: <i>Mem</i> for the portion of: “Draw out [<i>mishkhu</i>] and take your lambs” (Exodus 12:21–51); <i>alef</i> for the portion of “If <b>[</b><i>im</i>] you lend money to any of My people” (Exodus 22:24–23:19<i>)</i>; <i>peh</i> for the portion of “Hew [<i>pesol</i>] for yourself” (Exodus 34:1–26); and <i>vav</i> for the portion “And the Lord spoke [<i>vaydabber</i>]” (Numbers 9:1–14).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On the last Festival day of Passover, they read</b> the portion of <b>“And it came to pass, when</b> Pharaoh <b>let</b> the people <b>go”</b> (Exodus 13:17–15:26), because it includes the account of the splitting of the Red Sea, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion <b>“And David spoke”</b> (II Samuel 22), which is the song of David. <b>And</b> in the Diaspora, <b>on the next day,</b> the eighth day of Passover, they read the portion <b>“All the firstborns”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19–16:17), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“This very day”</b> (Isaiah 10:32–12:6), because it discusses the downfall of Sennacherib, which occurred on the night of Passover.
<b>Abaye said: And nowadays,</b> on the eight days of Passover in the Diaspora, <b>everyone is accustomed to read</b> portions that are indicated by the mnemonic phrase: <b>Draw the bull, sanctify with money, hew in the wilderness, send the firstborn.</b> This alludes to the following portions: “Draw out and take your lambs” (Exodus 12:21–51) and “A bull or a sheep” (Leviticus 22:26–23:44); “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:1–16) and “If you lend money to any of My people” (Exodus 22:24–23:19); “Hew for yourself” (Exodus 34:1–26) and “And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai” (Numbers 9:1–14); “And it came to pass, when Pharaoh let the people go” (Exodus 13:17–15:26) and “All the firstborns” (Deuteronomy 15:19–16:17).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On <i>Shavuot</i></b> they read the portion of <b>“Seven weeks,” and they read as the <i>haftara</i> from Habakkuk,</b> chapter 2, since it mentions the giving of the Torah at Sinai. <b>Others say:</b> They read the portion of <b>“In the third month”</b> (Exodus 19:1–20:23), which describes the giving of the Torah, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> from</b> the account of <b>the</b> Divine <b>Chariot</b> (Ezekiel 1). The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays,</b> in the Diaspora, <b>when there are two days</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>we act in accordance with both</b> opinions, <b>but in the reverse order.</b> On the first day they read the portion of “In the third month,” and on the second day they read the portion of “Seven weeks.”
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On Rosh HaShana</b> they read the portion of <b>“On the seventh month</b> on the first of the month” (Numbers 29:1–6) <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> “Is Ephraim My dear son?”</b> (Jeremiah 31:1–20), as it contains the verse: “I earnestly remember him still,” which recalls God’s love for His people. <b>And some say</b> that they read <b>“And the Lord visited Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21), which describes how God blessed her that she should have a child, and, according to tradition, God blessed her on Rosh HaShana. <b>And they read as the <i>haftara</i> from</b> the account of <b>Hannah</b> (I Samuel 1:1–2:10), who, according to tradition, was also blessed on Rosh HaShana that she should have a child.
The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays, when there are two days</b> of Rosh HaShana, on <b>the first day</b> they read Genesis 21 <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion cited as: <b>Some say. And on the next day</b> they read <b>“And God tested Abraham”</b> (Genesis 22), in order to mention the merit of the binding of Isaac on the day of God’s judgment, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> “Is Ephraim My dear son?”</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On Yom Kippur they read</b> the portion of <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16)<b>, and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“For thus says the High and Lofty One”</b> (Isaiah 57:14–58:14), which deals with fasting and repentance. <b>And during the afternoon</b> service they <b>read from</b> the portion detailing <b>forbidden sexual relations</b> (Leviticus 18) to convey the severity of these transgressions, so that if anyone transgressed any of these prohibitions he will repent on Yom Kippur. <b>And they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the book of <b>Jonah,</b> which mentions the repentance of the people of Nineveh.
Having mentioned the <i>haftara</i> read on Yom Kippur, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Wherever you find</b> a reference in the Bible to <b>the might of the Holy One, Blessed be He, you</b> also <b>find</b> a reference to <b>His humility</b> adjacent to it. Evidence of <b>this fact is written in the Torah, repeated in the Prophets, and stated a third time in the Writings.</b>
<b>It is written in the Torah: “For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:18), displaying his humility in caring for even the weakest parts of society. <b>It is repeated in the Prophets:</b> “For <b>thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred”</b> (Isaiah 57:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward:</b> “In the high and holy place I dwell <b>with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,</b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>It is stated a third time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is the Lord”</b> (Psalms 68:5), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows”</b> (Psalms 68:6).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: On <b>the first Festival day of <i>Sukkot</i>, they read from the portion of the Festivals</b> found <b>in Leviticus</b> (Leviticus 22:26–23:44), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“Behold the day of the Lord comes”</b> (Zechariah 14), which mentions the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays,</b> in the Diaspora, <b>when there are two</b> Festival <b>days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>on the next day, they read the same</b> Torah portion. But <b>what do they read as the <i>haftara</i>?</b> They read the portion of <b>“And</b> all the men of Israel <b>assembled themselves to King Solomon”</b> (I Kings 8:2–21), which describes events that took place on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And on all the other days of <i>Sukkot</i>, they read</b> selections <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the offerings of <i>Sukkot</i></b> found in the book of Numbers, chapter 29. <b>On the last Festival day</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, i.e., the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>they read</b> the portion of <b>“All the firstborns,”</b> starting with the portion of “You shall tithe,” since it includes many <b>mitzvot and statutes</b> relating to gifts for the poor, who should be helped during this period of rejoicing, and it concludes with the <i>halakhot</i> governing <b>firstborns</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22–16:17). <b>And they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end</b> of praying” (I Kings 8:54–9:1), which occurred on that day. <b>On the next day,</b> the second day of the Eighth Day of Assembly in the Diaspora, <b>they read</b> the portion of <b>“And this is the blessing”</b> (Deuteronomy, chapters 33–34) until the end of the Torah, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> “And Solomon stood”</b> (I Kings 8:22–53).
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> When <b>Shabbat occurs on</b> one of <b>the intermediate days</b> of a Festival, <b>whether on Passover or on <i>Sukkot</i>, they read the Torah</b> portion of <b>“See, You</b> say to me” (Exodus 33:12–34:26), as it includes the <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals and the intermediate days. <b>They read as the <i>haftara</i>, on Passover,</b> from the portion of <b>the dry bones</b> (Ezekiel 37:1–14), which portrays redemption from servitude, <b>and on <i>Sukkot</i></b> they read “And it shall come to pass <b>on that day when Gog shall come”</b> (Ezekiel 38:18–39:16), which speaks of the future redemption.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On</b> each day of <b>Hanukkah</b> they read a selection <b>from</b> the portion of the dedication of the altar by <b>the</b> tribal <b>princes</b> (Numbers 7), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> from</b> the portion of <b>the lamps of Zechariah</b> (Zechariah 2:14–4:7). The Gemara comments: <b>And if it occurs that there are two <i>Shabbatot</i></b> during Hanukkah, <b>on the first</b> Shabbat they read <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the lamps of Zechariah, and on the latter one</b> they read <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the lamps of Solomon</b> (I Kings 7:40–50), which discusses the lamps in the Temple.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On Purim</b> they read the portion of <b>“And Amalek came”</b> (Exodus 17:8–16). <b>On the New Moon</b> they read the portion of <b>“And in the beginnings of your month”</b> (Numbers 28:11–15). When <b>the New Moon occurs on Shabbat, they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion that concludes with <b>“And it shall come to pass that every New Moon,</b> and every Shabbat, shall all flesh come to bow down on the ground before Me” (Isaiah 66), as it mentions both Shabbat and the New Moon. When the New Moon <b>occurs on Sunday, on the previous day,</b> i.e., Shabbat, <b>they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“And Jonathan said to him: Tomorrow is the New Moon”</b> (I Samuel 20:18–42), which describes events that took place on the eve of the New Moon.
<b>Rav Huna said:</b>

Daf 31b

When the <b>New Moon of Av occurs on Shabbat, they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion that includes the verse <b>“Your New Moons and your Festivals, My soul hated; they were a burden to Me”</b> (Isaiah 1:14). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>“They were a burden to Me”?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: It is not enough for the Jewish people that they sin before Me, but</b> in addition, <b>they burden Me to reconsider what harsh decree I shall bring upon them,</b> for they are petitioning Me to annul those decrees.
The Gemara asks: <b>On</b> the <b>Ninth of Av itself, what do we read as the <i>haftara</i>? Rav said:</b> The portion containing the verse <b>“How</b> did the faithful city <b>become a harlot?”</b> (Isaiah 1:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What Torah portion</b> do they read? <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>others say:</b> They read the portion containing the verse <b>“But if you will not hearken to me”</b> (Leviticus 26:14). <b>Rabbi Natan bar Yosef said:</b> They read the portion containing the verse: <b>“How long will this people provoke me?”</b> (Numbers 14:11). <b>And some say:</b> They read the portion containing the verse: <b>“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation?”</b> (Numbers 14:27). The Gemara comments that <b>Abaye said: Nowadays, everyone is accustomed to read</b> the portion of <b>“When you shall beget children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:25–40), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“I will utterly consume them”</b> (Jeremiah 8:13–9:23).
§ The mishna states: <b>In the</b> non-priestly <b>watches</b> they read <b>the act of Creation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, i.e., why do they read the account of Creation? <b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> To allude to the fact that <b>were it not for</b> the non-priestly <b>watches, heaven and earth would not endure, as it is stated: “Were it not for My covenant day and night, I would not have set the statutes of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). God’s covenant is referring to the offerings sacrificed in the Temple, which sustain the world.
<b>And</b> with regard to Abraham <b>it is written: “And he said, O Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?”</b> (Genesis 15:8). <b>Abraham said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, perhaps, Heaven forbid, the Jewish people will sin before You, and You will do to them as</b> You did to the <b>generation of the Flood and as</b> You did to the <b>generation of the Dispersion,</b> i.e., You will completely destroy them? God <b>said to him: No,</b> I will not do that.
Abraham then <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe: “By what shall I know this?”</b> God <b>said to him: “Take Me a heifer of three years old”</b> (Genesis 15:9). With this, God intimated to Abraham that even if his descendants will sin, they will be able to achieve atonement through sacrificing offerings. Abraham <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> this <b>works out well when the Temple is standing</b> and offerings can be brought to achieve atonement, but <b>when the Temple will no</b> longer <b>be standing, what will become of them?</b> God <b>said to him: I have already established for them the order of offerings,</b> i.e., the verses of the Torah pertaining to the <i>halakhot</i> of the offerings. <b>Whenever they read those</b> portions, <b>I will deem it as if they sacrificed an offering before Me, and I will pardon them for all of their iniquities.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>On fast days</b> the congregation reads the portion of <b>blessings and curses</b> (Leviticus, chapter 16), <b>and one may not interrupt</b> the reading of the <b>curses</b> by having two different people read them. Rather, one person reads all of them. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? Why does one not interrupt the reading of the curses? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi said: For the verse states: “My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,</b> nor be weary of His correction” (Proverbs 3:11). If one makes a break in the middle of the curses, it appears as if he loathes rebuke.
<b>Reish Lakish said</b> a different answer: It is <b>because one does not say a blessing over a calamity.</b> If a second person were to begin to read in the middle of the portion of the curses, the blessing upon his reading would be considered a blessing over a calamity. <b>Rather,</b> what <b>does one do?</b> It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one begins</b> the reading, <b>one begins with the verse before</b> the curses, <b>and when one concludes</b> the reading, <b>one concludes with the verse after them.</b> In this way, neither the blessing before the reading nor after it relates directly to verses of calamity.
<b>Abaye said: They taught</b> this <b>only with regard to the curses that are</b> recorded <b>in Leviticus, but with regard to the curses that are</b> recorded <b>in Deuteronomy, one may interrupt</b> them by having two different people read them. <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>These</b> curses in Leviticus <b>are stated in the plural, and Moses pronounced them from the mouth of the Almighty.</b> As such, they are more severe. However, <b>these</b> curses in Deuteronomy <b>are stated in the singular, and Moses said them on his own,</b> like the rest of the book of Deuteronomy. They are therefore less harsh and may be interrupted.
It was related that <b>Levi bar Buti was</b> once <b>reading the</b> portion of the <b>curses before Rav Huna, and he was stammering</b> in his reading, as it was difficult for him to utter such harsh pronouncements. Rav Huna <b>said to him: If you wish,</b> you may stop where you are and a different reader will continue, for <b>they taught</b> one may not have two people read the curses <b>only with regard to the curses that are</b> recorded <b>in Leviticus. But with regard to the curses that are</b> recorded <b>in Deuteronomy, one may interrupt</b> them by having two different people read them.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Ezra enacted for the Jewish people that they should read</b> the portion of <b>the curses that are</b> recorded <b>in Leviticus before <i>Shavuot</i> and</b> the portion of the curses <b>that are</b> recorded <b>in Deuteronomy before Rosh HaShana.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Abaye said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Reish Lakish</b> who said: <b>In order that the year may conclude</b> together with <b>its curses,</b> and the new year may begin without the ominous reading of the curses.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the curses <b>that are</b> recorded <b>in Deuteronomy, there is</b> relevance to the reason: <b>In order that the year may conclude</b> together with <b>its curses,</b> for Rosh HaShana is clearly the beginning of a new year. <b>However,</b> with regard to the curses <b>that are</b> recorded <b>in Leviticus,</b> what relevance does that reason have? <b>Is that to say <i>Shavuot</i> is a new year?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> indeed, <b><i>Shavuot</i> is also a new year, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 16a): <b>And on <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> divine judgment is made <b>concerning the fruit of the trees,</b> which indicates that <i>Shavuot</i> also has the status of a new year.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: If old men say to you: Demolish, and children</b> say to you: <b>Build,</b> then <b>demolish and do not build, because the demolishing of old men is</b> ultimately as constructive as <b>building,</b> despite the fact that it appears destructive, <b>and the building of children is</b> as destructive as <b>demolishing. An indication of this matter</b> is <b>Rehoboam, son of Solomon.</b> He ignored the advice of the Elders and did not lower himself before his people, which ultimately led to the people rebelling against him.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the place</b> in the Torah <b>where</b> the congregation <b>concludes</b> the reading <b>on Shabbat morning,</b> it is from <b>there</b> that <b>they</b> continue to <b>read in the afternoon</b> service on Shabbat. Where they conclude <b>in the afternoon</b> service on Shabbat, from <b>there they</b> continue to <b>read on Monday</b> morning. Where they conclude <b>on Monday,</b> from <b>there they</b> continue to <b>read on Thursday</b> morning. Where they conclude <b>on Thursday,</b> from <b>there they</b> continue to <b>read on the coming Shabbat.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the place</b> in the Torah <b>where they conclude</b> the reading <b>on Shabbat morning,</b> it is from <b>there</b> that <b>they</b> continue to <b>read in the afternoon</b> service on Shabbat. <b>And</b> from that same place <b>they</b> continue to <b>read on Monday</b> morning, <b>and on Thursday</b> morning, <b>and on the coming Shabbat.</b>
The Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that with regard to <b>the place where they conclude</b> the reading <b>on Shabbat morning,</b> it is from <b>there</b> that <b>they</b> continue to <b>read in the afternoon</b> service on Shabbat. <b>And</b> from that same place <b>they</b> continue to <b>read on Monday</b> morning, <b>and on Thursday</b> morning, <b>and on the coming Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let him</b> simply <b>say: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Why did he have to explicitly state the whole <i>halakha</i>?

Daf 32a

The Gemara answers: <b>Because there are those who reversed</b> the names in the <i>baraita</i> and attributed the position of Rabbi Yehuda to Rabbi Meir, and vice versa. Therefore, in order to avoid any lack of clarity, Rabbi Zeira stated the <i>halakha</i> explicitly.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When a person reads from the Torah, <b>he should open</b> the scroll <b>and see</b> the place from where he will read, <b>furl</b> it so that it is closed, <b>and recite the blessing, and</b> then <b>he should again open</b> the scroll, <b>and read.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda said: He should open</b> the scroll, <b>and see</b> the place from where he will read, <b>and,</b> without closing it again, <b>he should recite the blessing, and read.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Meir’s</b> opinion that the blessing is not recited over an open scroll? The Gemara answers: His reasoning is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Ulla, as Ulla said: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>one who reads from the Torah should not assist the translator,</b> but rather the translation should be exclusively said by the translator? <b>In order that</b> people <b>should not say</b> that <b>the translation is written in the Torah. Here too,</b> the scroll should be closed when reciting the blessings, <b>in order that</b> people <b>should not say</b> that <b>the blessings are written in the Torah.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> is not concerned about this, as he claims that with regard to the <b>translation, there is</b> the possibility of people <b>erring</b> in this way, but with regard to <b>the blessings, there is no</b> concern about people <b>erring.</b> People will realize the blessings are not actually part of the Torah’s text because they are recited by each person who reads.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>he should open</b> the scroll, <b>see</b> the place from which he will read, <b>and,</b> without closing it again, <b>he should recite the blessing and read.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let him</b> simply <b>say: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Why did he have to explicitly state the whole <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Because there are those who reversed</b> the names in the <i>baraita</i> and attributed the position of Rabbi Yehuda to Rabbi Meir and vice versa. In order to avoid any lack of clarity, Rabbi Zeira stated the <i>halakha</i> explicitly.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said: The boards,</b> i.e., the empty margins of a Torah scroll, <b>and the platforms</b> from which the Torah is read <b>do not have any sanctity.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Shefatya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When one furls a Torah scroll, he needs to position it</b> so that it closes <b>on the seam</b> between two sheets of parchment. Once closed, the seam should be between the two rolls of the scroll, so that if it is mishandled or overly tightened, it will come apart along the seam and not be torn across the writing.
<b>And Rabbi Shefatya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When one rolls a Torah scroll</b> from one section to another, <b>he should roll it from the outside,</b> i.e., he should position the scroll so the two rollers are parallel to him and then roll the scroll by rotating the roller farthest away from him by rotating it toward himself, <b>and he should not roll it from the inside,</b> by rotating the roller nearest to him away from himself. If one does this and loses control, the scroll could roll away from him onto the floor.
<b>And when one tightens</b> the scroll, after he has found the new section, <b>he should tighten it from the inside,</b> by rotating the roller nearest to him, <b>and not from the outside,</b> by rotating the roller furthest away from him, in order not to extend his arms over the text of the Torah and obscure the view of the community, for it is a mitzva for them to be able to see the text.
<b>And Rabbi Shefatya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>ten</b> people <b>read from the Torah, the greatest among them should furl the Torah scroll,</b> for this is the most distinguished honor. <b>And the one who furls it takes the reward of all of them, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> If <b>ten</b> people <b>read from the Torah, the one who furls it receives the reward of all of them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> to say that he actually receives <b>the reward of all of them?</b> Why should all the others forfeit their reward? <b>Rather, say</b> instead: <b>He receives a reward equivalent to</b> that of <b>all of them.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shefatya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If one was deliberating about whether to do a certain action, and a Divine Voice indicated what he should do, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that one may make use of a Divine Voice</b> and rely upon it? <b>As it is stated: “And your ears shall hear a word behind you saying:</b> This is the way, walk in it” (Isaiah 30:21). The Gemara comments: <b>This applies</b> only <b>when one heard a male voice in the city,</b> which is unusual, for men are usually found in the fields, <b>or</b> when one heard <b>a female voice in the fields,</b> for women are generally not found there. Since the voice is unusual, one need not doubt it and may rely upon it. <b>And that</b> applies <b>when</b> the voice repeated its message and <b>said: Yes, yes. And that</b> also applies <b>when</b> the voice <b>said: No, no.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shefatya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Concerning anyone who reads</b> from the Torah <b>without a melody or studies</b> the Mishna <b>without a song, the verse states: “So too I gave them statutes that were not good,</b> and judgments whereby they should not live” (Ezekiel 20:25), as one who studies Torah through song demonstrates that he is fond of his learning. Furthermore, the tune helps him remember what he has learned.
<b>Abaye strongly objects to this:</b> Just <b>because one does not know</b> how <b>to make</b> his <b>voice pleasant, you read concerning him: “And judgments whereby they should not live”? Rather,</b> the verse should be understood <b>in accordance</b> with the statement of <b>Rav Mesharshiyya, who said: Concerning two Torah scholars who dwell in the same city and are not pleasant to one other in</b> matters of <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> and they quarrel and stir up controversy, <b>the verse states: “So too I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live.”</b>
<b>Rabbi Parnakh said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who holds onto an uncovered Torah scroll,</b> i.e., holds the parchment directly without anything intervening, <b>will be</b> punished by being <b>buried uncovered.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Can it enter your mind to say</b> that he will actually be buried <b>uncovered?</b> Why should he be buried in such a disgraceful manner? <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>he will be buried</b> metaphorically <b>uncovered,</b> i.e., <b>without</b> the merit of having performed <b>mitzvot.</b>
The Gemara again asks: <b>Can it enter your mind to say</b> that he will be buried <b>without</b> the merit of having performed <b>mitzvot?</b> Why should he forfeit the merit of all the mitzvot that he performed during his lifetime? <b>Rather, Abaye said: He will be buried</b> metaphorically <b>uncovered,</b> i.e., <b>without</b> the merit of <b>that mitzva.</b> He forfeits the reward of the mitzva he performed while holding directly onto the parchment.
<b>Rabbi Yannai, son of Rabbi Yannai the Elder, said in the name of Rabbi Yannai the Great: It is proper</b> that <b>the cloth</b> cover of a Torah scroll <b>be rolled</b> around the scroll, while holding the scroll stationary, <b>and one should not roll the Torah scroll</b> itself in the cloth in order to cover it.
§ The mishna states: The verse <b>“And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44) indicates that part of <b>the mitzva</b> of the Festivals is <b>that they should read</b> the portion relating to them, <b>each one in its</b> appointed <b>time. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses enacted for the Jewish people that they should make</b> halakhic <b>inquiries and expound upon the matter of the day.</b> They should occupy themselves with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover on Passover,</b> with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Shavuot</i> on <i>Shavuot</i>, and</b> with the <b><i>halakhot</i> of <i>Sukkot</i> on <i>Sukkot</i>.</b>
