Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

1 At "Or" (lit. Light) on the fourteenth one checks for Chametz (unleavened product) by the light of a candle.  Any place where Chametz is not brought into does not require checking.  And what about what was said about (checking) two rows in a cellar? (This is a case of) a place where Chametz is brought into.  Beit Shamai say the two upermost rows of the wine cellar (require checking).  Beit Hillel say the two outermost rows (require checking).
2 What does it mean (in the Mishnah) "Or"? Rav Huna says (it means) morning and Rav Yehudah says (it means) night.  You might of thought that the one (Rav Huna) who says morning literally means morning and the one (Rav Yehudah) who says night means night literally.  We raise a challenge on this 
... Gemara: What is the meaning of אור?
... Rav Huna says:
... The day before. And Rav Yehuda says:
... The night before
... If you would have thought that the person who said "the day before [Rav Huna] actually meant the day before, and that the one who said "The night before" [Rav Yehuda] actually meant the night before,
... They raised a contradiction:
... (Beraishit 44:3) "The morning lightened, and the people were sent off". Therefore,
... "אור" is the light of day.
... Where does it say "The light of day"?
... It says "The day lightened"! This is like the one who says
... "

Daf 2b



Daf 3a



Daf 3b


There were two disciples sitting before Hillel, of whom one was R. Jochanan b. Zakai. According to others, these disciples were sitting before Rabbi, and one of them was R. Jochanan. One said [while studying a Mishnah]: "Why must the grapes be cut according to the rules of levital cleanliness, while olives may be gathered even according to the rules of levitical defilement?" The other pupil said: "Why must the grapes be cut under the rules of levitical cleanliness, while the gathering of olives need not be made under the rules of levitical cleanliness?" "I am sure," remarked their teacher, "that this one [who used becoming words] will become a judge in Israel." It is said that before many days had elapsed he became a judge in Israel.  There were three priests [discussing the portions of their priestly gifts]; one said: "Mine was as large as a bean." To this the other responded: "Mine, was as large as an olive." The third one said: "Mine was as large as the tail of a lizard." In consequence of that unfit expression, the last was examined as to his fitness to serve upon the altar and they found in him a blemish of descent. Have we not been taught [in a Mishnah] ''No family records are searched beyond the altar"? [for he was certainly examined before he began serving upon it; hence how was this examination possible?] Do not say a "blemish of descent," but say [they found in him] "obscenity which made him unworthy of the priesthood." And if you please, you may say this instance differs, because he harmed himself by causing the investigation].
There was a gentile that used to go up and eat the Passover sacrifices in Jerusalem. He said: It is written, no stranger [i.e. gentile] should eat from it; no uncircumcised person shall eat from it, but I eat of the very best. R. Judah b. Bathyra said to him: Did they give you a piece from the fatty tail? No, he replied. When you go there tell them to give you some of the tail. When he went up he said to them, Give me from the fatty tail. They said to him: The fatty tail is sacrificed on the altar.  They said to him: Who told you to do this? He said: R. Judah b. Bathyra. They said: What's going on? They did a background check and discovered that he was a gentile and killed him. Then they sent a message to R. Judah b. Bathyra: Peace be with you, R. Judah b. Bathyra, for you are in Netzivin but your net is spread in Jerusalem.
When R. Cahana became ill, the Rabbis sent R. Joshua, the son of R. Ide, with instructions to visit him and find out what his condition was. When he came, he found R. Cahana dead. He tore his clothes, then turned them towards his back, and returned weeping. "Is he dead?" they asked him. "You say it, I do not say it," was his reply, adding also (Proverbs 10:18) “And he that spreadeth abroad an evil report is a fool.” (Fol. 4)

Gemara: The Rabbis taught - three things are said about Babylonian kutah
it confounds the heart, blinds the eyes, and weakens the body
it confounds the heart because of the milk whey, it blinds the eyes because of the salt, and it weakens the body because of the mouldy barley flour

Mishna: The eve of Pesach, close to [the time of] Mincha, one may not eat until it gets dark. Even an poor Jew cannot eat until he leans [at the Seder]. And they should not [give] less to him than the 4 cups of wine, even from the soup kitchen.
Gemara: Why deal [specifically] with "eves of Pesachs"? Even the eves of Sabbaths and Festivals also [one may not eat from close to Mincha until nightfall], as it is taught [in a Baraita], "One may not eat on the eves of Sabbatahs and Festivals from Mincha and on, so that one can enter the Sabbath with an appetite, these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yossi says, One may continue to eat until it gets dark." [So why deal with eves of Pesachs in our Mishna?] Rav Huna said, "This [Mishna] is only needed for Rabbi Yossi, who said, One may continue to eat until it gets dark. When do these words apply? To the eves of the Sabbaths and Festivals, but to the eve of Pesach, because there is the obligation of Matza, he would agree [that one may not eat on the eve of Pesach]." Rav Pappa said, "Even if you'll say [this Mishna is also needed within] Rabbi Yehuda, there [where he forbade eating] for eves of Sabbaths and Festivals, that was a prohibition from Mincha and on, but close to Mincha was permitted. But on the eve of Pesach, even close to Mincha would be forbidden." And would close to Mincha on the eve of the Sabbath be permitted [for eating]? But it is taught [in a Baraita], "One may not eat on the eve of Sabbath and Festivals from 9 hours and on, in order that one may enter the Sabbath with an appetite, these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yossi says, One may continue to eat unto it gets dark." [Thus, close to Mincha is also forbidden according to Rabbi Yehuda!] Mar Zutra said, "Who says that this [text] is a correct one?

Daf 100a

Maybe it's mistaken!" Mareimar, and some say it was Rav Yeimar, said, "I visited the lecture of Rav Pinchas the son of Rav Ami, and a reciter got up and recited it [that way] in front of him and [Rav Pinchas] accepted it!" If so, then this is a difficulty! Rather, it's clear [the answer is] according to Rav Huna. Is this really well for Rav Huna? But Rabbi Yirmiya said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, and some say it was Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yossi the son of Rabbi Chanina, "The law is like Rabbi Yehuda on the eve of Pesach, and like Rabbi Yossi on the eve of the Sabbath." "The law is like Rabbi Yehuda..." implies that Rabbi Yossi is arguing on both [the eve of Pesach and the Sabbath]! No, "the law is..." implies they argue about stopping [the meal]. As it is taught [in a baraita], "We stop [eating] for the Sabbaths, these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yossi said, We do not stop [eating]. An occurrence happened that Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yossi were eating in Acre, and the day became holy [the Sabbath having started]. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said to Rabbi Yossi, "Do you want to stop and be concerned for the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda our colleague?" [Rabbi Yossi] said to him, "Each and every day you have favored my opinions over Rabbi Yehuda's, and now you are favoring Rabbi Yehuda's over mine? 'Even to take the queen while I'm in the house?' [Esther 7:8]". He said to him, "If so, we should not stop, lest the students see and establish it that way forever." They say they did not budge until they established the law like Rabbi Yossi.
Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel, "The law is not like Rabbi Yehuda, nor like Rabbi Yossi, but rather one spreads a cover and makes kiddush [therefore not stopping completely, but not continuing either]." Is that so? But Rav Tachlifa bar Avdimi said in the name of Shmuel, "Just like one should stop [the meal] for kiddush,

Daf 100b

so too we stop [the meal] for havdalah." What is "we stop"? Is it not [referring to] removal of the table [like that of Rabbi Yehuda]? No, [it refers only to] covering. Rabbah bar Rav Huna visited the exilarch. They brought a tray before him, and he spread a covering over and made kiddush. It was also taught like this [in a baraita], "We should not bring in the table unless one has made kiddush. If they had brought it in, spread a cover and make kiddush." One teaching: They agree that one may not begin [a meal on an eve]. Another teaching: They agree that one may begin [a meal on an eve]. This is well according to the one who taught "They agree one may not begin," for it can apply to the eve of Pesach. But the one who taught "They agree that one may begin," when is that? If you'll say the eve of the Sabbath, they surely argue! That is not a difficulty, here [where they agree] is before the 9th hour, there [where they argue whether one may begin] is after the 9th hour. Those people that have kiddush made for them in the synagogue: Rav said, "They have not completed their duty for wine, but for kiddush, they have completed their duty." Shmuel said,

It was taught: R' Yehuda b. Beteira says:
"While the Temple is standing, there is no joy unless there is meat, as it says (Deut. 27) 'And you shall sacrifice peace-offerings and eat them there, and you will be joyful before the Lord, your God'. 
Now that the Temple is not standing, there is no joy without wine, as it says (Psalms 104) ' And wine will rejoice the heart of man.'"
