Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may irrigate a field that requires irrigation on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival as well as during the Sabbatical Year, both from a newly emerged spring</b> that began to flow only during the Festival, <b>and from a spring that did not just emerge</b> and that has been flowing for some time. <b>However, one may not irrigate</b> a field <b>with rainwater</b> collected in a cistern, a procedure that requires excessive exertion, <b>or with water drawn with a shadoof [<i>kilon</i>],</b> a lever used to raise water with a bucket from deep down in a well.
<b>And one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One may not construct a new</b> water <b>channel during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival or during the Sabbatical Year. And the Rabbis say: One may construct a new</b> water <b>channel during the Sabbatical Year and one may repair damaged</b> water channels <b>during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b>
In addition to performing labor on one’s own property in order to avoid financial loss, it is also permitted to perform labor on the intermediate days of a Festival for the public welfare: <b>One may repair damaged water</b> cisterns <b>that are in the public domain, and clean them out</b> by removing the dirt and sediment that accumulated there; <b>one may repair roads, streets, and ritual baths; and one may tend to all</b> other <b>public needs.</b> So too, <b>one may mark graves</b> to inform the public of their ritual impurity, <b>and</b> inspectors <b>may even go out to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of prohibited <b>diverse kinds</b> [<b><i>kilayim</i>]</b> that grew in the fields during the rainy season.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by questioning the wording of the mishna: <b>Now</b> that <b>it has been said</b> that on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>one may irrigate</b> a field <b>from a newly emerged spring,</b> whose walls have not yet stabilized and are <b>likely to collapse,</b> necessitating laborious repairs, <b>is it necessary</b> to mention that one may irrigate a field <b>from a spring that did not just emerge,</b> whose walls have already stabilized <b>and are</b> therefore <b>not likely to collapse?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>They say</b> that <b>it was necessary</b> to mention the second case as well. For <b>had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> us the <i>halakha</i> with regard to only <b>a newly emerged spring, I would have said</b> that <b>here,</b> in the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one is permitted to irrigate from such a spring, but in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one is not permitted to do so, <b>because it is likely to collapse. But</b> with regard to <b>a spring that did not just emerge, that is not likely to collapse, I</b> might <b>say that</b> one may provide supplementary irrigation <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater.</b>
Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>a newly emerged spring is no different</b> from <b>a spring that did not just emerge.</b> In the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one may irrigate on the intermediate days of a Festival, while in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one may not do so, even from an established spring.
The Gemara raises a question with regard to a linguistic issue: <b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit hashelaḥin</i>,</b> a field that requires irrigation, <b>is a term</b> denoting <b>thirst,</b> implying that supplementary watering is necessary? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And you were faint and weary”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:18). The term faint is referring to the thirst of the Israelites in the desert. <b>And,</b> in the standard Aramaic translation, <b>we translate</b> the verse as: <b>And you were thirsty [<i>meshalhei</i>] and weary.</b> The letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>heh</i> are sometimes interchanged, and therefore the term <i>beit hashelaḥin</i> connotes a thirsty field.
<b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit haba’al</i>,</b> a field that suffices with rainwater, <b>is a term denoting settlement,</b> i.e., an established field that does not require extensive upkeep? <b>As it is written: “For as a young man takes to himself [<i>yiv’al</i>] a virgin,</b> so shall your sons take you to themselves” (Isaiah 62:5). <b>And it is translated</b> in the Aramaic translation: <b>As a young man settles down with a virgin, so shall your sons become settled within you.</b> Similarly, <i>beit haba’al</i> is referring to a settled field that suffices with rainwater.
The Gemara begins to clarify the underlying principle of the mishna, asking: <b>Who is the</b> anonymous <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna who maintains <b>that</b> labor performed to prevent a considerable <b>loss,</b> such as watering a field that requires irrigation, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival; but labor performed to increase one’s <b>profit,</b> such as watering a field that ordinarily suffices with rainwater, <b>no,</b> it is not permitted? Furthermore, <b>even in a case</b> involving <b>loss, one may not</b> excessively <b>exert</b> oneself, as the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna renders prohibited all cases of watering fields with collected rainwater or with water drawn with a shadoof, even in a field that requires irrigation.
<b>Rav Huna said: It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In a field filled with trees, <b>one may draw water</b> via channels <b>from tree to tree, provided that</b> in doing so <b>he does not water the entire field.</b> As this field ordinarily suffices with rainwater, it is prohibited to water the entire field. Therefore, it is evident that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov renders prohibited work performed to increase profit on the intermediate days of a Festival.
The Gemara challenges this comparison: <b>Say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov holds that labor performed only to increase <b>profit is not</b> permitted. But <b>did you hear him</b> prohibit excessive <b>exertion in a case of</b> considerable <b>loss?</b> This aspect of the mishna finds no expression in the words of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From a newly emerged spring one may irrigate even a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may irrigate only a field requiring irrigation that dried up</b> and needs water. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Neither the one nor the other. Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> Owing to the exertion involved, <b>one may not divert a water channel</b> from its regular path in order <b>to water his garden or his ruin,</b> which is now being used for planting, <b>during the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>
The Gemara first clarifies the case of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Yehuda mean when he speaks of a field that <b>is dried up? If we say</b> that the field is <b>literally dried up</b> and the plants are already parched, <b>why do I</b> need <b>to water it? Abaye said:</b> It means that <b>the one spring</b> from which the field had been irrigated until now <b>dried up, but</b> in the meantime <b>another spring emerged.</b> If the field is not irrigated from this spring, it will be ruined.
The Gemara explains the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Neither the one nor the other.</b> By this he means that <b>it is no different</b> whether <b>the</b> original <b>spring dried up or did not dry up.</b> The guiding principle is: From <b>a newly emerged spring</b> one may <b>not</b> irrigate even a field that requires irrigation. In any event, Rabbi Yehuda seems to maintain an opinion that is like that of the mishna, i.e., that only a field that requires irrigation may be watered, but not a field that suffices with rainwater. And even in the case of a field that requires irrigation, excessive exertion is prohibited. 
The Gemara challenges this understanding: <b>And from where</b> do you conclude that the mishna reflects the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> that <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one may irrigate it on the intermediate days of a Festival, and <b>a field that suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one may not do so, <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a newly emerged spring,</b>

Daf 2b

<b>as it is likely to collapse. But</b> in the case of <b>a spring that did not just emerge, which is not likely to collapse</b> because its walls have already stabilized, <b>even a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater</b> may be irrigated.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that were <b>so,</b> then <b>to whom,</b> i.e., to which <i>tanna</i>, <b>would you attribute</b> the mishna? According to this interpretation, the mishna does not correspond to any opinion, while according to the previous interpretation, it corresponds to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, a newly emerged spring is no different</b> from <b>a spring that did not just emerge. A field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> it may be irrigated, while <b>a field that suffices with rainwater, no,</b> it may not be irrigated. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> opted <b>to teach</b> this dispute in the case of <b>a newly emerged spring</b> in order <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> which states that <b>one may irrigate even from a newly emerged spring,</b> and <b>even a field that suffices with rainwater.</b>
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following question: With regard to <b>one who weeds or one who waters seedlings on Shabbat, for what</b> prohibited labor <b>do we forewarn him?</b> Judicial punishment may be administered to a sinner only if he has been forewarned by two witnesses prior to the commission of his offense. This forewarning must include the specific transgression being violated, and on Shabbat it must include the specific category of prohibited labor that the action involves. <b>Rabba said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing. Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing.</b>
<b>Rabba said: According to my opinion</b> it <b>is reasonable. Just as the</b> usual objective <b>of plowing is to loosen the earth, so too, this,</b> weeding or watering, <b>loosens the earth. Rav Yosef said: According to my</b> opinion, it <b>is reasonable. Just as the</b> usual objective <b>of sowing is to cause the fruit to grow, here too,</b> weeding or watering <b>causes the fruit to grow.</b>
<b>Abaye said to Rabba: According to your</b> opinion, it is <b>difficult, and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> Abaye explains: <b>According to your</b> opinion, it is <b>difficult:</b> Is it true that <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing, yes,</b> he is forewarned, but <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing, no,</b> he is not forewarned? Similarly, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef, it</b> is <b>difficult:</b> Can it be that <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing, yes,</b> he is forewarned, but <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing, no,</b> he is not forewarned? Everyone should agree that weeding and watering fall under the categories of both plowing and sowing.
<b>And if you say that anywhere that there are two</b> possible categories of prohibited labor into which a particular action might fall, <b>one is liable</b> to be punished <b>for only one</b> of them, <b>didn’t Rav Kahana say:</b> If <b>one prunes</b> the branches of a vine on Shabbat <b>and he needs the wood</b> for firewood or any other purpose, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings? He is liable to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering <b>for</b> violating the primary category of <b>sowing,</b> as pruning vines facilitates their growth, and so it is a sub-category of sowing. <b>And</b> he is liable to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering <b>for</b> violating the primary category of <b>reaping,</b> as the essence of reaping is detaching that which one needs from the ground. Since he needs the wood that he is detaching from the vine, his action is considered reaping. Consequently, one action that incorporates two prohibited labors causes liability for both.
The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult</b> according to both opinions.
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> from what is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who weeds</b> in proximity to diverse kinds of seeds, <b>or covers</b> with earth the exposed roots of <b>diverse kinds, is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition against diverse kinds, i.e., tending different species of crops in one area of the same field, as it is stated: “You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19). <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> in his field a mixture of species that he could have uprooted is flogged for violating the prohibition against diverse kinds of seeds.
Rav Yosef explains: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>that I say</b> that one who weeds on Shabbat is forewarned <b>for</b> the prohibited labor of <b>sowing, this is</b> the reason he is liable to be punished with flogging for weeding diverse seeds: <b>Sowing diverse kinds is prohibited. But according to you, who said</b> that one who weeds on Shabbat is forewarned <b>for plowing,</b> why is one liable to be flogged for weeding in proximity to diverse kinds? <b>Is plowing prohibited</b> in connection with <b>diverse kinds?</b> At the time of plowing, there is no mixture of different species of crops, so plowing cannot be prohibited in this case.
Rabba <b>said to him:</b> According to my opinion, one who weeds a field of diverse kinds is flogged not because he is guilty of plowing, but <b>for</b> violating the prohibition against <b>maintaining</b> a mixture of species in his field.
The Gemara objects: <b>However, from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches in the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> in his field a mixture of species is liable to be flogged, <b>it may be inferred that</b> according to <b>the</b> anonymous <b>first <i>tanna</i>,</b> the liability for weeding is <b>not for maintaining</b> diverse kinds, but for performing some other prohibited labor.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: In fact, <b>the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and it is stated</b> in the style of <b>what is the reason.</b> The <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>What is the reason that one who weeds and one who covers</b> the exposed roots of <b>diverse kinds</b> with earth <b>is flogged?</b> He is flogged <b>for maintaining</b> diverse kinds in his field, <b>as Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> in his field a mixture of species is flogged.
With regard to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> opinion? How did he derive this prohibition from the verses? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not sow your field with mingled seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). <b>I have</b> derived from this verse that <b>only sowing</b> diverse kinds is prohibited. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>maintaining</b> diverse kinds, which does not involve any positive action, is also prohibited?
<b>The verse states: “Diverse kinds, you shall not</b> sow <b>your field</b> with mingled seed” (Leviticus 19:19). The prohibition against planting different species of a crop in one area of the same field is preceded in the verse by the prohibition against crossbreeding livestock: “You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind.” A slight change in punctuation yields the phrase: Diverse kinds in your field, you shall not, indicating that merely preserving diverse kinds in one’s field is prohibited.
§ The Gemara returns to the original topic of discussion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may irrigate a field that requires irrigation on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival as well as during the Sabbatical Year.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the intermediate days of <b>a Festival,</b> where the prohibition against irrigation is <b>due to</b> the mandate to avoid excessive <b>exertion</b> on the Festival, <b>in a case of</b> considerable <b>loss, the Sages permitted</b> one to exert himself. <b>However,</b> during the <b>Sabbatical Year, both according to</b> the <b>one who said</b> that one who waters is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing, and according to the one who said</b> that one is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing, are sowing and plowing permitted during the Sabbatical Year?</b> How can these actions be permitted when the Torah explicitly renders prohibited working the land during the Sabbatical Year?
<b>Abaye said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to the Sabbatical Year in the present time,</b> when its prohibitions are only by rabbinic decree, <b>and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“And this is the manner of the release,</b> every creditor <b>will release</b> that which he has lent to his neighbor” (Deuteronomy 15:2), <b>the verse speaks of two releases: One</b> is <b>the release of land,</b> that one must refrain from working the land, <b>and the other</b> is <b>the release of money,</b> that one must refrain from collecting debts.
This verse equates these two releases, indicating that <b>when you</b> are mandated by Torah law to <b>release land, you</b> must <b>release money, and when you</b> are <b>not</b> mandated to <b>release land, you need not release money.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, at the present time, the release of land is not mandated by Torah law. Therefore, observance of the Sabbatical Year is mandated only by rabbinic law, and the Sages were lenient in a case of significant loss.
<b>Rava said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and maintain that the observance of the Sabbatical Year, even at the present time, is mandated by Torah law, one can understand the leniency in the mishna. The reason for the leniency with regard to irrigation is because only <b>primary categories of labor were prohibited by the Merciful One,</b> i.e., by Torah law,

Daf 3a

whereas <b>the subcategories</b> of labor that are derived from them, e.g., watering, <b>were not prohibited by the Merciful One,</b> i.e., by Torah law, but only by rabbinic law; and in a case of loss the Sages were lenient. The source for this distinction is <b>as it is written: “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land,</b> a sabbath for the Lord: <b>Your field you shall not sow,</b> and your vineyard you shall not prune. That which grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather the grapes of your undressed vines” (Leviticus 25:4–5).
<b>Since pruning is included in</b> the principal category of <b>sowing,</b> as its objective is to encourage the plant’s growth, <b>and picking</b> grapes <b>is included in</b> the principal category of <b>reaping</b> grain, as both involve removal of produce from a plant, <b>for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write them?</b> Why did the Torah explicitly prohibit pruning and picking grapes, rather than sufficing with the general prohibitions against sowing and reaping?
The Gemara answers that these were individually enumerated <b>to say</b> that only <b>for these subcategories</b> of labor <b>is one liable</b> to be flogged, while <b>for other</b> subcategories of labor, i.e., watering a field, <b>one is not liable.</b> Consequently, there are only four types of labor that are prohibited by Torah law during the Sabbatical Year: Sowing and its subcategory of pruning, as well as reaping and its subcategory of grape picking. All other subcategories of labor are prohibited only by rabbinic decree.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> liability for other subcategories of labor? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). <b>I have</b> derived from here an explicit prohibition <b>only</b> against <b>sowing and pruning. From where</b> do I derive that <b>weeding,</b> i.e., uprooting weeds, <b>hoeing, and cutting weeds,</b> even without uprooting them, are also prohibited? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune.” This wording indicates that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>
Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one may not prune trees, and one may not trim dry branches</b> from trees, <b>and one</b> may <b>not cut large branches [<i>mefasegin</i>] from trees? The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby teaching that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>
Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one</b> may <b>not fertilize</b> fields and vineyards, <b>and one may not remove stones</b> that surround the base of a tree and impede its growth, <b>and one</b> may <b>not</b> cover exposed roots with <b>dust, and one may not fumigate a tree</b> in order to exterminate worms? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby indicating that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>
The apparent conclusion from this is that all labor in a field or a vineyard is prohibited. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may</b> also <b>not hoe lightly under olive</b> trees <b>and one may not hoe under grapevines, and one may not fill cracks</b> in the ground <b>with water, and one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> in order to collect rainwater. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Your field you shall not sow.”</b>
The Gemara explains the derivation: <b>Sowing was included</b> in the general prohibition against performing agricultural labors during the Sabbatical Year, as the verse states “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4). <b>Why was</b> sowing <b>singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? In order <b>to compare</b> other types of labor <b>to it</b> and to <b>say to you: Just as sowing is unique in that it is labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard, so too, any</b> other <b>labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard</b> is prohibited. However, labors performed only in the vineyard but not in the field, i.e., whose objective is merely to sustain the vines from year to year, such as the labors mentioned above, are permitted. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that many subcategories of labor are prohibited during the seventh year, and not just sowing and pruning, as Rava had stated.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: These labors, with the exceptions of sowing, pruning, grape picking, and reaping, are all prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse</b> that is cited as a source from the Torah <b>is a mere support,</b> and not a bona fide source.
Incidental to this discussion, the Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> light <b>hoeing</b> under olive trees in fact <b>permitted during the Sabbatical Year? Isn’t it written: “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow”</b> (Exodus 23:11), and it is taught with regard to this verse: <b>“You shall let it rest” from light hoeing, “and lie fallow” from clearing</b> the field of <b>stones.</b> This indicates that light hoeing is indeed prohibited during the Sabbatical Year.
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: There are two</b> types of light <b>hoeing, one</b> whose objective is <b>to strengthen</b> the <b>trees, and another</b> that is intended <b>to seal cracks.</b> There is a practical halakhic difference between them: Hoeing performed in order <b>to strengthen the tree is prohibited,</b> as it is similar to plowing in that it enhances the tree’s growth. However, hoeing undertaken in order <b>to seal cracks is permitted,</b> as by doing so one prevents damage to the tree.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar</b> disagreed with regard to <b>one who plows during the Sabbatical Year. One said: He is flogged</b> for doing so, <b>while the</b> other <b>one said: He is not flogged.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree with regard to</b> the principle that <b>Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said,</b> and one accepts this principle while the other does not. <b>As, Rabbi Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said: Wherever a generalization is stated</b> in the Torah <b>as a positive</b> mitzva, <b>and a detail</b> relating to that generalization is stated <b>as a negative</b> mitzva, <b>one does not apply</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> according to which the <i>halakha</i> under discussion is expanded to all cases that resemble the detail.
The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that one who plows during the Sabbatical Year <b>is flogged does not</b> accept the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said.</b> Accordingly, he expounds the verses as follows: The verse “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4) is a generalization stated as a positive mitzva. The continuation of the verse is “Your field you shall not sow,” which is a detail stated as a negative mitzva. This is followed by another generalization: “For it shall be a year of rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:5). By applying the principle of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, one can derive that there is a prohibition against performing any agricultural task that is similar to sowing, including plowing.
<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>one is not flogged</b> for plowing <b>holds</b> in accordance with the ruling <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> stated in the name of Rabbi Ile’a. Therefore, the prohibition stated as a detail, i.e., the prohibition against sowing, is not extended to include any other labor. One who plows violates the positive command to let the land rest, but does not transgress a Torah law phrased as a negative mitzva, and therefore he is not flogged.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> one can say that <b>everyone</b> holds that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is not</b> in accordance with the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said.</b> According to <b>the one who said he is flogged,</b> all is <b>well,</b> as he applies the hermeneutical principle of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization to derive a prohibition for plowing.
<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>he is not flogged</b> could have <b>said to you: Since pruning is</b> included <b>in</b> the primary category of <b>sowing, and</b> grape <b>picking is</b> included in the primary category <b>of reaping, for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write them?</b> They were individually enumerated <b>to say</b> that only <b>for these</b> specific <b>subcategories</b> of labor <b>is one liable</b> to be flogged, but <b>for</b> performing <b>other subcategories</b> of labor <b>one is not liable.</b> According to this opinion, the verse comes to teach that one is not liable to be flogged for performing any labor not explicitly enumerated in the Torah, including plowing.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> liability for other subcategories of labor? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> that <b>I have</b> derived from here an explicit prohibition <b>only</b> against <b>sowing and pruning? From where</b> do I derive that <b>weeding, hoeing, and cutting weeds</b> are also prohibited? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow and <b>your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune” (Leviticus 25:4). By placing the word “not” immediately following the words “field” and “vineyard,” the verse indicates that one may <b>not</b> perform <b>any labor that</b> is generally performed <b>in your field, and</b> one may <b>not</b> perform <b>any labor that</b> is generally performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>
Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one may not prune trees, and one may not trim dry branches</b> from trees, <b>and one</b> may <b>not cut large branches from trees? The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow and <b>your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” indicating that <b>any labor</b> that is generally performed <b>in your field may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year, <b>and any labor</b> generally performed <b>in your vineyard may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year.
<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>one may not fertilize</b> fields and vineyards, <b>and one may not remove stones</b> from around the base of a tree that impede its growth, <b>and one may not fumigate a tree</b> in order to exterminate worms? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow and <b>your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby indicating that <b>any labor</b> that is generally performed <b>in your field may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year, <b>and any labor</b> generally performed <b>in your vineyard may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year.
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may</b> also <b>not hoe</b> lightly <b>under olive</b> trees <b>and one may not hoe under grapevines, and one may not fill cracks</b> in the ground <b>with water, and one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> in order to collect rainwater. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Your field you shall not sow.”</b>
<b>Sowing was included</b> in the general prohibition against performing agricultural labors during the Sabbatical Year. <b>Why was</b> sowing <b>singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? In order <b>to compare</b> other types of labor <b>to</b> it and to <b>say to you: Just as sowing is unique in that it is labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard, so too, any other labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard</b> is prohibited. However, labor performed only in the vineyard, but not in the field, i.e., whose objective is merely to sustain the vines from year to year, is permitted. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that many labors are prohibited during the seventh year, and not just sowing and pruning.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: These labors, with the exceptions of sowing, pruning, grape picking, and reaping, are all prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse</b> that is cited as source from the Torah <b>is a mere support,</b> and not a bona fide source.

Daf 3b

<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he stated</b> a tradition he had heard from the Sages in Eretz Yisrael: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that one would be flogged for the addition, but a teaching states an exemption</b> from lashes. Rav Dimi noted: <b>But I do not know what teaching or what addition</b> this tradition is referring to.
The Sages disputed the meaning of this tradition. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The addition in question is <b>plowing</b> during the Sabbatical Year, for which there is no explicit prohibition in the Torah, and so it may be regarded as an addition to the labors explicitly enumerated in the Torah. <b>And this is what it is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one would be flogged for plowing</b> during the Sabbatical Year, <b>as it is derived by way</b> of the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization</b> that teaches that plowing is prohibited. <b>But a teaching states an exemption</b> from lashes for the labor of plowing.
This is logical, <b>because if</b> one is flogged for plowing, <b>why do I</b> need <b>all these details</b> that were enumerated in the verse, i.e., pruning and picking grapes? Rather, one must certainly conclude that these were singled out in order to teach that one is flogged only for these specific labors, but not for any other.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This addition is referring to <b>the</b> extra <b>days that the Sages added</b> to the prohibition against performing agricultural labor, <b>before Rosh HaShana</b> of the seventh year, when the Sabbatical Year formally begins. <b>And this is what it is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one would be flogged for</b> working the land during <b>the additional</b> period prior to <b>Rosh HaShana</b> of the Sabbatical Year, <b>as</b> this prohibition <b>is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“In plowing and in reaping you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21). This seemingly superfluous verse is understood as teaching that not only is working the land prohibited during the seventh year, but plowing a field during the sixth year to prepare the land for the seventh year, and reaping what grew in the seventh year during the eighth year are also prohibited. <b>But a teaching states an exemption</b> from lashes for these actions, <b>as we are about to state below.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>What</b> are the extra <b>days before Rosh HaShana? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 1:1): <b>Until when may</b> one <b>plow an orchard</b> on <b>the eve of the Sabbatical Year? Beit Shammai say:</b> One may plow <b>so long as</b> the plowing <b>is beneficial for the fruit</b> already on the trees. Once the plowing serves to benefit only the tree itself and the fruit it will produce the following year, it is prohibited. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may plow <b>until <i>Shavuot</i>.</b> The mishna notes: <b>And the statement of these,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>is close to being like the statement of these,</b> Beit Hillel; i.e., in practice, there is little difference between the dates established by the two opinions.
The mishna (see <i>Shevi’it</i> 2:1) additionally states: <b>And until when may</b> one <b>plow a white field,</b> i.e., a grain field, on <b>the eve of the Sabbatical Year?</b> One may plow <b>until the</b> residual <b>moisture</b> in the fields from the rain <b>ceases and so long as people</b> continue to <b>plow</b> their fields in order <b>to plant cucumbers and gourds,</b> which are planted at the end of the winter.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: If it is so</b> that no set time was established, then <b>the Torah has given an</b> individual <b>measure</b> of time <b>into the hands of each and every individual.</b> One may plow until a self-determined time, as he can always claim that he is plowing in order to plant during the sixth year. <b>Rather,</b> a fixed time must be established: <b>In a white field</b> one may plow <b>until Passover, in an orchard</b> one may plow <b>until <i>Shavuot</i>, and Beit Hillel say: Until Passover.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of bar Kappara: Rabban Gamliel and his court</b> discussed and then <b>voted about the</b> prohibitions of <b>these two periods,</b> i.e., from Passover or <i>Shavuot</i> until Rosh HaShana, <b>and nullified them,</b> thereby permitting plowing until Rosh HaShana, the actual beginning of the Sabbatical Year.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Abbahu, and some say</b> that it was <b>Reish Lakish</b> who said <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan: How could Rabban Gamliel and his court nullify an ordinance</b> instituted by <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel,</b> who were greater authorities than they were? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:5): <b>A court cannot nullify the ruling of another</b> court <b>unless it surpasses it in wisdom and in number?</b>
Rabbi Abbahu <b>“was astonished for a while”</b> (Daniel 4:16), and then <b>said to him: Say</b> that when Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel established their decree, <b>they stipulated among themselves: Anyone who</b> later <b>wishes to nullify</b> this decree <b>may come and nullify</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this</b> ordinance <b>theirs?</b> Did Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel institute the ordinance and as such have the authority to attach stipulations to it? <b>It is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. As Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Neḥunya from the valley of Beit Ḥortan:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>ten saplings,</b> the <i>mitzva</i> of bringing <b>willow</b> branches to the Temple on <i>Sukkot</i> and standing them up around the altar, and the <i>halakha</i> of <b>water libation</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> are all <b><i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> Consequently, the prohibition against plowing on the eve of the seventh year is a not a rabbinic ordinance from the Second Temple period, but rather an oral tradition dating back to Moses at Sinai.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: When they learned</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> as a tradition dating back to Moses at Sinai, the prohibition applied from only <b>thirty days before Rosh HaShana.</b> Afterward, <b>these</b> Sages of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>came</b> and <b>instituted</b> lengthier periods of restriction, <b>from Passover and from <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> respectively, <b>but they stipulated among themselves: Anyone who</b> later <b>wishes to nullify</b> this decree <b>may come and nullify</b> it. Rabban Gamliel and his court were therefore able to nullify extended restrictions instituted by Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.
The Gemara raises another question: <b>Are these</b> prohibitions of plowing before the Sabbatical Year really <b><i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>They are</b> actually prohibitions based on explicit <b>verses. As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“In plowing and in reaping you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21) that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is unnecessary</b> for the verse <b>to speak</b> about <b>plowing and reaping during the Sabbatical Year, as it was already stated:</b> “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath for the Lord; <b>your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). This teaches that during the seventh year all agricultural labor is prohibited. <b>Rather,</b> the verse comes to prohibit <b>plowing on the eve of the Sabbatical Year</b>

Daf 4a

<b>that entered into the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., plowing in the sixth year that will benefit crops growing in the seventh year, <b>and reaping</b> the crops <b>of the Sabbatical Year that continued into the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., reaping seventh-year produce that continued to grow into the eighth year.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that this verse is to be understood as referring to Shabbat and not to the Sabbatical Year, in accordance with the straightforward meaning of the verse. It teaches as follows: <b>Just as</b> only <b>optional plowing</b> is prohibited on Shabbat, as there is no instance where plowing fulfills a biblical mitzva, <b>so too,</b> only <b>optional reaping</b> is prohibited, <b>to the exclusion of the reaping of the <i>omer</i></b> offering, <b>which is a mitzva,</b> and consequently permitted on Shabbat. Nonetheless, the first opinion cited in the <i>baraita</i>, that of Rabbi Akiva, holds that the prohibition against plowing on the eve of the Sabbatical Year is derived from an explicit verse.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: When we learned</b> this as <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>it was to permit</b> plowing in the case of <b>young</b> saplings until Rosh HaShana. In contrast, <b>the verses</b> that were cited come <b>to prohibit</b> plowing in the case of <b>mature</b> and well-rooted trees thirty days before Rosh HaShana of the Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara asks: <b>But since the <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai comes <b>to permit</b> plowing in the case of <b>young</b> saplings until Rosh HaShana, <b>does it not automatically</b> follow that in the case of <b>mature</b> trees, plowing <b>is prohibited</b> before Rosh HaShana? Therefore, not only the allowance, but the prohibition as well was learned by tradition as a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, and not from the verses.
<b>Rather,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai is the basis of the prohibition against plowing on the eve of the Sabbatical Year <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who interprets the verse as referring to Shabbat, and not to the Sabbatical Year, whereas <b>the verses</b> are the basis of the prohibition <b>according to the</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The Gemara previously cited Rabbi Yitzḥak, who explained how Rabban Gamliel’s court nullified the extension to the prohibition against plowing before the Sabbatical Year that had been enacted by Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. The Gemara now cites another opinion, which holds that Rabban Gamliel’s court abolished the prohibition against plowing before the Sabbatical Year entirely. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel and his court nullified</b> the restrictions on working the land on the eve of the Sabbatical Year <b>based on</b> a source written <b>in the Torah.</b>
<b>What is the reason? He derives</b> it by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>Shabbat</b> stated with regard to the Sabbatical Year in the verse: “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4), <b>and</b> the word <b>Shabbat</b> stated with regard to the weekly Shabbat, which commemorates <b>the Shabbat of Creation. Just as there,</b> on Shabbat <b>itself it is prohibited</b> to perform labor, but <b>before and after</b> Shabbat <b>it is permitted, so too here,</b> in the case of the Sabbatical Year, during the Sabbatical Year <b>itself it is prohibited</b> to perform labor, but <b>before and after</b> the Sabbatical Year <b>it is permitted.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this:</b> If Rabban Gamliel and his court nullified the restrictions based on a verbal analogy, then according to <b>the one who said</b> that the prohibition against plowing thirty days before Rosh HaShana of the Sabbatical Year is a <b><i>halakha</i></b> that was transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>can a verbal analogy come</b> and <b>uproot a <i>halakha</i></b> that was transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>And</b> similarly, according to <b>the one who said</b> that the prohibition against plowing is derived from <b>a verse, can a verbal analogy come</b> and <b>uproot a verse?</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Rabban Gamliel and his court held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who said</b> that <b>they learned this</b> prohibition as <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. <b>But they learned this <i>halakha</i></b> only with regard to the time period <b>when the Temple is standing.</b> This is evidenced by the fact that it is <b>similar to</b> the other <i>halakha</i> stated along with it, that of the <b>water libation,</b> which was part of the service in the Temple. <b>But when the Temple is not standing</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>does not</b> apply, and therefore Rabban Gamliel and his court nullified the prohibition after the destruction of the Temple.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>However,</b> one <b>may not</b> irrigate a field on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>with rainwater</b> collected in a cistern <b>or with water drawn with a shadoof.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> irrigating a field with <b>water drawn with a shadoof involves excessive effort,</b> and so it is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>But what excessive effort is involved</b> in irrigating a field <b>with rainwater?</b> Rainwater collects on its own and one merely has to channel it to where it is needed.
<b>Rabbi Ile’a said that</b> Rabbi <b>Yoḥanan said:</b> A rabbinic <b>decree</b> was enacted with regard to <b>rainwater due to</b> its similarity <b>to water drawn with a shadoof. Rav Ashi said: Rainwater itself will come to be</b> like <b>water drawn with a shadoof.</b> Once the level of the collected rainwater drops, it will become necessary to draw it with a bucket, a procedure involving excessive effort.
The Gemara comments: Rabbi Ile’a and Rav Ashi <b>disagree with regard to</b> the ruling issued by <b>Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>streams that draw water from pools</b> of collected water, <b>one is permitted to irrigate</b> his field <b>from them on the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> because the flow of water is steady.
One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Ashi, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> as he prohibits only irrigating with rainwater, because the supply might come to an end, but he does not prohibit watering from a source whose flow is steady. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> as he prohibits irrigating with rainwater due to its similarity to water drawn with a shadoof. This applies regardless of whether the level of the rainwater will drop, and therefore Rabbi Yoḥanan would prohibit using collected water even if a stream flows through it and it will not dry up.
After mentioning the statement of Rabbi Zeira in the course of the previous discussion, the Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>streams that draw water from pools</b> of water, <b>one is permitted to irrigate</b> his field <b>from them on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised an objection to Rabbi Zeira</b> from what is taught in the mishna: <b>However, one may not</b> irrigate a field on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>with rainwater</b> collected in cisterns <b>or with water drawn with a shadoof.</b> This indicates that whenever there is a concern that the water might run out, it is prohibited to irrigate from this water source. Consequently, Rabbi Yirmeya wanted to know why this concern did not exist in the case of the pools of water as well. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Yirmeya, my son, these pools in Babylonia are like water that does not stop</b> flowing. Therefore, there is no concern that the water level in these pools might go down to such an extent that it will become necessary to draw the water with buckets.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>temporary pools and</b> regular <b>pools that were filled with water on the eve of a Festival, it is prohibited for one to irrigate</b> his field <b>from them on the intermediate days of the Festival,</b> lest they run out of water and he will come to exert himself and bring water from elsewhere. <b>But if a water channel passes between them</b> so that water flows from the one to the other, <b>it is permitted.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: And this</b> allowance applies only <b>when the majority of that field can be irrigated from that water channel,</b> such that most of the field can be irrigated at the same time. In this case, there is no concern that when the water runs out, he will come to exert himself and irrigate the rest of the field from another source of water. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It applies <b>even though the majority of that field cannot be irrigated</b> from that water channel at the same time. <b>Since</b> the channel <b>continuously draws</b> water, constantly replenishing its supply, even if it does so at a slow rate, one will <b>say</b> to himself that even <b>if</b> the entire field <b>cannot be irrigated</b> from that water channel <b>on a single day, it can be irrigated</b> from it <b>over</b> the course of <b>two or three days.</b> Accordingly, he will not find it necessary to exert himself to quickly irrigate that portion of the field that did not already receive its water.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a pool</b> that receives <b>drips</b> of <b>water from this field that requires irrigation,</b> which itself receives water from a spring, <b>one is permitted to irrigate from</b> this pool <b>another field</b> situated below it <b>that requires irrigation.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the pool <b>likely to stop flowing,</b> which will force him to exert himself and draw water from somewhere else? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The case is where the upper field <b>is still trickling</b> water into the pool and does not stop. <b>Abaye said: And this</b> allowance applies only <b>when</b> the water from <b>the first spring</b> that irrigates the upper field <b>has not stopped</b> flowing. Only in that case can one rely on the water trickling from the upper field and consequently irrigating the lower field from the pool.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> With regard to <b>two garden beds</b> located <b>one above the other, one may not draw</b> water <b>from</b> the channel supplying <b>the lower</b> garden bed in order <b>to irrigate the upper</b> garden bed, due to the excessive exertion involved. <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon said: Even</b> in the case of <b>a single garden bed, half of which is lower and half of which is higher, one may not draw</b> water <b>from the</b> channel supplying <b>the lower area to irrigate the upper area,</b> even though they are two parts of the same garden bed.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may draw</b> water and irrigate <b>vegetables in order to eat them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>But if</b> he does this <b>in order</b> to improve their growth and <b>to enhance their</b> appearance <b>it is prohibited,</b> as he is considered to be unnecessarily exerting himself on the Festival.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina and Rabba Tosefa’a were</b> once <b>walking along the road</b> when <b>they saw a certain man that was drawing</b> water <b>with a bucket on the intermediate days of a Festival. Rabba Tosefa’a said to Ravina: Let the Master come and excommunicate him</b> for transgressing the words of the Sages. Ravina <b>said to him: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may draw for vegetables in order to eat them,</b> and so he has not committed a transgression. Rabba Tosefa’a <b>said to him: Do you maintain</b> that <b>what is</b> meant by <b>one may draw</b> [<b><i>madlin</i></b>] <b>is</b> that <b>one may draw water</b> in order to irrigate the vegetables? This is not so. Rather, <b>what is</b> meant by

Daf 4b

<b>one may draw</b> is that <b>one may pull out</b> some of the vegetables that are growing densely together. The <i>baraita</i> comes to teach that one is permitted to thin out a garden bed on the intermediate days of a Festival in order to eat on the Festival those that he removes, but he is prohibited to do so in order to enhance the appearance of those that remain. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 7:5): <b>One who thins out [<i>meidel</i>] the vines</b> in his vineyard, <b>just as he may thin out his own</b> vines, <b>so too, he may thin out</b> the vines set aside for <b>the poor.</b> Since he is doing it for the sake of the vines, he may also thin out what he leaves for the poor; this is <b>the statemen</b>t <b>of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says: His own</b> vines <b>he is permitted</b> to thin out, <b>but he is not permitted</b> to thin out the vines set aside <b>for the poor.</b> This mishna indicates that the term <i>meidel</i> can be used to mean thinning out and does not refer only to drawing water.
Ravina <b>said to</b> Rabba Tosefa’a: <b>But wasn’t it</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may draw water</b> to irrigate <b>vegetables in order to eat them?</b> Rabba Tosefa’a <b>said to him: If it is taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>, the <i>halakha</i> is as <b>it is taught,</b> and I retract my statement.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not construct circular ditches [<i>ugiyyot</i>]</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What are <i>ugiyyot</i>? Rav Yehuda said:</b> They are what are called in Aramaic <b><i>binkei</i>,</b> circular ditches around vines. The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are <i>ugiyyot</i>: <i>Bedidin</i>,</b> circular ditches <b>around the bases of olive trees and around the bases of grapevines.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so?</b> Is it prohibited to dig circular ditches on the intermediate days of the Festival? <b>Didn’t Rav Yehuda permit the family of bar Tzitai to construct circular ditches for their vineyards</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> source, i.e., the mishna that renders the practice prohibited, is referring to digging <b>new</b> ditches. <b>That</b> other source, i.e., Rav Yehuda’s ruling that permits the digging of such ditches, is referring to <b>old</b> ones, which merely need to be cleared.
§ It was taught in the next clause of the mishna that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One may not construct a new</b> water <b>channel</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival or during the Sabbatical Year. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is prohibited for him to do so on the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, because</b> in so doing <b>he</b> excessively <b>exerts himself</b> on the Festival. <b>But what is the reason</b> that this is prohibited during <b>the Sabbatical Year,</b> when only labors that enhance the growth of plants are prohibited?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Abba bar Memel disagreed with regard to this</b> issue. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> It is prohibited <b>because it appears</b> to others <b>as if he were hoeing</b> his field. As onlookers do not know that he is merely digging a water channel, they suspect him of working his land during the Sabbatical Year. <b>And</b> the other <b>one said:</b> It is prohibited <b>because he</b> thereby <b>prepares</b> the channel’s <b>banks for planting,</b> for when he digs out the channel, he piles the fresh soil that is fit for planting on its two banks.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical halakhic difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical halakhic difference <b>between them</b> in a case where <b>water comes</b> into the channel immediately <b>after he</b> digs it out. According to <b>the one who said</b> that digging a water channel is prohibited <b>because he</b> thereby <b>prepares its banks for planting, there is</b> still a prohibition, as here too, he piles the fresh soil on the channel’s banks. <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> it is prohibited <b>because it appears as if he were hoeing, there is no</b> prohibition here, as the immediate entry of water makes it obvious that he is digging a water channel.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> that digging a water channel is prohibited <b>because it appears as if he were hoeing, let him be concerned that</b> the digger thereby <b>prepares</b> the channel’s <b>banks for planting</b> and render digging prohibited in this case as well. <b>Rather,</b> the matter must be explained differently, such that <b>there is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where he takes</b> the earth that he excavates <b>from</b> the channel <b>and throws</b> it a considerable distance <b>outside. According to the one who said</b> that it is prohibited <b>because he</b> thereby <b>prepares</b> the channel’s <b>banks for planting, there is no</b> prohibition here, as he does not prepare them for planting. But <b>according to the one who said</b> it is prohibited <b>because it appears as if he were hoeing, there is</b> a prohibition here, as here too, it appears as if he were hoeing.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> that digging a water channel is prohibited <b>because he</b> thereby <b>prepares its banks for planting, let him be concerned that</b> the digger <b>appears as if he were hoeing.</b> The Gemara answers that this is not a concern, because it is <b>also</b> true of <b>one who hoes</b> that <b>when he takes</b> up a clump of earth, he <b>puts it down</b> again <b>in its place.</b> Consequently, since one throws the dug-up earth far away, it is immediately apparent that he is not engaged in hoeing but is rather digging a water channel.
<b>Ameimar would teach</b> this mishna as stating explicitly that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says that one may not dig a new water channel during the Sabbatical Year <b>because it appears as if he were hoeing</b> his field, <b>and he</b> therefore found <b>a difficulty between</b> this statement of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya and</b> another statement of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.</b> The difficulty is as follows: <b>Did Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>any</b> action <b>that</b> causes him to <b>appear as if he were hoeing is prohibited?</b>
One may <b>raise a contradiction</b> to this assertion from a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 3:3) that states: <b>A person</b> may pile <b>his manure</b> in his field during the Sabbatical Year so that it <b>becomes a storage</b> heap, and there is no cause for concern that it may appear as if he were fertilizing his field. <b>Rabbi Meir prohibits</b> this <b>unless he deepens</b> the storage area for the manure <b>three handbreadths</b> below the ground <b>or raises</b> it <b>three handbreadths</b> above the surface of the ground, so that it does not appear as if he were fertilizing his field. If <b>he</b> already <b>had a small amount</b> of manure in that heap from before the Sabbatical Year, <b>he may continue to add to it,</b> and there is no need for concern.
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya prohibits</b> piling his manure in his field <b>unless he deepens</b> the storage area for the manure <b>three</b> handbreadths below the surface of the ground, <b>or he raises</b> it <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>above</b> the surface, <b>or he places</b> it <b>on a rock.</b> In any event, it seems that according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, it is permitted for him to dig a hole in the ground in order to deposit his manure there, even though he might appear to be hoeing the ground.
<b>Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Abba bar Memel</b> both offered resolutions to this difficulty: <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> The case in this second mishna is one <b>where he</b> had already <b>deepened</b> the three-handbreadth pit during the sixth year. <b>And</b> the other <b>one said: His</b> pile of <b>manure is proof</b> that he intends merely to bury the manure and not to hoe the field.
§ It was taught in the mishna that the Rabbis say: <b>One may repair a damaged</b> water channel <b>during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. What is</b> meant by <b>a damaged</b> water channel? <b>Rabbi Abba said that if it was</b> now <b>a handbreadth deep</b> because it had become filled with sediment, he may dredge it out until <b>he sets it at</b> its original depth of <b>six handbreadths.</b>
Based on this ruling, the Gemara clarifies several practical issues: It is <b>obvious</b> that if the channel is <b>half a handbreadth</b> deep and he wants to restore it to a depth <b>of three handbreadths, since water does not flow</b> through a three-handbreadth-deep channel in sufficient quantity, <b>it is nothing</b> at all and it is certainly prohibited to exert oneself with work that provides insignificant benefit. So too, if the channel is <b>two handbreadths</b> deep and he wants to deepen it <b>to twelve handbreadths,</b> even though he preserves the same ratio as in Rabbi Abba’s case, <b>since it involves excessive exertion, no,</b> this is also not permitted.
However, in a case where the channel is <b>two handbreadths</b> deep and he wants to deepen it <b>to seven</b> handbreadths, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question of whether this can be compared to the case in the mishna: <b>Here,</b> in the case of dredging a one-handbreadth-deep channel to restore its depth of six handbreadths, <b>he deepens</b> the channel by <b>five</b> handbreadths, <b>and</b> similarly <b>here,</b> in the case of deepening the channel from two to seven handbreadths, <b>he</b> likewise wants to <b>deepen</b> it by <b>five</b> handbreadths, and therefore it should be permitted. <b>Or perhaps, since there is an extra handbreadth</b> of depth, then bending over to dig that additional handbreadth <b>involves greater effort,</b> which is unnecessary, and so possibly it should be prohibited. The Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
It was related that <b>Abaye permitted the people of Bar Hamdakh to remove</b> the branches of the trees from <b>the river</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya permitted the people of Sekhavta to dredge out a river that had become blocked. Rav Ashi permitted</b> his townsmen, <b>the people of Mata Meḥasya, to clean out the</b> nearby <b>Burnitz River. He said: Since the public drinks from it, it is considered like a public</b> need, <b>and we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>one may tend to all</b> other <b>public needs</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.
§ It was taught in the mishna: During the intermediate days of a Festival <b>one may repair</b>

Daf 5a

<b>damaged water</b> cisterns <b>in the public domain and</b> clean them out by removing the dirt and sediment that has accumulated in them. The Gemara infers: <b>Cleaning</b> out the cisterns of dirt and sediment during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>is</b> indeed permitted, but <b>digging</b> a new cistern <b>is not</b> permitted.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught</b> that it is prohibited to dig new cisterns <b>only when the public does not need them; but if the public needs them, even digging</b> new cisterns <b>is permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And when the public needs them, is</b> digging really <b>permitted? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may clean</b> out <b>cisterns, ditches, and caves of an individual</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>and, needless to say,</b> one may clean out those <b>of the public. But one may not dig</b> new <b>cisterns, ditches, or caves of the public</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>and, needless to say,</b> one may not dig those <b>of an individual. What, is it not</b> so that this <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the public needs them,</b> but nevertheless digging new cisterns, ditches, and caves is prohibited?
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>No,</b> this <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the public does not need them.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: It would follow that <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to</b> the cisterns of <b>an individual,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where <b>the individual does not need them.</b> But in that case, <b>is cleaning</b> them out really <b>permitted? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may gather water into</b> the <b>cisterns, ditches, and caves of an individual, but one may not clean</b> them out <b>or plaster their cracks; but</b> for those <b>of the public, one may</b> indeed <b>clean</b> out <b>and plaster their cracks?</b> This indicates that on the intermediate days of a Festival, unneeded cisterns belonging to an individual may not even be cleaned out.
The Gemara rejects this difficulty: <b>Rather,</b> to <b>what</b> case does the first <i>baraita</i> refer? Is it referring to a case <b>where the individual needs</b> the cisterns? If so, then <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to</b> cisterns of <b>the public,</b> the <i>baraita</i> would be referring to a case where <b>the public needs them.</b> But in that case, <b>is digging</b> new cisterns really <b>prohibited? Isn’t it taught</b> in yet another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may gather water into cisterns, ditches, and caves of an individual, and one may clean them</b> out, <b>but one may not plaster their cracks, clear</b> earth <b>into them</b> in order to fill in the cracks, or <b>lime them with lime</b> so that they hold water. <b>But</b> with regard to those <b>of the public, one may</b> even <b>dig them out and lime them with lime.</b> Therefore, in a case where the public needs them, it is permitted to dig out public cisterns.
<b>But</b> if so, <b>the first</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that one may not dig new cisterns even for the public, is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted by this last <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>Answer</b> the difficulty and explain the first <i>baraita</i> <b>as follows: One may clean</b> out <b>cisterns,</b> ditches, and caves <b>of an individual</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>when the individual needs them; and needless to say,</b> one may clean out those <b>of the public when the public needs them, as even digging</b> new cisterns <b>is permitted</b> when the public needs them.
<b>But one may not dig cisterns, ditches and caves for the public when the public does not need them. And needless to say,</b> one may not dig them <b>for an individual, as when an individual does not need</b> the cisterns on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>even cleaning them</b> out <b>is prohibited.</b> In this way all of the seemingly contradictory sources can be reconciled.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The wording of <b>the mishna is also precise,</b> indicating that when there is a public need for such cisterns, they may be dug even on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>As it teaches: One may tend to all</b> other <b>public needs. What</b> does the word <b>all</b> come <b>to add</b> that was not stated explicitly? <b>Does it not</b> come <b>to add the digging</b> of cisterns, which is permitted?
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>No,</b> the word all comes <b>to add that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: On the intermediate days of a Festival, agents of the court <b>go out to clear thorns from the road, and to repair the</b> city <b>streets and highways [<i>isterata’ot</i>], and to measure the ritual baths</b> to ascertain that they have the requisite quantity of water. <b>And</b> if <b>any ritual bath does not contain forty <i>se’a</i>,</b> the minimal measure for ritual purification, <b>they direct [<i>margilin</i>]</b> a stream of water <b>into it,</b> such that it flows over the ground before entering the bath, so as not to disqualify the water as drawn water until it holds <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> agents of the court <b>did not go out and do all these</b> repairs, <b>that</b> with regard to <b>any blood that is shed there</b> on account of their negligence, <b>the verse ascribes to them</b> guilt <b>as if they had shed it? The verse states</b> with regard to the cities of refuge that offer protection to someone who committed inadvertent manslaughter: “That innocent blood be not shed in your land, which the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance, <b>and so blood be upon you”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:10). The Gemara maintains that the mishna uses the word all to allude to the cases mentioned in this <i>baraita</i>, and not to the digging of public cisterns.
The Gemara questions this: <b>But</b> these additional cases <b>are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna: <b>One may repair the roads, streets, and ritual baths, and one may tend to all</b> other <b>public needs. What</b> does this last phrase come <b>to add? Does it not</b> come to <b>add the digging</b> of cisterns needed by the public? The Gemara agrees: <b>Conclude from this</b> that the mishna means to permit the digging of new cisterns when they are needed by the public.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>One may mark graves</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival so that passersby will know to avoid them and not become ritually impure. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: Where is there an allusion in the Torah to the marking of graves? The verse states:</b> “And when they that pass through shall pass through the land, <b>and any see a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it”</b> (Ezekiel 39:15). Ezekiel prophesies that at some future time, the Jewish people will erect signs over the strewn remains of the dead so that others will know to avoid ritual impurity.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Before</b> the prophet <b>Ezekiel came</b> and alluded to this obligation, <b>who said</b> that graves must be marked? Even before the time of Ezekiel, people were careful with regard to ritual impurity. Rav Ashi responded: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that Ezekiel was introducing a new <i>halakha</i>, the same question can be raised with regard to <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rav Ḥisda said.</b> As Rav Ḥisda said with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one who is uncircumcised or an apostate may not serve in the Temple: <b>This matter we did not learn from the Torah of Moses our teacher,</b> but rather, <b>we learned</b> it <b>from the words of</b> the prophet <b>Ezekiel ben Buzi,</b> who said of such individuals: <b>“No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My Sanctuary to serve Me”</b> (Ezekiel 44:9).
Here too, one can ask: <b>Before Ezekiel came, who said</b> that such individuals cannot serve in the Temple? <b>Rather,</b> you must say that originally <b>they learned it as a tradition</b> and it was an accepted <i>halakha</i> for generations, <b>and</b> then <b>Ezekiel came and based it on a verse. Here too,</b> with regard to the obligation to mark graves, <b>they</b> originally <b>learned it as a tradition, and</b> then <b>Ezekiel came and based it on a verse.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> An allusion to the marking of graves may be derived <b>from here:</b> “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and <b>shall cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). This verse teaches that <b>impurity cries out</b> to the passerby <b>and tells him: Remove yourself.</b> The leper must inform others of his status so that they know not to come into contact with him and thereby maintain their ritual purity. So too, in our case, graves must be marked so that others will know to avoid them and prevent contracting ritual impurity. <b>And similarly, Rabbi Uzziel, grandson of Rabbi Uzziel the Great, said: Impurity cries out</b> to the passerby <b>and tells him: Remove yourself.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> verse, <b>does it come to teach this</b> idea? <b>That</b> verse <b>is needed for that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall cry: Impure, impure”;</b> this teaches that the leper <b>must inform the public of his distress, and the public will pray for mercy on his behalf.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If it is so</b> that the verse comes to teach only one idea, <b>let it write: And he shall cry: Impure. What</b> is to be derived the repetition of <b>impure, impure? Learn from this</b> reiteration <b>two</b> ideas: First, that the leper must inform the public of his pain so that others will pray on his behalf, and second, that he must warn the public to stay away so that they avoid coming into contact with him and contracting ritual impurity.
<b>Abaye said:</b> An allusion to the marking of graves may be learned <b>from here,</b> as it is written: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). <b>Rav Pappa said</b> the obligation is alluded to in the verse: <b>“And He will say: Pave, pave, clear the way,</b> take up the stumbling block out of the way of My people” (Isaiah 57:14), which indicates that roads must be cleared of all obstacles and hazards.
<b>Rav Ḥinnana said:</b> This may be derived from the end of that very same verse: <b>“Take up the stumbling block from the way of My people”</b> (Isaiah 57:14). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> This may be derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall show them the way in which they must walk”</b> (Exodus 18:20), i.e., you must properly repair the roads, which includes marking graves.
<b>Mar Zutra said</b> that an allusion to this obligation is found in the verse <b>“Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 15:31), which indicates that people must be warned to stay away from that which could cause them to become ritually impure. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall keep My charge”</b> (Leviticus 18:30), which means that you must <b>establish a safeguard for My charge,</b> i.e., protective measures must be enacted to prevent people from transgressing <i>halakha</i>, a task that includes distancing people from ritual impurity by marking off graves, so that they not come to convey ritual impurity to <i>teruma</i> or other consecrated items.
And finally, <b>Ravina said:</b> This obligation is alluded to by the verse <b>“And to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God”</b> (Psalms 50:23), meaning that one must mark the pathways that are ritually pure and upon which it is appropriate to walk.
With regard to the verse from Psalms cited above, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Whoever appraises his ways</b> in this world and contemplates how to act in the most appropriate way possible <b>merits seeing the salvation of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “And to him who orders his way.” Do not read</b> it as <b><i>vesam</i>,</b> who orders; <b>rather,</b> read it as <b><i>vesham</i>,</b> and appraises. With this reading, the verse indicates that one who appraises his ways, <b>him will I show the salvation of God.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yannai had a certain student who would raise difficulties</b> with his teachings <b>every day</b> as they were learning. <b>On Shabbat of a Festival,</b> when the broader public would come to hear the lesson, the student <b>would not raise</b> any <b>difficulties,</b> lest Rabbi Yannai lack an immediate answer and suffer embarrassment.

Daf 5b

Rabbi Yannai <b>read</b> this verse <b>about him: “And to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God”</b> (Psalms 50:23), for he considered his conduct and determined when it was inappropriate to challenge his master.
§ With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of marking graves, <b>the Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: The courts <b>do not mark</b> the area <b>of an olive-bulk of a corpse; nor of a bone</b> that is the size of a <b>barleygrain-bulk; nor of</b> any <b>item that</b> imparts impurity only through physical contact but <b>does not impart ritual impurity by means of a tent</b> to an individual or object that it overshadows, or that is overshadowed by it, or that is found together with it under the same structure. <b>But they do mark</b> the area of <b>the spine</b> of a corpse, <b>the skull,</b> or the bones that comprise <b>the majority of the</b> skeletal <b>structure or the majority of the number</b> of bones in the body.
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>they do not mark</b> the area <b>of certain</b> ritual impurity, i.e., a place that is known to all as ritually impure, <b>but they do mark</b> a place <b>of uncertain</b> ritual impurity. <b>And these are the</b> places of <b>uncertain</b> ritual impurity: <b>Overhanging boughs, protrusions, and a <i>beit haperas</i>. And they do not erect the marker</b> directly <b>over the site of the ritual impurity, so as not to cause a loss of ritually pure</b> food items, as one who is carrying such food might inadvertently walk up to the site of ritual impurity and only then notice the marker, after the food has already contracted impurity. <b>Similarly, they do not distance the marker from the</b> actual <b>site of ritual impurity, so as not to cause a loss of Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., so as not to increase the area into which individuals refrain from entering.
The Gemara begins to analyze this <i>baraita</i> by asking: <b>Is it</b> really <b>so that an olive-bulk of a corpse does not impart ritual impurity by means of a tent? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:1): <b>These are</b> the items <b>that impart ritual impurity by means of a tent,</b> and among other items this list includes <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse?</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the piece of flesh <b>is exactly an olive-bulk, which,</b> as it decays, <b>will ultimately diminish</b> in size to less than an olive-bulk. Accordingly, <b>it is preferable that <i>teruma</i> and consecrated items be burned because of it for the time being,</b> in a case where one inadvertently encounters this impurity because it was not marked and consequently one must burn any <i>teruma</i> or consecrated items that became ritually impure, <b>and not be burned because of it forever</b> afterward. After some time the piece of flesh will be less than an olive-bulk, yet if the area is marked, people will continue to burn <i>teruma</i> or consecrated items because of it, as, due to the marking, they will assume that ritual impurity was imparted by means of a tent.
The Gemara continues to explicate the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And these are the</b> places of <b>uncertain</b> ritual impurity: <b>Overhanging boughs, and protrusions,</b> and a <i>beit haperas</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>Overhanging boughs</b> is referring to <b>a tree that hangs over the ground</b> next to a cemetery, and under one of its branches there might be a corpse. If there is a corpse there, the branch overhanging it creates a tent and therefore imparts ritual impurity to anyone who passes underneath it.
<b>Protrusions</b> is referring to <b>protruding stones that jut out from a wall</b> and are not flush with it, under which there might be a corpse. Once again, if the stones protrude over a corpse, they create a tent and impart ritual impurity to anyone who passes underneath.
The definition of a <b><i>beit haperas</i></b> is <b>as we learned</b> elsewhere in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 17:1): <b>One who plows</b> a field containing <b>a grave,</b> thereby raising concern that bones may have become strewn throughout the field, <b>renders</b> the field <b>a <i>beit haperas</i>. And how much</b> of the field <b>does he render</b> a <i>beit haperas</i>? <b>The full</b> length of <b>a furrow,</b> which is <b>a hundred cubits.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Does a <i>beit haperas</i></b> really <b>impart ritual impurity by means of a tent? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>a person</b> is carrying ritually pure items or wishes to remain ritually pure so that he may consume consecrated items, yet he must cross a <i>beit haperas</i>, he <b>may blow upon</b> the earth in <b>the <i>beit haperas</i></b> before each step to clear away any small bones that may have become strewn across the field <b>and</b> proceed to <b>walk</b> across the area, thereby remaining ritually pure. This indicates that there is no concern about contracting ritual impurity by means of a tent in a <i>beit haperas</i>; otherwise, it would be prohibited to cross in this way, as it is possible that in the course of blowing one may already have contracted ritual impurity by leaning over the bones or by passing over bones that are buried beneath the surface.
Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: A <i>beit haperas</i> that was trampled,</b> i.e., a well-trodden <i>beit haperas</i>, <b>is ritually pure,</b> as passersby have certainly cleared away any bones with their feet. If a <i>beit haperas</i> were to impart ritual impurity by means of a tent, there should be a concern that the bones may have been trampled upon and buried in the ground. Both these sources prove that a <i>beit haperas</i> does not impart impurity by means of tent, posing a contradiction to the mishna.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>not difficult,</b> as a distinction can be made between different types of <i>beit haperas</i>: <b>Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that a <i>beit haperas</i> must be marked because it imparts tent impurity, it is referring to <b>a field in which a grave was lost,</b> i.e., a field that was known with certainty to contain a grave, though its precise location can no longer be recalled. <b>There,</b> where it ruled that a <i>beit haperas</i> does not convey tent impurity, it is a case of <b>a field where a grave was plowed</b> and it is not at all clear whether there are bones strewn across the field. In that case ritual impurity is not imparted by means of a tent, and so it need not be marked.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is a field where a grave was plowed called a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> such that one must be concerned about its ritual impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and so we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 18:2–4): <b>There are three</b> types of <b><i>beit haperas</i></b> through which those who eat <i>teruma</i> and consecrated items are prohibited to walk: <b>A field in which a grave was lost</b> and its precise location is no longer known, <b>a field in which a grave was plowed</b> and bones may have been scattered about, <b>and a weepers’ field.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>a weepers’ field? Rav Yehoshua bar Abba said in the name of Ulla: A field where</b> those escorting the deceased <b>would take leave of the deceased,</b> handing the corpse over to those who would perform the actual interment.
<b>And what is the reason</b> that one must be concerned about ritual impurity in a weepers’ field? <b>Avimi said:</b> It is <b>due to the</b> possible <b>despair by the owners</b> of recovering bones that the Sages <b>touched</b> upon <b>it.</b> There is a concern that in transporting the deceased from far away, a loose limb may have fallen from the corpse into the field, and unseen by those transporting the deceased, it was abandoned there. Since over time many corpses passed through this weepers’ field, it is assumed that ritual impurity might be found in many places throughout the field.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does a field in which a grave was plowed not require marking? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one encountered a field that was marked</b> due to ritual impurity, <b>and it is no</b> longer <b>known what the nature of the</b> ritual impurity <b>was, if there are trees in</b> the field, <b>it is known that a grave was plowed in it,</b> as it is permitted for one to plant trees in such a field. <b>If there are no trees in</b> the field, <b>it is known that a grave was lost in it,</b> as it is prohibited for one to plant trees in such a field. If a field is suitable for planting trees and yet there are none, clearly it is because a grave was lost in it.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> We do not rely on these signs <b>unless there is an Elder or</b> a rabbinic <b>scholar</b> who can testify about the subject, <b>as not all are experts in this matter,</b> and perhaps the field was not plowed at all. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> teaches that a field in which a grave was plowed is also marked.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Pappa said: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> concerning a marked field <b>is taught,</b> it is taught with regard to <b>a field where a grave was</b> certainly <b>lost</b> and <b>they</b> immediately <b>marked it.</b> However, <b>if there are trees in</b> the field, <b>it is known that a grave was</b> later <b>plowed in it,</b> i.e., it was forgotten that a grave had been lost in the field and so it was inappropriately plowed and prepared for planting. But <b>if there are no trees in</b> the field, <b>we know that a grave was lost in it</b> and it was not later plowed.
The Gemara raises a question about this ruling: <b>But let us be concerned that perhaps the trees were</b> located <b>inside</b> the field <b>and the grave was</b> located <b>outside</b> of it, and the actual site of the grave was never plowed but simply lost? How then can one rely on the presence of trees to indicate that the grave had been plowed in the field?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Ulla said</b> elsewhere. This is a case <b>where</b> the trees <b>are standing along the</b> field’s <b>boundaries,</b> next to a public domain, as the grave is certainly not outside the trees in the public domain, since people do not bury a corpse in the public thoroughfare. Rather, the grave must be between the trees, and was therefore plowed. <b>Here too</b>, then, this is a case <b>where</b> the trees <b>are standing along the borders.</b>

Daf 6a

The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps the ritual impurity was on the inside and the trees were on the outside,</b> and only the area between the trees was plowed, while the inner portion of the field with the grave was not plowed?
The Gemara answers: The case is where the trees are <b>scattered</b> throughout the entire field, so that it is likely that the entire field was plowed. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: This is not a concern, as <b>we said</b> earlier that <b>one does not distance the marker</b> too far <b>from the</b> actual <b>site of ritual impurity, so as not to cause a loss of Eretz Yisrael.</b> As the marker is located near the trees, presumably the trees are close to the actual site of the grave, and the site of the grave was plowed.
It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One relies on these signs <b>only</b> when <b>there is an Elder or</b> a rabbinic <b>scholar</b> who can testify about the matter, <b>as not all are well versed in this matter,</b> and perhaps the field was not plowed at all. <b>Abaye said: Learn from this</b> statement of Rabbi Yehuda that when <b>there is a Torah scholar in the city, all affairs of the city are thrust upon him,</b> i.e., are his responsibility. Consequently, he is expected to know what has happened in the city.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of marking graves. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one found</b> a single <b>marked stone,</b> this indicates that the ground <b>underneath it is ritually impure.</b> If he found <b>two</b> marked stones, the following distinction applies: <b>If there is lime</b> on the ground <b>between them,</b> this indicates that the area <b>between them is ritually impure</b> and the two stones mark the boundaries of the impure area; <b>and if there is no lime</b> on the ground <b>between them,</b> this indicates that the area <b>between them is ritually pure</b> and each stone marks a separate area of ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the area between them deemed ritually pure <b>even though there is no</b> sign of <b>plowing</b> having taken place between the stones? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>If one found a single marked stone,</b> this indicates that the ground <b>underneath it is ritually impure.</b> If he found <b>two</b> marked stones, then the following distinction applies: <b>If there is</b> evidence of <b>plowing</b> having taken place <b>between them,</b> the area <b>between</b> the two stones <b>is ritually pure; and if not,</b> the area <b>between them is ritually impure.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The contradiction can be resolved by explaining that <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the case is <b>where the lime</b> used as a marker of ritual impurity <b>had been poured on top</b> of the stones, <b>and it is spread thinly this way and that.</b> In this case, <b>if there is</b> evidence of <b>plowing</b> having taken place <b>between</b> the stones, the area <b>between them is ritually pure, as one</b> can <b>say</b> that the lime <b>was peeled off</b> from the stones <b>due to the plowing;</b> originally the lime was only on top of the stones, to indicate that there is ritual impurity underneath them, but then fell into the area between them during the plowing. <b>But if</b> there is <b>no</b> evidence of a plow having passed between them, then it is most likely that <b>the lime was</b> meant to mark the ground <b>between</b> the stones, and the entire area between them <b>is ritually impure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Asi said:</b> If only <b>one border</b> of a field <b>is marked,</b> it is assumed that the border itself <b>is ritually impure while the entire</b> rest of the <b>field is ritually pure.</b> If <b>two</b> borders are marked, it is assumed that <b>they are</b> both <b>ritually impure while the entire</b> rest of the <b>field is ritually pure.</b> If <b>three</b> borders are marked, it is assumed that the three of <b>them are ritually impure while the entire</b> rest of the <b>field is ritually pure.</b> If all <b>four</b> borders are marked, the borders themselves <b>are ritually pure, while the entire field</b> enclosed by the borders <b>is ritually impure.</b>
<b>As the Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not distance the marker from the</b> actual <b>site of ritual impurity, so as not to cause a loss of Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., not to increase the area into which people refrain from entering. Consequently, they marked all of the borders to indicate that the entire field is ritually impure.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> inspectors <b>even go out</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of prohibited <b>diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>]</b> that grew in the fields during the rainy season.
The Gemara asks: <b>Do they go out to</b> uproot <b>diverse kinds during the intermediate days of a Festival?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:1), which states: <b>On the first of Adar</b> the court <b>issues a proclamation concerning</b> the collection of <b>the shekels,</b> i.e., the yearly half-shekel contribution to the Temple treasury made by each adult male for the purpose of buying communal offerings. <b>And</b> the court also issues a proclamation <b>with regard to</b> the obligation to uproot <b>diverse kinds</b> from the fields.
<b>On the fifteenth of</b> Adar <b>the Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, <b>is read in the</b> walled <b>cities, and they go out to clear thorns</b> from the <b>roads, to repair the</b> city <b>streets, and to measure the ritual baths</b> to ascertain that they have the requisite quantity of water. <b>And they tend to all</b> other <b>public needs, and they mark graves</b> with lime, <b>and they go out to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of <b>diverse kinds.</b> If they already went out in Adar to uproot the diverse kinds, why would they go out again on the intermediate days of the festival of Passover?
<b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> disagreed about this issue: <b>One said: Here,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the fifteenth of Adar, it is referring to <b>the early crop,</b> while <b>there,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the intermediate days of the Festival, it is referring to <b>the late crop,</b> which isn’t clearly recognizable until the intermediate days of Passover. <b>And one said: Here,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the fifteenth of Adar, it is referring to <b>grains</b> that are sown in the winter and have already grown tall by Adar, while <b>there,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the intermediate days of the Festival, it is referring to <b>vegetables,</b> which only grow later in the season.
<b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught</b> that court messengers go out to uproot diverse kinds in the middle of the month of Adar <b>only</b> in a case <b>where the blossom was not</b> yet <b>recognizable</b> at an earlier date, so it was still impossible to determine whether or not the seedling was from diverse kinds of seeds. <b>But</b> if <b>the blossom was</b> already <b>recognizable</b> at an earlier date, <b>they go out</b> at that time to uproot the shoots of diverse kinds of seeds.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about the intermediate days of a Festival that we</b> specifically <b>go out</b> to uproot shoots of diverse kinds of seeds during that week? <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>due to the wages</b> paid to the workers hired by the court to uproot the diverse kinds. On the intermediate days of the Festival it is prohibited for them to perform ordinary labor, and so <b>they reduce</b> their rates <b>for us,</b> i.e., for public works, as otherwise they would have no income at all.
<b>Rav Zevid said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Mesharshiyya</b> who <b>said: Learn from this</b> explanation <b>that when we give</b> the workers who uproot the diverse kinds their <b>wages, we give</b> it <b>to them from</b> the funds of <b>the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> Since they are paid with consecrated money, an attempt is made to minimize the expenses. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we pay them from theirs,</b> i.e., the court forces the owners of the fields where the diverse kinds are found to pay the workers who uproot them, <b>what</b> benefit <b>would we derive from</b> saving the expense? <b>However much</b> the workers <b>desire, they should pay them.</b>
Concerning the issue of uprooting diverse kinds, the Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> of another species must be mixed in with a crop in order to be considered diverse kinds that must be uprooted by these workers? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The amount is <b>like that which we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:1): <b>Any <i>se’a</i></b> of seeds <b>that contains</b>

Daf 6b

<b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> or more <b>of seeds of a different type,</b> i.e., one twenty-fourth of the mixture is a type of seed other than the main type, <b>one must reduce</b> the other type of seeds in the mixture by uprooting the shoots.
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that inspectors must go out and uproot the shoots of diverse kinds of seeds that grew in the fields, the Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages <b>ordained that they should pronounce</b> the crop of <b>the entire field</b> in which diverse kinds was found <b>ownerless,</b> rather than uprooting the diverse kinds? The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna, where it says that the inspectors go out and uproot the diverse kinds, it is referring to the time <b>before the</b> institution of the new <b>ordinance; there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, where it says that the entire field is pronounced ownerless, it is referring to the time <b>after the</b> institution of that <b>ordinance.</b>
The Gemara explains this ordinance <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first,</b> the agents of the court <b>would uproot</b> the diverse kinds <b>and cast them before the livestock</b> belonging to the owners of the fields. However, <b>the property holders would rejoice for two</b> reasons: <b>One, that</b> the agents of the court <b>weeded their fields for them</b> when they uprooted the plants of the other type; and another <b>one, that they cast</b> the diverse kinds <b>before their livestock,</b> thereby saving them from having to feed them. Accordingly, the field owners took no steps to keep their fields free of diverse kinds of seeds.
The Sages, therefore, <b>ordained that</b> the agents of the court <b>should uproot</b> the diverse kinds <b>and cast</b> them <b>on the roads.</b> Yet the property holders <b>would still greatly rejoice that</b> the agents of the court <b>weeded their fields</b> free of charge. Finally, the Sages <b>ordained that they should pronounce</b> the crop of <b>the entire field</b> in which diverse kinds was found <b>ownerless.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In a field that is filled with trees, <b>one may draw water</b> via channels <b>from</b> one <b>tree to</b> another <b>tree</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival because trees are in dire need of water. <b>And</b> this is permitted <b>provided that</b> in doing so <b>he does not water the entire field.</b> With regard to <b>plants that were not watered prior to the Festival, one may not water them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival</b> because they do not need the water. <b>But the Rabbis permit</b> watering in <b>this</b> case, i.e., trees, <b>and that</b> case, i.e., plants.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said: If the field was moist [<i>metunenet</i>]</b> before the Festival but in the meantime it dried up, <b>it is permitted</b> to water the entire field even according to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. <b>That</b> ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they said</b> that <b>it is prohibited to water them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, they said this only with regard to plants that were not watered</b> at all <b>before the Festival. However,</b> with regard to <b>plants that were</b> already <b>watered before the Festival</b> and had begun to grow, <b>it is permitted to water them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival</b> because failure to water them would lead to substantial financial loss.
<b>And if the field was moist</b> before the Festival, <b>it is permitted</b> to water it even if the field had not been watered prior to the Festival. <b>And one may not water a dry field on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. But the Rabbis permit</b> watering <b>this and that,</b> i.e., plants that were not watered before the Festival and a dry field.
<b>Ravina said: Learn from here that one is permitted to sprinkle a garden [<i>tarbitza</i>]</b> with water <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> Ravina explains how he arrived at this conclusion: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Rabbis permit one to water <b>a dry field</b> despite the fact that the plants will not die from a lack of moisture? This is because watering the field in advance <b>turns a late crop into an early crop.</b> It can be understood from this that the late ripening of a crop is considered a substantial financial loss that serves as a reason to permit labor that would otherwise be prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a garden, sprinkling it with water <b>turns a late crop into an early crop,</b> and so it is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may sprinkle</b> water in <b>a field of grain during the Sabbatical Year, but not on the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may sprinkle</b> water in a field of grain <b>both on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival and during the Sabbatical Year? Rav Huna said: This</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> that prohibits sprinkling water in a field of grain on the intermediate days of a Festival is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> who prohibits watering an entire field. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> that permits it is in accordance with the more lenient opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may sprinkle</b> water in <b>a white field on the eve of the Sabbatical Year so that vegetables will sprout during the Sabbatical Year; and not only that, but one may sprinkle</b> water in <b>a field of grain</b> even <b>during the Sabbatical Year</b> itself, <b>so that vegetables will sprout upon the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year.</b> Since sprinkling water is not regarded as full-fledged agricultural labor, it is permitted as long as the sprinkling and the sprouting of the vegetables do not both occur during the Sabbatical Year itself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may trap moles</b> [<b><i>ishut</i></b>] <b>and mice in an orchard and in a field of grain in his</b> usual <b>manner,</b> i.e., as he would trap them all year round, both <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival and during the Sabbatical Year. But the Rabbis say: In an orchard</b> he may trap them <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner, but in a field of grain,</b> where there is no danger of substantial financial loss, he may only trap them in a way that is <b>not his</b> usual <b>manner.</b>
<b>And one may seal a breach</b> in the wall of his garden <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, and during the Sabbatical Year one may</b> even <b>build</b> a wall <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner,</b> as this is not considered an agricultural labor. Consequently, despite the fact that this benefits the garden by offering it protection, it is not prohibited during the Sabbatical Year.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term <b><i>ishut</i>? Rav Yehuda said:</b> An <i>ishut</i> is <b>a creature that has no eyes,</b> a rodent that digs holes in the ground and can cause damage to roots and vegetables. <b>Rava bar Yishmael said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya</b> who <b>said: What is the verse</b> that indicates the identity of the <i>ishut</i>? <b>“As a snail that melts and disappears; like the fall of a young mole [<i>eshet</i>] that has not seen the sun”</b> (Psalms 58:9). It is understood that this creature has not seen the sun because it does not have eyes.
The Gemara expands upon the <i>halakha</i> recorded in the mishna. <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may trap moles and mice in a field of grain and in an orchard in his</b> usual <b>manner, and one may destroy ant holes</b> so that the ants will cause no damage. <b>How does one destroy</b> ant holes? <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One brings soil from this</b> ant <b>hole and places it in that</b> ant <b>hole, and</b> since the ants from the two nests are not familiar with each other, <b>they strangle each other.</b>
<b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya said in the name of Abaye: And this</b> advice works only in certain circumstances: <b>When</b> the ant holes <b>are</b> located <b>on two</b> opposite <b>sides of a river, when there is no bridge</b> connecting the two sides, <b>when there is not</b> even <b>a plank</b> bridge over the water, <b>and when there is not</b> even <b>a rope</b> stretched taut across the river. If there is any connection whatsoever between the two sides of the river, the ants from the two nests are likely to recognize each other and not fight.

Daf 7a

<b>Up to what</b> distance are the ant holes considered to be adjacent such that a river is required in order to separate between them? <b>Up to a parasang</b> [<b><i>parsa</i></b>].
§ We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: In an orchard</b> one may trap moles and mice <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner, but in a field of grain,</b> he may trap them only in a way that is <b>not his</b> usual <b>manner. The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> does one trap <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner? He digs a hole</b> in the ground <b>and hangs a trap in it. How</b> does one trap in a way that is <b>not his</b> usual <b>manner? He inserts a spit</b> into the ground where the rodents are suspected of hiding, <b>strikes</b> it <b>with a spade, and removes the earth from beneath it</b> until he finds and kills the rodents.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: When they said</b> that one may trap moles and mice <b>in a field of grain</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival only in a way that is <b>not his</b> usual <b>manner, they spoke only with regard to a field of grain</b> that is <b>adjacent to the city,</b> where the damage is limited to that field and is not extensive. <b>But in a field of grain</b> that is <b>adjacent to an orchard,</b> one may trap <b>even in his</b> usual <b>manner, lest</b> the moles and mice <b>leave the field of grain and destroy the trees</b> in the adjacent orchard, causing great damage.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And one may seal a breach</b> in the wall of his garden <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How does one seal</b> such a breach? <b>Rav Yosef said: With palm branches [<i>hutza</i>] and</b> the branches of a <b>bay tree [<i>dafna</i>],</b> which do not create a significant partition, but simply a temporary barrier.
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One fills</b> in the breach <b>with stone, but he does not plaster</b> the stones <b>with clay. Rav Ḥisda said: They taught</b> that he may seal a breach but not build a wall in his usual manner <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the wall of a garden,</b> as no significant loss will be suffered if he delays building until after the Festival. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>the wall of a courtyard,</b> which prevents the entry of strangers who are likely to steal from him, <b>he may build</b> a wall <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> even on the intermediate days of a Festival.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> Rav Ḥisda’s statement: With regard to <b>a wall that is leaning [<i>goḥeh</i>] toward the public domain</b> and is likely to fall, <b>one may demolish and rebuild</b> it <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>due to the danger</b> that it poses to passersby. The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>There, the reason is as</b> the <i>baraita</i> explicitly <b>teaches,</b> i.e., it is <b>due to the danger</b> that the wall poses to passersby, and not due to the protection that it affords the courtyard.
<b>And some say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> was cited not to support Rav Ḥisda’s opinion but in order to refute it, as follows: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a wall that is leaning toward the public domain</b> and is likely to fall, <b>one may demolish and rebuild</b> it <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner, due to the danger</b> that it poses to passersby. The Gemara explains: The <i>baraita</i> indicates that if the need to build the wall is <b>due to the danger</b> that it poses, <b>yes,</b> he is permitted to rebuild the wall, but if the reason is <b>not due to the danger, no,</b> he is not permitted to do so. <b>Shall we say that this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who says that one may build the wall of his courtyard in his usual manner, even if no danger is present?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> could have <b>said to you: There,</b> in the case where the existing wall poses a danger, <b>he is</b> even permitted to <b>demolish</b> the wall <b>and build</b> it from scratch. <b>Here,</b> in the case of an ordinary wall enclosing a courtyard, <b>he is permitted to build</b> the breached wall in the usual manner, <b>but not to demolish</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> in the case of the leaning wall, let us say that he is permitted <b>to demolish</b> it and thereby remove the danger, <b>but not to rebuild</b> it until after the Festival. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, he might refrain</b> even <b>from demolishing</b> it, as demolishing the wall would leave his courtyard unprotected. Therefore, to eliminate the danger posed by the leaning wall, he is permitted not only to demolish it, but to rebuild it as well.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The wording of <b>the mishna is also precise</b> and indicates that it is referring to the wall of a garden, as understood by Rav Ḥisda, <b>as it teaches: During the Sabbatical Year one may</b> even <b>build in his</b> usual <b>manner.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Where</b> is the wall to which the mishna refers? <b>If we say</b> that the mishna is referring to the wall <b>of a courtyard, need it be said</b> that it may be built during the Sabbatical Year? Only agricultural labors are prohibited during the Sabbatical Year, but construction is permitted. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to the wall of <b>a garden,</b> and it was necessary to state that this wall may be built during the Sabbatical Year to indicate that <b>even though he appears as one who is building a protection for his produce,</b> he is nevertheless permitted to do so. This proves that the mishna’s discussion pertains to building the wall of a garden. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that Rav <b>Ḥisda’s interpretation is</b> indeed the correct understanding of the mishna.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When symptoms of leprosy appear, they must be examined by a priest, who determines whether or not the symptoms qualify as leprosy. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> A priest <b>may initially examine</b> an individual showing <b>symptoms of leprosy on the intermediate days of a Festival</b> in order <b>to be lenient,</b> i.e., he may pronounce the individual to be free of leprosy, <b>but not</b> in order <b>to be stringent;</b> he may not pronounce the individual to be impure. The individual does not become ritually impure until the priest pronounces him to have leprosy, and therefore the priest may remain silent and thereby prevent causing the afflicted individual distress during the Festival. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The priest may <b>not</b> examine the symptoms in order <b>to be lenient or</b> in order <b>to be stringent.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> A priest <b>may examine</b> an individual showing <b>symptoms of leprosy on the intermediate days of a Festival</b> in order <b>to be lenient, but not</b> in order <b>to be stringent. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The priest <b>may not</b> examine the symptoms <b>to be lenient or to be stringent.</b> The reasoning behind Rabbi Yosei’s opinion is <b>that if you attend to</b> the individual with the symptoms of leprosy <b>to be lenient, you must attend to him even to be stringent.</b> If the priest sees that the symptom is in fact leprosy, he must declare the affected person ritually impure rather than remain silent. Consequently, in order to avoid declaring that he has leprosy on the Festival, the priest should not examine him at all.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Meir appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard</b> to the case of <b>a quarantined</b> leper. In this case, the priest may reexamine him at the end of the week even on the intermediate days of a Festival, because if he declares the individual to be pure, he will cause him to rejoice, and if he declares that the individual must be quarantined for another week, his situation is no worse than it was previously. On the other hand, <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a confirmed</b> leper, one who has already been declared conclusively impure by a priest. The Gemara (7b) will explain the reason for this statement.
<b>Rava said: With regard to</b> an individual with symptoms of leprosy who is still <b>ritually pure,</b> i.e., who has not yet been examined by a priest, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the priest <b>does not examine him,</b> as his status can only worsen due to the examination. <b>With regard to</b> a suspected leper who is in his <b>first</b> week of <b>quarantine, everyone agrees that</b> the priest <b>examines him,</b> as the priest may declare him pure if his symptoms have subsided, and even if his symptoms remained as they were, he will simply be quarantined for another week. <b>When they disagree</b>

Daf 7b

<b>it is with regard to</b> a suspected leper who is already in his <b>second</b> week of <b>quarantine. One Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>the matter depends upon</b> the discretion of <b>the priest; if he is</b> found ritually <b>pure, the priest declares him pure, and if he is</b> found <b>ritually impure, the priest</b> can <b>remain silent.</b> As long as the priest does not declare the affected individual ritually impure, he does not become impure. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that since <b>it is written:</b> “This is the law of the plague of leprosy…<b>to pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:59), the priest is not permitted to be silent; just as he is obligated to declare him pure when that is the case, so too, he is bound to declare him impure when his symptoms indicate impurity.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Yosei appears</b> correct <b>with regard to a confirmed leper, and the statement of Rabbi Meir appears</b> correct <b>with regard to a quarantined</b> leper. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But isn’t the opposite taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>, namely, that Rabbi Yosei’s statement appears correct with regard to the case of a quarantined leper, while Rabbi Meir’s statement appears correct with regard to the case of a confirmed leper?
The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>One Sage,</b> the author of the latter <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds that the company of the world</b> at large <b>is preferable to</b> the leper. Consequently, the priest may examine a confirmed leper during the Festival because the priest will either decide that the leper’s symptoms are still present, in which case the leper’s situation will be no worse than before, or the priest will declare that his symptoms have subsided, in which case the leper may reenter the community, which will bring him joy.
<b>And one Sage,</b> the author of the <i>baraita</i> (7a), <b>holds that the company of his wife is preferable to</b> the leper. Consequently, the priest may not examine a confirmed leper on the Festival, because if he declares that his symptoms have subsided, the leper will begin his seven day purification process, during which time he is prohibited from engaging in conjugal relations with his wife. Due to the distress that this causes him, it is preferable that the priest not examine him at all during the Festival.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that a confirmed</b> leper <b>is permitted</b> to engage <b>in conjugal relations</b> with his wife? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and so</b> too <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a leper who is counting his seven days, it is written: <b>“But he shall remain outside his tent seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:8). This verse teaches <b>that</b> the leper <b>is prohibited</b> from engaging <b>in conjugal relations,</b> as the words <b>his tent</b> refer <b>only</b> to <b>his wife, as it is stated: “Go, say to them: Return again to your tents” (</b>Deuteronomy 5:27). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse states: “And after he is cleansed, <b>they shall count for him seven days”</b> (Ezekiel 44:26), indicating that he is prohibited from having conjugal relations during <b>the days of his counting, but not</b> during <b>the days of his confirmed</b> leprosy.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> Since the verse indicates that the prohibition to engage in conjugal relations applies during <b>the seven days of his counting</b> before becoming ritually pure, it follows based on an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the prohibition should also apply during <b>the days of his confirmed</b> leprosy, when his impurity is more severe.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya said: I deliberated</b> this matter <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and said: <b>Have you</b> not <b>taught us, our teacher,</b> that King <b>Jotham was only</b> born <b>to Uzziah,</b> the king of Judah, <b>during the days of his confirmed</b> leprosy? This would indicate that a confirmed leper is permitted to engage in conjugal relations. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: I too said this;</b> I am also of the opinion that a confirmed leper is permitted to engage in conjugal relations, in contrast to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do <b>they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds: The Merciful One revealed</b> the prohibition of conjugal relations with one’s wife <b>during the days of his counting; and all the more so</b> the prohibition applies <b>during his days of confirmed</b> leprosy, when his ritual impurity is more severe. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>maintains: That which</b> the verse <b>revealed, it revealed, but that which it did not reveal, it did not reveal;</b> the prohibition is not interpreted in a way that adds an extra stringency beyond what is stated explicitly in the Torah.
§ The Gemara returns to the original dispute with regard to the priest’s examination of the symptoms of leprosy. <b>Is this to say that the matter depends upon</b> the discretion of <b>the priest,</b> i.e., the priest can decide whether to declare the affected person ritually pure or impure or whether to examine the leprous symptoms or not? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and</b> so too <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“But on the day it appears in him”</b> (Leviticus 13:14), from which it may be inferred that <b>there is a day when you examine</b> the symptoms found in <b>him and there is a day when you do not examine</b> those symptoms.
<b>From here they stated:</b> With regard to <b>a bridegroom upon whom leprous symptoms came into being, we give him the seven days of the</b> wedding <b>feast</b> before the examination that determines ritual purity or impurity. This ruling applies whether the leprous symptoms appeared <b>upon him, upon his house, or upon his clothing. Similarly,</b> if the symptoms of leprosy appeared upon an individual <b>during a pilgrimage Festival, we give him the seven days of the Festival</b> in order to avoid causing him distress during that time; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The ruling is correct, but <b>there is no need</b> to prove it from this verse, as a much simpler proof can be brought from a different source. <b>It says: “Then the priest shall command that they empty the house</b> before the priest goes into it to see the plague, so that all that is in the house be not made unclean” (Leviticus 14:36). <b>If we delay</b> the priest’s examination of the house in order to give the owner time to remove his utensils and prevent them from contracting ritual impurity, which is merely <b>an optional matter, all the more so</b> should we delay his examination <b>for a matter of mitzva,</b> e.g., so as not to detract from the bridegroom’s joy or from the joy of a Festival.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them,</b> whether the source of the <i>halakha</i> is one verse or another? <b>Abaye said:</b> There is no practical difference between the opinions; rather, <b>the interpretation of the meaning</b> of the verses <b>is</b> the difference <b>between them,</b> as each has a different interpretation of the verse from which the other derived this <i>halakha</i>. <b>And Rava said:</b> There is in fact a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to whether or not one delays the examination of leprous symptoms found on an individual’s body for <b>an optional matter.</b> Rabbi Yehuda holds that one delays the examination only for the sake of a mitzva, while Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that one may delay it even for the sake of an optional matter.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> why is it not permitted to delay the priest’s examination of leprous symptoms on an individual’s body for an optional matter, just as with regard to leprous symptoms on one’s house? The Gemara answers: <b>We do not learn</b> a halakhic principle <b>from there because</b> the <i>halakha</i> of leprosy of houses <b>is</b> itself <b>a novelty,</b> a unique biblical law from which one cannot extrapolate to other cases.

Daf 8a

The Gemara explains that the <i>halakha</i> of leprous symptoms on a house constitutes a novelty, <b>as</b> by Torah law, <b>wood and stones are generally not susceptible to ritual impurity, yet here</b> in the case of house leprosy <b>they are susceptible to ritual impurity.</b>
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It was necessary</b> for the Torah to state both verses: “But on the day it appears in him” (Leviticus 13:14), as well as: “Then the priest shall command that they empty the house” (Leviticus 14:36). <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“But on the day it appears in him,” I would have said</b> that <b>for a matter of mitzva, yes,</b> one may delay the priest’s examination of the leprous symptoms, but <b>for an optional matter, no,</b> one may not, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Therefore <b>the Merciful One wrote: “Then the priest shall command,”</b> in order to teach that one may delay his examination even for an optional matter.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Then the priest shall command,” I would have said</b> that <b>for these</b> utensils that are found in the house, <b>yes,</b> one may delay the priest’s examination, as this is <b>not</b> a case of <b>impurity of the</b> individual’s <b>body</b> but only that of his possessions; <b>but</b> in a case of <b>impurity of</b> the individual’s <b>body, I</b> would <b>say</b> that the priest <b>must examine it</b> immediately. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the Torah to state that even in this case, one may delay his examination.
§ The Gemara proceeds to analyze the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> that <b>as</b> the verse states: “But on the day it appears in him,” it may be inferred that <b>there is a day when you examine</b> the symptoms found in <b>him and there is a day when you do not examine</b> those symptoms.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in this verse <b>may it be inferred? Abaye said: If</b> it were <b>so</b> that the priest must always examine the symptoms immediately, <b>the Merciful One should have written</b> simply: <b>On the day</b> it appears in him. <b>What is</b> implied by the actual formulation of the verse: <b>“But on the day”? Learn from here,</b> i.e., from the seemingly superfluous word “but” at the beginning of the phrase, that this is not an absolute <i>halakha</i>, but a conditional one, depending upon other factors: <b>There is a day when you examine</b> the leprous symptoms found in <b>him and there is a day when you do not examine</b> those symptoms.
<b>Rava</b> offered a different explanation and <b>said: The entire phrase</b> “but on the day,” <b>is superfluous. As, if</b> it were <b>so</b> that the priest must always examine the symptoms immediately, <b>the Merciful One should have written</b> simply: <b>And when it appears. What is</b> the meaning of the additional words <b>“but on the day”? Learn from here</b> that the issue is dependent upon other factors, as <b>there is a day when you examine</b> the symptoms of leprosy <b>in him and there is a day when you do not examine</b> them.
The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> according to <b>Abaye,</b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> from the word “but,” why does the verse include the phrase “on the day”? <b>That</b> phrase <b>is necessary</b> in order to teach that the priest examines the symptoms of leprosy only <b>during the day, but not at night.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> does <b>Rava</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the examination is performed <b>during the day but not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“As far as the priest’s eyes can see”</b> (Leviticus 13:12), which indicates that the priest must be able to carry out a careful examination of the leprous symptoms; this cannot be done at night, when his vision is limited. <b>And Abaye</b> could say that <b>this</b> verse <b>is necessary to exclude</b> a priest who is <b>blind in one eye</b> from inspecting symptoms of leprosy, as it says “eyes,” in the plural.
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rava also requires</b> this verse <b>to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that a priest who is blind in one eye is unfit to examine symptoms of leprosy. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> he agrees that this verse is the source of the <i>halakha</i> concerning a priest who is blind in one eye, and it is not the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the priest may only view leprous symptoms by day.
If so, <b>from where</b> does Rava derive the <i>halakha</i> that a priest examines leprous symptoms <b>during the day but not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse that quotes a homeowner saying to a priest: <b>“There seems to me as it were a plague in the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:35), which emphasizes that the leprous symptom is seen <b>by me, and not by</b> way of <b>my light,</b> i.e., that this takes place during the day. When the next verse states that the priest comes to view the leprous symptom, it means that this also takes place by day.
<b>And</b> why does <b>Abaye</b> require the proof that he adduces when it would seem that the verse that Rava brings offers sufficient proof? The Gemara explains: According to Abaye, <b>if</b> the source was derived <b>from there, I would have said</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one must wait until the light of day to examine the symptom, <b>applies</b> only to leprous symptoms on a house, which is <b>an impurity that is not</b> related to <b>the</b> individual’s <b>body. However,</b> in a case of <b>impurity of the</b> individual’s <b>body,</b> perhaps the priest may conduct his examination <b>even by</b> artificial <b>light,</b> as it is a more severe impurity. Therefore the verse <b>teaches us:</b> “But on the day,” to indicate that even in the case of impurity of the body the priest may perform the examination only during the day by natural sunlight, and not by any artificial light.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Meir also stated</b> another leniency concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of the intermediate days of a Festival: <b>A person may gather the bones of his father and mother</b> from their temporary graves on the intermediate days of a Festival. In ancient times, it was customary to first bury a corpse in a temporary grave. After the flesh had decomposed, the bones would be collected, placed in a coffin, and buried in a vault together with the bones of the deceased individual’s ancestors. This is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>because</b> the fact that one merited to bring the bones of his deceased parents to the graves of their ancestors <b>is</b> a source of <b>joy for him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> One does not gather these bones on the intermediate days of a Festival, because <b>it is</b> a source of <b>mourning for him.</b> Even though he is happy to be able to bury his parents’ bones in their ancestral graves, he is still pained by the memory of their death.
And all agree that <b>a person may not arouse [<i>ye’orer</i>]</b> lamentation <b>for his deceased</b> relative, <b>and he may not eulogize him</b> during the <b>thirty days before a pilgrimage Festival.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to Rabbi Meir’s opinion that gathering the bones of one’s parents is considered an occasion of joy, based on what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who gathers the bones of his father or his mother mourns for them the entire day, but he does not mourn for them in the evening. And Rav Ḥisda said: And even</b> in a case where he does not gather the bones from a temporary grave, but where <b>he had them bundled up in his sheet,</b> when he buries them he mourns for them all day. This indicates that gathering one’s parents’ bones is an occasion of mourning rather than joy.
<b>Abaye said: Say</b> that Rabbi Meir means that collecting and reinterring the bones of one’s parents is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival, not because it causes one joy, but rather <b>because the joy of the pilgrimage Festival is upon him.</b> The pain of gathering the bones of his parents is overpowered by the joy of the Festival.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>One may not arouse</b> lamentation <b>for his deceased</b> relative during the thirty days before a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by: <b>One may not arouse</b> lamentation <b>for his deceased</b> relative? <b>Rav said: In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>whenever a</b> professional <b>eulogizer would circulate</b> and ply his trade, <b>they would say: Let all those of bitter heart weep with him.</b> When they would say this, all those who had recently suffered losses would recall their pain and lament their losses.
It is taught in the mishna that one may not arouse lamentation or eulogize his relative for <b>thirty days before a pilgrimage Festival.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>thirty days,</b> that it is prohibited for one to lament the dead for specifically that amount of time before the Festival?
<b>Rav Kahana said that Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> There was an <b>incident</b> involving <b>a certain man who saved up money to ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the pilgrimage Festival</b>. A professional <b>eulogizer came and stood at the opening to his house and</b> the man’s <b>wife took</b> the money that he had saved <b>and gave it to</b> the eulogizer for his services. As a result, the man did not have enough money and <b>he refrained and did not ascend</b> to Jerusalem for the Festival. <b>At that time, they said: One may not arouse</b> lamentation <b>for his deceased</b> relative, <b>nor may</b> he <b>eulogize him</b> during the <b>thirty days before a pilgrimage Festival.</b>
<b>And Shmuel said:</b>

Daf 8b

It is <b>because the dead is not forgotten from the heart</b> and put out of mind <b>for thirty days,</b> and therefore, when one laments the loss of a deceased relative within thirty days before a Festival, the pain is still remembered on the Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the two reasons? The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in a case <b>where</b> the eulogizer <b>performs</b> the eulogy <b>free</b> of charge. In that case there is no worry that money that had been set aside for the Festival will be spent, but there is still room for concern about the lingering pain that will be felt on the Festival.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not dig crypts or graves on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> in preparation for those who are still alive, <b>but one may adjust</b> previously dug <b>crypts on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> in order to receive a particular corpse. <b>And one may</b> also <b>construct</b> a laundry <b>pond on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> as it does not involve excessive effort. <b>And</b> one may also prepare <b>a coffin</b> if he is together <b>with the corpse in the</b> same <b>courtyard,</b> as in that case everyone knows that he is preparing the coffin for the deceased. <b>Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> making the coffin <b>unless</b> one <b>has</b> wooden <b>boards with him</b> that had already been cut before the Festival and that need only to be attached.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What are crypts and what are graves,</b> and what is the difference between them? <b>Rav Yehuda said: Crypts</b> are constructed <b>by digging and graves</b> are constructed <b>by building.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>That is also taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are crypts and these are graves: Crypts</b> are constructed <b>by digging and graves</b> are constructed <b>by building.</b>
It is taught in the mishna: <b>But one may adjust</b> previously dug <b>crypts</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>How does one adjust</b> a crypt? <b>Rav Yehuda said: If</b> the crypt <b>was long</b>er than the corpse, <b>he shortens it.</b> With regard to this issue it <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: He lengthens</b> the crypt <b>and widens it</b> to make it the right size for the particular corpse.
It was further taught in the mishna: <b>And one may</b> also <b>construct a</b> laundry <b>pond</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What is a</b> laundry <b>pond? Rav Yehuda said: This is a ditch</b> dug in the ground for washing clothes. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A</b> laundry <b>pond and a</b> laundry <b>ditch,</b> which indicates that they are different from one another? <b>Abaye said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Kahana</b> who said: <b>A pond and a small pond,</b> i.e., the only difference between them is their size; a laundry pond is larger than a laundry ditch.
It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> one may also prepare <b>a coffin</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival if he is together <b>with the corpse in the</b> same <b>courtyard.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may tend to all the needs of the deceased</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival: <b>One may cut</b> the deceased’s <b>hair for him</b> if it was too long, <b>and one may wash his clothing,</b> i.e., his shrouds, <b>for him, and one may construct a coffin for him from boards that had</b> already <b>been cut from the eve of the Festival. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One may even bring timber and discreetly cut it</b> into boards <b>in</b> the privacy of <b>his house.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not marry a woman on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, not virgins and not widows, and one may not perform levirate marriage</b> with his sister-in-law, if his brother died childless, <b>because it is</b> a <b>joyous</b> occasion <b>for him. However, one may remarry his divorced wife</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, as this is not as great a joy for him.
<b>And a woman may engage in</b> all <b>her</b> usual <b>cosmetic treatments</b> to enhance her physical appearance <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: She may not apply lime</b> to her skin <b>because it</b> is temporarily <b>a disgrace to her,</b> as she is unattractive before the lime is peeled off and will therefore be distressed during the Festival. The mishna continues: <b>A layman,</b> who is not a skilled tailor, <b>may sew in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> if necessary for the Festival, <b>whereas a craftsman may form</b> only <b>temporary stitches. And one may interweave</b> the cords attached to the frames of <b>beds</b> upon which a mattress is placed. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One may</b> only <b>tighten</b> the cords but not interweave them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna that one may not marry a woman on the intermediate days of a Festival, because it is a source of joy for him. The Gemara asks: <b>And if it is a</b> source of <b>joy for him, what of it?</b> Isn’t there is a mitzva to rejoice on a Festival? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and, so too, Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> The reason that one may not get married on the intermediate days of a Festival is <b>because one may not mix</b> one <b>joy with</b> another <b>joy,</b> as each requires its own celebration. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> The reason is <b>because he forsakes the rejoicing of the pilgrimage Festival and occupies</b> himself <b>with rejoicing</b> with <b>his wife.</b>
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This</b> statement <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna is</b> actually a statement <b>of Rav, as Rav Daniel bar Ketina said that Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not marry a woman on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival? As it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). This verse emphasizes that you must rejoice <b>in your Festival and not in your wife.</b>
<b>Ulla said:</b> The reason one may not marry on the intermediate days of a Festival is <b>due to the</b> excessive <b>exertion</b> that the wedding preparations demand, which is prohibited during the Festival. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said:</b> The reason is <b>due to the neglect of</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply.</b> If it were permissible to get married during the intermediate days of a Festival, people would delay getting married until then in order to save money by avoiding the necessity of preparing separate feasts for the Festival and for the wedding. In the meantime they would neglect the mitzva of procreation.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>All those whom</b> the Sages <b>said are prohibited to marry on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b>

Daf 9a

<b>are permitted to marry on the eve of the pilgrimage Festival.</b> This poses <b>a difficulty to all of</b> the opinions, as a wedding celebration ordinarily extends for seven days, and the majority of the celebration will coincide with the Festival.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as this <i>baraita</i> can be reconciled with all of the opinions. <b>According to the one who said</b> that one may not get married on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>because of joy,</b> i.e., because one must not mix one joy with another, or because one may not put aside the rejoicing of the Festival and occupy himself with rejoicing with his wife, this is not difficult, as <b>the primary joy</b> of a wedding <b>is</b> only <b>one day,</b> and after that, the joy of the wedding will not affect the joy of the Festival.
And <b>according to the one who said</b> that one may not marry on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>due to</b> the excessive <b>exertion</b> that the wedding preparations demand, it is not difficult, as <b>the primary exertion is</b> only <b>one day.</b> After the wedding, excessive exertion is not required. And <b>according to the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the neglect of</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply,</b> there is no room for concern: Since there is only <b>one day,</b> the eve of the Festival, when he can get married and save money on the feast, <b>a man will not delay</b> his wedding in order to get married then, lest some unforeseen circumstance arise that will prevent him from getting married on that day. Therefore, according to all the reasons offered, there is no need to prohibit weddings on the eve of a Festival.
§ The Gemara asks: With regard to the principle that <b>one may not mix</b> one <b>joy with</b> another <b>joy, from where do we</b> derive it? The Gemara explains that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the dedication of the Temple: <b>“So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, fourteen days”</b> (I Kings 8:65). <b>And if it is so</b> that <b>one may</b> in fact <b>mix</b> one <b>joy with</b> another <b>joy, he should have waited until the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, which was the second set of seven days, <b>and made</b> a feast of <b>seven</b> days <b>for this and for that,</b> i.e., for the dedication of the Temple and for the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> together. The fact that he did not do so indicates that one must not mix one joy with another.
The Gemara raises a question: <b>Perhaps,</b> however, it may be derived from here only that <b>we may not delay</b> a wedding to be on a Festival, just as King Solomon did not delay the Temple dedication to be on the Festival, but nevertheless, <b>where it happens</b> to occur that way, <b>we may</b> indeed <b>prepare</b> a feast to celebrate both occasions together. The Gemara answers: If this were permitted, Solomon <b>should have left a small</b> part of the Temple unfinished until the Festival, and thereby arranged for a joint celebration of the dedication of the Temple and the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>One may not leave</b> any part of <b>the building of the Temple</b> undone, as a mitzva should be completed as quickly as possible. The Gemara modifies its previous opinion: Solomon <b>should have left the cubit-</b>wide plates with spikes, which were designed to <b>eliminate the ravens,</b> unfinished. The roof of the Temple was fitted with sharp metal spikes to deter the ravens, who were attracted by the smell of the sacrificial meat, from perching there. Although this was not considered a part of the building itself, delaying its installation would have allowed Solomon to delay the celebration of the Temple dedication.
The Gemara rejects this opinion as well: <b>The cubit</b>-wide plates with spikes to <b>eliminate the ravens was a necessary</b> element <b>in the building of the Temple,</b> and consequently Solomon could not delay its construction either. <b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from the redundancy</b> in <b>the verse. Since it is written “fourteen days,” why do I</b> need the verse to specify <b>“seven days and seven days”? Learn from it</b> that <b>these</b> seven days of celebrating the Temple dedication must <b>be discrete, and</b> similarly, <b>these</b> seven days of celebrating the Festival must <b>be discrete,</b> due to the principle that one may not mix one joy with another.
§ Apropos the discussion of the celebration at Solomon’s dedication of the Temple, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Parnakh said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That year,</b> the Jewish people <b>did not observe Yom Kippur,</b> as the seven-day celebration of the dedication of the Temple coincided with Yom Kippur and all seven days were celebrated with feasting. <b>And</b> the people <b>were worried and said: Perhaps the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <b>have become liable to be destroyed</b> for the transgression of eating on Yom Kippur, which is punishable by <i>karet</i>. <b>A Divine Voice issued forth and said to them: All of you are designated for life in the World-to-Come.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What derivation</b> led them to conclude that it was permitted for them to eat on Yom Kippur? The Gemara explains that they based their ruling on an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> at the dedication of <b>the Tabernacle, whose sanctity is not a permanent sanctity, an individual’s offering,</b> i.e., an offering of one of the tribal princes, <b>overrides</b> the prohibition of <b>Shabbat,</b> as the princes’ offerings were brought every day including Shabbat despite the attendant transgression of <b>a prohibition</b> that is punishable by <b>stoning;</b> then with regard to the dedication of <b>the Temple, whose sanctity is a permanent sanctity</b> and the offerings brought there were <b>communal offerings,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear that the dedication of the Temple overrides the prohibition of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> a violation that is <b>punishable by</b> the less severe punishment of <b><i>karet</i>?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if they had firm basis for their behavior, <b>why were they worried?</b> The Gemara answers that one can refute this <i>a fortiori</i> inference as follows: <b>There,</b> at the dedication of the Tabernacle, Shabbat was desecrated only <b>for the necessities</b> of the Temple service to God on <b>High,</b> i.e., by sacrificing offerings. <b>Here,</b> at the dedication of the Temple, they desecrated Yom Kippur by eating and drinking, which was for <b>the need of common</b> mortals. Based on this distinction the Gemara suggests: <b>Here too,</b> at the dedication of the Temple <b>they should</b> have <b>performed</b> the rites of the sacrificial offerings and <b>they should not</b> have <b>eaten or drunk.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is no</b> complete <b>rejoicing without eating and drinking.</b>
With regard to the proof itself, the Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the offerings brought at the dedication of <b>the Tabernacle overrode Shabbat? If we say</b> it is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the offerings brought by the tribal princes: <b>“On the first day”</b> (Numbers 7:12) <b>and “on the seventh day”</b> (Numbers 7:48), this is not a conclusive proof, as <b>perhaps</b> this refers not to the seventh day of the week but to <b>the seventh</b> day <b>of</b> sacrificial <b>offerings.</b> Perhaps they skipped Shabbat and did not sacrifice offerings connected to the dedication of the Tabernacle on that day. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The verse</b> also <b>states: “On the day of the eleventh day”</b> (Numbers 7:72). The repetition of the word day indicates that <b>just as a day is all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time, <b>so too, the eleven</b> days <b>were all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time, with no break in the middle, even for Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> this refers only to <b>days that are fit</b> for an individual’s offerings, i.e., the offerings were sacrificed on eleven consecutive days that were suitable for sacrificing the offerings of an individual, but not on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: In <b>another verse it is written: “On the day of the twelfth day”</b> (Numbers 7:78), indicating that <b>just as a day is all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time, <b>so too, the twelve days were all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time.
The Gemara asks again: <b>But perhaps here too</b> this is referring to <b>days that are fit</b> for sacrificing the offerings of an individual? The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>two verses,</b> the verse with regard to the eleventh day and the verse with regard to the twelfth day, to teach the same principle? The fact that the Torah uses repetitive phraseology in both verses indicates that all the days were consecutive, without a break for Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the feasting at the time of the dedication of <b>the Temple overrides Yom Kippur,</b> so that the people did not have to fast? <b>If we say</b> it is derived <b>from that which is written: Fourteen days, perhaps</b> this is referring to <b>days that are fit</b> for feasting, to the exclusion of Yom Kippur. The Gemara answers: This is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“day”</b> mentioned in this context <b>and</b> the word <b>“day”</b> mentioned <b>there,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle. Just as there the days were consecutive, without a break for Shabbat, so too here, the days were consecutive, without a break for Yom Kippur.
It was stated above that <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said to them: All of you are designated for life in the World-to-Come.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> God <b>pardoned them</b> for this sin? The Gemara answers: The Sage <b>Taḥlifa taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had done for David His servant and for Israel His people”</b> (I Kings 8:66).
This verse may be expounded as follows: The words <b>“to their tents”</b> indicate <b>that they went and found their wives in</b> a state of <b>purity,</b> as the terms tent and house often denote one’s wife. The term <b>“joyful”</b> is referring to the fact <b>they had enjoyed the splendor of the Divine Presence,</b> as there was a revelation of the Divine Presence when the offerings were sacrificed in the Temple. The phrase <b>“and glad of heart”</b> refers to the fact that <b>each of their wives conceived a male child.</b> The words <b>“for all the goodness”</b> indicate <b>that a Divine Voice issued forth and said to them: All of you are designated for life in the World-to-Come,</b> which is the ultimate good.
The aforementioned verse stated: “For all the goodness that the Lord had done <b>for David His servant and for Israel His people.</b>” The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> when the verse mentions the goodness that God did <b>for Israel His people,</b> this is referring to the fact <b>that He pardoned them the sin of</b> eating on <b>Yom Kippur</b> that year; <b>but what is</b> the goodness that God performed <b>for David His servant?</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: When Solomon sought to bring the Ark into the Temple the gates clung together</b> and could not be opened. <b>Solomon uttered twenty-four songs</b> of praise, <b>and</b> his prayer <b>was not answered. He began and said: “Lift up your heads, O you gates,</b> and be lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in” (Psalms 24:7), <b>but</b> once again his prayer <b>was not answered,</b> and the Temple gates remained closed.
<b>Once he said:</b> “Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into your resting place, You, and the Ark of Your strength; Let your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with victory and let Your pious ones rejoice in goodness. <b>O Lord God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember the faithful love of David Your servant”</b> (II Chronicles 6:41–42), <b>he was immediately answered. At that moment the faces of David’s enemies turned</b> dark <b>like the</b> charred <b>bottom of a pot, and all knew that the Holy One, Blessed be He, forgave him for that sin</b> involving Bathsheba, as they saw that it was only in his merit that the gates of the Temple opened.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, studied the portion</b> dealing with <b>oaths in the study hall of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai.</b> After completing their studies, the disciples <b>took leave of</b> their master <b>in the evening,</b> but did not yet leave the city. <b>In the morning they went back and took leave of him</b> a second time. <b>He said to them: Did you not</b> already <b>take leave of me</b> yesterday <b>in the evening?</b>
<b>They said to him: You have taught us, our teacher,</b> that <b>a disciple who takes leave of his teacher and</b> then <b>stays overnight in the same city must take leave of him an additional time, as it is stated</b> at the conclusion of the dedication of the Temple: <b>“On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king”</b> (I Kings 8:66), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away”</b> (II Chronicles 7:10). The eighth day in the verse is referring to the Eighth Day of Assembly, the twenty-second of the month of Tishrei, yet it says that he sent the people away on the next day, the twenty-third of the month.
<b>Rather,</b> it can be derived <b>from here</b> that <b>a disciple who takes leave of his teacher and</b> then <b>stays overnight in the same city must take leave of him an additional time,</b> just as the Jewish people took leave of Solomon an additional time on the day after the Festival, on the twenty-third of Tishrei.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <b>said to his son: These</b> two <b>people,</b> Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, <b>are men of</b> noble <b>form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> i.e., wise and learned individuals; <b>go to them so that they will bless you. He went</b> and <b>found them</b> deep in discussion, <b>raising</b> apparent <b>contradictions between verses</b> as follows: <b>It is written: “Make level the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established”</b> (Proverbs 4:26), indicating that when one has the opportunity to perform more than one mitzva, he must evaluate which of them is most important. <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Lest you level out the path of life,”</b> (Proverbs 5:6), indicating that one must perform each mitzva as the opportunity arises, without considering its relative importance.
They explained that it is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the first verse cited above, it is discussing <b>a mitzva that can be done by others,</b> and therefore one must consider what is most worthwhile for him to perform himself and what he will leave to others.

Daf 9b

<b>There,</b> in the other verse, it is referring to <b>a mitzva that cannot be done by others,</b> and therefore, one must not consider its relative importance, but rather do it immediately.
The two scholars, Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, <b>once again sat and raised the</b> following <b>dilemma:</b> In one place <b>it is written</b> in praise of the Torah: <b>“She is more precious than rubies; and all of your desires are not to be compared to her”</b> (Proverbs 3:15). One can infer from here that all human desires cannot be compared to the Torah, <b>but the desires of Heaven,</b> i.e., mitzvot, <b>can</b> indeed <b>be compared to her. And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written:</b> “For wisdom is better than rubies; <b>and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it”</b> (Proverbs 8:11), which indicates that even mitzvot cannot be compared to the Torah.
They resolved this contradiction by stating that <b>here,</b> in the second verse, it is discussing <b>a mitzva that can be done by others.</b> In that case, even mitzvot cannot be compared to the Torah, and accordingly, one who is engaged in Torah study should not interrupt his studies in order to perform another mitzva. However, <b>there,</b> in the first verse, it is discussing <b>a mitzva that cannot be done by others.</b> In that case Torah study is not more important than the mitzva, and one should interrupt his studies in order to perform the mitzva.
When Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, noticed Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai’s son, <b>they said to him: What do you want here? He said to them: Father told me: Go to them so that they should bless you. They said to him</b> as follows: <b>May it be</b> God’s <b>will that you should sow and not reap, that you should bring in and not take out, that you should take out and not bring in, that your house should be destroyed and your lodging place should be inhabited, that your table should become confused, and that you should not see a new year.</b>
<b>When he came</b> back <b>to his father, he said to him: Not only did they not bless me, but they</b> even <b>caused me pain</b> with their negative words. His father <b>said to him: What</b> exactly <b>did they say to you?</b> He answered: <b>They said to me such and such.</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <b>said to</b> his son: <b>These are all blessings,</b> uttered in a cryptic manner, and this is what they meant: When they said that <b>you should sow and not reap</b> they meant that <b>you should bear sons and they should not die.</b> Their statement that <b>you should bring in and not take out</b> means that <b>you should bring in brides</b> for your sons <b>and your sons should not die, which</b> would cause their wives <b>to leave.</b> When they said <b>you should take out and not bring in</b> they meant that <b>you should have daughters and their husbands should not die,</b> which would cause your daughters to <b>return to you.</b>
When they said that <b>your house should be destroyed and your lodging place should be inhabited,</b> this should be interpreted allegorically. <b>As this world is</b> compared to <b>your lodging place, and the World-to-Come is</b> compared to <b>your house, as it is written: “Their inward thought [<i>kirbam</i>], is that their houses shall continue forever”</b> (Psalms 49:12), and the Sages said: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“their inward thought [<i>kirbam</i>]”; rather</b> read it as <b>their graves [<i>kivram</i>].</b> According to this reading, one’s grave is considered his permanent house. The Sages gave Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai’s son a blessing that he should dwell in his temporary home rather than his permanent home, i.e., he should live a long life.
When they said that <b>your table should become confused,</b> they meant that you should be blessed <b>with</b> many <b>sons and daughters,</b> so that there will be noise and confusion at your table. When they said that <b>you should not see a new year,</b> they meant <b>your wife should not die and</b> as a result <b>you should not</b> have to <b>marry another woman,</b> about which it says: “When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free at home for one year” (Deuteronomy 24:5).
Apropos a blessing with an obscure meaning, the Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta took leave of Rav. His father said to him: Go to him so that he should bless you.</b> When <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta</b> returned to him for a blessing, Rav said to him: <b>May it be</b> God’s <b>will that you should not shame</b> others <b>and that you should not feel ashamed. He came</b> home <b>to his father,</b> who <b>said to him: What did he say to you? He said to him: Mere words he said to me,</b> i.e., he did not say anything of significance.
After Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta repeated what Rav had said, his father <b>said to him: He blessed you with the blessing with which the Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed Israel and</b> then <b>repeated</b> the blessing, indicating that is a very great blessing, <b>as it is written: “And you shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise</b> the Name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you; <b>and My people shall never be ashamed. And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,</b> and that I am the Lord your God, and there is none else; <b>and My people shall never be ashamed”</b> (Joel 2:26–27).
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And a woman may engage in</b> all of <b>her</b> usual <b>cosmetic treatments</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are the cosmetic treatments of women</b> that are permitted: <b>She may paint her eyelids, she may remove</b> unwanted <b>hair [<i>pokeset</i>], and she may put rouge on her face. And some say: She may pass a comb over her lower face,</b> i.e., she may remove the hair from her pubic area.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda’s wife would adorn herself</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>in the presence of her daughter-in-law,</b> i.e., when she already had a married son. <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana sat before Rav Ḥisda, and he sat and said: They taught only</b> that a woman is permitted to engage in cosmetic treatments on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a young woman,</b> as such treatments bring her joy, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>an old woman, no,</b> the treatments are not permitted, as she does not need them.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: By God! Even your mother, and even your mother’s mother, and even a woman</b> so old <b>that</b> she <b>is standing at</b> the edge of <b>her grave</b> are all permitted to adorn themselves. <b>As people say</b> in the popular adage: <b>A woman of sixty years, like one of six, runs at the sound of the timbrel [<i>tavla</i>],</b> implying that women of all ages are young in spirit; since they all take pleasure in their adornments, they are allowed to adorn themselves, regardless of age.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: She may not apply lime</b> to her skin <b>because it renders her</b> temporarily <b>unattractive</b> and she will be distressed during the Festival. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A woman may not apply lime</b> to her skin on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>because it</b> is temporarily <b>a disgrace to her,</b> as she appears unattractive until it is peeled off. <b>But Rabbi Yehuda concedes that with regard to lime that she can peel off during the Festival, she may apply it on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival, as even though she is distressed now,</b> as the lime renders her appearance unattractive, <b>she will be happy afterward,</b> when the lime is removed and she sees the results.
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Yehuda accept this reasoning</b> that it is permitted, despite the fact that it causes distress, because it will cause joy later? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> elsewhere in a mishna (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 2a): On the three days before the holidays of idolaters, it is prohibited to do business with them, so as not to cause them to thank their idols for their success. Similarly, it is prohibited on these days to lend to them, to borrow from them, to repay a debt to them, or even to collect a debt from them.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may collect</b> a debt <b>from them</b> during this period, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the gentile <b>is distressed</b> when he makes the payment. The Rabbis <b>said to him: Even though he is distressed now, he will be happy afterward,</b> as he is relieved of the debt, and therefore, it is prohibited to collect a debt from him during the three days before his holiday. In this mishna, Rabbi Yehuda considers only the immediate distress and does not consider the joy that will be experienced after some time.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Leave</b> aside <b>the <i>halakhot</i> governing a Festival,</b> which cannot be compared to other areas, as <b>all</b> of the labors that are permitted on a Festival are permitted because even though <b>one is distressed</b> by them <b>now, he will be happy</b> about them <b>afterward.</b> For example, cooking and baking are permitted even though preparing food involves effort and trouble, because eating the food after it is prepared provides pleasure and enjoyment.
<b>Ravina said</b> a different explanation: According to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>with regard to repaying</b> a debt, <b>a gentile is always distressed,</b> even after he repays a debt. However, in general, even Rabbi Yehuda accepts the principle of taking into account the joy that will be experienced at a later time.
With regard to applying lime to one’s body, <b>Rav Yehuda said: The daughters of Israel who reached</b> physical <b>maturity, but had not</b> yet <b>reached the age</b> of majority, i.e., girls that were less than twelve years of age, and therefore embarrassed by their precocious physical development, would seek to remove the excess hair from their bodies. <b>The poor</b> among them would <b>smear their</b> skin <b>with lime</b> in order to remove the hair. <b>The wealthy ones</b> would <b>smear themselves with fine flour</b> for this purpose, <b>and the daughters of kings would smear themselves with <i>shemen hamor</i>. As it is stated</b> with regard to the women who were brought to King Ahasuerus: <b>“Six months with <i>shemen hamor</i>”</b> (Esther 2:12).
The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>shemen hamor</i>? Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya said:</b> This is the perfume called <b><i>setaket</i>. Rav Yirmeya bar Ami said:</b> It is <b>olive oil</b> extracted <b>from</b> an olive <b>that</b> has <b>not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth; the acidic oil is effective as a depilatory.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Wherever the Mishna mentions <b><i>anpikinon</i>,</b> it is referring to <b>olive oil</b> from an olive <b>that has not yet reached one-third</b> of its growth. <b>And why do</b> women <b>spread it</b> on the body? It is due to the fact <b>that it removes the hair and pampers the skin.</b>
It was related that <b>Rav Beivai had a daughter,</b> and <b>he spread</b> lime <b>on her limb</b> by <b>limb,</b> which caused her hair to fall out and her skin to whiten. She became so beautiful that when marrying her off, <b>he took four hundred dinars for her. There was a certain gentile in his neighborhood who</b> also <b>had a daughter</b> and wanted to do this as well. <b>He spread her</b> entire body with lime all <b>at once, and she died.</b> That gentile <b>said: Beivai killed my daughter. Rav Naḥman said: Rav Beivai, who</b> regularly <b>drinks beer, his daughters require</b> that they be <b>smeared</b> with lime, as beer causes hair growth, <b>but we who do not drink beer, our daughters do not require</b> that they be <b>smeared</b> with lime, as they have little hair even without this treatment.

Daf 10a

§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>A layman,</b> who is not a skilled tailor, may <b>sew in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which an individual is considered <b>a layman?</b> The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Anyone who cannot</b> deftly <b>pull a full needle</b> of stiches through the fabric <b>at the same time</b> is considered a layman. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Anyone who cannot form a straight seam on the hem [<i>ḥefet</i>] of his shirt</b> is considered a layman.
§ It was further taught in the mishna: <b>A craftsman,</b> however, <b>may form</b> only <b>temporary stitches [<i>makhliv</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>forming temporary stitches? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He</b> does not sew all the stitches that are necessary, but rather <b>he skips</b> certain stitches in the middle (Rabbeinu Hananel). <b>Rabba bar Shmuel said:</b> He sews stitches that are like <b>the teeth of a dog.</b> He does not sew all the stitches in a straight line, so that they resemble the teeth of a dog, which also are not straight.
§ It was also taught in the mishna: <b>One may interweave</b> the cords attached to the frame of <b>a bed.</b> Rabbi Yosei says: One may only tighten the cords. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>interweaving, and what is</b> meant by <b>tightening? When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Asi disagree about</b> the matter, <b>and both of them</b> reported their opinions <b>in the name of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan. One</b> Sage <b>said: Interweaving</b> involves placing and tying the cords of the bed both <b>lengthwise and widthwise,</b> whereas <b>tightening</b> means arranging the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise. And one</b> Sage <b>said: Interweaving</b> involves arranging the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise, while tightening</b> means <b>that if</b> a cord <b>became loose, he</b> may <b>tighten it</b> but he may not tie any new cords.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Taḥlifa bar Shaul teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei <b>agree that one may not braid cords anew</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival? <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>interweaving</b> means tying the cords <b>lengthwise and widthwise, and tightening</b> means tying them only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise, this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which Rav Taḥlifa taught: And they</b> both <b>agree that one may not braid cords anew,</b> as even though one is permitted to arrange the cords of the bed, he is not permitted to produce new cords.
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>interweaving</b> means tying the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise,</b> while <b>tightening</b> means <b>that if</b> a cord <b>became loose, he</b> may <b>tighten it,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Now</b> that <b>you said</b> that tying the cords <b>lengthwise and widthwise, no,</b> it is not permitted even though the cords are readily available, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that braiding <b>cords anew</b> is prohibited? The Gemara comments: Indeed <b>it</b> is <b>difficult.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: Is there one who says that interweaving</b> means tying the cords <b>lengthwise, but not widthwise? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 16:1) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: A bed</b> is considered a utensil and becomes susceptible to ritual impurity <b>from when one interweaves three</b> rows of <b>meshes in it,</b> i.e., three rows lengthwise and widthwise? It is clear from here that interweaving a bed involves tying its cords lengthwise and widthwise.
<b>Rather, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he stated</b> a different version of the tradition: <b>With regard to interweaving, everyone agrees</b> that it is referring to tying the cords of a bed <b>lengthwise and widthwise. When they disagree it is only about</b> the meaning of <b>tightening. One Sage holds</b> that <b>tightening</b> means arranging the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise. And one Sage holds</b> that it means that <b>if</b> a cord <b>became loose, he may tighten it.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may interweave</b> the cords attached to the frame of <b>a bed</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>and needless to say one may tighten</b> those cords; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: One may</b> only <b>tighten</b> the ropes <b>but not interweave</b> them. <b>And some say: One may not tighten</b> them <b>at all.</b>
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>tightening</b> means tying the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise, this is</b> why the opinion presented as: <b>Some say, comes to disagree</b> and says that one may not tie the cords at all, even only lengthwise. However, if the cords became loose, all agree that they may be tightened. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that tightening means <b>that if</b> a cord <b>became loose he</b> may <b>tighten it,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion presented here as: <b>Some say,</b> may <b>he not even tighten</b> the cords of his bed? How, then, would he be able to sleep on it?
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> indeed, according to this opinion, it is prohibited even to tighten the cords of one’s bed. <b>Since it is possible</b> for him <b>to fill</b> the depression in his bed <b>with clothing,</b> so that he can sleep there, <b>he</b> may <b>not exert</b> himself during the week of the Festival and fix the bed in a more permanent manner.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may set up an oven, a stove, and a mill on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not chisel millstones for the first time</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>chiseling</b> millstones? <b>Rav Yehuda said: Cutting</b> grooves into <b>the millstones.</b> As the millstones wear down over time and become smooth, one must occasionally cut grooves into the stones so that they can grind properly. <b>Rav Yeḥiel said:</b> Cutting out <b>an eyehole</b> in the upper millstone, through which the grain can pass, so that it can be ground between the two millstones.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may set up an oven and a stove on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, provided that he does not</b> fully <b>complete the labor;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Rabbis say: He</b> may <b>even complete</b> the labor. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>One may set up a new</b> millstone <b>and one may chisel an old</b> millstone. <b>And some say: One may not chisel</b> a millstone <b>at all.</b>
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>chiseling</b> a millstone means <b>cutting</b> grooves into <b>the millstones, this is</b> how <b>you</b> can <b>find</b> this activity relevant <b>to an old</b> mill. <b>But according to the one who said</b> it means cutting out <b>an eyehole, why does an old</b> millstone <b>need an eyehole</b> to be cut out? It must have one already. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where he wants to widen</b> the hole <b>a little more.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna</b> once <b>heard a certain man cutting</b> grooves into <b>his millstone on the intermediate days of a Festival. He said: Who is this?</b> May <b>his body be desecrated, for he desecrates the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> The Gemara comments: Rav Huna <b>holds in accordance</b> with the statement cited as: <b>Some say,</b> that one is not permitted to roughen his millstones at all.
<b>Rav Ḥama taught</b> as follows: <b>One may cut</b> grooves into <b>millstones on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. In the name of Rabbi Meir he said: Even</b> with regard to <b>the horse that</b> one <b>rides upon and the donkey that he rides upon, he is permitted to trim</b> their <b>hooves</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival so that they do not suffer when they walk.

Daf 10b

<b>However,</b> with regard to the hooves of <b>a donkey</b> that turns the <b>millstones, no,</b> they may not be trimmed. This is unnecessary on the intermediate days of a Festival, as one may only grind grain that one needs to use on the Festival itself, and the donkey can perform this task even if its hooves are not trimmed.
<b>Rav Yehuda permits</b> one <b>to trim the hooves of the donkey</b> that turns <b>a mill, to set</b> the stones of <b>a mill</b> in their place, <b>to build</b> the base of <b>a mill, to construct</b> a water <b>channel</b> to carry water that drives <b>a mill, and to build a stable</b> for horses on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rava permitted</b> one <b>to groom a horse, to build a trough, and to build a bench</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<b>Rava</b> also <b>permitted</b> one <b>to let the blood of an animal</b> for medical purposes <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival. Abaye said to him:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught that supports you: One may let blood from an animal, and one</b> does <b>not withhold</b> any <b>medical treatment from an animal on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>
<b>Rava</b> further <b>permitted</b> one <b>to scrub garments</b> as part of the laundry process. <b>What is the reason? It is the work of a layman</b> and not the work of a craftsman, which is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami said that Rav Ḥisda said: Tying sleeves</b> to create pleats <b>is prohibited. What is the reason? It is the work of a craftsman</b> and is consequently prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival.
§ <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to one <b>who clears the ground</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, the following distinction applies: If <b>his intention</b> is to prepare <b>a threshing floor, it is permitted,</b> but if <b>his intention</b> is to prepare <b>the ground</b> for planting, <b>it is prohibited.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If he casts earth from one <b>mound [<i>mulya</i>] onto</b> another <b>mound, or</b> from <b>one furrow into</b> another <b>furrow [<i>natza</i>],</b> it is clear that he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> preparing <b>a threshing floor,</b> as his sole interest is the level area in the middle and not the ground that surrounds it. However, if <b>he takes</b> earth <b>from a mound and casts it into a furrow,</b> he is presumably doing this <b>with the intention of</b> preparing <b>the ground</b> for planting, which is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival due to its similarity to the prohibited labor of plowing.
<b>And Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who clears</b> his field from <b>twigs</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, the following distinction applies: If <b>his intention</b> is to use <b>the twigs it is permitted,</b> but if <b>his intention</b> is to prepare <b>the ground</b> for planting, <b>it is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If <b>he takes the large</b> twigs <b>and leaves the small</b> ones, it is clear that he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> using <b>the twigs.</b> But if <b>he takes</b> both <b>the large</b> twigs <b>and the small</b> ones, it appears as though that he is doing so <b>with the intention of</b> preparing <b>the ground,</b> and it is prohibited.
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>one who opens the</b> gates of <b>a water</b> channel running <b>through his land</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, the following distinction applies: If <b>his intention</b> is to catch <b>the fish</b> that come along with the water, <b>it is permitted,</b> but if <b>his intention</b> is to water <b>the ground, it is prohibited.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If <b>he opens two gates</b> in the water channel, <b>one above</b> his field <b>and one below,</b> so the water that flows in also flows out, it is clear that he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> catching <b>fish,</b> as the water will flow out and only the fish will remain in the indentations in his field. But if <b>he opens</b> only <b>one</b> gate, he is presumably doing this <b>with the intention of</b> watering <b>the ground,</b> as it is evident that he wants the channel to fill and the water to overflow into the field.
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>one who cuts</b> the branches of his <b>date palm</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, the following distinction applies: If he does this <b>with the intention of</b> feeding <b>his animals, it is permitted,</b> but if he does it <b>with the intention of</b> enhancing the growth of his <b>date palm, it is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If <b>he takes all</b> of the branches <b>from one side</b> of the tree, he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> feeding the branches to <b>his animals,</b> as it is evident that he is not concerned with the damage to the date palm. However, if he takes the branches <b>from this side</b> of the tree <b>and</b> also <b>from the other side,</b> it appears as though he is doing so <b>with the intention of</b> enhancing the growth of <b>the date palm, and it is prohibited.</b>
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>said: With regard to these unripe dates, cutting them</b> into pieces in order to render them fit for eating <b>is permitted</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, but <b>preserving them is prohibited,</b> as they will not be ready for use until after the Festival. <b>Rav Pappa said: Since they</b> are likely to <b>become infested with worms</b> if they are not properly attended to, <b>they are</b> treated <b>like merchandise that will be lost, and it is permitted</b> to preserve them on the intermediate days of a Festival.
§ <b>And Rava</b> also <b>said: Any commerce is prohibited</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said: But</b> with regard to <b>a matter that,</b> if left unattended, will result in significant <b>loss, it is permitted.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina</b> once <b>had a</b> joint <b>business</b> venture <b>that could have been sold for six thousand</b> dinars, but <b>he delayed selling it</b> until <b>after the intermediate days of a Festival, and he sold it</b> then <b>for twelve thousand</b> dinars.
It is further related that <b>Ravina had lent money to the residents of the fortress of Shanvata. He came before Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to going to them now,</b> on the intermediate days of the Festival, to collect my debt? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Since it is now that you will find them,</b> whereas <b>on other days you will not find them,</b> as during the year these people would travel from place to place to earn their livelihood, <b>this is</b> treated <b>like merchandise that will be lost, and it is</b> therefore <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to idol worship like this case: One may go</b>

Daf 11a

<b>to a fair of</b> pagan <b>gentiles</b> held on a day they have designated for idol worship <b>and buy animals, slaves, maidservants, houses, fields, and vineyards</b> from them. <b>And he may write</b> the necessary deeds <b>and confirm</b> them <b>in their courts [<i>arkaot</i>]</b> by verifying the signatures on the documents to prevent the sellers from appealing and retracting the sale. Although this behavior might be construed as a display of respect for the gentiles and their idols, it is nevertheless permitted <b>because it is as if he were rescuing</b> his property <b>from their hands,</b> as he would not have another opportunity to acquire these items. This indicates that time-sensitive transactions are considered like cases where one might suffer financial loss, and are permitted.
It was related that <b>Rav permitted Ḥiyya bar Ashi to weave</b> simple <b>traps [<i>oharei</i>] on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>it is the work of a layman. However,</b> complex <b>nets [<i>izlei</i>] are prohibited. What is the reason? It is the work of a craftsman,</b> which is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival.
It was further related that <b>Rav Yehuda permitted Ami the oven maker to construct ovens</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>and Rabba bar Ashabi to craft sieves.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that</b> really <b>so? Didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they</b> all <b>agree that one may not construct a new oven</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where Rav Yehuda permitted constructing an oven, he was referring <b>to the summer,</b> i.e., when the weather is hot and dry, so the oven can dry out and already be fit for use on the Festival; <b>there,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> prohibits constructing an oven, it is referring to <b>the rainy season,</b> i.e., when the weather is such that the oven will not be ready for use on the Festival.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may construct a railing for a roof or a balcony</b> if it is done in a nonprofessional manner, as <b>the work of a layman, but not</b> if it is done skillfully, as <b>the work of a craftsman. One may plaster the cracks</b> in an oven <b>and roll over them with a roller,</b> a wooden tool used to smooth out clay, <b>with a hand or a foot, but not with a presser,</b> a tool that is specially designed for this task.
With regard to <b>the hinge</b> of a door, <b>and the cylinder</b> of the hinge, <b>and the</b> cross <b>beam</b> that holds the door, <b>and a lock and a key that broke, one may fix them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> as these items are essential for the Festival and their repair cannot be delayed. This is permitted, <b>provided that he does not intend</b> ahead of time <b>to do his labor on the Festival</b> and delay it until that time.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>all preserved food from which one can eat on the Festival,</b> since they become ready to be eaten in a short amount of time, <b>he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which a railing is considered <b>the work of a layman? Rav Yosef said:</b> When it is made <b>with palm branches and</b> the branches of <b>bay trees,</b> which do not create a permanent structure. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>he fills in</b> the space <b>with stone but he does not plaster</b> the stones <b>with clay.</b>
It was taught in the mishna: <b>One may plaster the cracks</b> in an oven <b>and roll over them with a roller,</b> with a hand or a foot, but not with a presser. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that <b>you said</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> to roll over the cracks <b>with a roller, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that one may plaster the cracks <b>with a hand or a foot?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: One may plaster the cracks</b> in an oven <b>and roll over them as if with a roller,</b> meaning <b>with a hand or a foot, but not with a presser,</b> which is a craftsman’s tool made especially for this.
It was taught in the mishna: With regard to <b>the hinge</b> of a door, <b>and the cylinder</b> of the hinge, <b>and the</b> cross <b>beam</b> that holds the door, <b>and a lock and a key that broke, one may fix them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a different mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 5:15): <b>Until the days</b> of Yoḥanan the High Priest, workmen’s <b>hammers would beat in Jerusalem</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. One can deduce from this mishna that <b>until his days, yes,</b> the workmen’s hammers would beat, <b>but from then on, no,</b> because Yoḥanan the High Priest banned such work. This seems to contradict the mishna here that permits fixing certain items on the intermediate days of the Festival.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult: There,</b> when it is prohibited, it is referring to the work of <b>smiths,</b> which generates a great deal of noise; <b>here,</b> where it is permitted, it is referring to the work <b>of carpenters,</b> which is much quieter.
<b>Rav Ḥisda strongly objects to this:</b> If so, people <b>will say</b> that <b>a loud noise is prohibited,</b> but <b>a soft noise is permitted. Rather, Rav Ḥisda said</b> that the apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult</b> for a different reason: <b>This</b> mishna that permits labor is referring to <b>sickles,</b> as sickles emit no noise at all; whereas <b>that</b> mishna that prohibits labor is referring to <b>chisels. Rav Pappa said: Here</b> in the mishna it is referring to the period <b>before the decree</b> of Yoḥanan the High Priest; whereas <b>there</b> in the other mishna it is referring to the period <b>after the decree.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: That</b> mishna, which prohibits this labor, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda;</b> while <b>this</b> mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. As Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that all labor performed <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> must be done <b>with a change,</b> i.e., in an altered manner, even <b>with</b> regard to <b>a matter that will be lost</b> if timely action is not taken? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> as Rabbi Yosei permits doing labor that will prevent financial loss even when it is done in the usual manner.
<b>Ravina said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we now lift the lintel above the door</b> in order to drive in the nails that had loosened <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival</b> in the usual manner? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this done? It is done <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who permits labor that will prevent financial loss even when it is done in the usual manner.
§ It was taught in the mishna: With regard to all <b>preserved food from which he can eat on the Festival, he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara relates that the <b>Bedita</b> River once <b>overflowed,</b> depositing large quantities of <b>fish</b> in small water deposits on the river bank on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Everyone went and trapped and brought</b> home <b>fish,</b> and <b>Rava permitted them to salt</b> some <b>of</b> the fish.
<b>Abaye said to him: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>all preserved food from which he can eat on the Festival, he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival? In this case it was impossible to eat that much fish on the Festival, and therefore preserving them should have been prohibited. Rava <b>said to him: Since they initially brought</b> these fish <b>with the intention of eating</b> them on the Festival, and it only became clear afterward that they had brought too many, <b>and if one would leave them</b> without salting them <b>they would be ruined, they are</b> treated <b>like merchandise that will be lost, and</b> therefore preserving them <b>is permitted.</b>
<b>And some say</b> that it did not happen in this manner, rather, <b>Rava permitted them to trap</b> the fish, <b>to bring them</b> home, <b>and to salt</b> them. <b>Abaye said to him: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>all preserved food from which he can eat on the Festival, he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival? These fish were heavily salted and consequently could not be eaten until they thoroughly dried out.
Rava <b>said to him: These</b> fish that were just salted <b>can also be eaten</b> now, <b>by pressing</b> out the salt and brine, and therefore, they too are fit to be eaten on the Festival, <b>as in that</b> case <b>of Shmuel,</b> where <b>they prepared</b> recently salted fish <b>for him by pressing</b> it <b>sixty times and he ate</b> the fish. The Gemara relates that <b>Rava happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch</b> and <b>they prepared</b> freshly salted fish <b>for him by pressing</b> it <b>sixty times, and he ate</b> it.
Apropos eating fish in various ways, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Shapir,</b> and <b>they brought before him a certain fish,</b> of which <b>one- third</b> was <b>cooked, one-third</b> was <b>salted</b> and made edible via pressing, and <b>one-third</b> was <b>broiled.</b>
<b>Rav said: Adda the fisherman told me</b> that <b>a fish</b> that has sat for some time and is <b>close to spoiling is</b> at its <b>best. And Rav</b> also <b>said: Adda the fisherman told me:</b> With regard to <b>a fish, broil it with its brother,</b> i.e., with salt, which, like fish, also comes from the sea; <b>place it in its father,</b> i.e., in water; and <b>eat it with its son,</b> i.e., with fish brine which comes from it; <b>and drink after it its father,</b> i.e., water.
<b>And</b> in addition <b>Rav said: Adda the fisherman told me:</b> After eating <b>fish, cress, and milk, let the body carry them and let not the bed carry them,</b> i.e., it is advisable to go for a walk after eating them, rather than immediately going to sleep. <b>And Rav said: Adda the fisherman told me:</b> After eating <b>fish, cress, and milk,</b> it is better to drink <b>water and not beer,</b> and if he has no water, he should drink <b>beer and not wine,</b> in order to avoid harming his body.

Daf 11b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna discusses <b>one who had</b> already <b>turned over his olives</b> as part of the process of preparing them for pressing, <b>and mourning</b> for a close relative <b>befell him</b> and as a result he was prohibited from engaging in work, <b>or</b> some other <b>unavoidable accident</b> occurred, <b>or</b> his <b>workers misled him,</b> promising to come but failing to do so, so that he could not press his olives before the Festival. Under these circumstances, during the intermediate days of the Festival, <b>he may</b> place the olives in the press and <b>load the beam</b> with weights for the <b>initial</b> pressing of the olives and <b>leave it</b> this way <b>until after the Festival;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: He may press</b> the olives <b>and complete</b> the process <b>and</b> then <b>plug</b> each barrel of oil <b>in its</b> usual <b>manner.</b> Since delay can entail financial loss, the Sages did not require him to alter the normal process of extracting the oil.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: The <i>tanna</i> <b>opens</b> the mishna <b>with</b> a case of <b>mourning and ends</b> it <b>with</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the intermediate days of <b>the Festival,</b> leaving the connection between them unclear. <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: That is to say: Actions that are permitted on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival are prohibited during the days of one’s mourning.</b> Therefore, if a mourning period befell one before the Festival, and he could not prepare properly for the Festival due to the prohibition against performance of labor by a mourner, he is permitted to perform labor during the intermediate days of the Festival to avoid financial loss.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the didactic style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> and he is teaching two separate <i>halakhot</i>, one about mourning and the other about the Festival: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that <b>during the days of his mourning, when</b> the prohibition against labor <b>is rabbinic, it is permitted</b> to perform labor that, if delayed, could cause serious loss; <b>but even on the</b> intermediate days of the <b>Festival, when the prohibition against</b> performing <b>labor is by Torah law,</b> performing such labor is permitted because <b>in a case of a loss the Sages permitted</b> it.
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi: These are actions that</b> others <b>perform for the mourner during the days of his mourning:</b> If <b>his olives have</b> already <b>been turned over, they may load</b> them <b>for him</b> into the olive press, <b>and</b> likewise if <b>his cask</b> needs <b>to be plugged, or</b> if <b>his flax</b> needs <b>to be lifted out of the soaking pool</b> where it will rot if not removed in time, <b>or</b> if <b>his wool</b> needs <b>to be lifted from the cauldron</b> into which it was placed for dyeing, they perform all these actions for him. <b>They</b> also <b>irrigate his field when his turn for water arrives,</b> as in many places, each field would receive water in turn according to a prearranged schedule. If one does not utilize the water when his turn arrives, he loses that water. This supports Rav Sheisha’s opinion that the prohibition against performing labor is waived in cases of loss only on the Festival. Under such circumstances, labor is prohibited to a mourner and in cases of loss may only be performed for him by others.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They also sow for him a plowed field or a field set aside for flax,</b> where the time of sowing is critical. If the field is sown later, it will cause a loss. The Sages <b>said to him: If</b> that field <b>is not sown in the early</b> season, <b>it can be sown in the later</b> season; and similarly, <b>if it is not sown with flax, it can be sown with another species.</b> Therefore, this is not considered a great loss, and the Sages did not permit it.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If <b>his olives have</b> already <b>been turned over and there is no skilled worker</b> available who knows how to press them properly <b>but him,</b> or <b>his cask</b> needs <b>to be plugged and there is no skilled worker</b> available <b>but him,</b> or <b>his flax</b> needs <b>to be lifted out of the soaking pool, or his wool</b> needs <b>to be lifted from the cauldron, and there is no skilled worker</b> available <b>but him, he may perform</b> all of these actions himself <b>in private.</b>
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said further: If</b> this mourner <b>was a craftsman</b> who serves <b>the public,</b> providing a necessary service, <b>or a barber or a bath attendant for the public, and the time of the Festival arrived,</b> i.e., it was the eve of a Festival, <b>and there is no</b> other <b>skilled worker</b> available <b>but him,</b> then <b>he may perform</b> the labor even in public, as the needs of the public takes precedence over the mourning of an individual.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Tenant farmers,</b> who farm others’ land in exchange for a certain percentage of the crop, <b>and leasers,</b> who work the land in exchange for a fixed amount of the crop, <b>and contractors,</b> who work the land in exchange for a set amount of money, are included amongst <b>those for whom others may perform</b> their labor when they are in mourning. In contrast, <b>donkey drivers, camel drivers, and sailors</b> are <b>those</b> for whom others <b>may not perform</b> their work during their mourning periods. <b>However, if they</b> or their animals <b>were leased or hired out to others, then they may perform</b> work, because they were hired personally and cannot be replaced without loss. <b>A day laborer, even</b> if he is <b>in a different city</b> where his mourning status is not public knowledge, <b>may not perform</b> his work. If <b>a commission for others was his responsibility, even if it was by contract</b> and he was paid not by the day but upon its completion, <b>he may not perform</b> that labor.
The statement in the <i>baraita</i> that one may not perform a task for others <b>even if it was by contract</b> implies that <b>it is not necessary</b> to state that if it was <b>not by contract</b> the work is prohibited to a mourner. The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> when he works <b>by contract it is considered as</b> though it were <b>his</b> own work, since he simply receives payment for the completed task. Non-contracted labor, where he is paid for the time he works, is not viewed as his own and it is conceivable that it would be permitted during his mourning period. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> emend the text and <b>say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read: If a commission for others was his responsibility, <b>whether by contract or not by contract, he may not perform</b> it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>he commissioned others</b> to perform <b>his work,</b> then if it was <b>in his house they may not perform</b> the work, but if it was <b>in another house they may perform</b> it.
The Gemara relates that <b>Maryon, son of Ravin, and Mar, son of Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, held a team of</b> two <b>oxen</b> in partnership <b>between them,</b> one ox apiece. <b>An event,</b> i.e., a death in the family, <b>befell Mar, son of Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, and he detached his</b> ox <b>from the team,</b> preventing any work from being performed by the team, because he did not want work performed with his animal during his days of mourning. <b>Rav Ashi said: A distinguished man like Mar, son of Rav Aḥa, is behaving this</b> way? <b>Granted, he is not concerned about his own loss,</b> but <b>is he not concerned about the loss of others,</b> i.e., his partner? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>If they</b> or their animals <b>were hired out or leased to others, then they may perform</b> their work? In that case, why not allow the partner to work with the animal of Mar, son of Rav Aḥa?
The Gemara explains: <b>But</b> Mar, son of Rav Aḥa, <b>maintains: An important person is different.</b> Even if strictly speaking something is permitted, an important person must be more rigorous with himself, so that people learn not to take the <i>halakha</i> lightly.

Daf 12a

§ <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to gentile <b>contractors,</b> who are paid for the completed job rather than by the day, <b>it is prohibited</b> for them to work for a Jew <b>within</b> the boundaries of <b>the</b> Shabbat <b>limit</b> on a day that it is prohibited for the Jew to work. It looks like the Jew assigned work for them to do on that day, even though they in fact make their own schedule. <b>Outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> where Jews will not see the work being done, <b>it is permitted.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: And even outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, we said only</b> that it is permissible to let them work <b>when there is no</b> other <b>city in close proximity to there, but if there is</b> another <b>city in close proximity to there, it is prohibited,</b> since the work is likely to be seen by a Jew.
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: And even when there is no</b> other <b>city in close proximity, we said</b> that it is permissible for gentile contractors to work for a Jew <b>only on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals, when</b> Jewish <b>people do not routinely go there,</b> i.e., to the place where the work is being performed. <b>However, on the intermediate days of a Festival, when</b> Jewish <b>people routinely come and go from there</b> and see the work being done, <b>it is prohibited.</b>
The Gemara relates about <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman,</b> that gentile <b>contractors built a mansion [<i>apadana</i>] for him outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit. Rav Safra and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana happened</b> to come there, <b>but they did not enter it,</b> because it had been built on Shabbat in a prohibited manner. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: Even he,</b> Mar Zutra himself, <b>did not enter it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Shmuel say:</b> With regard to gentile <b>contractors, within</b> the boundaries of <b>the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, it is prohibited</b> to let them work on Shabbat, but <b>outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit it is permitted?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>An important person is different</b> and must behave in a stricter manner. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: He provided them with assistance with straw</b> for making the bricks. Consequently, they were not fully independent contractors, and therefore it was prohibited for them to work on Shabbat, even outside the Shabbat limit.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥama permitted the bath attendants [<i>abunagrei</i>] of the Exilarch’s house to work for them,</b> i.e., the Exilarch and his household, <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival. He said</b> in explanation of this leniency: <b>Since they do not take payment</b> for working during the week of the Festival, they <b>are</b> merely <b>conferring a favor</b> on the Exilarch. Therefore, it is not viewed as actual labor, <b>and we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Gentiles <b>may receive contract work on</b> the intermediate days of a <b>Festival</b> in order <b>to execute it after the Festival, but it is prohibited</b> to execute it <b>during the Festival</b> week itself. <b>The principle of the matter</b> is: <b>Any</b> action <b>that</b> a Jew <b>may perform</b> himself, <b>he may tell a gentile to perform, and any</b> action <b>that he may not perform</b> himself, <b>he may not tell a gentile to perform. It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: A gentile <b>may receive contract work on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> in order <b>to execute it after the Festival, provided that he does not measure, weigh, or count,</b> in order to plan the work, <b>in the</b> same <b>manner as he does on an</b> ordinary <b>weekday.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not breed an animal,</b> i.e., coax or compel a male to mate with a female, <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> as this is similar to prohibited labor. <b>Similarly, one may not breed a firstborn</b> animal, <b>nor an unfit consecrated animal.</b> It is prohibited to ever work these animals because of their sanctified status, and breeding them resembles working them.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not breed an animal on the intermediate days of a Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>a she-donkey yearns</b> for a mate because she is in heat, <b>one may breed her with a male, lest she cool off,</b> i.e., lest her estrus cycle pass without her mating, which will cause a significant loss. With regard to <b>all other animals</b> that are in heat, <b>they are</b> merely <b>brought into corrals</b> in which there are males, there being no need for further human intervention.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not enclose</b> livestock in particular areas of a field, in order to fertilize that area with their manure, <b>on <i>Shabbatot</i>, or on Festivals, or on the intermediate days of a Festival. But if</b> the animals <b>came on their own</b> to the field, <b>it is permitted,</b> and he need not remove them although he benefits from their manure.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And one may not assist</b> gentile shepherds in pasturing their sheep in his field so that it will be fertilized, <b>nor may one provide them with a shepherd to</b> help <b>herd their sheep</b> all around the field so that it is completely fertilized. If the gentile shepherds <b>were hired by the week, by the month, by the year,</b> or <b>by the septennial</b> period, i.e., the seven years from one Sabbatical Year to the next, <b>one may assist them and provide them with a shepherd to herd their sheep.</b> Since they were hired for an extended period of time, it is not as though they were hired specifically for Shabbat or the Festival. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: On Shabbat</b> one may have the gentile pasture the sheep in one’s field <b>as a favor,</b> i.e. in order to earn one’s good graces, but not for pay; <b>on a Festival,</b> it is permitted even in exchange <b>for food;</b> and <b>on the</b> intermediate days of <b>the Festival,</b> it is permitted <b>for pay. Rav Yosef said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one whose wine was</b> already <b>in the</b> collection <b>pit</b> beside the wine press and needed to be removed lest it sour, <b>and mourning</b> for some close relative <b>or</b> some other <b>unavoidable accident befell him, or</b> his workers <b>misled him,</b> promising to come but failing to do so, during the intermediate days of the Festival <b>he may draw off</b> the wine <b>and complete</b> the process, <b>and</b> then <b>plug</b> each barrel of wine <b>in its</b> usual <b>manner;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: He should construct a wooden panel</b> to cover the collection pit <b>so that</b> the wine <b>will not sour.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> both this mishna and the previous one (11b), about the olive press, are <b>necessary, as, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> only <b>the first</b> mishna, one might say that only <b>in that</b> case <b>does Rabbi Yosei say</b> that one is permitted to complete the process, <b>because</b> in the case of <b>oil, the</b> potential <b>loss is considerable. However,</b> in the case of <b>wine, where the loss is not</b> as <b>considerable,</b> one might say <b>that he concedes to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that it must be done in an altered manner. <b>And if he teaches us</b> only <b>the last</b> mishna, one might say that only <b>in that</b> case involving wine <b>did Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that one must be stringent, <b>but in the other</b> case involving oil one might <b>say that he concedes to Rabbi Yosei</b> and is lenient. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both cases.
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Abba said: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who teaches that labor performed <b>during the intermediate days of the Festival</b> must be performed in <b>an altered fashion</b> even <b>with regard to a matter that,</b> if unattended, will result in significant <b>loss?</b> That ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yosei’s</b> opinion, as Rabbi Yosei permits one to perform labor that will prevent such a loss even in the usual manner. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and it is permitted in cases of loss to perform labor in the usual manner.
The students <b>asked of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to sealing a barrel of beer during the intermediate days of the Festival?</b> If it is not properly sealed, the beer will leak out through the sides of the barrel. <b>He said to them: Sinai,</b> i.e., Rav Yosef, <b>said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> They asked: <b>Say that Rabbi Yosei said</b> that one may be lenient <b>about wine,</b> but <b>about beer does he say</b> the same thing? Beer is much cheaper than wine, and the loss would be much less significant.
The Gemara explains why no distinction should be made: With regard to <b>wine, what is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yosei was lenient? It is <b>because the loss</b> involved <b>is considerable;</b> with <b>beer as well, there is a loss</b> if the barrel is not properly sealed, <b>as Abaye said:</b> My foster <b>mother told me:</b> It is better to have a barrel <b>of six <i>se’a</i> that is sealed than</b> a barrel <b>of eight</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>that is not sealed,</b> as in the end more beer will remain in the smaller sealed barrel than in the larger unsealed one.
§ <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakhot</i> relating to</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival resemble the <i>halakhot</i> relating to the Samaritans in the <i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> aspect of <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> are they similar? <b>Rav Daniel bar Ketina said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> He meant <b>to convey that they are sterile, and one may not learn</b> further <i>halakhot</i> by extrapolation <b>one from one another</b> in both of these areas of <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara offers an example: <b>For</b> instance, <b>Shmuel said: One may seal a jug with pitch, but one may not seal a barrel with pitch</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a said: One may seal a barrel with pitch, but one may not seal</b> a small <b>jug with pitch.</b> Their reasoning is as follows: <b>This Sage,</b> i.e., Rav Dimi, <b>was</b> more <b>concerned about</b> possible financial <b>loss,</b> and so he permitted sealing the larger vessel, for which the potential for loss is great, but not the smaller one. <b>And this Sage,</b> i.e., Shmuel <b>was concerned about</b> unnecessary <b>exertion</b> on the Festival, and therefore he permitted sealing the smaller vessel, which requires less effort.
<b>Abaye stated</b> a different principle: <b>We have a tradition</b> that <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival are like the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat:</b>

Daf 12b

<b>Some of</b> the actions for which one is <b>exempt</b> by Torah law <b>are</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited, and some of them</b> are <b>permitted <i>ab initio</i>.</b>
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna had his crop harvested for him on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. Rabba bar Rav Huna raised an objection to</b> his father <b>Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may grind flour on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival for the sake of the Festival, but</b> if it is <b>not for the sake of the Festival,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b> With regard to <b>a matter that,</b> if unattended, will result in significant <b>loss on the Festival, it is permitted to perform</b> labor to prevent that loss <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival.</b> For <b>a matter that</b> will not result <b>in loss</b> if unattended during the intermediate days of <b>the Festival, it is prohibited</b> to perform labor.
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of crops that are already <b>detached from the ground, but</b> in the case of crops that are still <b>attached to the ground, even if it all will be lost,</b> labor <b>is prohibited</b> during the intermediate days of the Festival. <b>And if one does not have anything to eat,</b> then <b>he may reap and bind sheaves, and thresh, and winnow</b> the grain in the wind, <b>and separate</b> the grain from the chaff, <b>and grind</b> the grain into flour, <b>provided that he does not thresh with cows,</b> the way that threshing is performed on an ordinary weekday. Why, then, did Rav Huna, who certainly had enough to eat, allow his workers to reap the field during the Festival week?
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> his son: The opinion expressed in this unattributed <i>baraita</i> <b>is an individual</b> opinion, <b>and we do not hold in accordance with it; as it is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel stated a principle in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> In the case of <b>an item that is</b> already <b>detached from the ground, even if</b> only <b>a portion of it will be lost</b> by not working during the Festival, <b>it is permitted</b> to perform labor to prevent the loss, <b>whereas</b> for crops <b>that are</b> still <b>attached to the ground, even if all of them will be lost, it is prohibited</b> to perform labor for them. The opinion that all labor is prohibited for crops that have not yet been harvested is the opinion of an individual authority, Rabbi Yosei, with whom the Rabbis disagree.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> the unattributed <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and it is permitted to work when one has nothing to eat, <b>let him thresh even with cows.</b> Didn’t <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Abba say: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that labor performed <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> must be done in <b>an altered manner</b> even <b>with regard to a matter that</b> will involve <b>a loss</b> if unattended? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> as Rabbi Yosei does not require altering the manner in which one performs the labor. Why, then, does the <i>baraita</i> say that the threshing must be done in an altered manner and not with cows?
The Gemara rejects this argument: Rabbi Yosei could have <b>said to you: Here, too, since one does not always thresh with cows,</b> threshing without them <b>now</b> on the intermediate days of the Festival <b>is also not</b> considered threshing in <b>an altered manner.</b> The prohibition against threshing with cows is not because one must perform that labor in an altered manner but in order to avoid attracting public attention to the fact that one is working during the Festival week.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may grind</b> flour <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival for the sake of the Festival, but</b> if it is <b>not for the sake of the Festival,</b> it is <b>prohibited. And if he ground and left</b> some flour <b>over, it is permitted</b> for use after the Festival. Similarly, <b>one may cut down trees on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival for the sake of the Festival, but</b> if it is <b>not for the sake of the Festival</b> it is <b>prohibited. And if he cut down</b> trees for the Festival <b>and left</b> some wood <b>over, it is permitted</b> for use after the Festival.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>One may brew beer on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival for the sake of the Festival, but</b> if it is <b>not for the sake of the Festival,</b> it is <b>prohibited. And if he brewed</b> beer for the sake of the Festival <b>and left</b> some <b>over, it is permitted</b> for use after the Festival <b>provided that he does not employ an artifice,</b> exploiting the allowance to work on a Festival by knowingly making more than was needed.
The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may brew beer on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival for the sake of the Festival, but</b> if it is <b>not for the sake of the Festival,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b> This applies <b>both</b> to <b>date beer and</b> to <b>barley beer. And even though he has old</b> beer, <b>he may employ an artifice and drink from the new</b> beer, i.e., he may say he prefers new beer and brew a new batch, although he has enough old beer for the Festival. This statement contradicts the previous <i>baraita</i> that prohibited circumventing the prohibition against labor through artifice. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not employ an artifice in this regard,</b> i.e., to circumvent the prohibition against labor during the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: One may employ an artifice.</b>
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav had his crop harvested on the intermediate days of a Festival. Shmuel heard</b> about this and <b>was dismayed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Shmuel holds in accordance with the individual</b> opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who prohibits all labor for crops that are attached to the ground, even if inattention will result in significant loss? The Gemara answers: <b>No, it was a crop of wheat, which would not have been ruined</b> had the harvest been pushed off a week, and therefore Shmuel was offended.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rav acted in this manner?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav is in the category of <b>one who does not have anything to eat,</b> and that is why it was permitted to harvest his crops. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why, then, did <b>Shmuel</b> disapprove? The Gemara explains: The people who reported Rav’s actions to Shmuel <b>did not complete</b> the story <b>for him. Alternatively, an important person</b> such as Rav <b>is different,</b> and Shmuel thought Rav should have been stringent even in his difficult circumstances.
It was further related that <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia</b> once <b>went out</b> on Shabbat <b>with a coral seal [<i>ḥumreta</i>]</b> on his ring <b>and drank water heated by a gentile cook. Rabbi Ami heard</b> about this and <b>was dismayed</b> about both things. <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the reason</b> that <b>he was dismayed? If</b> it was <b>because of the coral seal, isn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Bracelets, nose rings, and rings are like all</b> other <b>utensils that may be carried in a courtyard?</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda Nesia’s action conformed to <i>halakha</i>.
And <b>if</b> Rabbi Ami was dismayed <b>because</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>drank water heated by a gentile cook [<i>kapeila</i>], didn’t Shmuel bar Yitzḥak say</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>anything that is eaten raw,</b> like water, even if it was cooked by a gentile, <b>it is not subject to</b> the prohibition against eating <b>food cooked by gentiles?</b> The Gemara resolves both difficulties: <b>An important person is different,</b> and Rabbi Ami believed that Rabbi Yehuda Nesia should have been more stringent.
<b>Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person may chop down a palm tree on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, although he needs only its sawdust.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Abaye cursed it,</b> i.e., the behavior of one who exerts such effort on the Festival for so small a need.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ashi had a forest [<i>ava</i>] in Shelaniya. He went to cut it down on the intermediate days of the Festival. Rav Sheila from Shelaniya said to Rav Ashi: What is your opinion</b> about what you are doing? Do you rely on <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person may chop down a palm tree on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival even though he needs only its sawdust? Didn’t Abaye curse</b> such behavior? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: I did not hear</b> that Abaye said that; <b>that is to say,</b> in a delicate way, <b>I do not hold</b> in accordance with his opinion. <b>The</b> iron of Rav Ashi’s <b>ax</b> then <b>slipped</b> and <b>was about to cut off his leg. He left it,</b> ceasing his chopping, <b>and came back again</b> to chop down the forest only after the Festival.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda permitted uprooting flax, cutting hops, and uprooting sesame plants</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Granted,</b> this is reasonable in the case of <b>flax,</b> which is <b>suitable for</b> use as <b>a cover [<i>ḥafifa</i>]</b> for various objects and therefore has a use even during the Festival, and so too <b>hops,</b> which are <b>suitable for</b> making <b>beer, but for what are sesame plants suitable,</b> since the sesame seeds require a long drying period before oil can be extracted from them? Rav Yosef said to him: <b>They are suitable for the seeds [<i>nazyei</i>] on them,</b> which can be consumed immediately.
It was further mentioned that <b>Rabbi Yannai had an orchard whose time</b> for harvesting the fruit <b>arrived during the intermediate days of the Festival. He harvested it</b> during the Festival, as the fruit would otherwise have spoiled. <b>The following year, everyone delayed</b> the harvest of <b>their orchards until the intermediate days of the Festival. Rabbi Yannai declared</b> the earnings from <b>his orchard ownerless that year,</b> since his harvesting of his fruit provided a misleading example for the public, causing many people to adopt an inappropriate leniency.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may bring his fruit in</b> from the field on the intermediate days of the Festival <b>because</b> he is concerned <b>about thieves, and he may draw his flax out of the soaking pool so that it is not ruined</b> from soaking too long in the water, <b>provided that he does not plan</b> from the outset to perform <b>his work on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival. And</b> with regard to <b>all</b> of these cases, <b>if one planned</b> from the outset to perform <b>his labor on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival,</b> the fruit of that labor <b>must be lost</b> and no benefit may be derived from it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one may bring in crops out of concern for thieves, <b>provided that he brings them into his house discreetly.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef had</b> wooden <b>beams,</b> which <b>he brought into</b> his house <b>during the day</b> on one of the intermediate days of a Festival.
<b>Abaye said to him: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One may bring in items <b>provided that he brings them into his house discreetly?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Discretion</b> with respect <b>to these</b> beams <b>is</b> moving them during <b>the day, since at night more people are required, and</b> also <b>torchbearers [<i>medokhrei denura</i>] are needed,</b> and <b>the matter</b> would be more <b>noticeable.</b>
The mishna states: <b>And he may draw his flax out of the soaking pool</b> so that it is not ruined from soaking too long in the water, provided that he does not plan from the outset to do his work on the intermediate days of the Festival. And with regard to anyone, if he planned from the outset to perform his labor on the intermediate days of the Festival, the fruit of that labor must be destroyed. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira:</b> If <b>one planned</b> from the outset to perform <b>his labor on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, and he died</b> after doing so, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Should his children be penalized after him</b> and have to lose the products of their father’s labor?
Even <b>if you might say</b> that

in the case of <b>one who slit the ear of a firstborn</b> animal, the Sages <b>penalized his son after him,</b> that is <b>because the prohibition is by Torah law.</b> A firstborn animal is disqualified from sacrifice if it becomes blemished, rendering it permitted to be eaten as non-sacred meat. It is prohibited to deliberately engender a blemish in a firstborn animal, and one who does so is prohibited from eating the meat.
<b>And if you might say</b> that in the case of <b>one who sold his slave to a gentile and</b> then <b>died</b> the Sages <b>penalized his son after him,</b> that is <b>because every day</b> the slave <b>is in the gentile’s possession precludes him from</b> performing mitzvot. A Canaanite slave is obligated in the same mitzvot as a Jewish woman. If he is illicitly sold to a gentile and escapes, requiring the seller to compensate the gentile, the seller may not then re-enslave the slave, who is regarded as emancipated. The Sages extended this penalty to the owner’s heirs as well.
<b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i> <b>here,</b> where one planned from the outset to perform his work on the intermediate days of a Festival and then after performing the work he died? Should one say that <b>the Sages penalized the man</b> himself <b>and he is no longer</b> alive, <b>or perhaps the Sages imposed a penalty on the money,</b> such that no benefit may be derived from it, <b>and it</b> still <b>exists</b> in the hands of his heirs?
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>You</b> already <b>learned</b> the answer to your question in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 4:2): <b>A field whose thorns were removed during the Sabbatical Year may be sown in the eighth year,</b> as removing thorns is not full-fledged labor that renders the field prohibited; but <b>if it had been improved</b> with fertilizer, <b>or if it had been enclosed</b> so that animals therein would fertilize it with their manure, <b>it may not be sown in the eighth year.</b> The Sages imposed a penalty that one not benefit from prohibited labor. <b>And Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: We have a tradition</b> that if one <b>improved</b> his field in a prohibited manner <b>and</b> then <b>died, his son may sow it. Apparently, the Sages penalized</b> only <b>him,</b> the one who acted wrongly, but <b>the Sages did not penalize his son. Here, too,</b> with regard to work performed on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>the Sages penalized him,</b> but <b>the Sages did not penalize his son.</b>
<b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> that if one <b>rendered impure another’s ritually pure items and died</b> before paying, the Sages <b>did not penalize his son after him</b> and require him to pay for the damage. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>damage that is not evident,</b> i.e., that does not involve any physical change visible to the eye, <b>is not considered damage</b> by Torah law; nevertheless, the injured party suffers a loss, and <b>the Sages penalized</b> only him, but <b>the Sages did not penalize his son.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not purchase houses, slaves, and cattle</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>unless</b> it is <b>for the sake of the Festival, or</b> to provide <b>for the needs of the seller who does not have anything to eat.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>wages</b> for a worker <b>who does not have anything to eat?</b> Is it permitted to provide a poor worker with work on the intermediate days of the Festival? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: We learned</b> this in the mishna: <b>Or</b> to provide <b>for the needs of the seller, if he has nothing to eat. What is added by</b> mentioning the condition that he has nothing to eat? Does it not <b>add</b> the case of <b>wages</b> and not only the case of one selling items he owns? Rava <b>said to him: No,</b> it <b>is</b> merely <b>explaining</b> what is meant by the needs of the seller.
<b>Abaye raised an objection</b> from a mishna (18b): <b>Promissory notes may not be written on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, but if</b> the lender <b>does not trust</b> the borrower and is concerned that without such a note he will be unable to collect, <b>or if he has nothing to eat, he may write</b> a promissory note. The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is added</b> here by the words: <b>If he has nothing to eat?</b> Are they not meant to add that a promissory note may be written for the sake of <b>the wages</b> of the scribe who draws up the document? <b>Conclude from it</b> that it is permitted to hire a worker who is in need of a livelihood even for work that would otherwise be prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 55a) that addresses the prohibition against performing labor on the eve of Passover: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The practitioners of only <b>three crafts</b> are permitted to <b>perform labor until midday on Passover eve,</b> and they are <b>the tailors, the barbers, and the launderers,</b> whose work is needed for the Festival. The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>The tailors</b> may perform labor on Passover eve, <b>as a layperson</b> is permitted to <b>sew in his</b> usual <b>manner during the intermediate days of the Festival.</b> Since similar labor is permitted during the Festival, one may be lenient on Passover eve as well. <b>The barbers and the launderers</b> are permitted to work, <b>as those who arrive from overseas</b> or <b>one who leaves prison</b> are permitted to <b>cut</b> their <b>hair and wash</b> their clothes <b>on the intermediate days of the Festival</b> because they had no opportunity to do so prior to the Festival.
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that paying <b>wages</b> to a worker <b>who does not have anything to eat is permitted</b> on the intermediate days of the Festival, then <b>all</b> other types of <b>labor should also be permitted</b> on the eve of Passover, <b>as there is</b> something similar permitted on the intermediate days of the Festival, namely, <b>the wages</b> paid to a worker <b>who does not have anything to eat.</b> Tailors are permitted to work on the eve of Passover because similar work is permitted during the intermediate days of the Festival. The payment of wages to a worker who does not have anything to eat on the Festival must be prohibited, as otherwise similar work, i.e., any work involving the payment of wages, would be permitted on the eve of Passover, which is not the case.
<b>Rav Pappa strongly objects to this: If that is so,</b> that one can derive <i>halakhot</i> in this manner, then <b>building</b> as well <b>should be permitted</b> on the eve of Passover, <b>as a wall that tilts toward the public domain</b> and is likely to fall <b>may be demolished and rebuilt in the usual manner</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>due to the danger</b> posed to passersby. Since building under such circumstances is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival, it should be permitted in general on the eve of Passover.
<b>Ravina</b> also <b>strongly objects to this: If that is so, a scribe [<i>lavlar</i>]</b> who draws up documents <b>should be permitted</b> to do so on the eve of Passover, <b>as one may write betrothal deeds, bills of divorce, and receipts</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> that Rav Sheshet’s original objection has no basis: <b>Are you raising a contradiction</b> between the <i>halakhot</i> of the intermediate days of <b>a Festival and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the fourteenth</b> day of Nisan, i.e., the eve of Passover? They are not comparable, as the prohibition against labor on each is for a different reason: Labor is prohibited on the intermediate days of <b>a Festival because it involves</b> excessive <b>exertion, and in a situation of</b> significant <b>loss the Sages permitted</b> it. In contrast, the prohibition against labor on <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>is due to the need</b> to prepare <b>for the Festival,</b> and especially the Paschal lamb. <b>Whatever is needed for the Festival,</b> e.g., the work of tailors and barbers, <b>the Sages permitted,</b> but <b>whatever is not needed for the Festival, the Sages did not permit.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not move</b> his possessions <b>from house to house</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>but he may move</b> them <b>to his courtyard</b> if that is necessary. <b>One may not bring</b> home <b>utensils from the house of a craftsman</b> after he has completed his work, but <b>if one is concerned about them</b> that if he leaves them in the craftsman’s house they are likely to be stolen, <b>he may move them to another courtyard.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say in the first clause</b> of the mishna that <b>one may not move</b> one’s possessions <b>at all,</b> even from one house to another? How is it that the mishna then permits moving objects from one courtyard to another in the second clause? <b>Abaye said</b> in explanation: <b>In the latter clause we come to</b> the case of moving objects from <b>the house in his courtyard</b> to that same courtyard.
The mishna states: <b>And one may not bring</b> home <b>utensils from the house of a craftsman. Rav Pappa said: Rava tested us</b> with the following question: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>one may not bring</b> home <b>utensils from the house of a craftsman. And this raises a contradiction to</b> another mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 55b): <b>One may take utensils to and bring them from the house of a craftsman, even if they are not</b> needed <b>for the sake of the Festival.</b>
<b>And we answered him: Here,</b> the mishna that permits the practice is referring <b>to the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, the eve of Passover, and <b>here,</b> the mishna that prohibits it, is referring <b>to the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> And <b>if you wish, say</b> another explanation: Both <b>this and that</b> refer <b>to the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> but <b>here,</b> the mishna that prohibits the practice is referring to a case <b>where he trusts</b> the craftsman and is not concerned about his utensils being lost or stolen, whereas <b>here,</b> the mishna that permits taking utensils to and from the craftsman is referring to a case <b>where he does not trust</b> the craftsman.

Daf 13b

<b>And</b> so <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may bring</b> home <b>utensils from the house of a craftsman; for example, a jug from the jug-maker's house and a cup from the glass-blower’s house,</b> as they will be used on the Festival itself. <b>But</b> he may <b>not</b> bring home <b>wool from the dyer’s house or utensils from the craftsman’s house,</b> as they are not needed on the Festival. <b>But if</b> the craftsman <b>has nothing to eat, he may give him his wages</b> during the Festival week <b>and leave</b> the utensil <b>with him. And if he does not trust</b> the craftsman to properly safeguard his utensil, <b>he may</b> take the utensil from the craftsman and <b>leave it in a house near him. And if he is concerned about</b> his utensils <b>lest they be stolen, he may move them to another courtyard. And if he does not trust</b> the owner of the other courtyard, <b>he may bring them into his house discreetly.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>You have</b> adequately <b>explained</b> the contradiction between the <i>mishnayot</i> about whether <b>one may bring</b> home utensils from the house of a craftsman. The mishna that permits it can be understood as referring to a case where the craftsman is not to be trusted. But the mishna in <i>Pesaḥim</i> also states that <b>one may take</b> utensils to the house of a craftsman, and this is <b>difficult, as</b> the mishna above <b>teaches: One may not bring</b> home utensils from the house of a craftsman. <b>And</b> this indicates that <b>all the more so, one may not take</b> utensils from his house to that of the craftsman. <b>Rather, it is clear as we answered initially</b> that one mishna is referring to the eve of Passover and the other to the intermediate days of a Festival.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>figs</b> that were spread out to dry <b>may be covered with straw</b> to protect them from rain and dew. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may even condense</b> the figs. <b>Those who sell produce, clothing, and utensils may sell</b> them <b>in private, for the sake of the Festival. Fishermen, and groats makers [<i>dashoshot</i>], and</b> bean <b>pounders,</b> who pulverize the beans, <b>may ply</b> their trades <b>in private for the sake of the Festival. Rabbi Yosei says: They were stringent with themselves</b> to refrain from this work even with respect to what was needed for the Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Asi disagree about</b> the following issue, <b>and both of them</b> assert their opinions <b>in the name of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan. One said: Cover</b> the figs means to <b>lightly</b> cover them with straw, and <b>condense</b> means to spread straw over them <b>densely. And</b> the other <b>one said: Cover</b> means to spread straw over them <b>whether lightly or densely,</b> and <b>condense</b> means to amass the figs into a pile, <b>making it as if</b> it were <b>a pile</b> of grain. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may condense,</b> i.e., amass the figs into a pile, <b>making it as if</b> it were <b>a pile</b> of grain. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
§ The mishna states: On the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>those who sell produce, clothing, and utensils may sell</b> them <b>in private,</b> for the sake of the Festival. Fishermen, groats makers, and bean pounders may ply their trades in private for the sake of the Festival. Rabbi Yosei says that they were stringent with themselves. The Sages were <b>asked:</b> When it says that <b>they were stringent with themselves,</b> does it mean that <b>that they did not work at all</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>or perhaps</b> it means <b>that they did</b> their work <b>in private,</b> though it is permitted to do it publicly?
The Gemara answers based on a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Those who sell produce, clothing, and utensils may sell</b> them <b>in private, for the sake of the Festival. Rabbi Yosei says: The merchants of Tiberias were stringent with themselves not to sell at all,</b> even in private. <b>Hunters of animals, fowlers, and fishermen may hunt</b> their quarry <b>discreetly for the sake of the Festival. Rabbi Yosei says: The hunters of Akko were stringent with themselves not to hunt at all. Groats makers</b> who crack grain into groats called <b><i>ḥilka</i>, <i>targis</i>, and <i>tisanei</i>, crack</b> the grain <b>in private for the sake of the Festival. Rabbi Yosei says: The groats makers of Tzippori were stringent with themselves not to crack</b> grain <b>at all.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei, the stringencies involve refraining from work entirely.
<b>Abaye said:</b> The term <b><i>ḥilka</i></b> means <b>one</b> kernel that is broken <b>into two;</b> the term <b><i>targis</i></b> means <b>one</b> kernel that is broken <b>into three;</b> and the term <b><i>tisanei</i></b> means <b>one</b> grain that is broken <b>into four. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> <i>Ḥilka</i> is referring to <b>emmer wheat.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Ḥilka</i>, <i>targis</i>, and <i>tisanei</i> are</b> susceptible to <b>ritual impurity everywhere. Granted, according to the one who said</b> that these are <b>one</b> grain broken <b>into two, into three, and into four, due to that</b> reason <b>they are</b> susceptible to <b>impurity everywhere, as they</b> have already <b>become fit</b> to contract ritual impurity by being rinsed with water in their processing. <b>But according to the one who says that</b> <i>ḥilka</i> <b>is emmer wheat</b> that has not necessarily been processed, <b>why is it susceptible to</b> ritual <b>impurity everywhere,</b> since <b>it has not</b> necessarily <b>become fit</b> to contract impurity by coming into contact with water?
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where, for example,</b> the emmer wheat <b>was husked, since if it had not been</b> previously <b>soaked in water, it would not have been possible to husk it. And why,</b> according to this opinion, <b>is it called <i>ḥilka</i>?</b> It is called this <b>because their husks [<i>ḥelkayhu</i>] were removed.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who vows to</b> prohibit himself <b>from</b> eating <b>grain [<i>dagan</i>]</b> is <b>prohibited to</b> partake <b>of even dry Egyptian beans, and</b> it <b>is permitted</b> for him to partake <b>of fresh</b> beans. <b>And</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him to partake <b>of rice,</b> as well as <b>of <i>ḥilka</i>, and <i>targeis</i>, and <i>tisnei</i>. Granted, according to the one who said</b> that these are <b>one</b> grain broken <b>into two, one</b> grain broken <b>into three, and one</b> grain broken <b>into four, it is fine, as</b> when the wheat is crushed into these <b>it leaves the category of grain. But according to the one who says</b> that <i>ḥilka</i> is <b>emmer wheat, it is</b> still <b>a proper grain.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult.</b>
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna permitted the spice merchants [<i>kerufayata</i>] to go</b> and <b>sell</b> their products <b>in their usual manner in the marketplace</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rav Kahana raised an objection to</b> Rav Huna’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a store opens into a row of pillars</b> that runs along the street, the storekeeper <b>may open and close it in his usual manner</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, since it is not in the public’s view.
However, if it is <b>open to the public domain, he may open</b> only <b>one</b> door <b>and</b> must <b>close the other. And on the eve of the last day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>he may take out</b> his wares from the store <b>and adorn the markets of the city with fruit in honor of the last day of the Festival.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>For the honor of the last day of the Festival, yes,</b> it is permitted for him to open the store in order to give people the opportunity to prepare for the holiday, but when <b>not for the honor of the Festival,</b> i.e., during the other intermediate days of the Festival, he is <b>not</b> permitted to do so. How, then, did Rav Huna permit those spice merchants to sell as usual on the intermediate days of the Festival?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> that prohibits selling in the usual manner is referring <b>to</b> the sale of <b>fruit,</b> which is usually bought in large quantities and could have been purchased before the Festival; people might therefore suspect the buyer of purchasing it for use after the Festival. In contrast, <b>this</b> lenient ruling of Rav Huna is referring <b>to</b> the sale of <b>spices,</b> which is permitted because people buy them only in small quantities for the sake of the Festival.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these may shave</b> and cut their hair <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival: One who comes from a country overseas; and</b> one who is released <b>from a house of captivity; and one who comes out of prison</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival; <b>and one who had been ostracized</b> and therefore prohibited from cutting his hair, <b>and the Sages released him</b> from his decree of ostracism on the intermediate days of the Festival; <b>and similarly, one who</b> had vowed not to cut his hair and then <b>requested of a Sage</b> to dissolve his vow <b>and was released</b> from it on the intermediate days of the Festival; <b>and the nazirite</b> whose term of naziriteship ended on the intermediate days of a Festival; <b>and the leper</b> who needs to purify himself on the intermediate days and must shave his entire body in order to leave <b>his</b> state of ritual <b>impurity</b> and regain <b>his</b> ritual <b>purity.</b> Since these people were not able to cut their hair on the eve of the Festival, they are permitted to do so on the intermediate days of the Festival.
<b>And these may launder</b> their clothes <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival: One who comes from a country overseas; and one who</b> is released <b>from a house of captivity; and one who comes out of prison</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival;

Daf 14a

<b>and one who had been ostracized and the Sages released</b> him from his decree of ostracism; <b>and similarly, one who</b> had vowed not to launder his clothes and he <b>requested from a Sage</b> to dissolve his vow <b>and was released</b> from it on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<b>Hand towels; and barbers’ towels,</b> which are used to cover a person having a haircut; <b>and body-drying towels,</b> all of which get quickly soiled, may be laundered on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b><i>Zavim</i>,</b> men suffering from an impure venereal emission; <b><i>zavot</i>,</b> women who experience a flow of menstrual-type blood on three consecutive days during a time of the month when they do not expect to experience menstrual bleeding; <b>menstruating women; women who have</b> just <b>given birth; and all others who leave</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity for</b> a state of <b>ritual purity</b> on the intermediate days of the Festival, <b>these</b> people <b>are</b> all <b>permitted</b> to launder their clothes in order to purify themselves. <b>But all other people are prohibited</b> from laundering during the intermediate days of the Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>all other people are prohibited</b> from performing these actions during the intermediate days? Why are these actions not included in the category of actions that are permitted in deference to the Festival?
The Gemara answers: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Taanit</i> 15b): Both <b>the members of the priestly watch</b> whose week it is to serve in the Temple <b>and the members of the non-priestly watch</b> who accompanied the members of the watch to Jerusalem <b>are prohibited from cutting</b> their <b>hair or laundering</b> their clothes during that week. <b>But on the Thursday</b> of that week <b>they are permitted</b> to do so <b>in deference to Shabbat.</b>
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: What is the reason</b> that the members of the priestly and non-priestly watch are prohibited from cutting their hair and laundering their clothes? It is <b>in order that they not enter their watch when they are untidy.</b> If it were permitted for them to cut their hair and launder their clothes during the week of their watch, they would leave their haircuts and laundry until the middle of that week and begin their service in a disorderly state. <b>Here, too,</b> ordinary people are prohibited from cutting their hair or laundering their clothes on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>in order that they</b> complete all necessary preparations beforehand and <b>not enter the Festival when they are untidy.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira asks: If one lost an item on the eve of a Festival</b> and he was busy searching for it and had no time to cut his hair or launder his clothes before the Festival commenced, can one say that <b>since</b> he was <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> which prevented from taking care of these matters prior to the Festival, <b>he is permitted</b> to cut his hair and launder his clothes on the intermediate days of the Festival? <b>Or perhaps since it is not</b> clearly <b>evident</b> to others that he failed to cut his hair or launder his clothes due to unavoidable circumstances, he is <b>not</b> permitted to perform these actions during the Festival week.
<b>Abaye said,</b> in answer to this question, that there is a principle of the Sages that applies here. They prohibited the baking of decorated Syrian cakes for Passover, lest people tarry in their preparation of these elaborate cakes and the cakes become leavened. When Baitos ben Zunen wished to prepare the cakes in a way that would not lead to a violation of any prohibition, the Sages nevertheless prohibited it. They explained that were they to permit him to do so, others <b>would say: All the</b> decorated <b>Syrian cakes are forbidden,</b> but <b>the Syrian cakes of Baitos are permitted?</b> This teaches that the Sages do not permit exceptions when the reason for leniency is not clearly evident, like in the case of one who was busy looking for a lost item.
Rabbi Zeira retorted: <b>And according to your reasoning, that which Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who has only one shirt is permitted to launder it on the intermediate days of a Festival, there too,</b> one should apply the principle that others <b>will say: All the</b> decorated <b>Syrian cakes are forbidden</b> but <b>the Syrian cakes of Baitos are permitted.</b> There, too, it is not clearly evident that the reason for leniency is that one has only one shirt.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Wasn’t it</b> already <b>said about this</b> that <b>Mar, son of Rav Ashi, said: His belt is proof for him,</b> as when he launders his only shirt he will have to wear his outer garment tied with his belt so that his body is not exposed, and everyone will understand that he has no other shirt to wear.
<b>Rav Ashi taught</b> a different version of this passage, as follows: <b>Rabbi Zeira asks:</b> With regard to <b>a craftsman who lost an item on the eve of a Festival</b> and was busy searching for it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted for him to launder his clothes and cut his hair on the intermediate days of the Festival because he had been unable to do so before the Festival? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Can one say that <b>since he is a craftsman, it is</b> clearly <b>evident</b> why he did not launder his clothes and cut his hair before the Festival, as many people would have come to his place of work and seen that he was busy looking for his lost article? <b>Or perhaps since</b> the special circumstances <b>are not</b> as clearly <b>evident as in those</b> cases in the mishna, it is <b>not</b> permitted for him to cut his hair or launder his clothes during the intermediate days of the Festival. The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna taught: One who comes <b>from a country overseas</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival is permitted to cut his hair. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who comes from a country overseas</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>must not shave</b> or cut his hair, <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>he left</b> his home <b>without permission.</b>
The Gemara continues to explain the definition and parameters of leaving without permission. <b>Rava said:</b> If one left Eretz Yisrael <b>to travel, all agree</b> that <b>it is prohibited</b> for him to shave during the intermediate days of the Festival because he left on his own initiative, and this is not considered an unavoidable circumstance. If he left <b>for</b> basic <b>sustenance,</b> i.e., due to financial difficulty, <b>all agree</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> for him to shave upon his return because he is regarded as having left due to circumstances beyond his control. <b>They disagree only</b> with regard to the case where he left <b>to</b> earn greater <b>profit,</b> i.e., he had enough to live on in Eretz Yisrael, but he left in order to increase his income. <b>One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>compares him</b> to one who left <b>to travel, and the other Sage,</b> the Rabbis of the mishna, <b>compare him</b> to one who left <b>for</b> basic <b>sustenance.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> The <b>statement of Rabbi Yehuda seems</b> more reasonable in a case <b>when he left without permission, and the statement of the Rabbis</b> seems more reasonable <b>when one left with permission.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>without permission? If we say</b> that it means that he left <b>to travel, didn’t you say</b> that in this case <b>all agree</b> that <b>it is prohibited</b> for him to cut his hair upon his return? <b>Rather,</b> say that it means that he left <b>for</b> basic <b>sustenance.</b> But <b>didn’t you say</b> that <b>all agree</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> for him to cut his hair in such a case? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it means that he left in search of greater <b>profit.</b>
<b>Say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>The statement of the Rabbis seems</b> more reasonable in a case <b>when one left with permission.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>with permission? If we say</b> that he left <b>for</b> basic <b>sustenance, didn’t you say</b> that <b>all agree</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> for him to cut his hair upon his return? <b>Rather,</b> say that it means that he left <b>for</b> greater <b>profit.</b> But <b>didn’t you say</b> in the first clause that <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda seems</b> more reasonable <b>in this</b> case? Therefore, according to Rava’s distinctions, there is an internal contradiction within the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda seems</b> more reasonable <b>to the Rabbis</b> in the case <b>where one left without permission. And what is</b> meant by without permission? It means a case where one left <b>to travel, as even the Rabbis disagree with</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>only</b> when one left <b>for</b> greater <b>profit, but</b> when one left <b>to travel they agree with</b> Rabbi Yehuda that it is prohibited for one to shave and cut his hair. <b>And the statement of the Rabbis seems</b> more convincing <b>to Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the case <b>where one left with permission. And what is</b> meant by with permission? It is a case where one left <b>for</b> basic <b>sustenance, as even Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with</b> the Rabbis <b>only</b> when one left <b>for</b> greater <b>profit, but</b> when he left <b>for</b> basic <b>sustenance</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>concedes to them</b> that it is permitted for him to shave and cut his hair. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s intent was not to decide between the opinions of the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda but to clarify their dispute.
§ <b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>a baby was born on a Festival</b> and he has long hair that is bothering him, <b>it is permitted to cut</b> his hair <b>on the</b> intermediate days of the <b>Festival, as there is no greater prison than this,</b> the womb of his mother, due to which his hair could not have been cut prior to the Festival. A precise reading of Shmuel’s statement indicates that if the child was born <b>on the Festival, yes,</b> his hair may be cut. However, if he was born <b>before</b> the Festival, but for some reason his hair was not cut, <b>no,</b> it is not permitted to cut it on the intermediate days of the Festival because there was time to do so before the Festival.
<b>Rav Pineḥas raised an objection</b> from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of those</b> about <b>whom</b> the Sages <b>said: It is permitted to shave</b> and cut his hair <b>on</b> the intermediate days of the <b>Festival, it is</b> also <b>permitted to shave</b> and cut his hair <b>during the days of his mourning. But</b> from this it follows that <b>one who is prohibited from shaving</b> and cutting his hair <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival is</b> also <b>prohibited from shaving</b> and cutting his hair <b>during the days of his mourning.</b>

Daf 14b

<b>And if you say</b> that with regard to <b>a baby there is a distinction</b> between being born before the Festival and being born on it, and in some cases it is prohibited to cut the hair of a baby, then <b>you find that mourning</b> is <b>practiced</b> even <b>with a minor.</b>
<b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One rends</b> the clothes of <b>a minor</b> whose relative has passed away, <b>due to</b> the desire to bring about feelings of <b>grief</b> among those who see him? However, there is no inherent requirement for the minor to observe any of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Is it taught</b> explicitly in the first <i>baraita</i> cited by Rav Pineḥas that if it is prohibited for one to have a haircut during the Festival, <b>it is</b> likewise <b>prohibited</b> to have a haircut during the week of mourning? That was merely an inference. <b>Perhaps there are</b> those <b>among them,</b> i.e., those listed in the mishna, for whom it is <b>prohibited,</b> while <b>there are</b> others <b>among them</b> for whom it is <b>permitted,</b> and the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning do not apply to a baby.
<b>Ameimar, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, taught</b> that statement <b>in this</b> manner. <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a baby, it is permitted to cut his</b> hair <b>during the Festival.</b> It <b>is no different</b> whether <b>he was born during the Festival, and it is no different</b> whether <b>he was born beforehand.</b>
<b>Rav Pineḥas said: We, too, learn</b> in the <i>baraita</i> a support for this statement: <b>All of those</b> about <b>whom</b> the Sages <b>said: It is permitted to shave</b> and cut his hair <b>on</b> the intermediate days of the <b>Festival, it is</b> also <b>permitted to shave</b> and cut his hair <b>during the days of his mourning. But</b> from this it follows that <b>one who is prohibited from shaving</b> and cutting his hair <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival is</b> also <b>prohibited from shaving</b> and cutting his hair <b>during the days of his mourning.</b>
<b>If you say</b> that with regard to <b>a baby it is prohibited</b> to cut his hair, then <b>you find that mourning</b> is <b>practiced</b> even <b>with a minor. And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One rends</b> the clothes of <b>a minor</b> whose relative has passed away <b>due to</b> the desire to bring about feelings of <b>grief</b> among those who see him. However, there is no inherent requirement for the minor to observe any of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Is it taught</b> explicitly in the first <i>baraita</i> cited by Rav Pineḥas that if it is prohibited for one to shave during the Festival, it is likewise <b>prohibited</b> to shave during the week of mourning? That was merely an inference. <b>Perhaps there are</b> those <b>among them</b> for whom it is <b>prohibited,</b> while <b>there are</b> others <b>among them</b> for whom it is <b>permitted.</b> If so, there is no clear support from this <i>baraita</i> for Shmuel’s statement.
§ <b>A mourner does not practice</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>his mourning on a Festival, as it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14).
The Gemara explains: <b>If it is a mourning</b> period that had already begun <b>at the outset</b> of the Festival, <b>the positive mitzva of</b> rejoicing on the Festival, which is incumbent upon <b>the community, comes and overrides the positive mitzva of</b> the <b>individual,</b> i.e., the mourning. <b>And if the mourning</b> period began only <b>now,</b> i.e., the deceased died during the Festival, <b>the positive mitzva of the individual does not come and override the positive mitzva of the community.</b>
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>one who was ostracized, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Must he <b>observe the practices of ostracism,</b> or are they overridden by the mitzva to rejoice <b>on the Festival? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from that which is taught: During the Festival <b>the court judges</b> cases of <b>capital law,</b> cases of <b>lashes,</b> and cases of <b>monetary law.</b> It is known that <b>if one does not listen to</b> and follow <b>the judgment,</b> among the possibilities of enforcement is that <b>we ostracize him</b> until he accepts the verdict.
<b>And if it enters your mind that one does not observe the practices of ostracism during the Festival,</b> the following <i>a fortiori</i> argument can be made: If, for <b>one who has already been ostracized at the outset</b> of the Festival, <b>the Festival comes and overrides his</b> observance of that status, is it reasonable that <b>now we,</b> the court, should <b>ostracize he</b> who does not listen to the judgment of the court during the Festival itself? Rather, it must be that one does observe the practices of ostracism, even during the Festival.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> There is no proof from here, <b>as perhaps</b> when the <i>baraita</i> states that the court judges cases, what it meant is that it <b>deliberates in judgment</b> on the Festival, but it does not actually reach a verdict. Therefore, the court never ostracizes someone during the Festival. Accordingly, there is no <i>a fortiori</i> argument proving that one observes the practices of ostracism during the Festival. <b>Because if you do not say so,</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to deliberation, then in the cases of <b>capital law that are taught, here too, would we put someone to death</b> on the Festival?
<b>But</b> if so, the judges <b>would be prevented from rejoicing on the Festival, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to the Sanhedrin who put someone to death that they may not taste</b> any food or drink <b>for the entire</b> rest <b>of the day? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood”</b> (Leviticus 19:26). It is not appropriate to eat during the same day that they caused bloodshed.
<b>Rather,</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that the court judges cases of capital law, must be referring <b>to deliberating in judgment</b> and not actually reaching a verdict. <b>Here too,</b> in cases of monetary law and of lashes, it is referring <b>to deliberating in judgment,</b> without the possibility of ostracizing anyone during the Festival. Rav Yosef said <b>to him: If so,</b> if only deliberations are conducted during the Festival, <b>you find a perversion of justice</b> by delaying <b>his</b> verdict.
Rather, the judges <b>come in the morning</b> as usual <b>and deliberate in judgment.</b> They then <b>enter</b> their homes <b>and eat and drink all day,</b> i.e., as much as they desire, in order to rejoice fully on the Festival. <b>Then they come</b> back to the courthouse close to <b>sunset and complete his judgment,</b> i.e., they dispense the verdict, and if necessary, <b>they kill him.</b> In this manner, they are not prevented from enjoying the Festival properly.
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another support from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> it is the case with regard to <b>one who is ostracized, that the Sages permitted him</b> to get a haircut during the intermediate days of the Festival. This indicates that one who is ostracized need not observe the practices of ostracism during the Festival.
<b>Rava said: Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>That they permitted it,</b> which would indicate that <b>the Sages</b> permitted all those who were ostracized to cut their hair on the intermediate days of the Festival? Rather, <b>it is taught: They permitted him.</b> This indicates that it is referring to an individual case, <b>where one went and appeased his</b> opposing <b>litigant and the Sages came and released him</b> from his decree of ostracism.
§ The Gemara asks a similar question: With regard to <b>a leper, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Must he <b>observe the practices of his leper status,</b> or are they overridden by the mitzva to rejoice <b>during the Festival? Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> both <b>the nazirite and the leper</b> who transfers <b>from his</b> state of <b>ritual impurity to his</b> new state of <b>purity</b> may shave on the intermediate days of the Festival. <b>This</b> implies that <b>during the days of his impurity</b> he must <b>observe</b> all of the ordinary practices, even during the Festival.
The Gemara rejects this proof: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> employing the didactic style of: <b>Needless to say. Needless to say, during the days of his impurity</b> on the Festival, <b>he does not observe</b> the practices of ostracism. <b>However,</b> with regard to one who regains <b>his</b> state of <b>purity</b> during the intermediate days of the Festival, one might think that <b>we should issue a decree</b> that he not be permitted to shave, <b>lest he delay</b> sacrificing <b>his offerings</b> until the last day of the Festival, when it is prohibited to sacrifice offerings of an individual. Perhaps prohibiting him from shaving will prevent this possibility. Therefore, because one might have thought that shaving should be prohibited, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that it is, in fact, permitted for him to shave during the intermediate days of the Festival.
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source. The verse states: <b>“And the leper</b> in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent” (Leviticus 13:45). The extra emphasis of the phrase: “And the leper” comes <b>to include the High Priest,</b> teaching that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the leper apply to him. <b>And</b> the status of <b>the High Priest</b> during <b>the entire year is like</b> that of <b>everyone on a Festival, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 12b): The <b>High Priest sacrifices</b> animals when he has the status of <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., before the burial of a close relative who died, <b>but he may not eat</b> of the offering. <b>Learn from it</b> that a leper <b>practices the customs of his leprosy during the Festival.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is so.
§ The source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>it is prohibited for a mourner to</b> receive <b>a haircut is</b> derived <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One states to the sons of Aaron: “Let not the hair of your heads go loose”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). It was prohibited for them to let their hair grow long during their period of mourning over the death of their brothers, Nadav and Avihu. <b>By inference,</b> it is teaching <b>that for everyone</b> else, i.e., non-priests, <b>it is prohibited</b> to cut their hair during the period of mourning.

Daf 15a

The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>those who are ostracized and lepers,</b> with regard to <b>a haircut?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Those who are ostracized and lepers are prohibited from cutting</b> their hair <b>and laundering</b> their clothes.
It was further taught there: If <b>one who is ostracized dies, the court</b> places <b>stones on his coffin. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This does <b>not</b> mean <b>that they pile up a heap of stones over him like the heap</b> of stones that was placed over the grave <b>of Achan</b> (see Joshua 7:26). <b>Rather, the court sends</b> its agents, <b>who place a large stone on his coffin</b> as a symbolic gesture. This comes <b>to teach you</b> that <b>anyone who is ostracized and dies while in his</b> period of <b>ostracism,</b> without seeking to be released from it, <b>the court</b> places <b>stones on his coffin.</b>
§ The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner is obligated to wrap</b> his <b>head</b> as a sign of mourning, covering his head and face. This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel,</b> while he is in mourning: <b>“And cover not your upper lip”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). God commands Ezekiel not to display outward signs of mourning, which proves <b>by inference that everyone</b> else <b>is obligated</b> to wrap their heads in this manner.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a person who is ostracized,</b> with regard to <b>wrapping of the head? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i> about those who were fasting for rain and whose prayers were not answered: <b>And they wrap themselves and sit as those who are ostracized and as mourners, until they are shown mercy from Heaven.</b> This implies that those who are ostracized must wrap their heads like mourners. <b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps one who is ostracized by Heaven is different, as that is more serious</b> than being ostracized by an earthly court.
The Gemara continues and asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>wrapping of the head? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based upon the verse: <b>“And he shall cover his upper lip”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), from which it may be learned <b>by inference that he is obligated to wrap</b> his <b>head.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case.
§ The Gemara moves on to another <i>halakha</i>: <b>A mourner is prohibited from donning phylacteries.</b> This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel,</b> while he is in mourning: <b>“Bind your headwear [<i>pe’er</i>] upon yourself”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). The word <i>pe’er</i> alludes to phylacteries. Ezekiel was unique in that he was commanded to put on phylacteries while in mourning, which proves <b>by inference that everyone</b> else <b>is prohibited</b> from doing so.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>one who is ostracized,</b> with regard to phylacteries? The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. The Gemara proceeds to its next question: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a leper</b> with regard to phylacteries? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the leper”</b> (Leviticus 13:45); as explained earlier, this comes <b>to include the High Priest</b> in all the <i>halakhot</i> of the leper. The verse states there: <b>“His garments shall be <i>perumim</i>,”</b> meaning <b>that they shall be rent.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And his head shall be <i>parua</i>,”</b> and this <b><i>peria</i></b> means <b>only growing the hair long;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The meaning of these terms is derived through a verbal analogy. The verse <b>states</b> a form of the verb <b>being, with regard to</b> one’s <b>head</b> in the verse: “His head shall be,” teaching that a leper must perform a certain action with his head. <b>And the verse states</b> a form of the verb <b>being with regard to</b> a leper’s <b>garment,</b> in the verse: “His garment shall be.” <b>Just as</b> the term <b>being stated with regard to</b> his <b>garment</b> is referring to <b>an object external to his body, so too,</b> the term <b>being</b> used <b>with regard to</b> his <b>head</b> is referring to <b>an object external to his body.</b> The Gemara derives from this: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>phylacteries,</b> and the verse teaches that it is prohibited for a leper to wear phylacteries?
<b>Rav Pappa said: No,</b> there is no proof from here, as the verse may be referring <b>to a cap [<i>kumta</i>] or a scarf [<i>sudara</i>],</b> which people wear on their heads. It is possible to explain that according to Rabbi Akiva, it is prohibited for a leper to wear such headwear because it is excessive adornment.
§ The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner is prohibited from greeting</b> others or being greeted. This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel: “Sigh in silence”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17), implying that aside from what was absolutely essential, he was prohibited from speaking.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to <b>greeting</b> others? <b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> dealing with those who were fasting for rain and whose prayers were not answered. These people were prohibited <b>from greeting one another, as people who are reprimanded by the Omnipresent.</b> This indicates that those who are ostracized must not greet each other, just as mourners may not greet each other. <b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps one who is ostracized by Heaven is different, as that is more serious</b> than being ostracized by an earthly court.
The Gemara continues and asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>greeting</b> others? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall cover his upper lip”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). This means that <b>his lips should be stuck together, that he should be like one who is ostracized and like a mourner, and he is prohibited from greeting</b> others or being greeted. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is so.
The Gemara asks: If this is the case, then <b>we should</b> also <b>resolve</b> the question asked above <b>with regard to one who is ostracized</b> and say that such a person is prohibited from offering greetings. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Pineḥas said in the name of Rav Yosef: Does it</b> explicitly <b>teach</b> that a leper <b>is prohibited</b> from greeting others, like one who is ostracized? <b>It teaches</b> only <b>that he should be</b> treated <b>like one who is ostracized and like a mourner,</b> i.e., he should be like them <b>with regard to other things, and</b> that <b>he is also prohibited from greeting</b> others. This being the case, no proof can be derived from here with regard to whether or not one who is ostracized may offer greetings.
§ The Gemara moves on to a new topic: <b>A mourner is prohibited</b> from studying <b>words of Torah.</b> This prohibition is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel:</b> “Sigh in <b>silence”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). Ezekiel was commanded to be silent and not discuss even Torah matters.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to speaking <b>words of Torah? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is ostracized may teach</b> Torah to others, <b>and</b> others <b>may teach him</b> Torah. Similarly, <b>he may be hired</b> for work by others, <b>and</b> others <b>may be hired by him.</b>
<b>One who has been excommunicated,</b> which is a more severe form of ostracism, <b>may not teach</b> Torah to others <b>and</b> others <b>may not teach him. He may not be hired</b> by others, <b>and</b> others <b>may not be hired by him. However, he may study by himself,</b> so <b>that he will not interrupt his study</b> entirely and forget everything he knows. <b>And he may build a small store for his livelihood,</b> so that he can earn enough money to cover his most basic needs, but not more.
<b>And Rav said:</b> What is the small store referred to here? This is referring to <b>selling water in the valley of Aravot,</b> where no water was to be found. One selling water there could earn a small income. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> <i>baraita</i> that one who is ostracized is permitted to study Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a leper</b> speaking <b>words of Torah?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children; the day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9–10). <b>Just as there,</b> the revelation at Sinai was <b>in reverence, fear, and trembling,</b> so too, here, in every generation, Torah must be studied in a similar fashion.
<b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: <i>Zavim</i>, lepers, and those who had intercourse with menstruating women</b> despite their severe ritual impurity <b>are permitted to read the Torah, Prophets, and Writings, and to study midrash, Talmud, <i>halakhot</i>, and <i>aggada</i>. But those who experienced a seminal emission are prohibited</b> from doing so. The reason for this distinction is that the cases of severe impurity are caused by ailment or other circumstances beyond one’s control; as a result, they do not necessarily preclude a sense of reverence and awe as one studies Torah. However, a seminal emission usually occurs due to frivolity and a lack of reverence and awe, and it is therefore inappropriate for one who experiences a seminal emission to engage in matters of Torah. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that a leper is permitted to study words of Torah.
§ The Gemara proceeds to discuss another issue: <b>A mourner is prohibited from laundering his clothes, as it is written: “And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray you, feign yourself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead”</b> (II Samuel 14:2).
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>laundering</b> with regard to <b>those who are ostracized or lepers? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Those who are ostracized or lepers are prohibited from cutting</b> their hair <b>or laundering</b> their clothes. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> here that they are prohibited from laundering their clothes.
The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner is obligated to rend</b> his clothes. This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to the sons of Aaron: “Neither rend</b> your clothes” (Leviticus 10:6), which proves <b>by inference that everyone</b> else, all other mourners, <b>are obligated</b> to rend their clothes.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rending</b> clothes with regard to <b>one who is ostracized</b>? No answer is found, and the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>rending? Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“His garments shall be rent”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), meaning <b>that they shall be torn.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case.
§ The Gemara moves to a different issue: <b>A mourner is obligated to overturn</b> his <b>bed,</b> so that he sleeps on the underside of it, <b>as bar Kappara taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that states:

Daf 15b

God stated: <b>I have placed the likeness of My image [<i>deyokan</i>] within</b> humans, as they were created in My image, <b>and owing to their sins I have overturned it,</b> as when this person died the Divine image in him was removed. Therefore, you must also <b>overturn your beds on account of this.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>one who was ostracized or a leper,</b> with regard to <b>overturning the bed?</b> The Gemara has no answer, and the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara proceeds to the next topic: <b>A mourner is prohibited from performing work, as it is written: “And I will turn your Festivals into mourning”</b> (Amos 8:10). The Gemara infers: <b>Just as a Festival</b> is a time when it is <b>prohibited to work, so too, a mourner is prohibited from performing work.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>one who was ostracized</b> with regard to <b>the performance of work? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> the Sages <b>said that the performance of work is prohibited</b> on a communal fast due to lack of rain, <b>they meant only</b> that work is prohibited <b>during the day</b> of the fast, <b>but during the night</b> of the fast <b>it is permitted. And you find a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a person</b> who was <b>ostracized and</b> with regard to <b>a mourner. What, is it not with regard to all</b> of the prohibitions stated that the <i>baraita</i> says that they apply to one who was ostracized as well, including the prohibition to engage in work? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this <b>is referring to the rest</b> of the prohibitions, but not to work.
The Gemara offers a different proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is ostracized may teach Torah</b> to others, <b>and</b> others <b>may teach him</b> Torah. Similarly, <b>he may be hired</b> for work by others, <b>and</b> others <b>may be hired by him.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from here</b> that it is permitted for one who is ostracized to engage in work. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper,</b> with regard to <b>the performance of work?</b> An answer is not found, and the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara discusses a different prohibition: <b>A mourner is prohibited from bathing, as it is written: “And do not anoint yourself with oil,</b> but be as a woman that had for a long time mourned for the dead” (II Samuel 14:2). <b>And bathing is included in</b> the category of <b>anointing,</b> as both activities have a similar goal, i.e., cleanliness.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to <b>bathing? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> the Sages <b>said that bathing is prohibited</b> on a communal fast, <b>they meant only</b> that a person may not wash <b>his entire body, but</b> washing <b>his face, his hands, and his feet is permitted. And you find a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a person who was ostracized and</b> with regard to <b>a mourner. What, is it not with regard to all</b> the prohibitions stated in the <i>baraita</i>, including the prohibition against bathing, that they apply also to one who is ostracized? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this <b>is referring to the rest</b> of the prohibitions, but not to bathing. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>bathing?</b> An answer is not found, and the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara moves to the next topic: <b>A mourner is prohibited from wearing shoes. Since the Merciful One says to</b> Ezekiel with regard to how his mourning rites should differ from the accepted custom: <b>“And put your shoes upon your feet”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17), which shows <b>by inference that everyone</b> else, i.e., all other mourners, <b>is prohibited</b> from wearing shoes.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to <b>wearing shoes? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>wearing shoes is prohibited</b> on a communal fast, <b>they meant only</b> that one may not wear shoes when he is walking about <b>in the city, but</b> if he set out to travel <b>on the road,</b> wearing shoes <b>is permitted. How so?</b> When <b>he sets out on the road, he may put on</b> his shoes. But as soon as <b>he enters the city</b> once again, <b>he must take off</b> his shoes and continue barefoot. <b>And you find a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a person</b> who was <b>ostracized and</b> with regard to <b>a mourner. What, is it not with regard to all</b> of the prohibitions stated in the <i>baraita</i>, including the prohibition against wearing shoes, that they apply also to one who was ostracized? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this <b>is referring to the rest</b> of the prohibitions, but not to wearing shoes.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>wearing shoes?</b> No answer is found, and the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara considers another issue: <b>A mourner is prohibited from engaging in sexual relations, as it is written: “And David comforted Bath-Sheba his wife, and went into her,</b> and lay with her” (II Samuel 12:24), after their son had died. This proves <b>by inference that initially,</b> during the period of mourning, sexual relations <b>were forbidden.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to <b>sexual relations? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All those years that the Jewish people were in the wilderness they were ostracized, and</b> yet <b>they engaged in sexual relations,</b> as there were children born to them during that period. It follows that it is permitted for one who is ostracized to engage in sexual relations. <b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps one who is ostracized by Heaven is different,</b> as <b>that is less serious</b> than being ostracized by an earthly court.
The Gemara asks in astonishment: Is it <b>less serious? But didn’t you,</b> Abaye, <b>say</b> elsewhere that a decree of ostracism imposed by Heaven is <b>more serious</b> than one issued by an earthly court? For this reason, Abaye rejected several proofs of Rav Yosef from the previously cited <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara answers: Abaye <b>is uncertain</b> whether a decree of ostracism imposed by Heaven is more or less serious than one imposed by an earthly court. Therefore, when <b>he goes in this</b> direction <b>he rejects</b> the argument, <b>and</b> when <b>he goes in that</b> direction <b>he rejects</b> the argument. Abaye asserts that since the issue is in doubt, no proof can be derived from ostracism issued by Heaven.
The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>sexual relations? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning a leper states: <b>“But he shall remain outside his tent</b> seven days” (Leviticus 14:8), from which it is derived <b>that</b> a leper <b>should be like one who is ostracized and like a mourner, and he is prohibited</b> from engaging <b>in sexual relations.</b> How is this derived? The <b>only</b> meaning of the term <b>“his tent”</b> is <b>his wife, as is stated</b> after the giving of the Torah: <b>“Go say to them, return again to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27). This statement rendered it permitted for the men to once again engage in sexual relations with their wives after they had previously been prohibited to do so in anticipation of the giving of the Torah, as expressed in the verse: “Come not near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that it is prohibited for a leper to engage in sexual relations.
The Gemara asks: If this is the case, then <b>can we</b> also <b>resolve</b> the question raised above with regard to <b>one who is ostracized,</b> by saying that it is prohibited for such a person to engage in sexual relations? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Pineḥas, said in the name of Rav Yosef: Is it taught</b> that a leper <b>is prohibited</b> from engaging in sexual relations like one who is ostracized? <b>It states</b> only that <b>he should be</b> treated <b>like one who is ostracized and like a mourner,</b> i.e., he should be like them <b>with regard to other things, and in addition he is prohibited</b> from engaging in <b>sexual relations.</b> Therefore, no proof can be derived from here with regard to one who is ostracized that he, too, is prohibited from engaging in sexual relations.
§ The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner may not send his offerings</b> to the Temple, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A peace</b>-offering <b>[<i>shelamim</i>]</b> is given this name also to teach us that one may sacrifice it only <b>at a time when he is whole [<i>shalem</i>]</b> and his mind is settled, <b>but not at a time when he is an acute mourner,</b> i.e., on the first day of his bereavement, when he is distressed.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to <b>sending his offerings</b> to the Temple? <b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All those years that the Jewish people were in the wilderness they were ostracized, and</b> yet <b>they sent their offerings. Abaye said to him: Perhaps one who is ostracized by Heaven is different, as that is less serious</b> than being ostracized by an earthly court.
The Gemara asks in astonishment: Is it <b>less serious? But certainly you,</b> Abaye, <b>said</b> elsewhere that being ostracized by Heaven is <b>more serious</b> than being ostracized by an earthly court. The Gemara offers a resolution: Abaye <b>is uncertain</b> whether being ostracized by Heaven is more or less serious than being ostracized by an earthly court, and therefore <b>he rejects</b> Rav Yosef’s arguments in both directions.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a leper sending his offerings</b> to the Temple? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a priest who became ritually impure: “And after he is purified, they shall count for him seven days” (Ezekiel 44:26). The verse should be understood as follows: <b>“And after he is purified”; after he has separated from</b> his <b>deceased</b> relative. <b>“They shall count for him seven days”; these are the seven days of his counting</b> before he may purify himself. <b>“And on the day that he goes into the Sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the Sanctuary, he shall sacrifice his sin</b>-offering, says the Lord God” (Ezekiel 44:27);

Daf 16a

<b>this is</b> the meal-offering of <b>a tenth of an ephah</b> of flour, which every priest would bring on the day he began serving in the Temple. But as long as he is ritually impure, whether because he had come into contact with a corpse or due to leprosy, he may not send his offerings to the Temple; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states: “And on the day that <b>he goes into</b> the Sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the Sanctuary <b>he shall sacrifice</b> his sin offering.” This teaches that <b>when he is fit to enter</b> the Sanctuary, <b>he is fit to sacrifice</b> an offering. But <b>when he is not fit to go into</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., when he is ritually impure, <b>he is not fit to sacrifice</b> an offering. This implies that a leper may not send his offerings to the Temple to be sacrificed on the altar, as he himself is not fit to enter the Temple.
§ Having discussed some of the restrictions applying to a person who was ostracized, the Gemara explains some of the basic principles relating to ostracism: <b>Rava said: From where do we</b> derive <b>that a court agent is sent to summon</b> the defendant <b>to</b> appear before the <b>court</b> before he is ostracized? <b>As it is written: “And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab”</b> (Numbers 16:12). <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we summon</b> the defendant, that he himself must appear before the <b>court? As it is written: “And Moses said to Korah: Be you and all your congregation</b> before the Lord, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow” (Numbers 16:16).
From where is it derived that the defendant must be told that he is being summoned to appear <b>before a great man? As it is written:</b> “And Moses said to Korah: Be you and all your congregation <b>before the Lord”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived that the summons must mention the names of both parties: <b>You and so-and-so,</b> the plaintiff? <b>As it is written: “You, and they, and Aaron”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived <b>that we set a date</b> for the court proceedings? <b>As it is written: “Tomorrow”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived that a second <b>date</b> must be set <b>after</b> the first <b>date,</b> if the defendant did not heed the first summons? <b>As it is written: “They did cry there, Pharaoh, king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed…</b>Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come” (Jeremiah 46:17). Although a time had been appointed and it had passed, it was not canceled entirely but pushed off to a later date.
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that if</b> the summoned person <b>behaves disrespectfully toward the agent of the court, and</b> the agent <b>comes</b> back <b>and reports</b> his conduct, that <b>this is not considered slander? As it is written: “Will you put out the eyes of these men?”</b> (Numbers 16:14). Dathan and Abiram spoke these words to the messenger that Moses had sent to them, and the messenger reported them back to Moses.
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we ostracize</b> one who does not obey a court summons? <b>As it is written: “Curse Meroz”</b> (Judges 5:23), who was ostracized for not coming to battle after having been summoned. From where is it derived that the ostracized person must be told <b>that it</b> was <b>the decision of a great man</b> to ostracized him? <b>As it is written:</b> “Curse Meroz, <b>said the messenger of the Lord”</b> (Judges 5:23). <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that,</b> if he fails to mend his ways, <b>we excommunicate</b> such a person more harshly, putting him under the most severe form of excommunication? <b>As it is written:</b> “Curse Meroz…<b>curse bitterly</b> its inhabitants” (Judges 5:23), implying that one curse is followed by another, i.e., lesser ostracism is followed by harsh excommunication.
From where is it derived <b>that</b> the curse applies to anyone who <b>eats or drinks with, or stands within, four cubits of</b> the ostracized person? <b>As it is written:</b> “Curse bitterly <b>its inhabitants”</b> (Judges 5:23), in reference to all those sitting together with Meroz. <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we detail his sin in public? As it is written:</b> “Curse bitterly its inhabitants, <b>because they did not come to the help of the Lord”</b> (Judges 5:23).
<b>And Ulla said: Barak ostracized Meroz with</b> the blowing of <b>four hundred <i>shofarot</i></b> due to his failure to come. As for the identification of Meroz, <b>some say</b> that <b>he was a great man</b> and that he was ostracized because he did not join in the war effort. <b>And others say</b> that the reference is to <b>a star</b> and not a human being, and that it did not aid the Jewish people in their battle, <b>as it is stated: “The stars fought from heaven;</b> in their courses they fought against Sisera,” (Judges 5:20). This star, which did not help the Jewish people, was cursed.
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the court <b>may declare the property of</b> one who does not obey its orders <b>as ownerless? As it is written: “And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the Elders, all his substance shall be forfeited [<i>yaḥoram</i>] and himself separated from the congregation of the exiles”</b> (Ezra 10:8). “Shall be forfeited” is referring to excommunication.
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we may contend with</b> such a person, <b>and curse</b> him, <b>and beat</b> him, <b>and pull out</b> his <b>hair, and make</b> him <b>take an oath</b> in order to prevent him from sinning? <b>As it is written: “And I contended with them, and cursed them, and beat some of them, and pulled out their hair, and made them take oath</b> by God” (Nehemiah 13:25).
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we may shackle</b> his hands and feet, <b>chain</b> him, <b>and apply pressure? As it is written: “Whether it be for death, or for banishment [<i>lishroshi</i>], or for confiscation of goods, or for imprisonment”</b> (Ezra 7:26). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b>“<i>lishroshi</i>,”</b> translated here as banishment? <b>Adda Mari said</b> that <b>Neḥemya bar Baruch said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is <b>pressure.</b> Since this expression is also unclear, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>pressure? Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav</b> that this term refers to the following series of actions: <b>They ostracize</b> him <b>immediately, and</b> then once <b>again after thirty</b> days, and if he still does not repent, <b>they excommunicate him after sixty</b> days.
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said to him: Rav Ḥisda said as follows:</b> Before excommunicating a person, the court <b>warns him</b> three times, on <b>Monday, Thursday, and</b> the following <b>Monday.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>This applies</b> in a case where one ignores <b>a monetary judgment</b> that was issued against him. He is warned three times that he must repay his debt. <b>But</b> in a case where one <b>behaves disrespectfully</b> toward a Torah scholar, he is <b>immediately</b> ostracized.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>a certain butcher behaved disrespectfully toward Rav Tuvi bar Mattana. Abaye and Rava were appointed</b> to the case <b>and ostracized him. In the end</b> the butcher <b>went and appeased his disputant,</b> Rav Tuvi. <b>Abaye said: What should we do</b> in this case? Shall <b>he be released</b> from his decree of ostracism? <b>His</b> decree of <b>ostracism has not</b> yet <b>been in effect for</b> the usual <b>thirty days.</b> On the other hand, <b>shall he not be released</b> from ostracism? But <b>the Sages wish to enter</b> his shop and purchase meat, and they are presently unable to do so. What, then, is the most appropriate course of action?
<b>He said to Rav Idi bar Avin:</b> Have <b>you heard anything with regard to such</b> a case? Rav Idi bar Avin <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Rav Taḥlifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said as follows:</b> A <i>shofar</i> <b>blast</b> at the time of the ostracism <b>makes</b> it <b>binding, and</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>blast releases</b> it. In other words, the <i>shofar</i> should be sounded now, as it had been sounded when the decree of ostracism was pronounced, and it should be canceled, although thirty days have not passed. Abaye <b>said to him: This applies</b> in a case where one ignores <b>a monetary judgment</b> that was issued against him; <b>but</b> in a case where one <b>behaves disrespectfully,</b> there must be no release <b>until the</b> decree of <b>ostracism has been in effect for thirty days.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently, Abaye maintains</b> that if <b>three</b> people <b>ostracized</b> one, <b>three others may not come and release him.</b> This is derived from the fact that Abaye was concerned about releasing the butcher from ostracism and did not delegate the task to someone else.
<b>As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>three</b> people <b>ostracized</b> someone, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>three others coming and releasing him</b> from his decree of ostracism? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was ostracized by the teacher</b> of Torah for having acted disrespectfully toward him <b>is</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the student,</b> and the latter must keep his distance from him. However, <b>one who was ostracized by the student is not</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the teacher.</b>
<b>One who was ostracized by his</b> own <b>city is</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to another city.</b> However, <b>one who was ostracized by another city is not</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to his</b> own <b>city. One who was ostracized by the <i>Nasi</i></b> of the Sanhedrin <b>is</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to all the Jewish people;</b> but <b>one who was ostracized by all the Jewish people is not</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the <i>Nasi</i></b> of the Sanhedrin. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If <b>one of the students</b> sitting as a judge on the court <b>had ostracized</b> someone, <b>and he died</b> before releasing him from the decree of ostracism, <b>his portion</b> of the decree of ostracism <b>is not nullified.</b>
The Gemara says: <b>Learn three</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from this</b> <i>baraita</i>. <b>Learn from this</b> that in the case of <b>a student who ostracizes</b> someone <b>due to</b> an insult to <b>his dignity</b> and not because the ostracized person was guilty of some transgression, <b>his</b> decree of <b>ostracism is valid.</b> Were the case one where one was ostracized due to sin, everyone is required to respect the decree of ostracism, even the student’s teacher. <b>And learn from this</b> that <b>each and every one</b> who participated in the decree of ostracism <b>nullifies his</b> own <b>portion</b> of the decree of ostracism, as the <i>baraita</i> speaks of: His portion. <b>And learn from this</b> that if <b>three</b> people <b>ostracized</b> another person, <b>three other</b> people <b>may not come and nullify</b> the decree of ostracism. Were this not the case, it wouldn’t matter if a certain person’s portion was not nullified. His portion could be nullified by someone else.
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i> is</b> that if <b>three</b> people <b>ostracize</b> another person, <b>three others may come and nullify</b> the decree of ostracism. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If <b>one of the students had ostracized</b> another person, <b>and he died</b> before releasing him from the decree of ostracism, <b>his portion is not nullified? What, is it not</b> that <b>it is not nullified at all,</b> i.e., it cannot be nullified by another person? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this means that the decree of ostracism remains in force <b>until three other people come and nullify</b> it.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ostracism does not</b> apply <b>for less than</b> a period of <b>thirty days, and admonition,</b> which is less severe than ostracism, <b>does not</b> apply <b>for less than</b> a period of <b>seven days. And although there is no proof with regard to the matter,</b> i.e., the standard duration of admonition, there is <b>an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed for seven days?”</b> (Numbers 12:14). This implies that admonition lasts for seven days.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Our</b> decree of <b>ostracism</b> in Babylonia has the power <b>of their admonition</b> in Eretz Yisrael. Since the authorities in Eretz Yisrael are ordained with the title Rabbi, their admonition carries more weight than a decree of ostracism issued in Babylonia. The Gemara asks: Is <b>their admonition</b> in Eretz Yisrael only <b>seven</b> days <b>and no more? But isn’t</b> it related that <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and bar Kappara were sitting and studying,</b> and they posed <b>a difficulty with</b> a certain <b><i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Shimon said to bar Kappara: This issue requires</b> my father, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, to explain it. <b>Bar Kappara said to Rabbi Shimon,</b> somewhat mockingly: <b>And what can</b> your father, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>say about this</b> issue? What can he add and teach us about it?
Rabbi Shimon <b>went and told his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, what bar Kappara had said, and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>became angry</b> with him. When <b>bar Kappara came</b> at some later point <b>to visit,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Bar Kappara, I do not know you at all.</b> Bar Kappara <b>understood that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>had taken</b> his <b>statement to heart,</b> i.e., was insulted. He subsequently <b>behaved</b> as if he had been <b>admonished,</b> as a self-imposed punishment, <b>for thirty days.</b>
<b>Once again, on another occasion, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>decreed that students not be taught in the marketplace</b> but only in a study hall. <b>What</b> verse did he <b>expound</b> to serve as the basis for this decree? The verse states: <b>“Your rounded thighs are like jewels,</b> the work of the hands of an artist” (Song of Songs 7:2). <b>Just</b> as <b>a thigh is</b> ordinarily <b>hidden</b> and kept covered with clothes,

Daf 16b

<b>so too, the words of Torah,</b> which are “the work of the hands of an artist,” i.e., God, must remain <b>hidden</b> in the study hall.
Despite Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s decree, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya went out and taught his two nephews, Rav and Rabba bar bar Ḥana, in the marketplace. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard</b> what he had done and <b>became angry</b> with him. When <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya came</b> at some later date <b>to visit him,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi mockingly <b>said to him: Iyya, who is calling you outside?</b> By asking this question Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was intimating that Rabbi Ḥiyya should leave his house. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>understood that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>had taken the matter to heart</b> and was insulted, and so <b>he conducted</b> himself as if he had been <b>admonished,</b> as a self-imposed punishment, <b>for thirty days.</b>
<b>On the thirtieth day,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>sent him</b> a message, saying: <b>Come</b> and visit me. However, <b>he later</b> reversed his opinion and <b>sent him</b> another message, telling him <b>not to come.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset what did he hold, and ultimately what did he hold? Initially,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>held that</b> the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day, and since the thirtieth day already begun, Rabbi Ḥiyya’s time of admonition had ended. <b>But ultimately he held</b> that with regard to this issue <b>we do not say</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day.
<b>In the end</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>came</b> on that same day. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>asked him: Why have you come?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>responded: Because</b> you, <b>Master, sent</b> me a message that <b>I should come.</b> He said to him: <b>But I sent</b> you a second message <b>that you should not come. He responded: This</b> messenger that you sent, i.e., the first one, <b>I saw</b> him and I did as he said, <b>but that</b> messenger, i.e., the second one, <b>I did not see.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>“When a man’s ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him”</b> (Proverbs 16:7), as it was clear to him that Rabbi Ḥiyya had merited divine assistance.
§ Concerning the issue with which the entire incident had begun, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi asked Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>What is the reason that</b> you, <b>the Master, acted as</b> you did, ignoring my instructions not to teach Torah in the marketplace? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: As it is written: “Wisdom cries aloud in the streets”</b> (Proverbs 1:20), which implies that Torah should be publicized in the streets. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: If you read</b> this verse once, <b>you</b> certainly <b>did not read</b> it <b>a second time</b> in greater depth; <b>and if you read</b> it <b>a second time, you</b> certainly <b>did not read</b> it <b>a third time;</b> and <b>if you read</b> it <b>a third time,</b> then <b>it was not</b> adequately <b>explained to you,</b> as it is clear that you do not understand it properly.
The words: <b>“Wisdom cries aloud in the streets,”</b> should be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>everyone who occupies himself with Torah</b> study <b>inside</b> the privacy of his home, <b>his Torah</b> knowledge <b>will proclaim his</b> greatness <b>outside,</b> as it will be revealed to the masses and they will see his greatness.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “From the beginning I have not spoken in secret”</b> (Isaiah 48:16), implying that the Torah should be taught and proclaimed in public? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is referring to <b>the days of the <i>kalla</i>,</b> the gathering for Torah study held during Elul and Adar, when many people come to listen to Torah discourses. During this time, it is not only permitted but even recommended to teach Torah to the masses. In this way, the verse can be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did Rabbi Ḥiyya do with this</b> verse: <b>“Your rounded thighs are like jewels”?</b> How did he understand it? This verse implies that the Torah must be kept hidden in the study hall and not publicized in the marketplace. The Gemara explains: <b>He interprets it</b> not as a reference to Torah, but as referring <b>to</b> acts of <b>charity and loving-kindness,</b> which should certainly be performed in private.
This incident demonstrates <b>that, apparently, admonition of those</b> who live in Eretz Yisrael lasts for <b>thirty days</b> and not for seven days. The Gemara answers that this is not a conclusive proof, since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was the <i>Nasi</i>. <b>The admonition of the <i>Nasi</i></b> of the Sanhedrin <b>is different</b> i.e., more severe, than the admonition of anyone else.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> long <b>is our admonition</b> in Babylonia? The Gemara answers: It is only <b>one day, as in</b> the case involving <b>Shmuel and</b> the Exilarch <b>Mar Ukva. When they would sit and study <i>halakha</i>, Mar Ukva would sit before Shmuel at a distance of four cubits</b> as a sign of respect. Mar Ukva would conduct himself as though Shmuel were his teacher because Shmuel was much greater than him in Torah matters. <b>And when they would sit</b> together <b>in judgment, Shmuel would sit before Mar Ukva at a distance of four cubits</b> because Mar Ukva was the Exilarch and the chief judge. <b>But they would lower a place for Mar Ukva in the matting</b> upon which he sat, <b>and he would sit on it so that he could hear</b> Shmuel’s <b>words</b> of Torah even when they were engaged in judgment.
<b>Every day, Mar Ukva would accompany Shmuel to his lodgings,</b> in the manner that a student would show honor toward his teacher. <b>One day,</b> Mar Ukva <b>was</b> so heavily <b>preoccupied with a case</b> that had been brought before him for judgment that he did not realize that <b>Shmuel was walking behind him</b> to show him respect due to his position as the Exilarch. <b>When</b> Mar Ukva <b>reached his home,</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: Is it not enough for you</b> that I accompanied you until here? <b>Release me, Master, from my obligation,</b> so that I may return home. Mar Ukva <b>understood that</b> Shmuel <b>had taken the matter to heart</b> and was insulted. Therefore, <b>he conducted</b> himself as if he had been <b>admonished, for one day</b> as a self-imposed punishment.
It was related that <b>a certain woman was sitting alongside a path</b> with <b>her leg extended</b> while <b>she was sifting barley. A Torah scholar passed</b> by her on this path, <b>but she did not yield to him</b> and move her leg to make room for him. <b>He said: How rude is that woman!</b> The woman <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> to ask if this statement should be deemed as excommunication. <b>He said to her: Did you hear</b> the word <b>excommunication</b> explicitly issue <b>from his mouth? She said to him: No. He said to her:</b> If this is the case, then <b>go and observe an admonition for one day,</b> as it appears that the Torah scholar sought only to admonish you.
§ <b>Zutra bar Toviyya was</b> once <b>reading the portion</b> of the Bible <b>before Rav Yehuda. When he reached the verse: “Now these are the last words of David”</b> (II Samuel 23:1), Zutra bar Toviyya <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: If it is written that these are the <b>last</b> of David’s words, <b>by inference there are first</b> words as well. If this is the case, <b>what are these first</b> words of David? Prior to this, it mentions only David’s song, but not his words.
Rav Yehuda <b>remained silent and said nothing to him.</b> Zutra bar Toviyya thought that Rav Yehuda did not hear what he had said, so he <b>then said to him</b> a second time: If it is written that these are the <b>last</b> of David’s words, <b>by inference there are first</b> words as well. If this is the case, <b>what are these first</b> words of David? <b>He said to him: What do you think?</b> Do you think that anyone <b>who does not know the meaning of this verse is not a great man?</b> Why are you stressing the fact that I do not know the answer to your question? Zutra bar Toviyya <b>understood that</b> Rav Yehuda <b>had taken the matter to heart</b> and was insulted. Therefore, <b>he conducted</b> himself as if had been <b>admonished for one day</b> as a self-imposed punishment.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> now <b>that we have come</b> to discuss this issue, since the verse mentions David’s <b>last</b> words, <b>by inference there are</b> also <b>first</b> words. <b>What</b> then <b>are these first</b> words of David? The Gemara answers: The first words are: <b>“And David spoke to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord delivered him out of the hand of his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul”</b> (II Samuel 22:1), as that song is also referred to as words.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: David, do you recite a song over the fall of Saul? Had you been Saul and he were David,</b> then <b>I would have destroyed many Davids before him.</b> Although I decreed that Saul’s kingdom would not continue, as an individual he was far greater and more important than you.
The response to this admonishment <b>is</b> found in the verse, <b>as it is written: “Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite”</b> (Psalms 7:1). <b>Is Cush his name? Saul is his name. Rather,</b> this is a designation that indicates: <b>Just as a Cushite,</b> a native of the ancient kingdom of Cush in eastern Africa, <b>is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Saul was distinguished by his actions,</b> as he was absolutely righteous and performed many good deeds. Therefore, David uses the word <i>shiggaion</i> as an allusion to the error [<i>shegia</i>] that he had made when he sang a song of praise over Saul’s downfall.
The Gemara notes: <b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: “And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses <b>due to the Cushite woman whom he had married,</b> for he had taken a Cushite woman” (Numbers 12:1). <b>But is her name Cushite? Zipporah is her name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Zipporah was distinguished by her actions.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: <b>“Now when Ebed-Melech the Cushite heard”</b> (Jeremiah 38:7). <b>Is his name Cushite? Zedekiah is his name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Zedekiah was distinguished by his</b> righteous <b>actions.</b>
<b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: <b>“Are you not as much Mine as the children of the Cushites, O children of Israel?”</b> (Amos 9:7). <b>Is their name Cushite? Israel is their name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, the Jewish people are distinguished by their actions,</b> and they are different <b>from all the</b> other <b>nations.</b>
§ Having mentioned the last words of David, the Gemara continues to explain other expressions in that passage. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The saying of David, son of Yishai, and the saying of the man who was raised up on high [<i>al</i> ]”</b> (II Samuel 23:1)? It means as follows: <b>The saying of David, son of Yishai, who raised the yoke of [<i>ulla</i>] repentance,</b> as through his actions he taught the power of repentance. The word <i>al</i>, on high, and the word <i>ulla</i> are comprised of the same consonants in Hebrew.
The passage continues: <b>“The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be righteous, ruling in the fear of God”</b> (II Samuel 23:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this verse <b>saying?</b> What does it mean? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: This is what</b> the verse <b>is saying: The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me:</b> Although <b>I rule over man, who rules over Me?</b> It is <b>a righteous person.</b> How is it possible to say that a righteous person rules over God, as it were? <b>As I,</b> God, <b>issue a decree</b> and the righteous person <b>nullifies it.</b>
Similarly, the verse states there: <b>“These are the names of David’s warriors; Josheb-Basshebeth</b> a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite; he raised his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time” (II Samuel 23:8). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this verse <b>saying? Rabbi Abbahu said: This is what</b> the verse <b>is saying: These are the names of the mighty actions of David.</b> These expressions should not be read as names of people but instead as descriptions of David’s good deeds.
<b>Josheb-Basshebeth [<i>yoshev bashevet</i>]</b> indicates that <b>when</b> David <b>would sit [<i>yoshev</i>] in the study hall, he would not sit upon pillows and cushions,</b> as an important person ordinarily would. <b>Rather,</b> he would sit <b>on the ground</b> like one of the students. <b>For as long as</b> David’s <b>teacher, Ira the Jairite, was alive,</b> Ira <b>would teach the Sages</b> while sitting <b>on pillows and cushions. When</b> Ira <b>passed away, David would teach the Sages, and he</b> did this while <b>sitting on the ground. They said to him: Master,</b> you <b>should sit upon pillows and blankets. He did not accept</b> their suggestions, since in his humility he did not wish to appear as the teacher of the Jewish people.
In this verse, David is described as <b>“a Tahchemonite [<i>taḥkemoni</i>].” Rav said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Since you have humbled yourself, be you</b> now <b>like Me [<i>tehe kamoni</i>].</b> How so? <b>As I issue a decree, and you,</b> owing to your righteousness, <b>may nullify it.</b>
David is also described here as <b>“chief of the captains [<i>rosh hashalishim</i>]”</b> because God said to him: <b>You will be the head [<i>rosh</i>] of the three [<i>sheloshet</i>] Patriarchs. “The same was Adino the Eznite”;</b> this alludes to the fact that <b>when</b> David <b>would sit and occupy himself with Torah, he would make himself soft [<i>me’aden</i>] as a worm, and when he would go out to war, he would make himself hard</b> and strong <b>as a tree [<i>etz</i>].</b>
The expression: <b>“Against eight hundred people, which he slew at one time,”</b> means <b>that he would throw an arrow</b> in the air <b>and</b> with it <b>kill eight hundred people at one time. And</b> David <b>would sigh over the two hundred</b> who were missing from fulfillment of the Torah’s promise, <b>as it is written: “How should one man chase a thousand”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:30).
<b>A Divine Voice issued forth and said</b> by way of explanation as to why the promise was not entirely fulfilled: “Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, <b>save only the matter of Uriah the Hittite”</b> (I Kings 15:5). Had David not committed this sin, then all of the promises mentioned in the Torah would have been fulfilled in their entirety through him.
The Gemara returns to the <i>halakhot</i> of ostracism and mentions that <b>Rabbi Tanḥum, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, of the village of Akko, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Simlai said, and</b> some <b>say</b> that this tradition was transmitted in the following manner: <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said, and</b> others <b>say</b> that <b>Rav Huna himself</b> made this statement without the chain of transmission:

Daf 17a

If <b>a student ostracized</b> someone else <b>due to</b> an insult to <b>his dignity,</b> and not because the ostracized person was guilty of some transgression, <b>his</b> decree of <b>ostracism is valid, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is ostracized by the teacher is</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the student.</b> However, <b>one who is ostracized by the student is not</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the teacher.</b> The Gemara attempts to draw an inference from a careful reading of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>He is not</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the teacher,</b> which implies <b>that he is</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to everyone</b> else.
The Gemara clarifies the case: <b>For what</b> reason was he ostracized? <b>If</b> it was <b>for a matter relating to Heaven,</b> i.e., because he sinned, then why, if he was ostracized by the student, should he not be considered ostracized with regard to the teacher? Doesn’t the verse state: <b>“There is no wisdom or understanding or counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30)? This means that when a sin is committed and God’s name is desecrated, all other considerations are ignored, even the eminence and knowledge of the teacher, and therefore he too must treat the offender as ostracized. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the Gemara is referring to a case where the student ostracized the other person due to an insult <b>to his</b> own <b>dignity?</b> Therefore, it is apparent that his decree of ostracism is valid and binding upon all, with the exception of his teacher.
<b>Rav Yosef said: A Torah scholar may execute judgment for himself with regard to a matter about which he is certain,</b> and he is not required to first go to court and have the case decided for him. The same applies when another person behaves in a disrespectful manner toward him; he is permitted to go ahead on his own and ostracize him.
<b>There was a certain Torah scholar who gained a bad reputation</b> due to rumors about his conduct. <b>Rav Yehuda said: What should be done? To excommunicate him</b> is not an option. <b>The Sages need him,</b> as he is a great Torah authority. <b>Not to excommunicate him</b> is also not an option, as then <b>the name of Heaven would be desecrated.</b>
Rav Yehuda <b>said to Rabba bar bar Ḥana:</b> Have <b>you heard anything with regard to this</b> issue? <b>He said to him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek Torah at his mouth; for he is a messenger [<i>malakh</i>] of the Lord of hosts”</b> (Malachi 2:7)? This verse teaches: <b>If the teacher is similar to an angel [<i>malakh</i>] of the Lord,</b> then <b>seek Torah from his mouth,</b> but if he is <b>not</b> pure and upright, then <b>do not seek Torah from his mouth;</b> even if he is knowledgeable about Torah, do not learn from him.
Based on this statement, <b>Rav Yehuda ostracized</b> that Torah scholar. <b>In the end,</b> after some time had passed, <b>Rav Yehuda took ill</b> and was on the verge of death. <b>The Sages came to inquire about his well-being, and</b> the ostracized scholar <b>came</b> along <b>with them as well. When Rav Yehuda saw him,</b> that scholar, <b>he laughed.</b>
The ostracized scholar <b>said to him: Was it not enough that you excommunicated that man,</b> i.e., me, <b>but</b> now <b>you even laugh at me?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: I was not laughing at you; rather, I am happy as I go to that</b> other <b>world that I did not flatter even</b> a great <b>man like you,</b> but instead I treated you fairly in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rav Yehuda died.</b> The ostracized scholar <b>came to the study hall and said</b> to the Sages: <b>Release me</b> from the decree of ostracism. <b>The Sages said to him: There is no man here as eminent as Rav Yehuda who can release you</b> from the ostracism. <b>Rather, go to Rabbi Yehuda Nesia</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>as</b> only <b>he can release you.</b> That scholar <b>came before</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia. Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>said to Rabbi Ami: Go and examine his case. If it is necessary to release him</b> from his decree of ostracism, <b>release him</b> on my behalf.
<b>Rabbi Ami examined his case</b> and <b>thought</b> at first <b>to release him</b> from his ostracism. But <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani rose up on his feet and said: If the maidservant in the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi once ostracized another person, and <b>the Sages did not relate frivolously to her</b> decree of <b>ostracism</b> and did not revoke it until <b>three years</b> had passed, <b>all the more so, with regard to</b> a decree of ostracism placed by <b>Yehuda our colleague,</b> we must take it seriously and not release this scholar.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: What</b> caused <b>this Elder,</b> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, <b>to come before us in the study hall</b> today <b>though for many years he did not come,</b> and now he comes precisely during this discussion. <b>Learn from this</b> that <b>it is not necessary to release him</b> from his decree of ostracism, as this combination of events is certainly not a coincidence. Rather, it should be viewed as an instructive sign from Heaven. Consequently, Rabbi Ami <b>did not release him</b> from the ostracism, and the ostracized scholar <b>left in tears.</b>
<b>A wasp came and stung</b> the ostracized scholar <b>on his penis and he died.</b> Because he was a great Torah scholar, <b>they took him into the caves in which the pious</b> are interred in order to bury him there, <b>but</b> the caves <b>did not accept him.</b> A snake stood at the entrance of the caves and did not let them pass. <b>They</b> then <b>took him into the caves of the judges, and they accepted him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that he was accepted there? The Gemara answers: Even though he sinned, <b>he</b> still <b>acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ilai, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ilai says: If a person sees that his</b> evil <b>inclination is gaining control over him</b> and he cannot overcome it, then <b>he should go to a place where he is not known. He should wear black, and he should wrap his</b> head <b>in black,</b> as if he were a mourner. Perhaps these changes will influence him, so that he not sin. Even if these actions do not help, <b>he should</b> at least <b>do as his heart desires</b> in private <b>and not desecrate the name of Heaven in public.</b> Although this person had sinned, he did so in private and in a manner that did not publicly desecrate God’s name, and therefore it was fitting that he be given an honorable burial.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the story mentioned by Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani involving <b>the maidservant in the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? It was related <b>that the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saw a certain man who was striking his adult son. She said: Let that man be excommunicated, due to</b> the fact that <b>he has transgressed</b> the injunction: <b>“You shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“You shall not place a stumbling block before the blind,”</b> and <b>the verse speaks</b> here <b>of one who strikes his adult son,</b> as the son is likely to become angry and strike his father back, thereby transgressing the severe prohibition against hitting one’s parent.
Similarly, it was related that <b>Reish Lakish was guarding an orchard</b> for payment when <b>a certain man came and ate</b> some <b>figs</b> that were growing there. Reish Lakish <b>raised his voice</b> and yelled at him, <b>but</b> this man <b>paid no attention to him</b> and kept eating. Reish Lakish <b>said: Let that man be</b> in a state of <b>excommunication.</b> The man eating the figs <b>said to him: On the contrary, let that man,</b> i.e., Reish Lakish, <b>be</b> in a state of <b>excommunication,</b> for even <b>if I have become liable to you for payment,</b> as I have eaten of the figs without permission, <b>have I become liable to you for excommunication?</b> With that statement, the man left.
Reish Lakish <b>went to the study hall</b> to inquire about the <i>halakha</i> with regard to this man. The other Sages <b>said to him: His</b> decree of <b>ostracism is</b> valid, but <b>your</b> decree of <b>ostracism is not.</b> In other words, that man was correct and Reish Lakish should not have ostracized him in response to his actions.
Reish Lakish then asked: If so, <b>what is the remedy</b> for this decree of ostracism? The Sages answered him: <b>Go to him so that he may release you</b> from it. Reish Lakish replied: <b>I do not know him. They said to him: Go</b> then <b>to the <i>Nasi</i>, so that he may release you</b> from the ban, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>was ostracized, but he does not know who ostracized him, he should go to the <i>Nasi</i>, and</b> the <i>Nasi</i> <b>may release</b> him from <b>his</b> decree of <b>ostracism.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>in Usha it was enacted:</b> If <b>the president of the court sinned, he is not ostracized.</b> Although this would be the appropriate punishment, he is not ostracized, so as not to cause a desecration of God’s name. <b>Rather,</b> they <b>say to him</b> the words of the verse: <b>“Keep your honor and stay at home”</b> (II Kings 14:10). That is to say, to preserve your dignity, it would be best if you were to stay at home, resign your position, and refrain from further public appearances. If <b>he sins again, he is ostracized, due to the desecration of God’s name</b> that would ensue were people to think that he was spared his rightful punishment due to his high position.
The Gemara comments: This opinion <b>disagrees with</b> that of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> for <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> If <b>a Torah scholar sins, he is not ostracized</b> at all <b>in public, as it is stated: “Therefore, shall you fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night”</b> (Hosea 4:5). This is explained to mean: If a prophet or any other important person sins, his offense <b>should be concealed like the night</b> and not punished in public.
With regard to this issue, it was related that <b>when a Torah scholar would become liable</b> to be punished with <b>excommunication before Mar Zutra the Pious,</b> Mar Zutra <b>would first excommunicate himself</b> as a mark of respect for the Torah scholar, <b>and afterward he would ostracize</b> the Torah scholar. This self-imposed excommunication was meant only as a show of honor to the other Torah scholar, and therefore <b>when</b> Mar Zutra <b>would enter his house</b> of lodging, <b>he would release his</b> own excommunication, <b>and afterward he would release</b> the other’s excommunication.
<b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: A Torah scholar may ostracize himself, and he may</b> similarly <b>release himself</b> from self-imposed ostracism. <b>Rav Pappa said: I have</b> good <b>coming to me,</b> for I am praiseworthy, <b>as I have never ostracized a Torah scholar.</b> The Gemara asks about this: <b>If so, when a Torah scholar was liable to be ostracized, what would he do?</b> The Gemara answers: He did <b>as they do in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, where <b>they appoint</b> a court <b>to give a Torah scholar lashes, but they do not appoint</b> a court <b>to ostracize him.</b> That is to say, lashes were preferred over ostracism.
The Gemara proceeds with a discussion that explains the severity of the punishment of excommunication: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b>excommunication [<i>shamta</i>]? Rav said:</b> This word is a contraction of the expression <b>there is death [<i>sham mita</i>],</b> alluding to the deathly aspect of excommunication. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> <i>Shamta</i> means that <b>he will be a desolation [<i>shemama yiheyeh</i>], and it is effective upon him like fat</b> smeared <b>on an oven.</b> Just as some of the fat will always remain absorbed in the walls of the oven, so too some aspect of the curse contained in the excommunication will continue to adhere to him even after the excommunication has been nullified.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this opinion <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> for <b>Reish Lakish said: Just as</b> ostracism <b>enters the two hundred and forty-eight organs</b> of one’s body when it is first pronounced, <b>so too when it leaves, it leaves from</b> his <b>two hundred and forty-eight organs.</b>
The following allusion is offered in support of the opinion of Reish Lakish: <b>When it enters,</b> it enters all the organs, <b>as it is written: “And the city shall be a curse [<i>ḥerem</i>]”</b> (Joshua 6:17), <b>and the numerical value [<i>gimatriyya</i>]</b> of the word <b><i>ḥerem</i>,</b> a concept similar to ostracism, <b>is two hundred and forty-eight.</b> Therefore, the verse alludes to the fact that a decree of ostracism penetrates one’s two hundred and forty-eight organs. <b>When it leaves,</b> it leaves all the organs, <b>as it is written: “In wrath remember mercy [<i>raḥem</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2), <b>and the numerical value</b> of the word <b><i>raḥem</i> is also</b> two hundred and forty-eight, thereby teaching that when the decree of ostracism is revoked, it disappears entirely.
The Gemara continues discussing the power of a ban. <b>Rav Yosef said: Cast an excommunication on the tail of a dog and it,</b> the excommunication, <b>will do its work</b> and harm the dog. It was related that there was <b>a certain dog that would eat the shoes of the Sages, and they did not know who it was</b> causing this damage. They thought that it was a person, <b>and</b> so <b>they excommunicated</b> whoever was doing it. Soon thereafter, the dog’s <b>tail caught fire and got burnt.</b> This shows that excommunication can have a harmful effect even on a dog.
It was further related that there was <b>a violent person who</b> caused <b>suffering to a certain Torah scholar.</b> This Torah scholar <b>came before Rav Yosef</b> to ask what he should do. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Go and ostracize him.</b> This Torah scholar <b>said to him: I am afraid of him,</b> that he will harass me even more.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Take</b> out, i.e., publish <b>a written</b> ostracism <b>against him.</b> The Torah scholar said to him: <b>All the more so I am fearful of him,</b> for if I publicize the matter he will certainly come after me. Rav Yosef <b>said to him</b> to do as follows: <b>Take</b> the written ostracism <b>and place it in a jug,</b>

Daf 17b

<b>and set it down in a cemetery,</b> where nobody is found, <b>and sound a thousand,</b> i.e., many, <b><i>shofar</i> blasts over the course of forty days.</b> That man <b>went and did this. The jug burst and the violent man died.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason that <b><i>shofarot</i></b> are sounded when a decree of ostracism is pronounced? The <i>shofarot</i> allude to the fact <b>that they extract punishment [<i>shenifra’in</i>] from</b> the excommunicated person.
The Gemara asks further: <b>What</b> is the reason that <b>broken</b> blasts are sounded on the <i>shofar</i> when the excommunication is pronounced? <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said: It breaks tall buildings,</b> i.e., a decree of ostracism can harm and break even the high and mighty, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Wherever</b> it says that <b>the Sages set their eyes</b> in anger upon a particular person, it causes <b>either death or poverty.</b>
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And the nazirite</b> whose term of naziriteship ended on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>and the leper</b> who needs to purify himself on the intermediate days and must shave his entire body in order to leave <b>his</b> state of ritual <b>impurity</b> and regain <b>his</b> ritual <b>purity,</b> these people are permitted to cut their hair on the intermediate days of the Festival because they were not able to do so on the eve of the Festival. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a question before Rabbi Zeira:</b> Is this allowance limited to the case <b>where they did not have the time</b> to cut their hair before the Festival, as it was prohibited for them to do so beforehand? <b>Or perhaps</b> they may cut their hair <b>even</b> in a case <b>where they had the time</b> to do so beforehand.
<b>He said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all those</b> about whom <b>the</b> Sages <b>said</b> that they <b>are permitted to cut their hair on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival,</b> they may do so only <b>if they did not have time</b> to cut their hair before the Festival. <b>But</b> if <b>they had time</b> before the Festival began, then <b>they are prohibited</b> from doing so.
However, <b>a nazirite and a leper, even if they had the time</b> to do so before the Festival, <b>they are permitted</b> to cut their hair. Why are they granted this special allowance? So <b>that they will not delay</b> bringing <b>their offerings.</b> Both a nazirite and a leper must cut their hair before sacrificing their offerings in completion of their purification process. Therefore, if they are not permitted to cut their hair, they will not be able to sacrifice their offerings at the proper time.
In was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A priest and a mourner are permitted to cut their hair</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> when the <b>mourner</b> is permitted to do so? <b>If we say that the eighth</b> day of <b>his</b> mourning <b>occurred on the eve of the Festival,</b> then <b>he should have cut his hair on the eve of the Festival,</b> as the more stringent restrictions of his mourning no longer applied. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that we are dealing with a case <b>where the eighth</b> day of <b>his</b> mourning <b>occurred on a Shabbat that was the eve of the Festival,</b> and so he could not have cut his hair on the Festival eve.
But if this is the case, <b>he should have cut his hair on Friday, for Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Ravina bar Sheila said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul.</b> If the deceased was buried seven days before the Festival, then not only has the mourner completed the seven-day mourning period, but he is even regarded as having begun the thirty-day mourning period, and so the Festival cancels this thirty-day period of mourning. <b>And the Rabbis concede</b> to the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul when the eighth</b> day of <b>his</b> mourning <b>occurs on a Shabbat that is the eve of the Festival,</b> and they maintain <b>that he is permitted to cut his hair on Friday.</b> Since he is unavoidably prevented from cutting his hair on the eighth day, the Rabbis allowed him to cut it already on the seventh day.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>necessary</b> in the case <b>where the seventh</b> day of <b>his</b> mourning <b>occurs on a Shabbat that is the eve of the Festival.</b> In that case, he certainly cannot cut his hair on Friday because it is only the sixth day of his mourning, and so he is permitted to cut his hair on the intermediate days of the Festival.
The Gemara comments: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>,</b> who permits a mourner to cut his hair during the intermediate days of the Festival, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul, who said:</b> The legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that of <b>an entire</b> day, <b>and</b> therefore <b>the seventh</b> day <b>counts as both</b> the final day of the seven-day mourning period and the first day of the thirty-day mourning period. From the perspective of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning, one would be permitted to cut his hair; however <b>since</b> this day <b>is Shabbat, he is unavoidably prevented</b> from doing so, and therefore he is permitted to cut his hair during the intermediate days of the Festival.
<b>The <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, on the other hand, who does not mention that a mourner is permitted to cut his hair on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>Rabbis, who say: We do not say</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that of <b>an entire</b> day for a mourner. Therefore, <b>he has not yet completed</b> his <b>seven-</b>day period of <b>mourning,</b> and consequently he will not be permitted to cut his hair even after the Festival, until the completion of the thirty-day mourning period.
The Gemara continues and asks: The case of <b>this priest,</b> who is permitted to cut his hair during the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say that he completed his watch on the eve of the Festival,</b> then <b>he should have cut his hair on the eve of the Festival.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>necessary</b> in the case <b>where one completed his watch during the Festival</b> week itself. <b>The <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna <b>holds</b> that <b>since we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 55b): <b>At the year,</b> i.e., the three pilgrimage Festivals, <b>all of the priestly watches share equally in the Festival offerings and in the division of the shewbread</b> among the priests on Shabbat that occurs on the Festival, therefore, <b>he is</b> considered <b>like one whose watch was not completed during the Festival,</b> and he may not cut his hair until after the Festival. <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that although</b> he <b>belongs</b> also <b>to those</b> other <b>watches</b> serving during the Festival, <b>nevertheless, his own watch was completed</b> before the Festival, and so he is permitted to cut his hair.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>All those about whom it was said</b> that they <b>are permitted to cut their hair on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> because they were unable to do so beforehand, <b>they may</b> similarly <b>cut their hair during the period of their mourning</b> if they had been unable to do so beforehand.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>They are</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> from cutting their hair during the period of their mourning? <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Sheila said: When it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>they are permitted</b> to cut their hair, it is referring to one <b>for whom</b> two periods of <b>mourning applied in succession.</b> In other words, this person was required to practice one period of mourning immediately following another period of mourning, and he is unable to endure the prescribed restrictions for such an extended period.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this is referring to a case <b>where his mourning applied in succession,</b> then <b>why specifically</b> does the <i>baraita</i> discuss <b>all those about whom it was said</b> that they may cut their hair? The allowance should apply <b>even to everyone,</b> not only to those who had been unavoidably prevented from cutting their hair in the preceding period, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one’s mourning</b> periods <b>applied in succession, one after the other,</b> and <b>his hair</b> grew long and <b>became heavy, he may lighten</b> it by cutting his hair <b>with a razor, and he may wash his garment in water,</b> so that he does not suffer for such a long time without cutting his hair or washing his clothes.
The Gemara answers: <b>But wasn’t it said with regard to that</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> When it states that one may cut his hair, it means that he may do so <b>with a razor, but not with scissors?</b> Similarly, when it states that one may wash his clothes, it means that he may launder them <b>with water, but not with <i>neter</i> or soap.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that if one had been unavoidably prevented from performing these actions beforehand and then had to observe a double mourning period, he may cut his hair in an ordinary manner, without performing these actions in an altered way. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: That is to say</b> that, generally speaking, <b>a mourner is prohibited from laundering</b> his clothes.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>it is prohibited to cut one’s hair during the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival, so too it is prohibited to cut one’s nails during the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, whereas Rabbi Yosei permits</b> cutting nails.
<b>And just as</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>a mourner is prohibited from cutting his hair during the period of his mourning, so too he is prohibited from cutting his nails during the period of his mourning;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, whereas Rabbi Yosei permits</b> a mourner to cut his nails.
<b>Ulla said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to mourning, but the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei with regard to the</b> intermediate days of the <b>Festival. Shmuel said:</b>

Daf 18a

<b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei with regard to</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival and with regard to mourning, as Shmuel said</b> this general principle: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>
It was related that <b>something</b> unpleasant <b>happened to Pineḥas, brother of Mar Shmuel,</b> that is to say, one of his close relatives died. <b>Shmuel entered to ask him the reason,</b> i.e., to console him. <b>He saw that</b> Pineḥas’s <b>nails were long,</b> and <b>said to him: Why do you not cut them?</b> Pineḥas <b>replied: If it were your</b> relative who died, and you were in mourning, <b>would you treat</b> the matter <b>so lightly</b> and cut your nails?
Pineḥas’s words <b>were: “Like an error that proceeds from a ruler”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:5). As soon as he uttered them they come true, even though he did not intend them. Shortly after Pineḥas made his comment, <b>something</b> unpleasant <b>happened to Shmuel,</b> and one of his close relatives died. <b>Pineḥas, his brother, entered to ask him the reason,</b> i.e., to offer words of comfort. Shmuel <b>took his nails and cast them in</b> Pineḥas’s face. Shmuel then <b>said to him:</b> Do <b>you not</b> know the principle that <b>a covenant is made with the lips?</b> In other words, do you not know that what one says influences future events?
This is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a covenant is made with the lips,</b> and that one’s speech has the power to change events? <b>For it is stated: “And Abraham said to his young men: Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go onward; and we will worship, and we will come back to you”</b> (Genesis 22:5). Abraham said this even though he thought that he was going to sacrifice his son as an offering and that Isaac would not be returning, <b>yet this had an influence and they both came back.</b>
With regard to this <i>halakha</i> pertaining to a mourner cutting his nails: They initially <b>concluded from this:</b> With regard to the nails on his <b>hand, yes,</b> a mourner may cut them; but as for the nails on his <b>foot, no,</b> he may not cut them, because long toenails are less repulsive. <b>Rav Anan bar Taḥlifa said: It was explained to me by Shmuel</b> himself: <b>It is not different</b> if it is the nails on the <b>hand and it is not different</b> if it is the nails on the <b>foot,</b> as in both cases cutting the nails is permitted.
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: But with scissors [<i>genustera</i>]</b> specifically for nail cutting <b>it is prohibited,</b> i.e., the mourner should cut his nails in an alternate manner. <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba said: I</b> once <b>stood before Rabbi Yoḥanan in the study hall during the intermediate days of a Festival, and he cut his nails with his teeth and threw them</b> down.
The Gemara comments: <b>Learn from this</b> incident of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Learn from this</b> that <b>it is permitted to cut one’s nails on the intermediate days of a Festival. And learn from this</b> that nails <b>have no</b> prohibition <b>due to</b> the fact that they are <b>repulsive,</b> i.e., there is no prohibition against biting them on that basis. Inasmuch as one is prohibited from placing something repulsive in his mouth, this incident teaches that nails do not fall into this category. <b>And</b> also <b>learn from this</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> to throw <b>nails</b> away.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three things were said about nails: One who buries them</b> in the ground <b>is</b> deemed <b>righteous. One who burns them</b> is even better, as he <b>is</b> considered <b>pious. One who</b> merely <b>throws them</b> away <b>is</b> regarded as <b>wicked.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that it is prohibited to throw away nail clippings? This is prohibited <b>lest a pregnant women pass over them and miscarry,</b> for the Sages had a tradition that it is dangerous for a pregnant woman to walk over fingernails.
The Gemara answers: <b>A woman is not usually</b> found <b>in the study hall,</b> and therefore Rabbi Yoḥanan was not concerned about throwing his nail clippings there. <b>If you say</b> that <b>sometimes</b> the nails <b>are gathered</b> together when the floor is swept <b>and</b> then <b>thrown outside</b> where a pregnant woman may walk over them, this is not a problem. <b>Once</b> their place <b>has changed</b> the nails themselves <b>change</b> and are no longer harmful.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A pair</b> of Sages from <b>Ḥamatan came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And Mar Zutra taught</b> it without the names of Rav Yehuda and Rav, simply as: <b>A pair</b> of Sages from <b>Ḥamatan came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And they asked him</b> whether or not a mourner is permitted to cut his <b>nails, and he permitted</b> it <b>to them. And had they asked him</b> whether or not a mourner may trim his <b>mustache, he would</b> also <b>have permitted</b> it <b>to them. And Shmuel said: They also asked him</b> about trimming <b>a mustache,</b> and <b>he permitted</b> it <b>to them.</b>
<b>Avitul the scribe said in the name of Rav Pappa: A mustache</b> may be trimmed <b>from</b> one <b>corner to</b> the other <b>corner</b> of the mouth. <b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> One may trim only the portion of the <b>mustache that interferes</b> with normal eating, but one may not trim the mustache for beautification. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: For me,</b> my entire mustache <b>is</b> considered <b>like a mustache that interferes</b> with normal eating, as I am particularly sensitive, and so I may trim my entire mustache.
§ Having mentioned Avitul the scribe, the Gemara records other statements of his: <b>And Avitul the scribe said in the name of Rav Pappa:</b> The <b>Pharaoh who lived in the days of Moses was a cubit</b> tall, his <b>beard was a cubit</b> long, <b>and his penis</b> [<b><i>parmashtako</i></b>] was <b>a cubit and a span,</b> i.e., a cubit and the distance between the thumb and the little finger, in length, <b>in order to fulfill what is stated: “And He sets up over it the lowest of men”</b> (Daniel 4:14), which teaches that Pharaoh was extremely short and lowly.
<b>Avitul the scribe</b> also <b>said in the name of Rav Pappa:</b> The <b>Pharaoh who lived in the days of Moses was a sorcerer</b> [<b><i>amgushi</i></b>], <b>as it is stated: “Behold, he goes out to the water”</b> (Exodus 7:15). Pharaoh would regularly go out to the water in order to engage in witchcraft.
§ The mishna taught: <b>And these</b> people <b>may launder</b> their clothes <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival: One who comes from a country overseas. Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who has only one shirt is permitted to launder it on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised an objection</b> from what was taught in the mishna: <b>And these</b> people <b>may launder</b> their clothes <b>on the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival: One who comes from a country overseas,</b> and one who is released from a house of captivity, and one who comes out of prison, and one who had been ostracized and the Rabbis released him from his decree of ostracism, <b>etc.</b> It may be inferred: <b>Those</b> who are mentioned in the mishna, <b>yes,</b> they may launder their clothes during the intermediate days of the Festival, but <b>one who has only one shirt</b> may <b>not</b> launder it.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov said to Rabbi Yirmeya: I will explain it to you. The mishna</b> is referring to those cases where one is permitted to launder his clothes even if <b>he has two</b> changes of garments <b>and</b> they are <b>dirty.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan speaks about one who has only one garment, and he rules that he may launder it in all circumstances.
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ya’akov bar Giyorei sent</b> a message <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>linen garments, it is permitted to launder them during the intermediate days of the Festival</b> because they are easily soiled. <b>Rava raised an objection</b> from what is taught in the mishna: <b>Hand towels, the towels</b>

Daf 18b

<b>of barbers</b> that are used to cover a person having a haircut, and body-drying towels may all be laundered on the intermediate days of a Festival. This statement implies that <b>these</b> garments, <b>yes,</b> they may be laundered, but other types of <b>linen garments, no,</b> they may not be laundered.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> This is not a contradiction: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to garments made <b>even of other types</b> of materials; linen garments, however, may be laundered even when they serve other purposes. <b>Bar Hedya said: I myself saw the Sea of Tiberias,</b> the Sea of Galilee, <b>to which basins</b> full <b>of linen garments were brought out</b> to be laundered <b>during the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>
<b>Abaye strongly objects to this:</b> This report cannot be adduced as proof for the <i>halakha</i>, for <b>who says to us</b> that <b>they did</b> this <b>in accordance with the will of the Sages? Perhaps they did</b> it <b>without the will of the Sages.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these</b> are the documents that <b>may be written on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival:</b> Documents of <b>betrothal of wives,</b> through which bridegrooms betroth their brides; <b>bills of divorce; receipts</b> for the repayment of debts; <b>wills [<i>deyateiki</i>];</b> deeds of <b>gift; <i>perozbolin</i>,</b> documents through which lenders authorize the courts to collect their loans on their behalf, thereby preventing the Sabbatical year from canceling their debts; <b>letters of valuation,</b> which were drawn up by the court when they valuated property and transferred it to the lender; and <b>letters of sustenance,</b> which were drawn up when one accepted upon himself to maintain another, e.g., his step-daughter.
The list continues: <b>Documents of the ritual through which the brother-in-law frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>],</b> thereby freeing her from the obligation to marry one of her deceased husband’s brothers; documents in which the court records the <b>refusal</b> of a girl upon reaching majority to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brothers married her as a minor after the death of her father; <b>documents of arbitration,</b> in which the court summarizes a conflict that had been resolved through arbitration; <b>court rulings; and</b> the official <b>correspondence of the</b> ruling <b>authorities.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel said: It is permitted to betroth</b> a woman <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival, lest another</b> come and betroth her <b>first.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that</b> the mishna <b>supports</b> Shmuel, who said: <b>And these</b> are the documents that <b>may be drawn up on the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival: Documents of betrothal.</b>
<b>What, is</b> the mishna <b>not</b> referring to <b>actual documents of betrothal,</b> through which one would actually betroth a woman? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring to <b>documents of stipulation</b> recording the amounts that the parents agree to pay as the dowry of their respective son or daughter, <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said.</b>
<b>For Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> When two families negotiate the terms of marriage for their respective children, and one side says to the other: <b>How much do you give to your son</b> as a dowry? And the second side says: I give <b>such and such</b> amount; <b>how much do you give to your daughter?</b> And the first side responds: <b>Such and such</b> amount, then, once the bride and groom <b>arose and</b> pronounced <b>the betrothal</b> formula, then all of these obligations are <b>acquired</b> and therefore binding. <b>These are</b> among <b>the things that are acquired through words</b> alone. In other words, there is no need to perform an additional act of acquisition in order to confirm the agreement, and the mishna is referring to a document recording such an agreement. Although such a document may be drawn up even on the intermediate days of a Festival, this does not mean that one may actually betroth a woman during this period.
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that the following mishna <b>supports</b> Shmuel: <b>One may not marry a woman on the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival, neither a virgin nor a widow; nor may one</b> then <b>perform levirate marriage</b> with his sister-in-law, if his brother died childless, <b>because that</b> would be <b>a joyous</b> occasion <b>for him.</b> This statement implies that it is only marrying that is prohibited, <b>but betrothing is permitted.</b>
The Gemara rejects this argument: This is not the correct way to understand the mishna, as <b>it is speaking in the style of: Needless to say.</b> It is <b>needless to say</b> that <b>betrothal</b> is not permitted, <b>because</b> the groom <b>does not perform a mitzva</b> through betrothal. <b>Rather,</b> the same is true <b>even of marriage, through which one performs a mitzva,</b> as marriage is preparation for fulfilling the mitzva of procreation. It is still <b>not permitted.</b>
The Gemara offers another support for Shmuel: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> a Sage of <b>the school of Shmuel taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may betroth</b> a woman on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>but he may not marry</b> her, <b>nor may he make a betrothal feast, nor may he perform levirate marriage, because that</b> would be <b>a joyous</b> occasion <b>for him,</b> and one may not mix the joy of a wedding with the joy of the Festival. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> a support for Shmuel’s opinion.
The Gemara raises a question about the ruling itself: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that we are concerned that <b>perhaps another</b> man will come and betroth the woman <b>first? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say that Shmuel said: Every day a Divine Voice issues forth and says: The daughter of so-and-so</b> is destined to be the wife of <b>so-and-so; the field of so-and-so</b> will belong <b>to so-and-so?</b> If this is the case, why should one be concerned lest another betroth her first? It is predestined that he will marry his designated mate.
<b>Rather,</b> Shmuel’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>Perhaps another</b> man will come and betroth her <b>first by means of</b> praying for divine <b>mercy.</b> In other words, Shmuel is concerned that the rival may beseech God to cancel the decree of the Divine Voice, and therefore the first man needs to hurry and betroth the woman before the other one has a chance to pray that he should take her from him.
This is <b>like this</b> incident, in <b>which Rava heard a certain man asking for mercy,</b> i.e., praying, <b>who said: Grant me so-and-so</b> as a wife. Rava <b>said to him: Do not</b> pray and <b>ask for mercy</b> in <b>this</b> way. <b>If</b> she <b>is fit for you,</b> and it has been decreed that she will be your wife, <b>she will not go away from you. And if</b> she is <b>not</b> destined to be your wife, <b>you will</b> come to <b>deny the Lord</b> when you see that your prayer is not answered. <b>After</b> the man married this woman, Rava <b>heard him say</b> in prayer: Please <b>either let him die before her or let her die before him.</b> He was speaking about himself and his wife because he had grown to hate her so much. Rava <b>said to him: Did I not say to you not to pray for this matter?</b>
<b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Reuven ben Itzterobili as follows: From the Torah, and from the Prophets, and from the Writings;</b> it implies that the decree that a specific <b>woman</b> is destined to be married <b>to</b> a specific <b>man</b> is <b>from God.</b> From where is this derived? It is <b>from the Torah, as it is written: “Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: The thing comes from the Lord,</b> we cannot speak to you either bad or good” (Genesis 24:50). <b>From the Prophets, as it is written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord”</b> (Judges 14:4). <b>From the Writings, as it is written: “House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent woman is from the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 19:14).
§ Apropos a teaching of Rabbi Reuven ben Itzterobili, the Gemara states that <b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Reuven ben Itzterobili, and some say</b> that <b>it was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>Rabbi Reuven ben Itzterobili said: A man is suspected of</b> having done <b>something</b> wrong <b>only if he has</b> indeed <b>done so. And if he did not do it wholly,</b> then probably <b>he did it partly. And if he did not do it</b> even <b>partly,</b> then probably <b>he thought in his heart to do it. And if he did not</b> even <b>think to himself to do it,</b> then certainly <b>he saw others doing it and was happy.</b> Suspicions do not arbitrarily arise about a person; therefore there is certainly some basis for them.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov raised an objection:</b> Does the verse not say: <b>“And the children of Israel fabricated matters that were not right against the Lord their God”</b> (II Kings 17:9), which indicates that it is possible to make up stories about someone else even though they are entirely baseless. The Gemara answers: <b>There they did it in order to anger</b> God, but they did not actually think that what they were saying was true.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a challenge from a different source: The verse states: <b>“And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, of Aaron the Lord’s holy one”</b> (Psalms 106:16). <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This verse <b>teaches that every man warned his wife</b> against seclusion <b>with Moses</b> because he was jealous. This implies that every man thought that his wife had secluded herself with Moses and sinned, although this was certainly not the case. This demonstrates that it is possible to suspect an absolutely innocent person. The Gemara answers: <b>There they did it out of hatred</b> for Moses. They did not actually suspect him of wrongdoing. Instead, their goal was to degrade him by leveling these false accusations against him.
The Gemara raises another challenge, based on yet another source: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which Rabbi Yosei said: May my portion</b> in the future world <b>be with one who is suspected</b> of a certain wrongdoing <b>but is innocent,</b> as the pain that such a person experiences atones for his sins. This statement also appears to imply that it is possible to suspect an absolutely innocent person. <b>And Rav Pappa said: They suspected me</b> of a certain wrongdoing <b>but I was not</b> guilty.
The Gemara answers: <b>It</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> is referring <b>to a rumor that stops,</b> and therefore it is possible that it is groundless, whereas <b>that</b> is referring <b>to a rumor that does not stop,</b> and in that case there must be a factual basis for the suspicion. The Gemara asks: To be considered <b>a rumor that does not stop, for how long</b> must it persist? <b>Abaye said: My nurse told me: Local gossip lasts for a day and a half,</b> and then it is deemed to be a rumor that does not stop.
The Gemara comments: <b>This applies only</b> if the rumor <b>did not stop in between,</b> during the day and a half, <b>but</b> if <b>it stopped in between</b> then <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and it is not a persistent rumor. <b>And if</b> the rumor <b>stopped in between, we said</b> that it is considered baseless <b>only</b> if it <b>stopped</b> of its own accord and <b>not out of fear,</b> i.e., because the suspect is violent and therefore people are afraid to speak badly about him. But if the rumor <b>stopped out of fear,</b> then this dispensation does <b>not</b> apply, and it is still assumed that there must be some basis to the rumor.
<b>And we said</b> that a rumor that stopped is assumed to be baseless <b>only if it did not arise again. But</b> if <b>it arose again,</b> then this does <b>not</b> apply. <b>And we said</b> that a rumor that does not stop must be taken seriously <b>only if</b> the slandered person <b>has no enemies. But</b> if <b>he has</b> known <b>enemies,</b> then it can be assumed that <b>it was the enemies who disseminated the rumor.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not write bills of debt on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. But if</b> the lender <b>does not trust</b> the borrower, and he is concerned that the borrower will later deny the loan, <b>or</b> if the scribe <b>has nothing to eat,</b> then <b>he may write</b> a bill of debt during the Festival week.
<b>One may not write</b> Torah <b>scrolls, phylacteries, or <i>mezuzot</i> on the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival, nor may one correct a single letter, even in the</b> Torah <b>scroll of Ezra,</b> which was kept in the Temple and upon which all the Jewish communities relied. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may write phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> for himself</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival if he needs them.

Daf 19a

<b>And one may spin sky-blue</b> wool <b>for</b> his <b>ritual fringes on his thigh,</b> but not in the ordinary manner with a spindle, as this procedure must be performed in an altered manner on the intermediate days of a Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may write phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> for himself and spin sky-blue</b> wool <b>for his fringes on his thigh. And for others</b> he may do these things <b>as a favor,</b> but not for payment. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he initially made them for himself, <b>he may employ artifice, sell his own and</b> then <b>go back and write</b> new ones <b>for himself. Rabbi Yosei says: He may write and sell</b> them <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner,</b> in the amount that is <b>enough</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood.</b>
<b>Rav ruled for Rav Ḥananel, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> who ruled <b>for Rav Ḥananel: The <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>one may write and sell</b> them <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner,</b> in the amount that is <b>enough</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood.</b>
§ The mishna taught: <b>And one may spin sky-blue</b> wool <b>for</b> his <b>ritual fringes on his thigh. The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may spin sky-blue</b> wool <b>for his ritual fringes on his thigh, but not with a stone,</b> which can be used to form a small spindle and ease the spinning process; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Rabbis say:</b> One may spin the sky-blue wool <b>even with a stone. Rabbi Yehuda said in</b> the name of Rabbi Eliezer: It is permitted <b>with a stone, but not with a spindle. And the Rabbis say:</b> One may spin this wool <b>with either a stone or a spindle.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and similarly Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that one may spin the sky-blue wool for fringes on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>both with a stone and with a spindle,</b> owing to the importance of the mitzva of ritual fringes. <b>And</b> similarly <b>the <i>halakha</i> is: One may write</b> phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner and sell enough</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who buries his deceased</b> relative <b>three days before a pilgrimage Festival</b> has <b>the decree of</b> the <b>seven-</b>day period of mourning, i.e., the <i>halakhot</i> and prohibitions associated with that period, <b>nullified for him</b> by the Festival. He is not required to complete this seven-day mourning period after the Festival. If one buries his deceased relative <b>eight</b> days before a pilgrimage Festival, then <b>the decree of thirty</b> days <b>is nullified for him.</b> The restrictions that ordinarily apply during this thirty-day mourning period no longer apply after the Festival.
This is <b>because</b> the Sages <b>said</b> a principle with regard to this issue: <b>Shabbat counts</b> as one of the days of mourning, although one may not mourn on it <b>and it does not interrupt</b> the mourning period, which continues after Shabbat. The <b>pilgrimage Festivals,</b> on the other hand, <b>interrupt</b> the mourning period, so that if one began mourning before such a Festival, then the mourning period is canceled by the Festival. <b>They do not,</b> however, <b>count.</b> If one did not begin mourning before the Festival, or if his relative died during the Festival, then he is required to complete his mourning period afterward, as the days of the Festival do not count toward the requisite days of mourning.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From the time that the Temple was destroyed, <i>Shavuot</i> is like Shabbat,</b> because nowadays the days following <i>Shavuot</i> are not treated like Festival days. When the Temple stood, many of the Festival’s offerings that could not be sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i> itself would be sacrificed during the six days following the Festival. Nowadays, however, when offerings are no longer sacrificed, <i>Shavuot</i> lasts for only one day in Eretz Yisrael, and therefore it is treated like Shabbat with regard to mourning: It counts as one of the days of mourning, but does not interrupt the period of mourning.
<b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> Even <b>Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur</b> are considered <b>like</b> the <b>pilgrimage Festivals,</b> in that they interrupt the mourning period but are not counted toward the days of mourning. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is neither in accordance with the statement of</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>nor in accordance with the statement of </b> Rabban Gamliel. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to mourning, <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> is treated <b>like the</b> other <b>pilgrimage Festivals,</b> whereas <b>Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur</b> are treated <b>like Shabbat.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that the seven- and thirty-day periods of mourning are nullified, <b>Rav said:</b> The <b>decree,</b> meaning the main prohibitions of the period, <b>was nullified,</b> but <b>the days</b> of mourning themselves <b>were not</b> entirely <b>nullified.</b> Instead, these periods of mourning remain to some degree. <b>And so said Rav Huna: The decree was nullified,</b> but <b>the days</b> of mourning themselves <b>were not nullified. And Rav Sheshet said: Even the days</b> of mourning <b>were also nullified.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason that the days</b> themselves <b>were not nullified?</b> The Gemara explains: It is so <b>that if</b> one observed eight days of mourning before the Festival, so that the prohibition against hair cutting was nullified before the Festival, but for whatever reason <b>he did not cut his hair on the eve of the Festival, he is prohibited from cutting his hair after the Festival</b> until the end of the thirty-day period of mourning. In other words, the mourning period was not entirely nullified, and since he did not take advantage of the allowance to cut his hair before the Festival, he must observe the prohibitions applying during the thirty-day period of mourning after the Festival as well.

Daf 19b

<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who buries his dead</b> relative <b>three days before a pilgrimage Festival, the decree of</b> the <b>seven-</b>day period of mourning is <b>nullified for him.</b> If one buries his dead relative <b>eight</b> days before a Festival, <b>the decree of thirty</b> days <b>is nullified for him,</b> and therefore he may <b>cut his hair on the eve of the Festival. If,</b> however, <b>he did not cut his hair on the eve of the Festival, he is prohibited from cutting his hair after the Festival</b> until the end of the thirty-day period of mourning.
<b>Abba Shaul says:</b> Even if he failed to cut his hair on the eve of the Festival, <b>he is permitted to cut his hair after the Festival, for just as</b> his observance of <b>the mitzva of three</b> days of mourning prior to the Festival <b>cancels the decree of</b> the <b>seven-</b>day period of mourning, and so if the deceased was buried three days before the Festival, the mourner is no longer required to continue this period of mourning after the Festival, <b>so too,</b> his observance of <b>the mitzva of seven</b> days of mourning before the Festival <b>cancels the decree of</b> the <b>thirty-</b>day period of mourning.
The Gemara asks: Why does Abba Shaul speak of the observance of <b>seven</b> days of mourning? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that it requires <b>eight</b> days? The Gemara explains: <b>Abba Shaul maintains</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that of <b>an entire day,</b> and therefore <b>the seventh day counts as both</b> the final day of the seven-day period of mourning and the first day of the thirty-day period of mourning. <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Ravina bar Sheila said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul.</b>
<b>And</b> furthermore, even <b>the Rabbis concede to Abba Shaul that when one’s eighth</b> day of mourning <b>occurs on a Shabbat,</b> which is also <b>the eve of a Festival, he is permitted to cut his hair on Friday,</b> which is the seventh day. Since he is unavoidably prevented from cutting his hair on the eighth day, as it is prohibited for him to cut his hair on Shabbat, he may do so already on Friday, although it is only his seventh day of mourning.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Amram said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>a mourner, once the comforters have stood up</b> to leave <b>his</b> house on the seventh day of his mourning, <b>he is immediately permitted to bathe? In accordance with whose</b> opinion? <b>In accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul.</b> He maintains that a part of the seventh day is treated as an entire day with regard to this issue.
<b>Abaye said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul with regard to the seventh</b> day of mourning, <b>and the Rabbis concede to Abba Shaul with regard to the thirtieth day,</b> for with regard to the thirtieth day <b>we</b> certainly <b>say</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that of <b>an entire</b> day, and so a mourner may already cut his hair on the morning of the thirtieth day.
<b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul with regard to the thirtieth day</b> of mourning, <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with Abba Shaul with regard to the seventh</b> day. <b>And</b> the Sages of <b>Neharde’a say: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul with regard to both</b> the seventh day and the thirtieth day, for <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> follows the statement of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>
§ The Gemara asks now about the thirty-day mourning period: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <b>thirty-day</b> period of mourning? The Gemara answers: <b>It is learned</b> by way of a verbal analogy <b>between</b> one instance of the word <b><i>pera</i></b> and a different instance of the word <b><i>pera</i></b> stated with regard to <b>a nazirite. Here,</b> in the instructions given to Aaron not to mourn the deaths of his sons, <b>it is written: “Let the hair of your heads not grow loose [<i>tifra’u</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:6), which indicates that ordinary mourners are required to grow their hair long. <b>And there,</b> with regard to a nazirite, <b>it is written: “He shall let the hair of his head grow long [<i>pera</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:5). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the nazirite, he must grow his hair for <b>thirty</b> days, <b>so too, here</b> a mourner must grow his hair for <b>thirty</b> days.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to a nazirite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that he must grow his hair for thirty days? Nowhere is this explicitly stated with regard to a nazirite. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Mattana said: An unspecified naziriteship,</b> when one takes a vow of naziriteship without specifying for how long, extends for <b>thirty days. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states: “He shall be sacred,</b> and he shall let the hair of his head grow” (Numbers 6:5), and <b>“He shall be [<i>yihye</i>],”</b> which is written <i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <b>has a numerical value [<i>gimatriyya</i>] of thirty,</b> as <i>yod</i> has a numerical value of ten and <i>heh</i> has a numerical value of five. This implies that an unspecified naziriteship extends for thirty days, and by way of the verbal analogy, this is applied to mourning as well.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Everyone,</b> including Abba Shaul, who says that part of a day is treated like a full day, <b>agrees</b> that <b>when his third</b> day of mourning <b>occurs on the eve of the Festival,</b> the mourner <b>is prohibited from bathing</b> his body <b>until the evening.</b> In this case, the principle that the legal status of part of the day is like that of an entire day does not apply. Rather, one must observe three full days of mourning. He must therefore wait until the evening and wash himself with cold water, or wait until the intermediate days of the Festival and bathe in hot water.
<b>Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: I</b> once <b>found Rav Pappi and Rav Pappa sitting</b> together <b>and saying: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this tradition: <b>Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, said: I</b> once <b>found Rav Pappi, Rav Pappa, and Rav Huna, son of Yehoshua, sitting</b> together <b>and saying: Everyone concedes</b> that <b>when the third</b> day of mourning <b>occurs on the eve of a Festival,</b> the mourner <b>is prohibited from bathing</b> his body <b>until the evening.</b>
<b>Abaye inquired of Rava:</b> If <b>one buried</b> his dead relative <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>does the Festival count toward his thirty-</b>day period of mourning, <b>or does the Festival not count toward his thirty-</b>day period of mourning? Abaye elaborated on his question: <b>I do not ask</b> whether or not the Festival counts toward his <b>seven-</b>day period of mourning because <b>the obligation</b> to observe <b>seven</b> days of mourning <b>does not apply</b> at all <b>during the Festival,</b> and therefore he must certainly observe the seven-day mourning period, beginning from after the Festival. <b>What I am asking is</b> with regard to the <b>thirty-</b>day period of mourning, because certain aspects of the <b>mitzva of</b> the <b>thirty-</b>day mourning period <b>do</b> in fact <b>apply during the Festival,</b> e.g., the prohibitions to launder clothes and cut hair. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>: Do the days of the Festival count toward the thirty days or not?
Rava <b>said to him:</b> The Festival <b>does not count</b> toward the thirty days. Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rava’s opinion from the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one buries his dead</b> relative <b>two days before a Festival, he must count five days</b> of mourning <b>after the Festival, and</b> during this period <b>his work is performed</b> for him <b>by others. And his menservants and maidservants do</b> this work <b>in private inside his house, and the public need not occupy themselves with him</b> by coming to console him,

Daf 20a

<b>for they already occupied themselves with him</b> when they came to console him <b>during the Festival. The</b> general <b>principle with regard to the matter</b> is as follows: <b>Any</b> activity <b>that</b> is prohibited to the mourner <b>because it is</b> an expression of <b>mourning is interrupted by the Festival</b> and remains prohibited afterward. <b>And anything that involves the public’s occupation</b> with the mourner, e.g., coming to the mourner to offer him comfort and condolence, <b>is not interrupted by the Festival,</b> for people console the mourner during the Festival as well.
If <b>he</b> buries his relative <b>three days</b> before <b>the end of the Festival,</b> the mourner <b>must count seven</b> days of mourning <b>after the Festival</b> because his mourning never began. On the <b>first four days</b> of his mourning, <b>the public must occupy themselves with him</b> and come to console him. On <b>the three last days,</b> however, <b>the public need not occupy themselves with him, as they already occupied themselves with him during the Festival.</b> That is to say, they certainly came to console him during the Festival, although the period of mourning did not actually begin until afterward. <b>And the Festival counts for him</b> toward the thirty-day mourning period.
With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that the Festival counts toward the thirty-day period of mourning: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>, which speaks about a case where the burial was performed during the Festival itself? If this is the case, then a refutation of Rava’s opinion is stated explicitly, that the Festival counts toward the thirty-day mourning period, even if the deceased was buried on the Festival itself. Rava rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>the first clause,</b> which discusses a case where the burial was performed before the Festival, and since rites of mourning were observed already before the Festival, the Festival is counted toward the thirty-day period of mourning. Therefore, it is not a refutation of Rava’s <i>halakha</i>.
Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rava’s opinion from another <i>baraita</i>, in which it was taught: <b>A pilgrimage Festival counts toward the thirty-</b>day period of mourning. <b>How so?</b> If one <b>buried</b> his dead relative <b>at the beginning of a pilgrimage Festival, he must count seven</b> days of mourning <b>after the Festival, and</b> during this period <b>his work is performed by others. And his menservants and maidservants perform</b> this work <b>in private inside his house, and the public need not occupy themselves with him</b> and come to console him, <b>for they already occupied themselves with him during the Festival. And the Festival counts for him.</b> Here it is explicitly stated that the Festival counts toward the thirty-day period of mourning, even when the deceased was buried during the Festival itself. The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rava’s opinion.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if <b>one buried</b> his dead relative <b>during the Festival,</b> the Festival counts toward his thirty-day period of mourning. <b>And, similarly, Rabbi Elazar ruled for Rabbi Pedat, his son: Even if one buried</b> his dead relative <b>during the Festival</b> it counts towards his thirty days.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one fulfilled the</b> obligation of <b>overturning the bed for three days before the pilgrimage Festival, he is no</b> longer <b>required to overturn it after the Festival;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Rabbis say: Even</b> if one overturned his bed for only <b>one day, or even for</b> only <b>one hour,</b> he is not required to overturn it after the Festival.
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said: This is the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> and <b>that is the statement of Beit Hillel.</b> In other words, Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagreed about a matter that was the subject of an earlier dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>for Beit Shammai say: Three days, and Beit Hillel say: Even one day.</b>
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say</b> a different version of this line of transmission: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and to Rav Huna: Even one day, even one hour.</b> The Gemara cites <b>Rava,</b> who <b>said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, who <b>said three</b> days. Based on this, we rule that the mourning rites are not canceled after the Festival unless they were observed for at least three days before the Festival.
<b>Ravina happened</b> to come to the city of <b>Sura on the</b> banks of the <b>Euphrates</b> River. <b>Rav Ḥaviva said to Ravina: What is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to this issue? <b>He said to him: Even one day, and even one hour.</b>
§ It was related that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, Rabbi Ami, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa were</b> once <b>sitting in the pavilion of Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar</b> and were conversing. <b>A matter emerged from among them: From where</b> is it derived that the rites of <b>mourning</b> are observed for <b>seven</b> days? <b>As it is written: “And I will turn your Festivals into mourning”</b> (Amos 8:10). <b>Just as a Festival</b> lasts for <b>seven</b> days, <b>so too mourning</b> lasts for <b>seven</b> days.
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that perhaps mourning is like <b><i>Shavuot</i>, which is</b> only <b>one day.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>That</b> derivation, from the one day of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>is required for</b> what was stated by <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> mourning in the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> i.e., when one hears that one of his relatives died a long time ago, <b>applies for only one day? As it is written: “And I will turn your Festivals into mourning,” and we find</b> with regard to <b><i>Shavuot</i> that one day is</b> also <b>called a Festival.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>recent tidings</b> of a relative’s death, mourning <b>applies for seven- and thirty-</b>day periods. In the case of <b>distant tidings, it applies only for one day. What are</b> considered <b>recent tidings and what are</b> considered <b>distant tidings? Recent</b> tidings are news that arrives <b>within thirty</b> days of the person’s death. <b>Distant</b> tidings are news that arrives <b>after thirty</b> days; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in the case of <b>recent tidings and</b> in the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> mourning <b>applies for seven- and thirty-</b>day periods.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Wherever you find an individual being lenient and the majority being stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the majority, except for this</b> case, <b>for even though Rabbi Akiva is lenient and the Rabbis are stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> This is in keeping with the principle <b>stated by Shmuel: The <i>halakha</i> follows the statement of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>
It was related that <b>Rav Ḥanina received</b> distant <b>tidings of his father’s</b> death <b>from Bei Ḥozai. He came before Rav Ḥisda</b> to ask what he should do. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> In the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> mourning <b>applies for only one day.</b> It was similarly related that <b>Rav Natan bar Ami received a report about his mother’s</b> death <b>from Bei Ḥozai. He came before Rava,</b> and Rava <b>said to him: They said</b> that in the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> mourning <b>applies for only one day.</b>
Rav Natan <b>raised an objection to</b> Rava’s opinion based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that mourning applies for only one day <b>said?</b> In the case of <b>the</b> other <b>five close relatives,</b> over whose <b>death</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> to mourn, i.e., son, daughter, brother, sister, and spouse. <b>But for one’s father or mother,</b> one is required to mourn for <b>seven and thirty</b> days, even when the report of the parent’s death is received some time after the event.
Rava <b>said to him:</b> This <b>is an individual</b> opinion, <b>and we do not hold in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident and the father of Rabbi Tzadok died in</b> the city of <b>Ginzak, and they informed him</b> of his father’s passing only <b>after three years. He came and asked Elisha ben Avuya and the Elders with him</b> what he should do. <b>And</b> Elisha ben Avuya <b>said</b> to him: <b>Observe</b> the rites of mourning for <b>seven and thirty</b> days. <b>And when the son of Rabbi Aḥiyya died in the Diaspora,</b> and Rabbi Aḥiyya was informed about his passing a long time afterward, he <b>sat</b> in mourning for <b>seven and thirty</b> days. Therefore, it is clear that this opinion was held only by a few individual Sages, but it was not generally accepted.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that this is Rabbi Aḥiyya’s opinion? <b>But Rav was the son of Rabbi Ḥiyya’s brother and</b> also <b>the son of Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sister,</b> for Rav’s father, Aivu, was Rabbi Ḥiyya’s paternal half brother, and Rav’s mother was Rabbi Ḥiyya’s maternal half sister. <b>When</b> Rav <b>went there,</b> Eretz Yisrael, his uncle Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Is</b> your <b>father,</b> Aivu, still <b>alive?</b>

Daf 20b

Not wishing to deliver unfortunate news, Rav <b>said to him: Is</b> my <b>mother</b> still <b>alive?</b> In other words, why do you not ask me about my mother, who is your sister, whether she is still among the living? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Is</b> your <b>mother</b> still <b>alive?</b> Rav <b>said to him: Is</b> my <b>father</b> still <b>alive?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya understood from Rav’s failure to provide him with straight answers that both his brother and his sister had passed away. Rabbi Ḥiyya immediately <b>said to his servant: Remove my shoes</b> as a sign of mourning, and afterward <b>carry my clothes behind me,</b> as I am going <b>to the bathhouse.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Learn three</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from this</b> incident with Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>Learn from this</b> that <b>a mourner is prohibited from wearing shoes,</b> and therefore Rabbi Ḥiyya removed his shoes upon hearing of the deaths of his brother and sister. <b>And learn from this</b> that in the case of <b>distant tidings</b> of a relative’s death, the mourning rites <b>apply for only one day</b> and no more. <b>And learn from this</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day, as immediately following the removal of his shoes, Rabbi Ḥiyya went to the bathhouse.
In any case, Rabbi Ḥiyya observed only one day of mourning after receiving a belated report of his siblings’ passing, in contrast to Rabbi Aḥiyya, who observed seven and thirty days. The Gemara’s question assumes that Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Aḥiyya are the same person. The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, for <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya is a discrete</b> person <b>and Rabbi Aḥiyya is a discrete</b> person; despite the similarity between their names, these are two different people.
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said:</b> If <b>one received recent tidings</b> of a relative’s death <b>during a Festival,</b> when it is prohibited to mourn, <b>and after the Festival they became distant</b> tidings, as after the Festival thirty days had already elapsed since the relative’s passing, the Festival <b>counts for him</b> toward the number of days that make it a belated report. <b>And,</b> consequently, after the Festival <b>he observes only one day</b> of mourning. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Adda of Caesarea taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If <b>one received recent tidings</b> of a relative’s passing <b>on Shabbat, and at the conclusion of Shabbat it became distant tidings, he observes only one day</b> of mourning.
§ The Gemara asks: Upon receiving a belated report of a close relative’s passing, <b>does one rend</b> his garment <b>or does he not rend</b> it? <b>Rabbi Mani said: He does not rend</b> it, whereas <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> He does <b>rend</b> it. <b>Rabbi Mani said to Rabbi Ḥanina: Granted,</b> it makes sense <b>that according to my</b> position this is consistent, <b>as I say</b> that <b>he does not rend</b> his garment, and <b>this is because there is no seven-</b>day period of <b>mourning. But according to you, who says</b> that <b>he does rend</b> his garment, <b>is there rending without a seven-</b>day period of <b>mourning</b> afterward?
The Gemara asks: Is there <b>not? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> reported by <b>Isi, father of Rabbi Zeira, and some say</b> it was taught by <b>the brother of Rabbi Zeira before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If at first <b>one did not have</b> his own <b>garment to rend, and he acquired</b> one <b>during the seven-</b>day period of mourning, he should <b>rend</b> it then. But if he acquired it only <b>after the seven-</b>day period of mourning, <b>he does not rend</b> it.
<b>Rabbi Zeira explained</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>after him,</b> filling in a missing element: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that one does not rend his garment after the seven-day period of mourning <b>said?</b> In the case of <b>the</b> other <b>five close relatives</b> over whose <b>death</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> to mourn, i.e., son, daughter, brother, sister, and spouse. <b>But for one’s father or mother, one continues</b> to be obligated <b>to rend</b> his garment if he receives the garment after the seven-day mourning period as well. This apparently contradicts Rabbi Mani’s statement that there is no rending without seven days of mourning.
The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring to a symbolic act meant <b>to honor his father or mother.</b> It is for one’s father or mother that he must rend his garment, even if it becomes available only after the seven-day period of mourning. Essentially, however, the obligation to rend one’s garments applies only when it is followed by a seven-day period of mourning.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>all</b> of the relatives <b>mentioned in the</b> Torah in the <b>passage</b> referring to <b>priests, for which a priest becomes impure, a mourner must mourn for them. And they are: His wife, his father, and his mother, his brother and his</b> unmarried <b>sister</b> from the same father, <b>his son, and his daughter.</b> The Sages <b>added</b> other relatives <b>to</b> this list: <b>His</b> maternal <b>brother and his unmarried sister from the same mother, and his married sister, whether from the same father or from the same mother.</b> One mourns for these relatives, <b>although</b> a priest would not become impure for them.
<b>Just as one mourns for them, so too he mourns for their</b> relatives’ relatives, who are his <b>second-degree relatives.</b> That is to say, just as one is required to mourn over his close relatives, so too he is required to mourn over his relatives’ close relatives, which are known as second-degree relatives. For example, if his father’s father, his son’s son, his brother’s son, or the like passed away, he must join his relatives in their mourning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: He mourns only over his son’s son and his father’s father,</b> but not over the other relatives of his relatives. <b>And the Rabbis say: Any</b> relative <b>over whom one would mourn</b> if that person died, <b>one mourns with him</b> when he is in mourning.
The Gemara asks: The statement of <b>the Rabbis is</b> identical to the statement of the <b>first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Akiva. What does their statement add? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to whether one mourn <b>with him</b> only <b>in the</b> same <b>house.</b> According to the Rabbis, one is required to mourn with his relative only while he is with him in the same house, whereas according to Rabbi Akiva, he is required to observe mourning even when he is not with him. This is <b>like what Rav said to his son, Ḥiyya, and</b> it is <b>similarly</b> like what <b>Rav Huna said to his son Rabba,</b> when the latter’s wife was in mourning: <b>In her presence practice mourning,</b> but <b>out of her presence do not practice mourning.</b>
It is related that <b>the son of Mar Ukva’s father-in-law,</b> i.e., Mar Ukva’s brother-in-law, <b>died,</b> and Mar Ukva <b>thought to sit</b> in mourning <b>over him for</b> the <b>seven- and thirty-</b>day periods of mourning. <b>Rav Huna went into his</b> house, <b>found him</b> observing the rites of mourning, and <b>said to him: Do you desire to eat mourners’ food [<i>tzudaniyyata</i>]?</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that one should observe mourning <b>in honor of his wife only</b> when she is in mourning over the death of <b>his father-in-law or his mother-in-law.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One whose father-in-law or mother-in-law died may not force his wife to paint [<i>koḥelet</i>]</b> her eyelids <b>or put rouge [<i>pokeset</i></b>] on her face while she is in mourning. <b>Rather, he should overturn his bed, and observe</b> the rites of <b>mourning with her. And similarly, when her father-in-law or mother-in-law dies, she may not paint</b> her eyelids <b>or put rouge</b> on her face. <b>Rather, she should overturn her bed and practice</b> the rites of <b>mourning with him.</b>
<b>And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said that</b> a husband <b>may not force his wife to paint</b> her eyelids <b>or put rouge</b> on her face when she is in mourning, i.e., that she may not treat her mourning lightly, <b>actually, they said</b> that <b>she may pour his cup</b> of wine, <b>make his bed, and wash his face, hands, and feet,</b> as these activities are expressions of affection between husband and wife rather than unnecessary adornment or a belittlement of the mourning. These two <i>baraitot</i> <b>contradict each other:</b> The first <i>baraita</i> indicates that the husband must practice the rites of mourning together with his wife, whereas the second one bars him only from forcing her to treat her own mourning lightly.
<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from this</b> as follows: <b>Here,</b> where one is required to observe the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning together with his wife, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the death of <b>his father-in-law or mother-in-law. There,</b> where one is not required to mourn, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the death of his wife’s <b>other relatives</b> for whom she is required to mourn. The Gemara summarizes: <b>Conclude from this</b> that this is the case. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>said</b> that one is required to observe the rites of mourning <b>in honor of his wife only</b> when she is in mourning over <b>his father-in-law or his mother-in-law.</b>
It was further related that <b>the son of Ameimar’s son died,</b> and Ameimar <b>rent</b> his garment <b>over him. His son came</b> before him, and <b>he rent</b> his garments again <b>in the presence of his</b> son, as an expression of empathy with his son’s pain and grief. Later, <b>he remembered</b> that when he rent his garments in his son’s presence <b>he rent</b> them while <b>sitting,</b> and therefore <b>he stood up</b> and <b>rent</b> his garment again while <b>standing.</b>
With regard to this issue, the Gemara reports that <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: From where do we</b> derive that <b>rending</b> must be done while <b>standing?</b> He responded: <b>As it is written</b> about the deaths of Job’s sons: <b>“Then Job arose, and rent his coat”</b> (Job 1:20).

Daf 21a

Rav Ashi challenged him: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> one should be required to stand while performing the ritual through which the brother-in-law frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>], as the verse states: <b>“And if he stands and he says: I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>Here</b> must he <b>also</b> stand for the ceremony? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <i>ḥalitza</i> may be performed <b>whether</b> the man is <b>sitting, or standing, or reclining?</b>
<b>He said to him: There,</b> in the case of <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>it is not written: And he will stand and he will say,</b> which would imply an obligation to stand; whereas <b>here,</b> in the case of rending, <b>it is written: “Then</b> Job <b>arose, and rent</b> his coat” (Job 1:20).
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that rending must be</b> performed while <b>standing? As it is stated: “Then Job arose, and rent</b> his coat” (Job 1:20). The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps he did something extra</b> beyond what is required, and actually there is no obligation to stand; <b>as, if you do not say</b> that he did more than what was required of him, then how do you explain the continuation of the verse: <b>“And he shaved his head”</b> (Job 1:20)? Is every mourner required to act in <b>this</b> manner <b>also</b> and shave his head?
The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> this source must be rejected, and instead the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here,</b> the verse that describes David’s mourning over his son: <b>“Then the king arose, and rent his garments”</b> (II Samuel 13:31). The Gemara asks: But <b>perhaps he</b> too <b>did something extra</b> beyond what is required, and he was not actually obligated to stand; <b>as, if you do not say</b> that he did more than what was required of him, then how do you explain the continuation of the verse: <b>“And he lay on the earth”</b> (II Samuel 13:31)? Is every mourner required to act in <b>this</b> manner <b>also?</b>
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a mourner <b>sat on a bed, on a chair, on a large mortar [<i>udyanei</i>], or on the ground, he does not fulfill his obligation through any of them. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>because he did not fulfill</b> his obligation to <b>overturn his bed,</b> even if he lay on the ground. This indicates that there is no requirement whatsoever to lie on the ground.
Ameimar <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: The verse does not mean that David actually lay on the ground. Rather, it was <b>as if</b> he were <b>on the ground,</b> since he overturned his bed and brought it closer to the ground. If this is the case, then Ameimar acted correctly, and a mourner should rend his garments while standing.
§ <b>The Sages taught: These are the activities that a mourner is prohibited from</b> engaging <b>in: He is prohibited from working, and from bathing, and from anointing</b> himself with oil, <b>and from engaging in sexual relations, and from wearing shoes. And he is prohibited from reading in the Torah, and in the Prophets, and in the Writings, and from studying in the Mishna, in the midrash, and in the <i>halakhot</i>, and in the Talmud, and in the <i>aggadot</i>. But if the public needs him</b> to teach them these things, <b>he need not refrain</b> from doing so. <b>There was an incident that the son of Rabbi Yosei died in Tzippori, and</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>entered the study hall and expounded</b> there <b>for the entire day.</b>
It was related that <b>a calamity,</b> i.e., a death in the family, once <b>befell Rabba bar bar Ḥana,</b> and <b>he thought not to go out to</b> deliver <b>his exposition. Rabbi Ḥanina said to him:</b> Is it not taught that <b>if the public needs him</b> to teach them these things, <b>one need not refrain</b> from doing so? <b>He</b> then <b>thought to place an interpreter alongside him,</b> who would sound his words to the public, as was normally done for such an exposition. <b>Rav said to him: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> similarly: <b>Provided that he does not place the disseminator</b> alongside him.
The Gemara asks: <b>But how,</b> then, should he <b>act</b> so that he can be heard? The Gemara answers: It is <b>like that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident and the son of Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai died, and</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>entered the study hall. And Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya</b> entered after him and <b>sat by his side.</b> Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai then <b>whispered</b> his lecture <b>to Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya, and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya</b> whispered it <b>to the disseminator, and the disseminator sounded to the public</b> what had been told to him. In this way, it became known that Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai was in mourning.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: For <b>the first three days, a mourner is prohibited from donning phylacteries. From the third</b> day <b>and on, and including the third</b> day, <b>he is permitted to don phylacteries. And if new faces,</b> i.e., people who had not yet come to console him, <b>come, he need not remove</b> them, although these people may falsely conclude that he had also donned phylacteries during the first two days of his mourning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: For the first two days, a mourner is prohibited from donning</b> phylacteries. <b>From the second</b> day, <b>and including the second</b> day, <b>he is permitted to wear</b> phylacteries. <b>But if new faces come in</b> to console him, <b>he must remove</b> his phylacteries.
<b>Rav Mattana said: What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written: “And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8). The plural term “days” implies a minimum of two, and it indicates that the main portion of the mourning period is the first two full days. <b>Rav Eina said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehoshua? As it is written:</b> “And I will make it as the mourning for an only son, <b>and its end as a bitter day”</b> (Amos 8:10), i.e., a single “day.”
The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> for <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, isn’t it written</b> in the Torah: <b>“And the days</b> of weeping and mourning for Moses <b>ended,”</b> thereby implying that this period lasts for two days? The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>Moses was different, because the mourning for him was more intense,</b> and the people mourned for him longer than usual. The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> for <b>Rabbi Eliezer, isn’t it written</b> in the Torah: <b>“And its end as a bitter day”?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have said to you that <b>the main bitterness is</b> only <b>one day,</b> but the severity of the mourning lasts for two days.
<b>Ulla said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer with regard to</b> the <b>removal</b> of phylacteries. A mourner need not remove them when new people come in to console him. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua with regard to the donning</b> of phylacteries, and so a mourner may already don phylacteries on the second day.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars: <b>According</b> to <b>Ulla,</b> who rules in accordance with Rabbi Yehoshua that a mourner may don phylacteries <b>on</b> his second <b>day</b> of mourning, is the mourner required to <b>remove</b> them if new people arrive on that day, <b>or</b> is he <b>not</b> required to <b>remove</b> them?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what <b>Ulla said</b> explicitly: <b>One removes</b> his phylacteries when new people come to console him, <b>and he dons</b> them again when they leave, <b>even</b> if he must don and remove them <b>a hundred times. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yehuda ben Teima says: He removes</b> his phylacteries <b>and dons</b> them again, <b>even</b> if he must do so <b>a hundred times.</b>
<b>Rava said: Once he dons</b> his phylacteries, <b>he does not remove</b> them <b>again.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it Rava</b> himself who <b>said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, who <b>said</b> that the most serious period of mourning is <b>three</b> days? How then does he rule in accordance with the <i>baraita</i> that a mourner may don phylacteries during these days?

Daf 21b

The Gemara answers: <b>A mitzva is different,</b> and since it is a mitzva to put on phylacteries, the mourner is required to do so, even during the first three days.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>During the first three days</b> after his bereavement, <b>a mourner is prohibited from working, even if he is a poor person who is supported by charity. From this</b> point <b>forward, he may do</b> work <b>privately in his</b> own <b>home</b> if he needs to do so. <b>And</b> similarly <b>a woman may spin</b> thread <b>on a spindle in her</b> own <b>home</b> when she is mourning.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>A mourner during the first three days</b> after his bereavement <b>may not go to</b> another <b>mourner’s house</b> to console him. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, he may go, but he may not sit among the consolers, but rather in the place of those being consoled,</b> i.e., with the mourners in that house.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in yet another <i>baraita</i>: <b>A mourner, during the first three days</b> after his bereavement, <b>is prohibited from extending greetings</b> to others. <b>From the third</b> day <b>to the seventh</b> day, <b>he may respond</b> when other people address him, <b>but he may not extend greetings</b> to them. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, he may extend greetings and respond in his</b> usual <b>manner.</b>
The Gemara asks: Is he really <b>prohibited</b> from extending <b>greetings during the first three</b> days of mourning? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident and the sons of Rabbi Akiva died, and all the Jews entered to eulogize them with a great eulogy.</b>
<b>When they were about to take leave, Rabbi Akiva stood on a large bench and said: Our brothers, the house of Israel, listen! Even had my two sons been bridegrooms, I would have been consoled on account of the honor you have shown</b> them. <b>If you came</b> to console <b>for the sake of Akiva, there are many Akivas in the marketplace</b> whom the Jews do all not come to console. <b>Rather,</b> certainly <b>this is what you said</b> to yourselves: <b>“The Torah of his God is in his heart”</b> (Psalms 37:31), and you wished to show your respect for the Torah. <b>All the more so is your reward doubled,</b> for you have consoled mourners and shown respect for the Torah. <b>Return</b> now <b>to your homes in peace.</b> This indicates that a mourner may greet other people even on the first day of his mourning.
The Gemara answers: Showing <b>respect for the public is different.</b> Rabbi Akiva was permitted to greet them to demonstrate courtesy and respect.
§ It was taught in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the third</b> day <b>to the seventh</b> day, <b>he may respond</b> when other people address him, <b>but he may not extend greetings</b> to them. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, he may extend greetings and respond in his</b> usual <b>manner.</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>One who finds another in mourning during the</b> first <b>thirty days</b> of that person’s bereavement <b>may</b> still <b>speak words of consolation to him, but he should not extend greetings toward him.</b> If he finds him <b>after thirty days, he may extend greetings toward him, but he should not speak words of consolation to him,</b> so as not to remind him of his pain.
If it was the mourner’s <b>wife</b> who <b>died and he married another woman</b> within thirty days of his first wife’s death, <b>one may not enter his house to speak words of consolation with him,</b> so as not to offend his new wife. If, however, <b>he finds him</b> alone <b>in the marketplace, he may speak to him with gentle words and in a serious manner.</b> This indicates that the prohibition against extending greetings lasts for thirty days and not just seven.
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin said:</b> The two <i>baraitot</i> refer to different situations: The first <i>baraita</i> is referring to the mourner <b>himself, who may extend greetings [<i>shalom</i>] to others</b> after the completion of his seven days of mourning, <b>as the others are at peace [<i>shalom</i>].</b> The second <i>baraita</i>, which speaks of a prohibition that lasts thirty days, is referring to <b>other people, who may not extend greetings to him, as he,</b> the mourner, <b>is not at peace.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that after the third day of his bereavement, the mourner may <b>respond</b> when other people address him, <b>by inference</b> others <b>may extend greetings to him.</b> The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case where people <b>did not know</b> that he was in mourning and unknowingly extended greetings to him.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the <i>baraita</i> speaks of a case where the people who greeted him were unaware that he was in mourning, then <b>there also,</b> during the first three days of his bereavement, he should be permitted to respond when other people address him. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> during the first three days, <b>he must inform them</b> that he is in mourning <b>and not respond</b> to their greetings. <b>Here,</b> after the first three days, <b>he need not inform them</b> about his bereavement, but rather he may respond to their greetings.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>One who finds another in mourning during</b> his <b>twelve months</b> of bereavement <b>may</b> still <b>speak words of consolation to him, but he should not extend greetings toward him.</b> If he finds him <b>after twelve months, he may extend greetings toward him, and he should not speak words of consolation to him. He may, however, speak to him indirectly,</b> i.e., he may say to him: May you be consoled, without mentioning the name of the deceased.
<b>Rabbi Meir said: One who finds another in mourning after twelve months and speaks to him words of consolation, to what may</b> this situation <b>be likened? To a person who broke his leg and it healed,</b> and afterward a physician <b>found him and said to him: Come to me, for I will break it</b> a second time <b>and</b> then <b>I will heal it, so that you may know how good my medicines are</b> and how well they work. One who consoles his friend after so much time has passed acts in a similar fashion, stirring up an old wound and then trying to heal it. In any event, it appears that one must not extend greetings to a mourner during the entire twelve-month mourning period.
The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that one must not extend greetings to a mourner for twelve months, is referring to one who lost <b>his father or mother. That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that a mourner may be greeted after seven days, is referring to one who is in mourning over <b>other relatives.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> in the case of other relatives after thirty days, <b>let him speak words of consolation to him indirectly.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> say that after thirty days he should not speak words of consolation to him at all? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so. And what</b> is meant by the words: <b>He should not speak words of consolation to him?</b> This means that he may not console him <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner, but he may speak to him indirectly.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a mourner comes</b> to the house of mourning <b>from a nearby place during the first three days</b> of mourning, <b>he counts</b> his days of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners from the time of the burial and completes his mourning with them. This is the case even if he may end up observing mourning for only five or six days. But if <b>he came from a distant place, he counts on his own</b> seven complete days from the time that he was informed of his relative’s death. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., after the first three days of mourning, <b>even if he came from a nearby place, he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own. Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if <b>he came on the seventh day from a nearby place, he counts</b> and completes the seven-day period of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners.
<b>The Master said,</b> citing the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a mourner comes</b> to the house of mourning <b>from a nearby place during the first three days</b> of mourning, <b>he counts</b> his days of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners and completes his mourning with them. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is</b> in a case <b>where the principal</b> member <b>of the household is in the house,</b> and therefore all the other family members follow his mourning. If, however, it is the principal member of the family who comes home, he certainly does not follow the other members, but rather he counts seven days on his own.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars:

Daf 22a

If <b>the principal</b> member <b>of the household went</b> with the remains of the deceased <b>to the cemetery</b> and did not return for several days, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If another mourner came to the house of mourning during his absence, does he follow the principal member of the household and count from the time of the burial, or does he count from the time that the funeral procession departed, like the other members of the household?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if the <b>principal</b> member <b>of the household went to the cemetery,</b> the mourner who comes home during his absence <b>counts with them,</b> i.e., the other members of the household who did not go to the cemetery. The Gemara asks: Does <b>he</b> really <b>count</b> and complete his mourning <b>with them? But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>, that <b>he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> statement, that he counts with them, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the principal member of the household <b>came</b> home <b>within three</b> days. <b>And the other</b> ruling, that he counts on his own, is referring to a case <b>where he did not come</b> home <b>within three</b> days. This conclusion is <b>similar to</b> what <b>Rav said to the sons of Hatzleponi</b> when they were in mourning: <b>Those who come</b> home <b>within three</b> days <b>should count with you;</b> whereas <b>those who do not come</b> home <b>within three</b> days <b>should count on their own.</b>
<b>Rava said to the people of Meḥoza:</b> Those of <b>you who do not follow the coffin</b> all the way to the place of interment <b>should begin counting</b> your days of mourning <b>from when you turn your faces from the city gates</b> to return home. Since the dead were commonly transported long distances and buried far away, most of the mourners did not accompany their deceased relatives to the actual site of burial.
§ The Gemara cites the <i>baraita</i> taught above: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if one of the mourners <b>came on the seventh day from a nearby place, he counts with</b> the other mourners and completes the seven-day period of mourning with them. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said that Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: And this is</b> the <i>halakha</i>, provided that <b>he came and found consolers</b> still present <b>in the house.</b>
§ <b>Rav Anan asks:</b> If the consolers <b>had</b> already <b>stirred</b> themselves <b>to stand up</b> and leave but <b>did not</b> yet actually <b>stand up</b> and leave, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered as if the consolers have already left or not? This question was not answered, and the dilemma <b>stands</b> unresolved.
The Gemara relates that <b>a colleague of Rabbi Abba bar Ḥiyya learned</b> the following principle as a tradition <b>from Rabbi Abba.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And who was</b> this colleague? It was <b>Rabbi Zeira. And some say</b> a different version of this tradition: <b>A colleague of Rabbi Zeira</b> learned a tradition <b>from Rabbi Zeira.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And who is</b> this colleague? It was <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> an animal that is unsuitable for human consumption because of severe organic disease or congenital defect, making it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>mourning.</b>
The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning, concerning that which we</b> just <b>said</b> about a mourner who arrives on the seventh day. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> defects in animals that render them <b><i>tereifa</i></b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the animal’s <b>intestines became perforated, but</b> the hole <b>was stopped up by mucus,</b> so that nothing comes out of this hole, the animal is <b>fit.</b> Unlike an ordinary hole in the intestines, this hole does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and make it unfit for consumption. This is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b>mucus? Rav Kahana said: The fat [<i>shirka</i>] of the intestines that comes out under pressure. Someone</b> whose name was not given <b>said: May I merit to go up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and learn this <i>halakha</i> from the mouth of its author.</b>
<b>When he went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba,</b> and <b>said to him: Did the Master say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> defects that render the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? He said to him: I said</b> just the opposite, namely, that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not</b> in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and therefore such a hole in the animal’s intestine makes it unfit for eating.
He asked him again: <b>What</b> about the other ruling reported in your name, that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning?</b> Is this accurate? <b>He said to him:</b> This issue is <b>subject to dispute, as it was stated: Rav Ḥisda said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>and similarly Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is the <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> But <b>Rav Naḥman said: It is not the <i>halakha</i>.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> the aforementioned issue of <b><i>tereifa</i>, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning, as Shmuel stated</b> a principle: <b>The <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>
§ It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, it <b>is praiseworthy</b> for <b>one</b> to be <b>quick</b> in taking <b>the bier</b> out for burial. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>one’s father or mother,</b> acting in this manner <b>is condemnable,</b> as one should draw out the period of acute mourning for his parent. If, however, <b>it was Friday or the eve of a Festival,</b> then <b>one is praiseworthy</b> for expediting his parent’s burial because <b>he does this only out of respect for his father or mother,</b> as he does not want them to remain unburied for the duration of Shabbat or the Festival.
<b>With regard to all</b> other <b>dead,</b> if the mourner <b>wishes</b> he may <b>reduce his business</b> due to mourning. If, however, <b>he wishes</b> not to do so, he <b>need not</b>

Daf 22b

<b>reduce</b> it. <b>In</b> the case of <b>his father or mother,</b> he must always <b>reduce</b> his business.
<b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, if the mourner <b>wishes, he may remove</b> his garment from one of his shoulders, and if <b>he wishes</b> not to remove it, <b>he need not remove</b> it. However, <b>in</b> the case of <b>his father or mother, he</b> must always <b>remove</b> his garment from one of his shoulders.
There was <b>an incident when the father of a leading authority of</b> his <b>generation died, and</b> the authority <b>wished to remove</b> his garment from one shoulder. <b>Another leading authority of the generation</b> also <b>wished to remove</b> his own garment together <b>with him,</b> in order to join him in his mourning, <b>but</b> due to this the first person <b>refrained and did not remove</b> his garment, so that his colleague would not remove his garment as well.
<b>Abaye said: The leading authority of the generation</b> mentioned here is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and <b>the leading authority of the generation</b> who was <b>with him</b> was <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa. And some say: The leading authority of the generation</b> was <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa,</b> and <b>the leading authority of the generation</b> who was <b>with him</b> was <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara examines this issue: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>the leading authority of the generation</b> who was <b>with him was Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>this is</b> the reason that <b>he refrained and did not remove</b> his garment from his shoulder. That is to say, Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa refrained from doing so because he did not wish to cause the <i>Nasi</i> to remove his own garment.
<b>But according to the one who said</b> that it is <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa</b> who was the leader of the generation with him, <b>why did</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>refrain and not remove</b> his garment from his shoulder? <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> the father of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, was also <b>the <i>Nasi</i>, and everyone is required to remove</b> his garment from his shoulder for him, as was the accepted practice. Therefore, Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa would also have been required to bare his shoulder. Why, then, did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prevent him from doing so? The Gemara concludes: Indeed <b>this</b> is <b>difficult.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all deceased</b> relatives except for parents, <b>one may cut his hair after thirty days. In</b> the case of <b>one’s father or mother,</b> one may not cut his hair <b>until his colleagues have rebuked him</b> for his hair being too long. <b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, <b>he may enter a place</b> where <b>a joyous</b> celebration is taking place <b>after thirty days; in</b> the case of <b>his father or mother,</b> he may enter such a place only <b>after twelve months.</b>
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said:</b> The ruling that a mourner may enter a house of joy after thirty days applies specifically <b>to a joyous social gathering,</b> that is to say, to the joyous meals that a group of friends would eat together, each taking a turn hosting. But this ruling does not apply to a large joyous occasion, such as a wedding feast. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> which adds: <b>And</b> also <b>for joyous social gatherings, thirty days.</b> This implies that when the <i>baraita</i> speaks of joyous celebrations without further specification, it is not referring to joyous social gatherings, but even to weddings and other joyous occasions. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>it</b> is <b>difficult.</b>
<b>Ameimar taught</b> the previous discussion <b>as follows: Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> an alternative version of the discussion: <b>For a joyous social gathering one is permitted to enter immediately.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For joyous celebrations and for joyous social gatherings,</b> one must wait <b>thirty</b> days?
The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> ruling, of the <i>baraita</i>, is referring <b>to an initial</b> gathering, when the mourner is the first in the group of friends to host. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that in such a situation the mourner is required to wait thirty days before doing so. <b>That</b> ruling, of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, is referring <b>to a reciprocal</b> gathering. The mourner’s friends have already hosted these gatherings, and now it is his turn to host. Since he is required to host such a gathering for his colleagues, he need not postpone it. Rather, he may host the group immediately.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, <b>one rends</b> his garment the length <b>of a handbreadth,</b> and that suffices. <b>In</b> the case of <b>his father or mother,</b> he must rend his garment <b>until he reveals his heart. Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the verse</b> that teaches that the rent must be a handbreadth? <b>“And David took hold of his clothes and rent them”</b> (II Samuel 1:11), <b>and taking hold cannot</b> be done for a garment <b>less than a handbreadth.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> teaches further: <b>With regard to all</b> other deceased relatives, <b>even if he is wearing ten garments,</b> one on top of the other, <b>he rends only</b> his <b>outer</b> garment. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>his father or mother, he must rend them all.</b> Failure to rend <b>his undergarment,</b> however, <b>does not invalidate</b> the fulfillment of the mitzva.
<b>Both a man and a woman</b> are required to rend their garments. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A woman</b> first <b>rends</b> her <b>inner</b> garment <b>and turns</b> it <b>around,</b> so that the tear is <b>on her back. And</b> only <b>afterward</b> does <b>she rend</b> her <b>outer</b> garment, so that she does not expose her chest.
<b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, if <b>one wishes he may rip apart</b> his garment <b>on the hem,</b> rather than merely expanding the neck hole, so that the tear stands out distinctly from the opening of the garment. If he <b>wishes</b> not to do this, <b>he does not rip apart</b> the hem in this manner. That is to say, one may simply enlarge the neck hole, although rending a garment in this way makes the tear less prominent. <b>In</b> the case of <b>one’s father or mother,</b> however, <b>he must</b> always <b>rip apart</b> the hem.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Any rending that does not rip apart</b> his garment <b>on the hem</b> of the garment <b>is nothing other than a frivolous rent</b> of no significance, as it must be evident that one has rent his garment in mourning and that the rent is not merely an imperfection in the garment. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “And he took hold of his own clothes and he rent them in two pieces”</b> (II Kings 2:12). <b>From that which is stated: “And he rent,” do I not know that</b> he rent them <b>in two? Rather,</b> these words teach <b>that</b> the rent clothes must <b>appear as if they were torn into two</b> pieces, i.e., the tear must be obvious and visible.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, <b>one may tack</b> the tear with rough stitches <b>after seven days, and one may join</b> the edges more carefully <b>after thirty</b> days. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>one’s father or mother, he may tack</b> the tear only <b>after thirty days, and he may never</b> again <b>join</b> the edges more carefully. <b>A woman,</b> however, <b>may tack</b> the tear <b>immediately, due to her honor,</b> for it would be dishonorable for her to be seen with torn garments.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, <b>if one wishes, he may rend</b> his garment <b>with</b> his <b>hand;</b> and if <b>he wishes, he may rend</b> it <b>with a utensil</b> in a way that will preserve it. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>his father or mother,</b> he must rend his garment <b>with his hand</b> in a manner that will utterly ruin it.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, one rends his garment <b>on the inside,</b> meaning, he rends his inner garment and not necessarily his outermost garment. <b>In</b> the case of <b>one’s father or mother,</b> however, <b>he must rend</b> the garment <b>on the outside,</b> i.e., the outermost garment. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: And likewise, over a <i>Nasi</i>,</b> one is required to rend his garment as he does over his father.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> in which it was taught: The <i>halakhot</i> of rending for the death of other people referred to in the <i>baraita</i>, e.g., a <i>Nasi</i>, a president of the court, or one’s teacher, <b>were likened to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of rending for <b>one’s father or mother only with regard to</b> the issue of carefully <b>rejoining</b> the edges of the rent, as in all of these cases it is prohibited to mend one’s garment with precise stitches.
<b>What, is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> also referring <b>even</b> to one who rends his garment <b>for the <i>Nasi</i>?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the other people, <b>aside</b> from one who rends his garment for the <i>Nasi</i>, as rending for the <i>Nasi</i> is the same as rending for one’s father with regard to all aspects of the rending.
It was related that the <b><i>Nasi</i> died,</b> and <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Ḥanan bar Rava: Turn the mortar over and stand on it, and show</b> the <b>rent to everyone.</b> Everyone will then rend his garment in this manner, as everyone is required to rend his garment over the death of the <i>Nasi</i>.
§ It was further taught: <b>For</b> mourning <b>a Sage, one removes</b> his garment <b>from the right</b> shoulder. <b>For</b> the <b>president of the court</b> he removes his garment <b>from the left</b> shoulder. <b>For</b> the <b><i>Nasi</i></b> he removes his garment <b>from here and from here,</b> from both shoulders.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a Sage dies, his study hall ceases</b> its regular study as a sign of mourning over him. When <b>the president of the court dies, all of the study halls in his city cease</b> their regular study, and everyone <b>enters the synagogue and changes their places</b> there as a sign of mourning over him. <b>Those who</b> ordinarily <b>sit in the north</b> should <b>sit in the south, and those who</b> ordinarily <b>sit in the south</b> should <b>sit in the north.</b> When <b>a <i>Nasi</i> dies, all study halls cease</b> their regular study. On Shabbat, <b>the members of the synagogue enter the synagogue</b> for public Torah reading, which requires a congregation of ten,

Daf 23a

<b>and seven</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>And</b> then <b>they leave</b> and pray on their own. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> It is <b>not that they stroll</b> afterward <b>in the marketplace,</b> but <b>rather they sit</b> at home <b>in silent</b> mourning.
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>one may not speak</b> about <b><i>halakha</i> or <i>aggada</i> in a house of mourning,</b> as this is an activity that brings people joy. <b>It was said of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel that he would speak about <i>halakha</i> and <i>aggada</i> in a house of mourning.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: During the <b>first week</b> after his bereavement, <b>the mourner may not go out of the opening of his house.</b> During the <b>second</b> week, <b>he may go out, but he may not sit in his</b> usual <b>place</b> in the synagogue. During the <b>third</b> week, <b>he may sit in his</b> usual <b>place but he may not speak.</b> During the <b>fourth</b> week, <b>he is like any</b> other <b>person.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They did not need to say</b> that <b>during the first week</b> the mourner <b>may not go out of the opening of his house.</b> This teaches us nothing new, <b>as</b> at that time <b>everyone goes into his house to console him. Rather,</b> during the <b>second</b> week, he may <b>not go out of the opening of his house.</b> During the <b>third</b> week, <b>he may go out, but he may not sit in his</b> usual <b>place</b> in the synagogue. During the <b>fourth</b> week, <b>he may sit in his</b> usual <b>place, but he may not speak.</b> During the <b>fifth</b> week, <b>he is like any</b> other <b>person.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> another <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the entire thirty-day</b> period of mourning, it is prohibited <b>to marry.</b> If <b>one’s wife died, it is prohibited to marry another wife until three Festivals pass</b> since her death. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Until the <b>first and second</b> Festivals have passed, <b>he is prohibited</b> from marrying; before the <b>third</b> Festival, however, he is <b>permitted</b> to do so.
<b>And if he does not have children, he is permitted to marry</b> another wife <b>immediately due to</b> the need to not <b>neglect</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b> Since he has not yet fulfilled the mitzva of procreation, he is still required to marry a wife. Any delay might result in a lost opportunity for marriage. Similarly, if his wife died and <b>left him young children, he is permitted to marry</b> another wife <b>immediately, so that</b> she might <b>take care of them.</b>
There was <b>an incident when the wife of Yosef the Priest died, and he said to her sister at the cemetery</b> immediately after the funeral: <b>Go and care for your sister’s children.</b> In other words, he alluded that he wished to marry her immediately. <b>But even though</b> he married her immediately, <b>he did not engage in sexual relations with her for a long time</b> afterward. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>A long time? Rav Pappa said: After thirty days.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> yet another <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the entire thirty-day</b> period of mourning, it is prohibited <b>to</b> wear <b>ironed</b> garments, <b>whether they are new garments or old garments taken out of the press,</b> as ironed garments appear to be new. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi disagrees and <b>says:</b> The Sages <b>prohibited</b> wearing <b>only new garments. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: They prohibited</b> wearing <b>only new white garments.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye went out</b> while he was in mourning <b>in an old white garment, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rava,</b> on the other hand, <b>went out in a new, red Roman cloak,</b> as he acted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</b>
It was taught in the mishna: This is <b>because</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>Shabbat counts</b> as one of the days of mourning, <b>but it does not interrupt</b> the mourning period, which continues after Shabbat. It is stated that with regard to mourning on Shabbat, there is a difference in practice between <b>the residents of Judea and the residents of the Galilee. These say:</b>

Daf 23b

<b>There is</b> some <b>mourning on Shabbat,</b> i.e., with regard to mourning rites that can be observed privately in the mourner’s home and will go unnoticed by other people; <b>whereas those say: There is no mourning on Shabbat</b> at all.
The Gemara explains: <b>The ones who said</b> that <b>there is</b> some <b>mourning on Shabbat</b> rely on <b>that</b> which is <b>taught,</b> that Shabbat <b>counts</b> as one of the days of mourning, implying that some degree of mourning applies on that day. <b>The ones who said</b> that <b>there is no mourning on Shabbat</b> at all base this on <b>that</b> which is <b>taught</b> that Shabbat <b>does not interrupt</b> the mourning period.
The latter argue as follows: <b>If it should enter your mind</b> to say that <b>there is</b> some <b>mourning on Shabbat,</b> there is a difficulty, for <b>now</b> that it has been stated that actual <b>mourning applies</b> on Shabbat, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach us that this day does not <b>interrupt</b> the mourning period? Rather, the conclusion must be that there is no mourning on Shabbat whatsoever.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna that Shabbat <b>counts</b> as one of the days of mourning, implying that it is just like the other days of mourning, and at least some mourning rites are practiced on it? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the mishna <b>wished to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that the days of a Festival <b>do not count</b> toward the requisite days of mourning, <b>it taught</b> also <b>in the first clause</b> that Shabbat <b>counts</b> as one of the days of mourning, although no mourning rites are practiced on it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the ones who said</b> that <b>there is</b> some <b>mourning on Shabbat, isn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in the mishna that <b>it does not interrupt</b> the mourning period, which would have been unnecessary to say if the mourning rites are practiced on it? The Gemara answers: This was not necessary for itself, but <b>due to</b> the fact that the mishna <b>wished to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that the Festivals <b>interrupt</b> the mourning, <b>it taught</b> also <b>in the first clause</b> that Shabbat <b>does not interrupt</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that this is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to whether or not some mourning rites are observed even on Shabbat, for it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One whose deceased</b> relative <b>is laid out before him eats in another room.</b> If <b>he does not have another room, he eats in the house of a friend. If he does not have a friend’s house</b> available, <b>he makes a partition ten handbreadths</b> high between him and the deceased, so that he may eat. If <b>he does not have material with which to make a partition, he averts his face</b> from the dead <b>and eats.</b>
<b>And</b> in any case, <b>he does not recline while he eats,</b> as reclining is characteristic of a festive meal; <b>and he neither eats meat nor drinks wine; and he does not recite a blessing</b> before eating to exempt others from their obligation; <b>and he does not</b> recite the formula to <b>invite</b> the participants in the meal to join together in the Grace after Meals, <b>and they do not recite a blessing over him nor do others invite him</b> to join in the Grace after Meals, as he cannot be a member of the three required to recite the formula. <b>And he is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, and from</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, and from</b> donning <b>phylacteries, and from</b> performing <b>all</b> of <b>the mitzvot mentioned in the Torah.</b>
<b>But on Shabbat he reclines</b> at the meal, as per his custom, <b>and eats; and he eats meat and drinks wine; and he recites blessings</b> to exempt others from their obligation; <b>and</b> he recites the formula to <b>invite</b> the participants in the meal to join together in the Grace after Meals, <b>and others may recite blessings on his behalf and invite</b> him to join in the Grace after Meals. <b>And he is</b> also <b>obligated in the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, and in</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, and in</b> the mitzva of <b>phylacteries, and in all the mitzvot mentioned in the Torah. Rabban Gamliel says: Since he is obligated</b> to fulfill <b>these</b> mitzvot associated with Shabbat, <b>he is obligated</b> to fulfill <b>all</b> of the mitzvot on Shabbat.
Rabban Gamliel’s statement is vague. The following clarifies it: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them,</b> the opinion of the anonymous first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, is with regard to <b>sexual relations.</b> According to Rabban Gamliel, the acute mourner is obligated in the mitzva to engage in marital intercourse with his wife on Shabbat, just as he is obligated in all the other mitzvot.
The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not with regard to this</b> issue that <b>they disagree:</b> Is it not <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the anonymous first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is</b> some <b>mourning on Shabbat</b> with regard to private issues, and therefore the mourner does not engage in sexual relations; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no mourning on Shabbat</b> at all?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>From where</b> do you reach this conclusion? <b>Perhaps the first <i>tanna</i></b> is <b>saying</b> that it is prohibited for the grieving relative to engage in sexual relations in the case dealt with <b>only there, because his deceased</b> relative <b>is laid out before him</b> and has not yet been buried. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the period of mourning, when <b>his dead</b> has been buried and <b>is no</b> longer <b>laid out before him,</b> sexual relations are <b>not</b> prohibited.
<b>And</b> alternatively, perhaps <b>Rabban Gamliel is saying</b> that the grieving relative is permitted to engage in sexual relations <b>only there, where</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>mourning have not</b> yet <b>taken effect,</b> as mourning begins only after the burial. <b>But here, where</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>mourning</b> have already <b>taken effect,</b> he may <b>also</b> prohibit sexual relations.

Daf 24a

<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan asked of Shmuel: Is there</b> some <b>mourning on Shabbat or is there no mourning on Shabbat</b> at all? <b>He said to him: There is no mourning on Shabbat</b> at all.
<b>The Sages sat before Rav Pappa and said in the name of Shmuel: A mourner who engaged in sexual relations during his days of mourning is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty</b> at the hand of Heaven. <b>Rav Pappa said to them: It was said</b> that sexual relations are <b>prohibited,</b> but not that the offender is guilty of a capital crime. <b>And</b> the ruling <b>was said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and not in the name of Shmuel.
<b>And if you heard</b> a statement on this issue <b>in the name of Shmuel,</b> then <b>you heard as follows: Rav Taḥlifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: A mourner who did not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild and did not rend</b> his garments <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated</b> following the deaths of Nadab and Abihu concerning the surviving sons of Aaron: <b>“Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes, that you not die”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). They were instructed not to mourn, so as not to interfere with the dedication of the Tabernacle. From here it may be deduced <b>that</b> any <b>other</b> mourner <b>who did not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild or rend</b> his clothes <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty.</b>
<b>Rafram bar Pappa said:</b> A Sage <b>taught in <i>Evel Rabbati</i>,</b> a separate tractate devoted to the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning: <b>A mourner is prohibited from engaging in sexual relations during his days of mourning.</b> There was <b>an incident with one who engaged in sexual relations during his days of mourning and</b> he was punished, for after his death <b>pigs dragged away his corpse.</b>
<b>Shmuel</b> offered a mnemonic device with regard to the observance of mourning rites on Shabbat, and <b>said: <i>Peh</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>zayin</i> are obligatory.</b> These letters combine to create a mnemonic standing for: Uncovering the head [<i>periat rosh</i>], reversing the torn garment [<i>ḥazarat kera</i>], and standing the bed upright [<i>zekifat hamitta</i>]. However, <b><i>nun</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>reish</i>,</b> which stand for: Wearing shoes [<i>ne’ilat hasandal</i>], marital relations [<i>tashmish hamitta</i>], and hand washing [<i>reḥitzat yadayim</i>], <b>are optional.</b>
This is explained: <b>Uncovering the head,</b> i.e., removing the head covering usually worn by a mourner; <b>reversing the tear to the back,</b> so that it will not be visible; and <b>standing the bed upright</b> in the usual position, so that it is not overturned, are all <b>obligatory</b> for the mourner to uphold in honor of Shabbat. However, <b>wearing shoes, engaging in sexual relations,</b> and <b>washing one’s hands and feet in hot water in the evening are optional</b> activities on Shabbat. If a mourner wishes to refrain from them he may do so. <b>And Rav said: Uncovering the head is also an optional</b> activity.
The Gemara asks: <b>According to Shmuel, what is different about wearing shoes</b> that it is <b>optional?</b> His reasoning presumably is that <b>not everyone wears shoes</b> at all times, and therefore not wearing shoes will not be perceived by others as a sign of mourning. If so, the same thing may be said about <b>uncovering the head also,</b> i.e., <b>not everyone uncovers his head</b> at all times, as some people always walk around with their heads wrapped. This, too, should not be seen as a clear display of mourning, and therefore uncovering one’s head should also be treated as optional.
The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> for <b>Shmuel said: Any rending</b> of garments <b>that is not</b> done <b>at the time of</b> the <b>most intense</b> grief, i.e., the time of death, <b>is not</b> considered proper <b>rending</b> of garments. <b>And any wrapping</b> of the head <b>that is not</b> done <b>in the manner of the wrapping of the Ishmaelites,</b> who wrap their heads on all sides, <b>is not</b> considered proper <b>wrapping.</b> Since Shmuel requires that a mourner wrap his head in this special manner, one who acts in this way on Shabbat openly displays his mourning, as people do not ordinarily wrap their heads in this manner. What is this wrapping? <b>Rav Naḥman demonstrated</b> the procedure by covering up his face to the <b>sides of the beard,</b> leaving only the center of his face exposed.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught</b> that a mourner is required to remove his head covering on Shabbat <b>only when he has no shoes on his feet,</b> so that he not appear too obviously to be in mourning. <b>But if he has shoes on his feet,</b> then <b>his shoes prove</b> that <b>he</b> is not observing the rites of mourning on Shabbat.
The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s statement that <b>any rending</b> of garments <b>that is not</b> done <b>at the time of most intense</b> grief and pain <b>is not</b> considered proper <b>rending</b> of garments. The Gemara poses a question: <b>But</b> when <b>they said to Shmuel</b> that <b>Rav had passed away, he rent twelve garments on account of him, and said: The man of whom I was in fear,</b> owing to his great learning, <b>has gone</b> and died. Similarly, when <b>they told Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina had passed away, he rent thirteen</b> expensive <b>wool [<i>mileta</i>] garments [<i>itztelei</i>] on account of him, and said: The man of whom I was in fear has gone.</b> When each of these Sages received the news that their distinguished colleague had died, it was no longer the time of the most intense grief, i.e., the time of death, and yet they rent their garments.
The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages are different. Since their teachings are mentioned all the time,</b> every time they are mentioned <b>is like the time of most intense</b> grief, as the pain over their death is once again renewed.
<b>Ravin bar Adda said to Rava: Your student, Rav Amram, said</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> as follows: For <b>all seven days</b> of mourning, <b>a mourner</b> must keep <b>the tear</b> in his garment <b>before him</b> so that it will be seen. <b>And if he comes to change</b> clothing, <b>he changes and rends</b> the new garment. <b>On Shabbat,</b> he turns <b>the tear to his back, and if he comes to change</b> clothing, <b>he changes but does not tear</b> the second garment. From here it seems that there is an obligation to rend garments during the entire week of mourning, not only at the most intense moment of grief.
The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring to the specific case of rending one’s garment <b>in honor of his father or mother.</b> Owing to the special honor due to one’s parents, it is inappropriate for the child to wear a garment that is not torn. Consequently, if he changes clothing, he must tear the new garment, even if it is no longer the most intense time of grief.
The Gemara asks: <b>Those</b> additional <b>tears</b> that are made in honor of one’s father or mother, <b>may they be</b> properly <b>mended</b> at the end of the son’s period of mourning, <b>or may they not be</b> properly <b>mended,</b> like the tear made for one’s father or mother at the most intense moment of grief? The Gemara answers: <b>They disagree about</b> this issue, <b>the father of Rav Oshaya and bar Kappara. One said: They may not be mended, and one said: They may be mended.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude that</b> it was <b>Rav Oshaya’s father</b> who <b>said</b> that such rents <b>may not be</b> properly <b>mended, for Rav Oshaya said:</b> Such rents <b>may not be</b> properly <b>mended. From whom did he hear</b> this <i>halakha</i>? Was it <b>not from his father?</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this cannot be offered as a proof, as perhaps <b>he heard it from bar Kappara,</b> who was <b>his teacher.</b>
§ <b>Rava said: A mourner may walk about his house in</b> a torn <b>robe [<i>unkali</i>]</b> on Shabbat, since he is not doing so in public. It was related that <b>Abaye found Rav Yosef walking back and forth in his house</b> on Shabbat when he was in mourning <b>with a scarf spread over his head</b> in the manner of mourning. <b>He said to him: Master, do you not maintain</b> that <b>there is no mourning on Shabbat? He said to him: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Matters that are in private apply,</b> and so when one is in his house he must observe the rites of mourning even on Shabbat.
§ The mishna taught: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Since the Temple was destroyed, <i>Shavuot</i> is like Shabbat</b> with regard to mourning. Rabban Gamliel says: Even Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur are considered like Festivals. The Gemara comments that <b>Rav Giddel bar Menashya said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel.</b>
<b>And some teach this</b> ruling <b>of Rav Giddel bar Menashya</b> as referring <b>to the following</b> case: It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Within the first <b>thirty days</b> after birth, <b>an infant</b> that dies <b>is taken out</b> for burial <b>in</b> one’s <b>bosom,</b> that is to say, he is carried to his grave in one’s arms, not in a coffin. <b>And he is buried by one woman and two men,</b> there being no need for a quorum of ten men. <b>But</b> he should <b>not</b> be taken out <b>by one man and two women,</b> because it is prohibited for one man to seclude himself with two women.

Daf 24b

<b>Abba Shaul says:</b> The infant may be taken out <b>even by one man and two women,</b> for there is no concern with regard to seclusion in a time of mourning. <b>And for</b> such an infant, people <b>do not stand in a line</b> to offer their condolences to the mourners, as is ordinarily done after a burial; <b>nor do</b> others <b>recite over him the mourners’ blessing,</b> which is recited in the courtyard of the graveyard after the burial; <b>nor</b> is the usual formula for the <b>consolation of mourners</b> recited during the seven days of mourning.
<b>A thirty-day-old</b> infant that dies <b>is taken out</b> for burial <b>in a coffin [<i>deluskema</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda says: Not in</b> a small <b>coffin that is carried on</b> one’s <b>shoulder, but rather</b> in a coffin that is carried <b>in the arms</b> of two people. <b>And for</b> such an infant, people <b>stand in a line</b> to offer their condolences to the mourners. <b>And</b> others <b>recite the mourners’ blessing</b> at the cemetery. <b>And</b> people recite <b>the consolation of mourners</b> during the week of mourning.
<b>A twelve-month-old</b> infant <b>is taken out</b> for burial <b>on a bier,</b> just as an adult is. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies if the infant that dies <b>is one year old and his limbs are like</b> those of <b>a two year old,</b> so that he looks older, or if <b>he is two years old and his limbs are like</b> those of <b>a one-year-old.</b> Only then <b>he is taken out on a bier.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: For one that is taken out on a bier, the public should grieve [<i>matzhivin</i>]. For one that is not taken out on a bier, the public need not grieve. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If the infant was <b>known to the public,</b> because he regularly left the house and many people knew him, <b>the public must occupy themselves with him</b> and participate in his burial. If <b>he was not known to the public, the public need not occupy themselves with him.</b>
<b>And what is the</b> status of deceased infants <b>with regard to eulogy? Rabbi Meir said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> The children of <b>the poor</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of three,</b> whereas the children of <b>the wealthy</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of five.</b> This is because a child is the sole source of joy for the poor, and so the pain and grief of the poor over the death of a child is greater than that of the wealthy. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of</b> Rabbi Yishmael: The children of <b>the poor</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of five,</b> whereas the children of <b>the wealthy</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of six. And the children of the elderly are</b> treated <b>like the children of the poor,</b> for the death of a child is particularly painful for an older person.
<b>Rav Giddel bar Menashya said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who stated it in the name of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
<b>Rabbi Anani bar Sason taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>:</b> If one suffered the loss of a close relative shortly before the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before <i>Shavuot</i> and <i>Shavuot</i></b> itself together count as <b>fourteen</b> days. The day before the Festival counts as seven full days of mourning because the Festival interrupts the seven-day period of mourning, and the Festival itself is counted as a seven-day Festival. Even though it is a one-day Festival, it is counted as seven days because it has the same <i>halakha</i> as the other Festivals. After <i>Shavuot</i>, then, only sixteen days are left to complete the thirty-day mourning period. <b>Rabbi Ami heard</b> this <b>and became angry</b> with him. <b>He said: Is that to say</b> that it is <b>his own</b> opinion? <b>It is</b> the opinion <b>that Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> said.
Similarly <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa taught in the pavilion [<i>kila</i>] of the Exilarch:</b> If one’s relative died shortly before the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before <i>Shavuot</i> and <i>Shavuot</i></b> itself count as <b>fourteen</b> days. <b>Rav Sheshet heard and became angry.</b> He <b>said: Is that to say</b> that it is <b>his own</b> opinion? <b>It is</b> the opinion <b>that Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> said.
In both of these cases, a Sage presented an opinion as their own, without attributing it to the original Sage who stated it, <b>for Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the <i>Shavuot</i></b> offerings <b>have redress all seven</b> subsequent <b>days?</b> That is to say, if someone failed to bring the Festival offering on the Festival itself, he has six more days to bring it. <b>As it is stated:</b> “Three times a year shall all your males appear before the Lord your God in the place that He shall choose; <b>on the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:16). <b>Just as</b> the offerings of <b>the festival of Passover have redress all seven</b> days, as Passover is seven days long, <b>so too</b> the offerings of <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> have redress all seven</b> days, during the week following <i>Shavuot</i>. From this we learn that <i>Shavuot</i> is treated like a seven-day Festival for all halakhic purposes.
<b>Rav Pappa granted permission to Rav Avya the Elder</b> to speak <b>and he taught</b> the following in public: If one’s relative died shortly before Rosh HaShana, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before Rosh HaShana and Rosh HaShana</b> itself together count as <b>fourteen</b> days, because Rosh HaShana is treated like a seven-day Festival. <b>Ravina said: Therefore,</b> if one’s relative died shortly before <i>Sukkot</i>, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before the Festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>and the Festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> itself, which is seven days, <b>and its Eighth</b> day of Assembly, which is considered to be a separate Festival, count as <b>twenty-one</b> days, and he must observe only nine more days of mourning to complete the thirty-day period of mourning.
It was related that <b>Ravina happened</b> to come <b>to</b> the city of <b>Sura on the Euphrates</b> River. <b>Rav Ḥaviva from Sura on the Euphrates said to Ravina:</b> Did the <b>Master say</b> that <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before Rosh HaShana and Rosh HaShana</b> itself count <b>as fourteen</b> days? <b>He said to him: I said that it stands to reason</b> that this is so <b>according to Rabban Gamliel,</b> who maintains that Rosh HaShana is treated like a pilgrim Festival. But I did not rule in accordance with this opinion.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Mourners <b>do not rend</b> their garments during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>and do not remove</b> their garments from their shoulders. <b>And</b> others <b>do not provide them with a meal [<i>mavrin</i>]</b> after the burial, <b>except for close relatives of the deceased. And</b> the consolers <b>provide the</b> first <b>meal</b> after the burial <b>only</b> while the mourner is sitting <b>on an upright bed,</b> and not on one that is overturned.

Daf 25a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that only the relatives of the deceased rend their clothes. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this the case <b>even</b> if the deceased was a Torah <b>Sage? But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: When a Torah <b>scholar dies, everyone is his relative.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> to say that <b>everyone is his relative? Rather,</b> this <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>Everyone is</b> considered to be <b>like his relative</b> in the sense that <b>everyone rends his</b> garment in anguish <b>over him, and everyone bares</b> his shoulder <b>over him</b> in mourning, <b>and everyone eats the mourner’s meal over him in the public square</b> as mourners do. The death of a Torah scholar is a personal loss for every Jew. So why is the mishna limited to only relatives? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the deceased <b>is not a</b> Torah <b>scholar.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> the deceased <b>was an upright person</b> who feared Heaven and performed good deeds, then aren’t all those present at his death <b>obligated to rend</b> their garments over his death? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what</b> reason <b>do a person’s sons and daughters die when they are young?</b> They die <b>so that he will cry and mourn</b> over the death of <b>an upright person.</b>
The Gemara questions the formulation: They die so that <b>he will cry and mourn? Is security,</b> i.e., his children, <b>taken from him</b> in advance to ensure that in the future he will mourn over the death of an upright person? <b>Rather</b> the <i>baraita</i> means as follows: His children died <b>because he did not cry or mourn over an upright person</b> who died. <b>As</b> with regard to <b>anyone who cries and mourns over an upright person</b> who died, <b>they forgive him</b> for <b>all his transgressions because of the honor he accorded</b> to the deceased. If this is the case, one also rends his clothes over an upright person. The Gemara answers: Rather, the mishna is referring only to one <b>who</b> was <b>not an upright person.</b>
The Gemara challenges: But <b>if one was standing there at the time of the soul’s departure,</b> i.e., at the time of death, he <b>is</b> also <b>obligated</b> to rend his clothes. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One who stands over the deceased at the time of the soul’s departure is obligated to rend</b> his clothes. <b>To what may this be likened? To a Torah scroll that is burned,</b> for which anyone present <b>is obligated to rend</b> his clothes.
The Gemara answers: The mishna must be referring to a person <b>who was not standing there at the time of the soul’s departure</b> but who heard that someone who is not a close relative died, and the deceased was neither a Torah scholar nor an upright person.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Safra passed away the</b> other <b>Sages did not rend</b> their garments <b>over him. They said: We did not learn from him,</b> as he did not disseminate his Torah knowledge to the public. <b>Abaye</b> berated them and <b>said to them: Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If one’s <b>teacher died? It is taught:</b> If a Torah <b>scholar died,</b> and Rav Safra was certainly a Torah scholar. <b>And furthermore, every day his teachings are in our mouths in the study hall,</b> so that even if we did not learn directly from him, we should still be considered his students.
The other Sages <b>thought that what was</b> done <b>was</b> done, and it was now too late for them to rend their garments. <b>Abaye said to them: We learned:</b> With regard to a Torah <b>scholar, as long as they are engaged in eulogizing</b> him, then people <b>are obligated to rend</b> their garments, even after the time of his death. <b>They</b> then <b>thought to rend</b> their garments <b>immediately. Abaye said to them: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A</b> Torah <b>scholar’s honor is at</b> the time of <b>his eulogy,</b> and so you should wait until the time of the eulogy before rending your garments.
§ The Gemara relates another incident: <b>When Rav Huna died they thought to place a Torah scroll on his bier,</b> as was commonly done after the death of a Torah scholar, as if to say that the deceased fulfilled everything written in the scroll. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to them:</b> This is <b>a practice that he did not hold with during his lifetime; now should we stand up and do</b> it <b>for him</b> when he is dead? <b>As Rav Taḥlifa said: I</b> myself <b>saw Rav Huna, who wished to sit on his bed, and there was a Torah scroll placed on it. And he turned a jug over and placed the Torah scroll on it</b> so that he could then sit on the bed. <b>Apparently he holds</b> that <b>it is prohibited to sit on a bed upon which a Torah scroll lies.</b> Therefore, it would be inappropriate to lay a Torah scroll next to his body after he died.
When they tried to remove his corpse from his house for the burial, <b>the bier would not</b> fit <b>through the</b> narrow <b>door. They</b> then <b>thought to lower</b> the bier <b>from the roof. Rav Ḥisda said to them: This I learned from him,</b> Rav Huna himself: <b>A scholar’s honor</b> is for him to be taken out <b>through the</b> main <b>opening,</b> and not in any other manner.
<b>They</b> then <b>thought to move him from</b> his <b>bier to</b> a narrower <b>bier</b> so that it would fit through the door. But <b>Rav Ḥisda said to them: I learned from him,</b> Rav Huna himself, <b>as follows: A scholar’s honor is</b> for him to be taken out <b>on the first bier. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a scholar’s honor is</b> for him to be taken out <b>on the first bier? As it is stated: “And they set the Ark of God upon a new cart”</b> (II Samuel 6:3). When taking the Ark to Jerusalem, King David had it placed back on the cart upon which it had been returned by the Philistines, and a Torah scholar is considered to be similar to the Ark of the Covenant. When they saw that there was nothing else that they could do, <b>they broke the doorway and took him out</b> through it.
<b>Rabbi Abba opened</b> his eulogy for <b>him: Our Rabbi was worthy that the Divine Presence should rest upon him, except</b> for the fact <b>that Babylonia caused it</b> not to rest. In other words, it was only because he lived in Babylonia and not in Eretz Yisrael that the Divine Presence did not rest upon him.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Ḥisda raised an objection</b> against this, <b>and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ḥisda:</b> Is it not stated: <b>“The word of the Lord came [<i>hayo haya</i>] to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans”</b> (Ezekiel 1:3), thereby implying that a prophet can prophesy outside of Eretz Yisrael?
<b>His father tapped him with his sandal</b> on his foot, thereby hinting to him that he should be quiet. <b>He said to him: Have I not told you not to trouble everyone</b> with questions in the middle of a eulogy? The Gemara answers the question: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the doubling of the word <b>“came [<i>hayo haya</i>]”?</b> It implies <b>that it had already come</b> before, i.e., that Ezekiel had already begun to prophesy in Eretz Yisrael, and his prophecy in Babylonia was merely a continuation of that prophecy.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>when they took</b> Rav Huna <b>there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, for burial <b>they said to Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi: Rav Huna has come,</b> and they misunderstood and thought that he was still alive. <b>They said: When we were there,</b> in Babylonia, we <b>did not have strength to lift our heads before him. Now</b> that <b>we have come here, has he come after us?</b>
<b>They said to them: His coffin has come. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi went out</b> to meet his funeral procession. <b>Rabbi Ila and Rabbi Ḥanina did not go out. Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ila went out,</b> but <b>Rabbi Ḥanina did not go out.</b>
The Gemara asks: Those who <b>went out, what is</b> the <b>reason</b> that they went? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a coffin is passing from place to place,</b> the people <b>stand in a line</b> to show respect <b>for</b> the deceased, <b>and they recite the mourners’ blessing and the consolation of the mourners over it.</b> Those <b>who did not go out, what is the reason</b> that they did not? <b>As it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: When a <b>coffin is passing from place to place, they do not stand in a line</b> to show respect <b>for</b> the deceased, <b>and they do not recite the mourners’ blessing or</b> the <b>consolation of the mourners for him.</b>
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>these</b> two tannaitic statements <b>contradict each other.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is not difficult: Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the skeleton</b> of the deceased <b>is</b> still <b>intact,</b> and the mourning practices must be observed. <b>And there</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the skeleton</b> of the deceased <b>is no longer intact,</b> and it is not necessary to observe the customs of mourning. <b>And Rav Huna’s skeleton was</b> still <b>intact.</b> The reason that the <b>one</b> Sage <b>did not go out</b> was that <b>they did not confirm for him</b> that the skeleton was still intact.
The Sages of Eretz Yisrael <b>said: Where shall we bury him?</b> They concluded: <b>Rav Huna disseminated Torah to</b> the people of <b>Israel, and</b> similarly <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya disseminated Torah to</b> the people of <b>Israel;</b> therefore, it is appropriate to bury Rav Huna next to Rabbi Ḥiyya.
They asked: <b>Who will take him in</b> to Rabbi Ḥiyya’s burial cave, as few are fit to enter it? <b>Rav Ḥagga said to them: I will take him into</b> the cave, <b>for I presented my studies</b> before him <b>when I was</b> just <b>eighteen, never having experienced a seminal emission. And</b> so too <b>I attended to him and knew his</b> great <b>deeds.</b> For example, <b>one day one of the straps of his phylacteries turned around,</b> the unpainted side being turned outward, <b>and he observed forty fasts for this,</b> as he had acted negligently, allowing the black side to face inward.
Rav Ḥagga <b>took him in.</b> The body of Rabbi Ḥiyya’s son <b>Yehuda lay</b> buried <b>to the right of his father, and</b> the body of his other son <b>Ḥizkiyya</b> lay <b>to his left.</b> The spirit of <b>Yehuda said to</b> the spirit of <b>Ḥizkiyya: Rise from your place, as</b> it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to remain lying when the body of <b>Rav Huna is standing here. When</b> Ḥizkiyya’s corpse stood <b>up, a pillar of fire rose with him.</b> When <b>Rabbi Ḥagga saw this, he was frightened</b> by what he saw, and so <b>he stood up</b> Rav Huna’s <b>coffin and went away.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And he was not punished</b> or harmed by this pillar of fire <b>because he set up Rav Huna’s coffin</b> as protection for himself.
§ The Gemara relates another story about the burial of one of the Sages: <b>When Rav Ḥisda died they thought to place a Torah scroll on his bier. Rabbi Yitzḥak said to them:</b> This is <b>a practice that this Rabbi did not hold with during his lifetime; should we stand up and do</b> it <b>for him</b> now that he is dead?
<b>They</b> then <b>thought not to tack,</b> i.e., sew up, <b>the tears</b> that they had made in their clothes. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Ami said to them:</b> When the deceased is <b>a Torah Sage, they may tack</b> the tears <b>once they turn their faces from the bier.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rabba bar Huna and Rav Hamnuna died, they took them</b> both <b>up there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael.

Daf 25b

<b>When they reached a bridge</b> that could be crossed only in single file, <b>the camels</b> carrying the two Sages <b>stood</b> in their places and would not cross the bridge. <b>A certain Arab</b> [<b><i>Tayya’a</i></b>] who witnessed what was happening <b>said to them: What is this</b> phenomenon that the camels have stopped moving? <b>They said to him: The</b> deceased <b>Sages are showing honor to each other.</b> It is as if one <b>Sage is saying: The Master should go</b> and cross the bridge <b>first,</b> while at the same time the other <b>Sage is saying: The Master should go</b> and cross <b>first.</b> The Arab <b>said: By law Rabba bar Huna should go first,</b> since he is the son of a great man, and <b>the camel</b> carrying <b>Rabba bar Huna</b> then <b>passed</b> first. Shortly thereafter, <b>the molars and</b> other <b>teeth of that Arab fell out</b> due to the disrespect he showed Rav Hamnuna.
When they reached Tiberias <b>a certain child opened</b> his eulogy saying as follows: <b>The shoot of an ancient line,</b> i.e., Rabba bar Rav Huna, who was the descendant of great people, <b>has ascended from Babylonia, and with him is the book of wars,</b> i.e., Rav Hamnuna, who was great in Torah, which is referred to as the book of the Wars of the Lord (Numbers 21:14). <b>The</b> curses of the <b>pelican and the bittern,</b> which are symbols of the destruction of the Temple (Isaiah 34:11), <b>have been doubled, to see the ruin and brokenness that has come from Shinar,</b> i.e., Babylonia. The Lord <b>became angry with His world and seized souls from it, and He rejoices over them</b> when they come to Him <b>like a new bride.</b> God <b>who rides upon the clouds is joyous and happy when an innocent and righteous soul comes to Him.</b>
§ The Gemara continues recounting other famous eulogies. <b>When Ravina passed away, a certain eulogizer opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> with the following words: <b>Date-palms, hang your heads</b> in sadness <b>over the righteous man who may be likened to a date-palm. Let us make,</b> our <b>nights like days</b> in weeping, <b>over</b> a man who <b>made</b> his <b>nights like days</b> studying the Torah.
The Gemara relates that prior to Ravina’s death, <b>Rav Ashi said to bar Kippok,</b> who was a famous eulogizer: <b>On that day</b> when Ravina will die, <b>what will you say? He said to him: I shall</b> begin my eulogy and <b>say</b> as follows: <b>If the cedars went up in flame, what shall the hyssop of the wall do? If the leviathan was lifted by a hook, what shall the</b> tiny <b>fish of the marsh do? If dryness overtook a flowing river, what can the water of the puddles do?</b>
<b>Bar Avin,</b> who was also a eulogizer, <b>said to him: God forbid</b> that the words <b>hook and flame</b> should be <b>said with regard to the righteous,</b> as these are not expressions of honor. Rav Ashi asked him: <b>And what will you say?</b> He said to him: <b>I shall say: Cry for the mourners and not for that which was lost, as</b> that which was lost, i.e., the soul of Ravina, has gone <b>to</b> its eternal <b>rest, while we,</b> the mourners, are left with our <b>sighs.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>was offended by them,</b> as their words of praise for Ravina might have been understood as a show of disrespect to Rav Ashi, since they likened Ravina to a cedar and the other Sages, Rav Ashi included, to hyssops of the wall. Due to Rav Ashi’s anger, <b>their feet turned</b> inward and became crooked. <b>On that day</b> when Ravina actually died, <b>neither</b> of them <b>came to eulogize him. This is</b> what <b>Rav Ashi said</b> using a metaphor to describe this incident: <b>Neither bar Kippok can perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, nor can bar Avin perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> because their feet are crooked and so their shoes cannot be removed from their feet in the proper manner.
<b>When Rava</b> once <b>came to the Tigris</b> River, and he was concerned that he might be swept away by the water, <b>he said to bar Avin: Rise</b> and <b>say</b> a prayer on our behalf. <b>He rose and said: Most of the third,</b> a poetic reference to the Jewish people (Isaiah 19:24), <b>has come in the water,</b> implying that Rava was equal in importance to the majority of the Jewish people. <b>Remember</b> then <b>and have mercy</b> on us. Although <b>we have strayed from you like an</b> unfaithful <b>woman</b> strays <b>from her husband, do not forsake</b> and punish <b>us like the sign of the bitter water,</b> with which a woman suspected of adultery is tested. That is to say, do not punish us with water.
Apropos eulogies for righteous men, the Gemara presents the names: <b>Ḥanin, Yoḥanan, Zeira, Abba, Ya’akov, Yosei, Shmuel, Ḥiyya,</b> and <b>Menaḥem;</b> this is a <b>mnemonic device</b> for the stories that follow.
It was related that <b>Rabbi Ḥanin was a son-in-law in the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> At first <b>he did not have</b> any <b>children,</b> but <b>he prayed</b> that God have <b>mercy</b> on him, <b>and</b> then <b>had</b> a child. <b>On the</b> same <b>day that</b> a son <b>was</b> born <b>to him, he</b> himself <b>passed away. A certain eulogizer opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> with the following words: <b>Happiness has been turned into sorrow; joy and suffering have become joined together. At the moment of his happiness he sighed</b> his dying breath. <b>At the moment he was graced</b> with a son, <b>his</b> own <b>grace was lost. And they named</b> the child <b>Ḥanan after</b> his father.
<b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan passed away, Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> as follows: <b>Today is as difficult for the Jewish people as the day that the sun set at noon, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass on that day,</b> says the Lord God, <b>that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,</b> and I will darken the earth in the clear day. And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and its end like a bitter day” (Amos 8:9–10). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This was the day</b> on which King <b>Josiah</b> was killed (see II Chronicles 35:20–24). This demonstrates that the most righteous person of the generation is described as the sun.
It was further related that <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan passed away, Rabbi Ami sat</b> in mourning for him for <b>seven</b> days <b>and</b> for <b>thirty</b> days as though he had lost a close relative. <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said:</b> What <b>Rabbi Ami did, he did on his own,</b> but this practice does not reflect the <i>halakha</i>. <b>For Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: Even</b> for the death of <b>his teacher who taught him wisdom, one sits</b> in mourning <b>over him for only one day</b> and no more.
The Gemara tells of another incident about a eulogy: <b>When Rabbi Zeira died, a certain eulogizer opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> saying: <b>The land of Shinar conceived and gave birth</b> to him, as he was originally Babylonian, but <b>the land of beauty,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>raised the darling</b> of Babylonia, as he later moved to Eretz Yisrael and grew up there. <b>Woe to her, said Rakkath,</b> a poetic name for Tiberias, <b>for her dearest vessel has been lost.</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss the death of the righteous: <b>When Rabbi Abbahu passed away, the pillars of Caesarea,</b> his city, <b>ran with water</b> as if they were shedding tears over him. When <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> passed away, <b>the gutters of Tzippori,</b> his city, <b>flowed with blood.</b> When <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> passed away, <b>the stars were visible during the day.</b> When <b>Rabbi Asi</b> passed away, <b>all the trees were uprooted</b> in a storm. When <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> passed away, <b>fiery stones fell from the sky.</b> When <b>Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> passed away, the faces of <b>the statues became smooth as if they had been smoothed with</b> a plasterer’s <b>trowel</b> [<b><i>meḥlatzaya</i></b>].
When <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya</b> passed away, <b>every statue [<i>andartaya</i>]</b> of the king <b>was mutilated.</b> When <b>Rabbi Elyashiv</b> passed away, <b>seventy tunnels</b> of thieves <b>were dug in Neharde’a,</b> because as long as he was alive there were no thieves in the town due to his merit. When <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> passed away, <b>hail stones fell from the sky.</b> When <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef</b> passed away, the tops of <b>the bridges of the Euphrates</b> collapsed and <b>touched each other.</b> When <b>Abaye and Rava</b> passed away, the tops of <b>the bridges of the Tigris</b> collapsed and <b>touched each other.</b> When <b>Rabbi Mesharshiyya</b> passed away, <b>the palm trees</b> became <b>laden</b> with <b>thorns [<i>shitzei</i>].</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the subject of tearing garments in mourning: <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 26a

<b>And these are the rents</b> of mourning <b>that may never be</b> properly <b>mended: One who rends</b> his garments <b>for</b> the death <b>his father, or for his mother, or for his teacher who taught him Torah, or for</b> the <b><i>Nasi</i>, or for</b> the <b>president of the court; or upon</b> hearing <b>evil tidings; or</b> hearing God’s <b>name being blessed,</b> which is a euphemism for hearing God’s name being cursed; <b>or when a Torah scroll has been burned; or upon</b> seeing <b>the cities of Judea</b> that were destroyed <b>or the</b> destroyed <b>Temple or Jerusalem</b> in ruins. This is the way one conducts himself when approaching Jerusalem when it lies in ruin: <b>He</b> first <b>rends</b> his garments <b>for the Temple and</b> then <b>extends</b> the rent <b>for Jerusalem.</b>
The Gemara elaborates upon the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his clothing for <b>his father, his mother, and his teacher who taught him Torah? As it is written</b> with regard to the prophet Elijah, when he ascended to Heaven in a tempest: <b>“And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and their horsemen”</b> (II Kings 2:12). The Gemara interprets this verse as follows: <b>“My father, my father”; this</b> comes to teach that one must rend his garments for the death of <b>his father or mother. “The chariots of Israel and their horsemen”; this</b> comes to include also <b>one’s teacher who taught him Torah.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that this is referring to one’s teacher? The Gemara explains: <b>As</b> the verse <b>was translated by Rav Yosef: My teacher, my teacher, who was better for</b> the protection of the <b>Jewish people with his prayers than</b> an army with <b>chariots and horsemen.</b>
<b>And from where do we</b> derive that these rents <b>are never</b> to be properly <b>mended? As it is written: “And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces”</b> (II Kings 2:12). <b>From the fact that</b> it <b>is stated: “And he rent them,” do I not know that</b> he rent them <b>in two</b> pieces? <b>Rather,</b> when the verse adds that they were torn into two pieces, <b>it teaches that they must remain torn in two</b> pieces <b>forever.</b> Accordingly, this rent must never be properly mended.
<b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> But isn’t <b>Elijah</b> still <b>alive?</b> Why, then, did Elisha rend his garments for him? <b>He said to him: Since it is written: “And he saw him no more”</b> (II Kings 2:12), Elijah was <b>considered dead from</b> Elisha’s perspective, and so Elisha rent his clothing for him.
§ <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his clothing for the death of the <b><i>Nasi</i> or</b> the <b>president of the court and</b> upon hearing <b>evil tidings? As it is written,</b> when David heard about the defeat of Israel and the death of Saul and his sons: <b>“Then David took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword”</b> (II Samuel 1:11–12).
The Gemara explains how the aforementioned <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the verse: <b>“Saul”; this is</b> a reference to the <b><i>Nasi</i>,</b> as Saul was king of Israel. <b>“Jonathan”; this is</b> a reference to the <b>president of the court. “For the people of the Lord, and for the house of the Israel”; these are</b> a reference to <b>evil tidings.</b>
<b>Rav bar Shaba said to Rav Kahana: But</b> perhaps you can <b>say</b> that one need not rend his clothing <b>until all these</b> calamities occur together, and that rending clothing is performed only over a tragedy of this magnitude. <b>He said to him:</b> The repetition of the word “for”: <b>“For</b> Saul,” <b>“for</b> Jonathan,” and “for the people of the Lord” <b>divides the matter</b> and teaches that each individual misfortune is sufficient cause to rend one’s garments.
The Gemara asks: <b>But do we</b> actually <b>rend</b> our clothing upon hearing <b>evil tidings? But didn’t they say to Shmuel: King Shapur killed twelve thousand Jews in Mezigat Caesarea, and</b> Shmuel <b>did not rend</b> his clothing?The Gemara answers: <b>They said</b> that one must rend his clothing upon hearing evil tidings <b>only</b> in a case where the calamity involved <b>the majority of the community</b> of Israel <b>and resembles the incident that occurred</b> when Saul was killed and the entire nation of Israel suffered defeat.
The Gemara tangentially asks: <b>Did King Shapur</b> really <b>kill Jews? But didn’t King Shapur say to Shmuel: I have</b> a blessing <b>coming to me, for I have never killed a Jew?</b> The Gemara answers: King Shapur never instigated the killing of Jews; <b>there,</b> however, <b>they brought it upon themselves, as Rabbi Ami said</b> in an exaggerated manner: <b>Due to the noise of the</b> harp <b>strings</b> of <b>Mezigat Caesarea, the walls of Laodicea were breached,</b> for the residents of the city celebrated when they rebelled against King Shapur. Because they rebelled against him and threatened his rule, he was forced to kill them.
§ The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his garments <b>upon</b> hearing God’s <b>name being blessed,</b> i.e., cursed? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the blasphemous words said by Rab-shakeh: <b>“Then came Eliakim, son of Hilkiya, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent”</b> (II Kings 18:37).
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this issue: Both <b>one who</b> actually <b>hears</b> the curse <b>and one who hears from the mouth of</b> the one <b>who heard</b> the curse <b>are obligated to rend</b> their garments. <b>But the witnesses</b> who testify against the person who uttered the blasphemy <b>are not obligated to rend</b> their clothing when they testify as to what they heard <b>because they already rent</b> their clothing <b>when they heard</b> the curse the first time.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>does</b> it make that they rent their garments <b>when they heard</b> the curse the first time? <b>Didn’t they hear</b> it again <b>now?</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>This will not enter your mind, as it is written: “And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes”</b> (II Kings 19:1). This indicates that <b>the king rent</b> his garments, <b>but</b> those who reported the blasphemy to him <b>did not rend</b> theirs, as they had already rent their garments the first time.
<b>And from where do we</b> derive that these rents <b>may not be</b> properly <b>mended? This is derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between the verb <b>rending</b> used here with regard to Hezekiah and the verb <b>rending</b> used in the case of Elijah and Elisha.
§ <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his garments when <b>a Torah scroll has been burned? As it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he would cut it with a penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier”</b> (Jeremiah 36:23). With regard to the verse itself the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>“three or four leaves,”</b> and why did he cut the book only at that point?
The Gemara explains: <b>They said to Jehoiakim: Jeremiah has written a book of Lamentations</b> over the future downfall and destruction of Jerusalem. <b>He said to them: What is written in it?</b> They read him the first verse: <b>“How does the city sit solitary”</b> (Lamentations 1:1). <b>He said to them: I am king,</b> and this does not apply to me. <b>They read him</b> the second verse: <b>“She weeps sore in the night”</b> (Lamentations 1:2). He said to them: <b>I am king,</b> and this does not apply to me. They read him the third verse: <b>“Judah is gone into exile due to affliction”</b> (Lamentations 1:3). He said to them: <b>I am king.</b> They read to him: <b>“The ways of Zion do mourn”</b> (Lamentations 1:4). He said to them: <b>I am king.</b> These are the four leaves, or verses, that he read first.
They read him an additional verse: <b>“Her adversaries have become the chief”</b> (Lamentations 1:5), i.e., the reigning king will be removed from power. Once he heard this, <b>he said to them: Who said</b> this? They said to him: This is the continuation of the verse: <b>“For the Lord has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions”</b> (Lamentations 1:5). <b>Immediately, he cut out all the names</b> of God <b>from</b> the book <b>and burned them in fire. This is as it is written: “Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments,</b> neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words” (Jeremiah 36:24). <b>By inference,</b> this shows <b>that</b> they <b>were required to rend</b> their clothing when they saw this.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Perhaps you can <b>say</b> that they should have rent their garments <b>due to the evil tidings</b> contained in the scroll and not because of the destruction of the book? Abaye <b>said to him: Were they evil tidings at that time?</b> This was a prophecy and not an account of current events.
<b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who sees a Torah scroll that was torn is obligated to make two rents, one for the parchment</b> that was damaged <b>and one for the writing, as it is stated:</b> “Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, <b>after the king had burned the scroll and the words”</b> (Jeremiah 36:27). This implies that a separate rent must be made for each of them, both the parchment and the writing.
It was related that <b>Rabbi Abba and Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya were sitting before Rabbi Abba.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>needed to relieve himself. He removed his phylacteries</b> from his head and <b>placed them on the cushion</b> on which he was sitting. <b>An ostrich came and wanted to swallow</b> the phylacteries.
<b>He said: Now,</b> had it succeeded to swallow it, <b>I would have been obligated to make two rents. He said to him: From where do you</b> derive <b>this? There was an incident in which I</b> was involved <b>and I came before Rav Mattana</b> asking what to do, <b>but he did not have</b> an answer readily available. <b>I</b> then <b>came before Rav Yehuda, and he said to me: Shmuel said as follows: They said</b> that one is obligated to rend his clothing <b>only</b> when a Torah scroll or some other sacred book is torn <b>by force, and it resembles the incident that occurred</b> with Jehoiakim.
§ <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his garments upon seeing <b>the cities of Judea</b> in ruin? <b>As it is written: “There came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty people, their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring to the house of the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 41:5). This indicates that they rent their garments upon seeing the destruction.
<b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Ulla Bira’a said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who sees the cities of Judea in their desolation says: “Your sacred cities are become a wilderness”</b> (Isaiah 64:9), <b>and</b> then <b>rends</b> his garments. One who sees <b>Jerusalem in its desolation says: “Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation”</b> (Isaiah 64:9), <b>and</b> then <b>rends</b> his garments. One who sees <b>the Temple in its desolation says: “Our sacred and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste” (</b>Isaiah 64:10), <b>and</b> then <b>rends</b> his garments.
It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>He</b> first <b>rends</b> his garments <b>for the Temple and</b> then <b>extends</b> the rent <b>for Jerusalem. And they raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> that states: Both <b>one who hears</b> that Jerusalem is in ruin <b>and one who sees</b> the destruction, <b>once he reaches</b> Mount <b>Scopus [<i>Tzofim</i>], rends</b> his garments. <b>And he rends</b> his garments <b>for the Temple separately and for Jerusalem separately.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that instead of making a separate rent for Jerusalem one may extend the first rent that he had made for the Temple, is referring to the case where <b>one reached the Temple first,</b> before seeing the rest of Jerusalem, and saw it in ruin. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that one must make separate rents for Jerusalem and for the Temple, is referring to the case where <b>one reached Jerusalem first,</b> and only afterward the Temple.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>And all of these</b> rents, <b>one may tack them</b> together with loose stitches, <b>and hem them, and gather them, and fix them</b> with imprecise <b>ladder-like</b> stitches. <b>But one may not mend them</b> with precise stitches.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b>

Daf 26b

<b>And</b> the reference here is <b>to</b> the <b>Alexandrian</b> method of <b>mending,</b> a type of sewing performed in Alexandria, which is considered to be of exceptional quality and after which the tear is no longer visible.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who rends</b> his garment in a place <b>that had been</b> loosely <b>tacked</b> together, or <b>from the hem of the garment,</b> or <b>on the gathering,</b> or <b>on the ladder-like stiches has not fulfilled</b> his obligation to rend it. But if he rends it in a place <b>that had been</b> carefully <b>mended, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, because such a garment is regarded as whole. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: And</b> here, too, the reference is <b>to</b> the <b>Alexandrian</b> method of <b>mending</b> and not to ordinary sewing.
<b>The Sages taught</b> another <i>baraita</i>: One is <b>permitted to turn</b> a garment that was rent on the upper edge <b>upside down and</b> then <b>mend</b> it in a precise fashion. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar prohibits</b> careful <b>mending</b> in this case as well. <b>And</b> if one wishes to sell a garment that he had previously rent in mourning, <b>just as the seller,</b> who had rent the garment, <b>is prohibited from</b> carefully <b>mending</b> the garment, <b>so too the buyer,</b> who purchases it from him, <b>is prohibited from mending it. The seller must therefore inform the buyer</b> that the rent was made on account of mourning and may not be mended.
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The initial rending is a handbreadth</b> in length,<b> and</b> the <b>extension,</b> if one is obligated to rend his garment for other deceased relatives and he wishes to use the same rent for this purpose, <b>is three fingerbreadths;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The <b>initial rending is three fingerbreadths</b> in length, <b>and</b> its <b>extension is any amount,</b> with no minimum measure.
<b>Ulla said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir that</b> the initial <b>rending</b> is one handbreadth in length, <b>and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda that an extension</b> can be any length. The Gemara comments: <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The <b>initial rending</b> is <b>one handbreadth, and</b> the size of the <b>extension is any</b> minimal <b>amount.</b> By tradition, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei when he disagrees with any one of his colleagues.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>they</b> first <b>said to</b> a person that <b>his father died, and he rent</b> his garment, and afterward they told him that <b>his son died, and he added</b> to the same rent, in such a case the <b>lower</b> portion of the rent that had been made for his son <b>may be mended.</b> This is because, after completing the period of mourning, one is permitted to mend a rent made for relatives other than one’s parents. However, the <b>upper</b> portion of the rent <b>may not be mended,</b> as a tear made for one’s father may never be carefully sewn back together.
If, on the other hand, they said to him first that <b>his son died, and he rent</b> his garment, and afterward they told him that <b>his father died, and he added</b> to the same rent, then in that case the <b>upper</b> portion of the rent, which had been made for his son, <b>may be mended,</b> but <b>the lower</b> portion of the rent, which had been made for his father, <b>may not be mended.</b>
If they said to him all at one time that <b>his father died, his mother died, his brother died, and his sister died,</b> then <b>he may make one rent for all of them. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: For all</b> of his other relatives he makes <b>one rent,</b> and <b>for his father and mother</b> he makes <b>another rent, as one must not add</b> to <b>a rent</b> made <b>for his father and mother.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira’s opinion that one may not add to the rent torn for a mother or father? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Because they cannot be added;</b> one has only one father and one mother and cannot add others.
<b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But didn’t Shmuel say</b> the principle is that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement</b> of the <b>lenient</b> Sage with regard to <b>mourning;</b> yet here he rules in accordance with the more stringent opinion. The Gemara answers: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>mourning are discrete</b> and the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>rending are discrete,</b> and it is only with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning that Shmuel rules consistently in accordance with the lenient opinion.
It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Until where</b> may <b>he rend</b> his garment, if he continues to rend the same garment for additional relatives? He may continue rending <b>until</b> the point where the garment covers <b>his navel. Some say: Until</b> the point where the garment covers <b>his heart. Although there is no</b> absolute <b>proof for the matter</b> that one may rend the garment until this point, there is <b>an allusion to this matter, as it is stated: “And rend your hearts, and not your garments”</b> (Joel 2:13), thereby intimating that one may extend the rent in his garment only until he reaches the point where the garment covers his heart.
If <b>he</b> tore his garment until he <b>reached</b> the point where it covers <b>his navel,</b> he should not continue rending in the same place. Instead, <b>he should move away</b> a space of <b>three fingerbreadths</b> from the first rent <b>and make</b> a new <b>rent.</b> If the garment <b>became full</b> of rents <b>in the front, he should turn</b> the garment <b>front to back</b> and make a rent on the other side. If <b>it became full</b> of rents <b>above, he should turn it</b> top to bottom and make a rent on what used to be <b>the bottom. But one who rends</b> his garment <b>at the bottom or at the sides has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as rending may be done only at the top of the garment. <b>The High Priest, however,</b> who is prohibited from rending his garments in mourning, <b>may tear</b> his garment <b>at the bottom</b> to mark his mourning in a symbolic manner.
<b>Rav Mattana and Mar Ukva disagreed about</b> the following issue, <b>and both of them</b> stated their respective opinions <b>in the name of Shmuel’s father and Levi. One said:</b> During <b>all seven</b> days of mourning, if the mourner hears that another relative of his passed away, <b>he makes</b> a new <b>rent; after seven</b> days of mourning <b>he</b> merely <b>adds</b> to the first one. <b>And one said:</b> During <b>all</b> of the first <b>thirty days he makes</b> a new rent; <b>after thirty</b> days <b>he</b> merely <b>adds</b> to the first one.
<b>Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this:</b> According to <b>the one who said</b> that during <b>all seven</b> days of mourning <b>he makes</b> a new <b>rent, why</b> is it not enough to add to the first one? It is because <b>he may not tack it</b> until the end of the seven-day period of mourning, and therefore if he adds to the rent it will look like a continuation of the previous tear. <b>But</b> then, with regard to <b>that which the Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: After <b>a woman</b> rends her garment, she <b>may tack</b> the tear <b>immediately,</b> would you say that <b>here also</b> she may add to the first rent for a new bereavement during the seven-day period of mourning?
The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> the woman is permitted to tack the rent <b>due to the woman’s honor,</b> as it would be dishonorable for her to be seen wearing torn garments. However, halakhically the rent is considered as if it still exists, and therefore she must make a new rent for a new bereavement and not merely add to the previous one.
Rabbi Zeira asked further: According to <b>the one who said</b> that <b>all thirty days</b> of mourning <b>one must make</b> a new <b>rent</b> rather than add to the existing tear, <b>why</b> does he say this? It is because during the thirty days <b>one is not given</b> permission to properly <b>mend</b> the garment, and so it still appears to be torn. <b>But</b> then, in a case of a rent made <b>for one’s father or mother,</b> for <b>which</b> he <b>is not given</b> permission to <b>ever</b> properly <b>mend it,</b> would you say that he should <b>so too</b> be forever barred from adding to the rent for a new bereavement and is instead obligated to make a new rent?
The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> he may not properly mend the rent <b>due to the honor due to his father and mother.</b> Essentially, however, the tear is considered as if it had been sewn up after the thirty-day period, and therefore the son may extend it in the case of a new bereavement.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who goes out before the deceased in a rent garment</b> that he had previously torn over another bereavement, thereby giving the appearance of having rent his garment for him, <b>steals from the dead,</b> as he did not rend a garment for him. <b>And</b> he similarly steals <b>from the living,</b> who see him and think that he made the tear in honor of the deceased, when in reality he is deceiving them.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> In the case of <b>one who says to his fellow: Lend me your cloak and I will go and visit my father because he is sick, and he goes and finds that</b> his father <b>has died, he rends</b> the cloak <b>and</b> may then <b>mend it</b> in the proper manner. <b>And when he returns home, he returns the cloak</b> to his fellow <b>and pays him the value of the rent,</b> i.e., the depreciation in the value of the cloak that resulted from the tear. The assumption is that the lender considered the possibility that the sick father might die, and lent the garment anyway, understanding that he might have to tear it. <b>But if one did not inform</b> his fellow that he was going to visit his sick father, <b>he must not touch it,</b> as he was not granted permission to tear the garment belonging to someone else.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: When a relative <b>of a sick</b> person <b>dies,</b> those around him <b>do not inform him that</b> this relative <b>died, lest he lose control of his mind</b> due to his emotional state and his grief exacerbate his physical health. <b>And</b> other people <b>may not rend</b> their garments <b>in his presence,</b> so that he will not know that one of his relatives passed away. <b>And we silence the women</b> who weep <b>in his presence,</b> so that he will not know that his relative is no longer alive.
<b>And</b> the relatives <b>rend</b> the garment <b>of a minor child</b> when there is mourning in his family <b>in order to arouse grief.</b> Although a minor is not required to rend his garments, this will add to the grief of those who see that even the garments of children are rent. <b>And one rends</b> his garment <b>for his father-in-law or mother-in-law, although</b> he is not required to mourn for them, <b>due to the honor of his wife,</b> to show her that he joins in her mourning.
<b>And Rav Pappa said:</b> A Sage <b>taught in <i>Evel Rabbati</i>: A mourner should not place</b> a young <b>child in his lap because</b> the child <b>will bring him to laughter, and he will be disgraced in</b> the eyes of <b>other people</b> because he laughed while in mourning.
§ The mishna taught: <b>And</b> the consolers <b>provide the</b> first <b>meal</b> after the burial <b>only</b> while the mourner sits <b>on an upright bed</b> and not on one that is overturned. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who goes to the house of the mourner, if he is confident</b> in his friendship <b>with him</b> because they are close friends, <b>they provide him with the meal of comfort</b> while both he and the mourner sit <b>on overturned beds. And if</b> he is <b>not</b> confident in his friendship with him, both <b>he</b> and the mourner <b>should be fed on upright beds.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>something</b> unpleasant <b>happened to Rava,</b> i.e., one of his close relatives died, and <b>Abba bar Marta, who</b> was also known as <b>Abba bar Minyomi, entered</b> to visit <b>him. Rava stood</b> the bed <b>upright,</b> treating him like any other person who came to comfort him. <b>Abba bar Marta overturned</b> the bed because he saw himself as being on very familiar terms with Rava. Rava <b>said: How lacking in sense is this Torah scholar.</b> Rava had shown from the outset that he did not consider Abba bar Marta to be a close friend, yet the latter ignored this message and viewed himself as being exceptionally close to Rava.
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one who was going from place to place</b> learned of the death of a close relative, so that he must now observe the rites of mourning,

Daf 27a

<b>if he can reduce his business, he should reduce</b> it; <b>and if not, he may carry on with them,</b> i.e., his business partners. He may act in partnership with the members of the group with which he is traveling, but he may not engage in business independently.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when do</b> the mourners <b>overturn</b> their <b>beds? From when</b> the corpse <b>is taken out of the opening of his house;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: From when the</b> tomb <b>is sealed</b> with <b>the grave cover.</b>
There was <b>an incident</b> in <b>which</b> the <i>Nasi</i> <b>Rabban Gamliel the Elder died,</b> and <b>once</b> his body <b>left the opening of his house, Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> the members of the household: <b>Overturn your beds. And once the</b> tomb <b>was sealed</b> with <b>the grave cover, Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: Overturn your beds. They</b> then <b>said to him: We already overturned</b> them <b>in accordance with the Elder,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when do</b> the mourners <b>stand</b> their <b>beds upright on Friday;</b> as the rites of mourning are not observed on Shabbat, and the beds must be returned to their ordinary position beforehand? <b>From <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward. Rabba bar Huna said: Even so, one may not sit down on</b> his upright bed immediately. Rather, he must wait <b>until it becomes dark</b> to do so. <b>And at the conclusion of Shabbat, even if he has only one</b> more <b>day to sit</b> in mourning, i.e., his period of mourning concludes on Sunday, <b>he must</b> once <b>again overturn</b> his bed.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who</b> is in mourning and must <b>overturn his bed, he overturns not only his</b> own <b>bed, but rather he overturns all the beds he has in his house. And even if he has ten beds in ten</b> different <b>places, he overturns them all. And even</b> if there are <b>five brothers and one</b> of them <b>died, all of them overturn</b> their beds wherever they live.
<b>If, however, it is a bed designated</b> for the storage of <b>garments</b> and not for sleeping, <b>he is not required to overturn it. It is</b> also <b>not necessary to overturn a <i>dargash</i>, but rather he stands it upright. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>dargash</i>, one loosens its loops [<i>karbitav</i>],</b> which hold up the pillows, <b>and it falls on its own.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>dargash</i>? Ulla said:</b> It is a good-<b>luck [<i>gada</i>] bed,</b> as it was common to have ornamental beds for good luck, which were not used for sleeping.
<b>Rabba said to him: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> then the following statement <b>with regard to a king</b> is difficult, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 20a): When the mourner’s meal is served to the king and his family, <b>all the people recline on the ground, and he,</b> the king, due to his honor, <b>reclines on a <i>dargash</i>. Is there anything upon which we would not have seated him until now,</b> when he was not a mourner, <b>but now,</b> specifically during the mourning period, <b>we seat him on it?</b>
<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this: What is the difficulty</b> raised by Rabba? One can answer: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as it is in</b> the case of <b>eating and drinking,</b> that <b>until now,</b> before one became a mourner, <b>we did not feed him or give him drink,</b> but <b>now</b> that he is a mourner <b>we feed him and give him drink</b> during the first meal after the burial.
<b>Rather, if it</b> is <b>difficult, this</b> is <b>difficult, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is not necessary to overturn a <i>dargash</i>, but rather he stands it upright. But if it is</b> a good-<b>luck bed, why is it not necessary to overturn it? Didn’t we learn: One who</b> is in mourning and must <b>overturn his bed overturns not only his</b> own <b>bed, but rather he overturns all the beds in his house,</b> including this good luck bed?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what</b> is <b>difficult</b> in this? One can answer: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as it is in</b> the case of <b>a bed designated for</b> the storage of <b>garments, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If it is a bed designated for</b> the storage of <b>garments,</b> and not for sleeping, <b>one is not required to overturn it.</b> So too, one is not required to overturn a <i>dargash</i>, as it is a bed that is not used for sleeping.
<b>Rather if it</b> is <b>difficult, this is the difficulty:</b> It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>dargash</i>, one loosens the loops</b> that hold up the pillows, <b>and it falls on its own. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that a <i>dargash</i> is <b>a</b> good-<b>luck bed,</b> it is like other beds, so <b>what loops does it have?</b>
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>one of the Sages, whose name was Rav Taḥalifa from the West,</b> and <b>who was frequently</b> found <b>in the market of leather workers, said to him: What is a <i>dargash</i>?</b> It is <b>a leather bed.</b>
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: A <i>dargash</i></b> has <b>its interlacing from the inside,</b> i.e., attached to loops that go through holes that are made in the bed frame itself; whereas <b>a bed</b> has <b>its interlacing from the outside,</b> i.e., the strapping itself is looped around the wood of the frame, and therefore it cannot be loosened.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> with regard to a <i>dargash</i>. <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Asi: A bed whose posts [<i>naklitin</i>] extend,</b> meaning that they are very long so that the bed will remain high off the ground even if it is overturned, <b>may be stood upright and that is sufficient.</b> That is to say, one is not required to overturn such a bed.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If the mourner <b>sleeps on a chair,</b> or <b>on a large</b> overturned <b>mortar,</b> or <b>on the ground, he does not fulfill his obligation,</b> even though he is uncomfortable while sleeping. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>because he did not fulfill</b> the mitzva of <b>overturning the bed.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may sweep and sprinkle</b> water on a dirt floor <b>in the house of a mourner, and one may wash bowls, cups, jugs, and pitchers in the house of a mourner. But one may not bring incense or</b> fragrant <b>spices into the house of a mourner.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t bar Kappara teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing either over incense or over fragrant spices in the house of a mourner?</b> From this one may infer that <b>one may not recite a blessing</b> over these incense or spices, <b>but one may bring them</b> into the house of the mourner. This appears to contradict the previous <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>It is not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to the house of a mourner,</b> into which spices should not be taken; <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that one may not recite a blessing over them, is referring <b>to the house of the consolers,</b> his relatives, into which spices may be brought.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not bring</b> the first meal after the burial <b>to the house of mourning on a small tray [<i>tavla</i>], in a bowl [<i>iskutla</i>], or in a narrow-mouthed basket [<i>kanon</i>], but rather in</b> ordinary <b>baskets. And the mourners’ blessing is not recited on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, but</b> the consolers may <b>stand in a row</b> when the mourners leave the cemetery <b>and console</b> them. <b>And</b> the mourners <b>dismiss the many</b> consolers, by telling them that they may return home after they have fulfilled the mitzva of consoling the mourners.
<b>The bier</b> of the deceased <b>is not set down in the street</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>so as not to encourage eulogies.</b> On an ordinary weekday, people would gather in the street around the bier to eulogize the deceased, but this should be avoided during the intermediate days of the Festival. <b>And</b> the biers <b>of women</b> are <b>never</b> set down, even if it is not the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>due to their honor.</b> Blood might drip from their bodies, and it would cause them dishonor if their blood stained the street.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first,</b> the meal after the burial <b>would be brought to the house of the mourner</b> in various ways. <b>The wealthy</b> would bring the meal <b>in baskets of silver and gold, and the poor</b> would bring it in <b>baskets of peeled willow branches. And the poor were embarrassed,</b> as everyone would see that they were poor. The Sages <b>instituted that everyone should bring</b> the meal <b>in baskets of peeled willow branches, due to the honor of the poor.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> a similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first, they would serve</b> wine <b>in the house of the mourner</b> during the first meal after the burial; the <b>wealthy</b> would do so <b>in</b> cups made from <b>white glass, and</b> the <b>poor</b> would serve this wine <b>in</b> cups of <b>colored glass. And the poor were embarrassed,</b> as everyone would see that they were poor. The Sages <b>instituted that all should serve drinks</b> in the house of the mourner <b>in colored glass</b> cups, <b>due to the honor of the poor.</b>
Furthermore, <b>at first they would uncover the faces of the wealthy</b> who passed away <b>and cover the faces of the poor, because their faces were blackened by famine. And the poor were embarrassed</b> because they were buried in a different manner. The Sages <b>instituted that everyone’s face should be covered, due to the honor of the poor.</b>
Additionally, <b>at first the wealthy would take</b> the deceased <b>out</b> for burial <b>on a <i>dargash</i>, and the poor</b> would take the deceased out

Daf 27b

<b>on a plain bier</b> made from poles that were strapped together, <b>and the poor were embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that everyone should be taken out</b> for burial <b>on a plain bier, due to the honor of the poor.</b>
Similarly, <b>at first they would place incense under</b> the beds of <b>those who died with an intestinal disease,</b> because the body emitted an especially unpleasant odor. <b>And those who were alive with an intestinal disease were embarrassed</b> when they understood that they, too, would be treated in this manner after their death, and that everyone would know the cause of their death. The Sages <b>instituted that incense should be placed under everyone, due to the honor of those with an intestinal disease who were</b> still <b>living.</b>
Moreover, <b>at first they would</b> ritually <b>immerse</b> all <b>the utensils</b> that had been used <b>by</b> women who <b>died</b> while <b>menstruating,</b> which had thereby contracted ritual impurity. <b>And</b> due to this, <b>the living menstruating women were embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that</b> the utensils that had been used <b>by all</b> dying <b>women must be immersed, due to the honor of living menstruating women.</b> And, <b>at first they would</b> ritually <b>immerse</b> all <b>the utensils</b> that had been used by <b><i>zavin</i>,</b> men suffering from gonorrhea, <b>who died,</b> as the utensils had thereby contracted ritual impurity. <b>And</b> due to this <b>the living <i>zavin</i> felt embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that</b> the utensils that had been used <b>by all</b> men <b>must be immersed, due to the honor of the living <i>zavin</i>.</b>
Likewise, <b>at first taking the dead out</b> for burial <b>was more difficult for the relatives than the</b> actual <b>death,</b> because it was customary to bury the dead in expensive shrouds, which the poor could not afford. The problem grew <b>to the point that relatives would</b> sometimes <b>abandon</b> the corpse <b>and run away.</b> This lasted <b>until Rabban Gamliel came and acted</b> with <b>frivolity,</b> meaning that he waived his dignity, by leaving instructions that he be <b>taken out</b> for burial <b>in linen garments. And the people</b> adopted this <b>practice after him</b> and had themselves <b>taken out</b> for burial <b>in linen garments. Rav Pappa said: And nowadays, everyone follows the practice</b> of taking out the dead for burial <b>even in</b> plain <b>hemp garments [<i>tzerada</i>]</b> that cost only <b>a dinar.</b>
It is taught in the mishna: <b>The bier</b> of the deceased <b>is not set down in the street</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival, so as not to encourage eulogies. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> There are <b>no</b> restrictions on eulogizing on the intermediate days of <b>a Festival in the presence</b> of a deceased <b>Torah scholar,</b> and therefore he may be eulogized in the ordinary manner during the Festival week. <b>And all the more so</b> a Torah scholar may be eulogized on the days of <b>Hanukkah and Purim,</b> which have less sanctity than the intermediate days of a Festival.
The Gemara comments: <b>But this</b> allowance to eulogize a Torah scholar during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>applies only</b> when the eulogy is <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the deceased, before the bier. <b>However,</b> giving a eulogy that is <b>not in his presence</b> is <b>not</b> permitted. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Kahana eulogize Rav Zevid from Neharde’a in</b> his city <b>Pum Nahara</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival? <b>Rav Pappa said: It was the day</b> on which Rav Kahana received the <b>news</b> of Rav Zevid’s death, <b>and</b> a eulogy in such a situation <b>is considered as</b> if it is <b>in his presence.</b>
The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning: <b>Ulla said:</b> Although <i>hesped</i> usually refers to a eulogy, strictly speaking, <b><i>hesped</i></b> is referring to striking oneself <b>on the heart, as it is written: “Striking [<i>sofedim</i>] the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 32:12). The term <b><i>tipuaḥ</i></b> is referring to striking <b>with</b> one <b>hand</b> against the other hand, i.e., clapping. The term <b><i>killus</i></b> is referring to stomping <b>with</b> one’s <b>foot</b> on the ground.
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who stomps his foot on the ground</b> as a sign of mourning <b>should not stomp with a sandal, but rather</b> he should do so wearing <b>a shoe, due to the danger</b> of being hurt. Because a sandal is easily torn, it is possible that something sharp on the ground will puncture his foot, or that he will suffer some other injury.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Once a mourner nods his head</b> to show that his grief has slightly diminished, <b>the consolers may no longer sit next to him,</b> as with his action the mourner shows that he no longer desires their presence.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan further said: All are obligated to stand</b> in the <b>presence of the <i>Nasi</i>, except for a mourner and one who is sick. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: To all</b> who stand before a great person <b>one says: Be seated,</b> and only then may they sit down, <b>except for a mourner and one who is sick.</b> If they stood up they do not need permission to sit down, but rather they may do so if they wish.
<b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: A mourner</b> on the <b>first day</b> of his mourning <b>is prohibited from eating of his own bread.</b> From where is this derived? <b>From</b> what <b>the Merciful One says to Ezekiel</b> when the latter is in mourning: <b>“Nor eat the bread of men”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17), which indicates that other mourners must eat bread made by others. It was related that when <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef</b> were in mourning they <b>would exchange their meals with each other.</b>
<b>And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav:</b> When a person <b>dies in a city, all of the residents of that city are prohibited from performing work</b> until he has been buried.
The Gemara relates that when <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> once <b>happened</b> to come to a place called <b>Darumata he heard the sound of a <i>shofar</i></b> announcing that a person <b>had died</b> in the town. When <b>he saw some people doing work he said to them: Let these people be under an excommunication. Is there not a dead</b> person <b>in town? They said to him: There are</b> separate <b>groups in the town,</b> each one responsible for its own dead. Knowing that the deceased was not from our group, we continued our work. <b>He said to them: If so, it is permitted</b> to you, and he revoked his excommunication.
<b>And Rav Yehuda said further in the name of Rav: Anyone who grieves excessively over his dead</b> and does not allow himself to be consoled <b>will</b> in the end <b>weep for another</b> person. The Gemara relates that <b>a certain woman</b> who lived <b>in the neighborhood of Rav Huna had seven sons. One of them died and she wept for him excessively. Rav Huna sent</b> a message <b>to her: Do not do this.</b> But <b>she took no heed of him. He</b> then <b>sent</b> another message <b>to her: If you listen to me, it is well, but if not, prepare shrouds for another death.</b> But she would not listen <b>and they all died. In the end,</b> when she continued with her excessive mourning, <b>he said to her:</b> Since you are acting in this way, <b>prepare shrouds for yourself, and</b> soon thereafter <b>she died.</b>
The Sages taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that states: <b>“Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10): <b>“Weep not for the dead”</b> is referring to <b>excessive</b> mourning; <b>“neither bemoan him” more than the</b> appropriate <b>measure</b> of time. <b>How so?</b> What is the appropriate measure? <b>Three days for weeping, and seven for eulogizing, and thirty for</b> the prohibition against <b>ironing</b> clothing <b>and for</b> the prohibition against <b>cutting hair. From this</b> point <b>forward the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Do not be more merciful with</b> the deceased <b>than I am.</b> If the Torah commands one to mourn for a certain period of time, then that suffices.
It is stated in the continuation of the verse: <b>“Weep sore for him that goes away.” Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is referring <b>to one who leaves</b> the world <b>without children</b> to survive him, since mourning for him is much more intense. It was related that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> would <b>go to a house of mourning only for one who passed away without children, as it is written: “Weep sore for him that goes away; for he shall return [<i>yashuv</i>] no more, nor see his native land”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10). <b>Rav Huna</b> disagreed with the interpretation of the verse and <b>said:</b> “Him that goes” <b>is</b> one <b>who committed a transgression and</b> then <b>repeated it,</b> i.e., one who sins constantly and does not repent [<i>yashav</i>], and therefore loses his portion in the World-to-Come, his “native land.”
The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as <b>Rav Huna said: Once a person commits a transgression and repeats it, it becomes permitted to him.</b> The Gemara questions the wording used here: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that it is actually <b>permitted?</b> How could it possibly be permitted for him to sin? <b>Rather, say</b> instead: <b>It becomes as though it were permitted,</b> for after doing it twice he no longer relates to his action as the violation of a serious prohibition.
<b>Rabbi Levi said: A mourner</b> during <b>the first three days</b> of his mourning <b>should see himself as though a sword were lying between his two thighs,</b> meaning that he too may be facing imminent death. During this period he should live in dread. <b>From the third to the seventh</b> days he should conduct himself <b>as if</b> the sword <b>were lying opposite him in the corner,</b> but still threatening him. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward it is as if</b> the sword <b>was moving before him in the marketplace,</b> and the fear is not as great.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the biers <b>of women</b> are <b>never</b> set down, <b>due to</b> their <b>honor.</b> The Sages of <b>Neharde’a say: They only taught</b> this

Daf 28a

with regard to <b>a woman</b> who died <b>in childbirth,</b> and therefore continues to bleed. <b>But</b> the biers of <b>other women may be set down</b> in the street.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: Even</b> the biers of <b>other women</b> must not be set down in the street, <b>as it is written: “And Miriam died there and was buried there”</b> (Numbers 20:1), which teaches that <b>the</b> site of her <b>burial was close to</b> the place of her <b>death.</b> Therefore, it is preferable to bury a woman as close as possible to the place where she died.
With regard to that same verse <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> further: <b>Miriam also died by</b> the divine <b>kiss,</b> just like her brother Moses. What is the source for this? <b>This is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“there”</b> stated with regard to Miriam and the word <b>“there”</b> mentioned <b>with regard to Moses.</b> With regard to Moses it says: “So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab by the mouth of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>For what</b> reason <b>was it not</b> explicitly <b>stated with regard to her,</b> as it is stated with regard to Moses, that she died <b>“by the mouth of the Lord”?</b> It is <b>because it would be unseemly to say such a thing,</b> that a woman died by way of a divine kiss, and therefore it is not said explicitly.
<b>Rabbi Ami said: Why was</b> the Torah portion that describes the <b>death of Miriam juxtaposed to the portion</b> dealing with <b>the red heifer? To tell you: Just as the red heifer atones</b> for sin, <b>so too, the death of the righteous atones</b> for sin. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Why was</b> the Torah portion that describes the <b>death of Aaron juxtaposed to</b> the portion discussing <b>the priestly garments?</b> This teaches that <b>just as the priestly garments atone</b> for sin, <b>so too, the death of the righteous atones</b> for sin.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>dies suddenly</b> without having been sick, <b>this is death</b> through <b>snatching.</b> If he <b>became sick for a day and died, this is an expedited death. Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel says: This is death at a stroke, as it is stated: “Son of man, behold, I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes at a stroke”</b> (Ezekiel 24:16). <b>And</b> when this prophecy is fulfilled <b>it is written: “So I spoke to the people in the morning and at evening my wife died”</b> (Ezekiel 24:18).
If he was sick for <b>two days and died, this is a quickened death.</b> If he was sick for <b>three</b> days and died, this is a death of <b>rebuke.</b> If he died after being sick for <b>four</b> days, this is a death of <b>reprimand.</b> If one died after a sickness lasting <b>five</b> days, <b>this is the</b> ordinary <b>death of all people.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? It is stated: <b>“Behold, your days approach that you must die”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:14). This verse is expounded in the following manner: <b>“Behold [<i>hen</i>]”</b> indicates <b>one; “approach [<i>karvu</i>],”</b> a plural term, indicates <b>two; “your days [<i>yamekha</i>],”</b> also a plural term, indicates another <b>two;</b> and therefore in total <b>this is five.</b> How does the word <b><i>hen</i></b> indicate <b>one? Because in the Greek language they call</b> the number <b>one <i>hen</i>.</b>
The Gemara discusses the significance of death at different ages: If one <b>dies when</b> he is <b>fifty years</b> old, <b>this is death through <i>karet</i>,</b> the divine punishment of excision, meted out for the most serious transgressions. If he dies when he is <b>fifty-two years</b> old, <b>this is the death of Samuel from Ramah.</b> If he dies at the age of <b>sixty, this is death at the hand of Heaven.</b>
<b>Mar Zutra said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is written: “You shall come to your grave in a ripe age [<i>bekhelaḥ</i>]”</b> (Job 5:26). The word <b>“ripe age” [<i>bekhelaḥ</i>] has the numerical value of sixty,</b> and it is alluded to there that dying at this age involves a divine punishment.
One who dies at the age of <b>seventy</b> has reached <b>old age.</b> One who dies at the age of <b>eighty</b> dies in <b>strength, as it is written: “The days of our years are seventy, or if by reason of strength, eighty years”</b> (Psalms 90:10). <b>Rabba said:</b> Not only is death at the age of fifty a sign of <i>karet</i>, but even death <b>from fifty to sixty years</b> of age <b>is death by <i>karet</i>. And</b> the reason that <b>all of these years were not counted</b> in connection with <i>karet</i> is <b>due to the honor of Samuel from Ramah,</b> who died at the age of fifty-two.
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Yosef turned sixty he made a holiday for the Sages.</b> Explaining the cause for his celebration, <b>he said: I have passed</b> the age of <b><i>karet</i>. Abaye said to him: Master,</b> even <b>though you have passed the <i>karet</i> of years, have you, Master, escaped the <i>karet</i> of days?</b> As previously mentioned, sudden death is also considered to be a form of <i>karet</i>. <b>He said to him: Grasp at least half in your hand,</b> for I have at least escaped one type of <i>karet</i>.
It was related that <b>Rav Huna died suddenly,</b> and <b>the Sages were concerned</b> that this was a bad sign. The Sage <b>Zuga from Hadayeiv taught them</b> the following: <b>They taught</b> these principles <b>only when</b> the deceased <b>had not reached</b> the age of <b>strength,</b> i.e., eighty. <b>But if he had reached</b> the age of <b>strength</b> and then died suddenly, <b>this is death by way of a</b> divine <b>kiss.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> Length of <b>life, children, and sustenance do not depend on</b> one’s <b>merit, but rather they depend upon fate. As, Rabba and Rav Ḥisda were both pious Sages;</b> one <b>Sage</b> would <b>pray</b> during a drought <b>and rain would fall, and</b> the other <b>Sage</b> would <b>pray and rain would fall.</b>
And nevertheless, their lives were very different. <b>Rav Ḥisda lived for ninety-two years,</b> whereas <b>Rabba lived for</b> only <b>forty</b> years. <b>The house of Rav Ḥisda</b> celebrated <b>sixty wedding feasts,</b> whereas the <b>house of Rabba</b> experienced <b>sixty calamities.</b> In other words, many fortuitous events took place in the house of Rav Ḥisda and the opposite occurred in the house of Rabba.
<b>In the house of Rav Ḥisda</b> there was bread from <b>the finest flour [<i>semida</i>]</b> even <b>for the dogs, and it was not asked after,</b> as there was so much food. <b>In the house of Rabba,</b> on the other hand, there was coarse <b>barley bread</b> even <b>for people, and it was not found</b> in sufficient quantities. This shows that the length of life, children, and sustenance all depend not upon one’s merit, but upon fate.
Apropos Rav Ḥisda’s great wealth, the Gemara reports that <b>Rava said: These three things I requested from Heaven, two</b> of which <b>were given to me,</b> and <b>one was not given to me:</b> I requested the <b>wisdom of Rav Huna and the wealth of Rav Ḥisda and they were given to me.</b> I also requested the <b>humility of Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> but <b>it was not given to me.</b>
The Gemara continues its discussion of the deaths of the righteous. <b>Rav Seorim, Rava’s brother, sat before Rava,</b> and <b>he saw that</b> Rava <b>was dozing,</b> i.e., about to die. Rava <b>said to</b> his brother: <b>Master, tell him,</b> the Angel of Death, <b>not to torment me.</b> Knowing that Rava was not afraid of the Angel of Death, Rav Seorim <b>said to</b> him: <b>Master, are you not a friend of</b> the Angel of Death? Rava <b>said to him: Since</b> my <b>fate has been handed over</b> to him, and it has been decreed that I shall die, the Angel of Death <b>no longer pays heed to me.</b> Rav Seorim <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Master, appear to me</b> in a dream after your death. And Rava <b>appeared to him.</b> Rav Seorim <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Master, did you have pain</b> in death? <b>He said to him: Like the prick</b> of the knife <b>when letting blood.</b>
It was similarly related that <b>Rava sat before Rav Naḥman,</b> and <b>he saw that</b> Rav Naḥman <b>was dozing,</b> i.e., slipping into death. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Master, tell</b> the Angel of Death <b>not to torment me.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Master, are you not an important person</b> who is respected in Heaven? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> In the supernal world <b>who is important? Who is honorable? Who is complete?</b>
Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Master, appear to me</b> in a dream after your death. And <b>he appeared to him.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Master, did you have pain</b> in death? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Like the removal of hair from milk,</b> which is a most gentle process. But nevertheless, <b>were the Holy One, Blessed be He, to say to me: Go</b> back <b>to that world,</b> the physical world, <b>as you were, I would not want to go, for the fear of</b> the Angel of Death <b>is great.</b> And I would not want to go through such a terrifying experience a second time.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Elazar was</b> once <b>eating <i>teruma</i>,</b> when the Angel of Death <b>appeared to him. He said to</b> the Angel of Death: <b>I am eating <i>teruma</i>; is it not called sacred?</b> It would be inappropriate for me to die now and thereby defile this sacred <i>teruma</i>. The Angel of Death accepted his argument and left him. <b>The moment passed,</b> and he lived for some time afterward.
It was similarly related that the Angel of Death once <b>appeared to Rav Sheshet in the marketplace.</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> the Angel of Death: Shall I die <b>in the market like an animal? Come to</b> my <b>house</b> and kill me there like a human being.
So too, the Angel of Death <b>appeared to Rav Ashi in the marketplace.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> the Angel of Death: <b>Give me thirty days so that I may review my studies, for you say</b> above: <b>Fortunate is he who comes here</b> to Heaven <b>with his learning in his hand. On the thirtieth day</b> the Angel of Death <b>came</b> to take him. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> the Angel of Death: <b>What is all of this?</b> Why are you in such a hurry to take me? Why can you not postpone my death? He said to him: <b>The foot of</b> Rav Huna <b>bar Natan is pushing</b> you, as he is ready to succeed you as the leader of the generation, <b>and one sovereignty does not overlap with its counterpart, even</b> by <b>one hairbreadth.</b> Therefore, you cannot live any longer.
The Angel of Death <b>was unable</b> to take <b>Rav Ḥisda because his mouth was never silent from study.</b> So the Angel of Death <b>went</b> and <b>sat on the cedar</b> column that supported the roof of <b>the study hall of the Sages. The cedar cracked and</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>was silent</b> for a moment, as he was startled by the sound. At that point the Angel of Death was <b>able to</b> take <b>him.</b>
The Angel of Death <b>could not come near Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> owing to his righteousness. <b>One day</b> the Angel of Death <b>appeared to him as a poor person. He came and knocked on the door. He said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Bring out bread for me,</b> and <b>he took out</b> bread <b>for him.</b> The Angel of Death then <b>said</b> to Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Master, do you not have mercy on a poor person? Why, then, do you not have mercy upon that man,</b> i.e., upon me, and give me what I want? The Angel of Death then <b>revealed</b> his identity <b>to him,</b> and <b>showed him a fiery rod</b> in order to confirm that he was the Angel of Death. At this point Rav Ḥiyya <b>surrendered</b> himself <b>to him.</b>

Daf 28b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>On</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival women may wail</b> in grief over the deceased, <b>but they may not clap [<i>metapeḥot</i>]</b> their hands in mourning. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Those who are close to the bier may clap.</b>
<b>On New Moons, Hanukkah and Purim,</b> which are not Festivals by Torah law, the women <b>may</b> both <b>wail and clap</b> their hands in mourning. <b>On both</b> the intermediate days of a Festival <b>and on</b> New Moons, Hanukkah and Purim <b>they may not lament.</b> After <b>the deceased has been buried they may neither wail nor clap.</b>
The mishna explains: <b>What is</b> considered <b>wailing?</b> This is <b>when they all wail together</b> simultaneously. And what is considered <b>a lament?</b> This is <b>when one speaks and they all answer after her</b> with a repeated refrain, <b>as it is stated: “And teach your daughters wailing and everyone her neighbor lamentation”</b> (Jeremiah 9:19).
In order to conclude on a positive note, the mishna says: <b>But with regard to the future,</b> the verse <b>states: “He will destroy death forever; and the Lord, God, will wipe away tears from off all faces</b> and the reproach of His people He will take away from off all the earth” (Isaiah 25:8).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What do</b> the women who wail over the dead <b>say? Rav said:</b> They say: <b>Woe over him who is</b> now <b>departing; woe over</b> him who is now returning <b>the pledge,</b> i.e., his soul, which had been deposited in his hands all the years of his life.
<b>Rava said: The women</b> in the city of <b>Shekhantziv,</b> who were known for their wisdom, <b>would say as follows: Woe over him who is</b> now <b>departing; woe over</b> him who is now returning <b>the pledge. And Rava said: The women of Shekhantziv would say</b> about an elderly person: <b>The bone has been removed from the jaw and the water returns to the kettle.</b>
<b>And Rava said: The women of Shekhantziv would say</b> at a time of bereavement: <b>Wrap and cover the mountains</b> in mourning, <b>as</b> the deceased is <b>the son of the high and distinguished. Rava said: The women of Shekhantziv would say: Lend</b> out <b>a cloak of fine wool</b> to serve as a burial shroud <b>for a free man whose sustenance has been depleted.</b> In other words, a wealthy person who loses his fortune would rather die than live in poverty.
<b>And Rava said: The women of Shekhantziv would say:</b> A person <b>runs and tumbles at the ford and</b> still <b>he borrows. And Rava said: The women of Shekhantziv would say: Our brothers, the merchants, will be examined at their places</b> of business to see if they are honest businessmen. <b>And Rava said: The women of Shekhantziv would say: Death is like death,</b> as everyone must die, <b>and suffering is like interest.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say</b> with regard to the verse <b>“It is better to go to the house of mourning</b> than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the end of all men; <b>and the living will lay it to his heart”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:2): What should the living lay to his heart? <b>Matters relating to death.</b> And these matters are as follows: He <b>that eulogizes will be eulogized</b> by others. He <b>that buries</b> others <b>will be buried</b> by others. He <b>that loads</b> many words of praise and tribute into the eulogies that he delivers for others <b>will be</b> similarly <b>treated</b> by others. He <b>that raises</b> his voice in weeping over others <b>will</b> have others <b>raise</b> their voices <b>over him.</b>
<b>And some say:</b> One <b>who does not raise himself</b> with pride, but chooses his place among the lowly, <b>will be raised</b> by others, <b>as it is written:</b> “Do not exalt yourself in the king’s presence, and stand not in the place of great men. <b>For it is better to be told, step up here,</b> than to be degraded in the presence of the great” (Proverbs 25:6–7).
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>When the sons of Rabbi Yishmael died, four Elders entered to console him: Rabbi Tarfon, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, and Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Tarfon said to them: Know that</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>is a great Sage and well versed in <i>aggadot</i>. Let none of you interrupt the words of another,</b> but rather each person should say something novel of his own. <b>Rabbi Akiva said: And I</b> shall speak <b>last.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> the mourner, <b>opened and said</b> about himself: <b>Many are his sins.</b> Due to this, <b>his bereavements came in</b> quick <b>succession</b> and <b>he troubled his teachers once and</b> then <b>a second time</b> to come and console him.
Having been granted permission to speak, <b>Rabbi Tarfon answered and said:</b> With regard to the death of Aaron’s sons it says: <b>“But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the Lord has kindled”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Nadav and Avihu, who had performed only one mitzva</b> that is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him”</b> (Leviticus 9:9), <b>this</b> was nevertheless stated about them, then with regard to <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who were well known for their performance of many mitzvot, <b>all the more so</b> should the entire Jewish people bewail their death.
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili answered and said:</b> With regard to Abijah, son of King Jeroboam, the verse states: <b>“And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him”</b> (I Kings 14:13). <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Abijah, son of Jeroboam, who did only one good thing, as it is written: “Because in him there is found some good thing</b> toward the Lord God of Israel” (I Kings 14:13), i.e., he did only one good thing, and <b>this</b> was his reward, then with regard to <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael all the more so</b> should they be rewarded by having the entire Jewish people mourn for them and bury them.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> was this <b>one</b> good <b>thing</b> that Abijah did? <b>Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa</b> disagreed about this issue. <b>One said: He abandoned his guard post.</b> His father, Jeroboam, had assigned him to serve as one of the guards whose mission it was to prevent people from going up to Jerusalem on the pilgrimage Festivals. <b>And he</b> himself <b>went up</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the pilgrimage Festival. And one said: He removed the guards [<i>pardesaot</i>] that his father, Jeroboam, had placed along the roads so that</b> the people of <b>Israel would not go up</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the pilgrimage Festivals.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya answered and said:</b> With regard to King Zedekiah, the verse states: <b>“But you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings that were before you, so shall they make a burning for you”</b> (Jeremiah 34:5). <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Zedekiah, king of Judea, who had performed</b> only <b>one mitzva</b> that is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, <b>for he had Jeremiah lifted out of the mire</b> (Jeremiah 38:10), <b>this</b> was nevertheless stated about him, then with regard to <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael all the more so</b> should they be rewarded by dying in peace.
<b>Rabbi Akiva answered and said:</b> The verse states: <b>“On that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon”</b> (Zechariah 12:11). The Gemara comments: With regard to this verse, <b>Rav Yosef said: Had it not been for the</b> Aramaic <b>translation of this verse, we would not have known what it is saying,</b> as nowhere in the Bible do we find this incident involving Hadadrimmon.
The Aramaic translation reads as follows: <b>At that time the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning over Ahab, son of Omri, who was slain by Hadadrimmon, son of Tabrimmon, and like the mourning over Josiah, son of Amon, who was slain by Pharaoh the lame in the valley of Megiddon.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Ahab, king of Israel, who did</b> only <b>one good thing</b> that is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “And the king was propped up in his chariot facing Aram”</b> (I Kings 22:35), as he did not want the Jewish people to see that he was mortally wounded and flee, and <b>this,</b> that he was greatly mourned, was nevertheless stated about him, then <b>all the more so</b> will <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael</b> be greatly mourned.
The Gemara discusses issues in the aforementioned verses: <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written with regard to Zedekiah: “You shall die in peace,” but</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “And he put out Zedekiah’s eyes”</b> (Jeremiah 39:7). Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> The first verse: “You shall die in peace,” means <b>that Nebuchadnezzar died in</b> Zedekiah’s <b>lifetime</b> and consequently the latter died in peace, having seen the death of the wicked.
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written with regard to Josiah: “Behold, therefore I will gather you unto your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace”</b> (II Kings 22:20), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “And the archers shot at King Josiah;</b> and the king said to his servants, Get me away; for I am grievously wounded” (II Chronicles 35:23). <b>And</b> with regard to this verse <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With their many arrows, <b>they made</b> his body <b>like a sieve.</b>
Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> The words “in peace” stated with regard to King Josiah refer to the fact <b>that the Temple was not destroyed in his lifetime,</b> as the verse itself continues: “And your eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place” (II Kings 22:20).
The Gemara returns to examining the <i>halakhot</i> of consolation. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The consolers are not permitted to speak words</b> of consolation <b>until the mourner opens</b> and speaks first. <b>As it is stated:</b> “And they sat down with him upon the ground for seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him; for they saw that his suffering was very great. <b>After this Job opened his mouth”</b> (Job 2:13–3:1). <b>And afterward: “And Eliphaz the Temanite answered</b> and said” (Job 4:1).
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the mourner reclines at the head [<i>rosh</i>]</b> of the table? <b>As it is stated: “I chose out their way, and sat as chief [<i>rosh</i>], and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforts [<i>yenaḥem</i>] the mourners”</b> (Job 29:25). This indicates that the mourner sits at the head of the table, as the chief.
The Gemara raises an objection: But the word <b><i>yenaḥem</i> means that he comforts others,</b> thereby implying that one who comforts the mourners sits at the head of the table. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The word <b>is written</b> as <b><i>yinaḥem</i>,</b> meaning: Will be comforted, and therefore can be understood as referring to the mourner.
<b>Mar Zutra said:</b> A proof may be derived <b>from here:</b> The verse <b>“And the revelry [<i>mirzaḥ</i>] of those who stretched themselves out shall pass away [<i>sar</i>]”</b> (Amos 6:7) means that <b><i>mirzaḥ</i>,</b> he who is bitter [<i>mar</i>] and whose mind is overwrought <b>[</b><i>zaḥ</i><b>]</b> due to grief, <b>is made a prince [<i>sar</i>] over those who</b> sit beside him <b>stretched out</b> below him to comfort him.
<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a groom reclines at the head</b> of the table? <b>As it is stated: “As a bridegroom decks himself [<i>yekhahen</i>] with a garland”</b> (Isaiah 61:10). <b>Just as a priest [<i>kohen</i>]</b> is <b>at the head</b> of the table, <b>so too, a bridegroom</b> is <b>at the head</b> of the table.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the priest himself</b> sits at the head? The Gemara answers: <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> With regard to a priest it says: <b>“You shall sanctify him,</b> for he offers the bread of your God” (Leviticus 21:8), meaning that you are to sanctify him <b>with regard to all matters of sanctity: To be first to begin</b> reading the Torah, <b>to be first to recite the Grace</b> after Meals, <b>and to be first to take a portion</b> during a meal.
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of death: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The soul’s departure from the body is as difficult</b>

Daf 29a

<b>as</b> it is <b>for a knotted rope [<i>tzippori</i>] to pass through an eye [<i>veshet</i>]</b> in a ship’s rigging. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is as difficult <b>as</b> it is <b>for a halyard [<i>pitirei</i>] to pass through an eye [<i>veshet</i>].</b>
<b>And Rabbi Levi bar Ḥayyata said: One who departs from the deceased should not say to him: Go to peace, but rather</b> he should say: <b>Go in peace. One who departs from the living should not say to him: Go in peace, but rather</b> he should say: <b>Go to peace.</b>
<b>One who departs from the deceased should not say to him: Go to peace, but rather: Go in peace, as it is stated: “And you shall go to your fathers in peace;</b> you shall be buried in a good old age” (Genesis 15:15).
<b>One who departs from the living should not say to him: Go in peace, but rather: Go to peace, as David said to Absalom: “Go in peace”</b> (II Samuel 15:9), and <b>he</b> subsequently <b>went and was hanged;</b> whereas <b>Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace”</b> (Exodus 4:18), and <b>he went and was successful.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Levi said: Anyone who leaves from the synagogue</b> and goes <b>to the study hall or</b> goes <b>from the study hall to the synagogue,</b> i.e., he goes from the mitzva of prayer to the mitzva of Torah study or vice versa, <b>merits to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion”</b> (Psalms 84:8).
With regard to the same verse, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Torah scholars have no rest, even in the World-to-Come,</b> as even there they remain in constant movement and ascent, <b>as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion.”</b> Even when they are in the World-to-Come, they continue to go from strength to strength, until the final redemption will arrive in the end of days and God will appear in Zion.
