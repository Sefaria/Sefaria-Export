Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>thirty-six</b> cases <b>in the Torah</b> with regard to which one who performs a prohibited action intentionally is liable to receive <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b> They are: <b>One who engages in sexual intercourse with</b> his <b>mother; or with the wife of</b> his <b>father,</b> even if she is not his mother; <b>or with</b> his <b>daughter-in-law.</b> The same punishment is imposed on a man <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male [<i>hazekhur</i>], or</b> who copulates <b>with an animal; and a woman who brings an animal upon her</b> to engage in bestiality. The same punishment is imposed on <b>one who engages in intercourse with a woman and her daughter, or</b> with <b>a married woman.</b> The same punishment is imposed on <b>one who engages in intercourse with his sister, or with his father’s sister, or with his mother’s sister, or with his wife’s sister, or with his brother’s wife, or with the wife of his father’s brother, or with the wife of his mother’s brother, or with a menstruating woman.</b>
<b>And</b> these too are liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>One who blasphemes</b> the name of Heaven, <b>and</b> one who <b>worships an idol, and one who gives of his children to <i>Molekh</i></b> (see Leviticus 20:1–5), <b>and a necromancer, and</b> one who <b>desecrates Shabbat. And</b> the same is the punishment of <b>one who is ritually impure who ate sacrificial</b> food; <b>and one who enters the Temple</b> while <b>ritually impure; and one who eats</b> forbidden <b>fat, or</b> consumes <b>blood, or</b> eats meat <b>left over from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>], or</b> eats meat of <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]; and one who slaughters</b> offerings <b>and offers</b> them <b>up outside</b> the Temple.
<b>And</b> these too are liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>One who eats leavened bread on Passover, and one who eats or performs</b> prohibited <b>labor on Yom Kippur. And</b> the same is the punishment of <b>one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness (see Exodus 30:22–33); <b>and one who blends the incense</b> according to the specifications of the incense used in the Temple service for purposes other than use in the Temple; <b>and one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin. <b>And</b> one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for failure to fulfill the mitzva of bringing <b>the Paschal offering and the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> which unlike the cases of prohibitions enumerated in the mishna, are <b>positive mitzvot.</b>
<b>For</b> any of <b>these</b> prohibitions, one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> violation <b>and</b> to bring <b>a sin offering for its unwitting</b> violation. <b>And for their</b> violation in a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to him whether or not he transgressed, he is liable to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering,</b> which provides provisional atonement until he discovers whether or not he transgressed. This is the <i>halakha</i> for all of the transgressions listed above <b>except for one who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he enters the Temple while ritually impure, <b>or</b> partakes of <b>its consecrated items</b> while ritually impure. In these cases he does not bring a provisional guilt offering <b>because he is</b> obligated <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering for a definite transgression. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>even</b> with regard to <b>the one who blasphemes, as it is stated</b> with regard to the sin offering: <b>“You shall have one law for him who performs the action unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:29), <b>excluding</b> one who <b>blasphemes, as he does not perform an action</b> but sins with speech.

Daf 2b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to state this <b>tally</b> of cases where one who performs the action is liable to receive <i>karet</i>? Why does it state a number? All thirty-six are listed in the mishna, and one could simply count them to discover how many there are. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> By listing the tally, the mishna is teaching <b>that if one performed all of them in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive punishment <b>for each and every one,</b> i.e., to bring thirty-six sin offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 73a): The <b>primary categories of labor</b> are <b>forty-less-one; why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of forty-less-one? The Gemara answers: By listing the tally the mishna is teaching <b>that if one performed all of</b> the prohibited labors <b>in one lapse of awareness</b> during which he was unaware of the prohibition involved, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every one.</b>
The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (8b): There are <b>four</b> people <b>who have not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete their purification process and may not eat sacrificial meat until they bring the requisite offerings. The mishna then teaches: And these are the people who have not yet brought an atonement offering: The <i>zav</i>, and the <i>zava</i>, and the woman after childbirth, and the leper. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of four?
The Gemara answers: By listing the tally, the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, who says there are five</b> such individuals. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A convert</b> is also <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering and he may not partake of sacrificial meat, although he was circumcised and immersed in a ritual bath, <b>until the priest sprinkles</b> the <b>blood</b> of his offering on the altar <b>on his</b> behalf. It is <b>for this</b> reason that the mishna <b>teaches four,</b> to emphasize that there are not five such people.
The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in that same mishna (8b): And there are <b>four who bring</b> an offering <b>for the intentional</b> transgression of a prohibition <b>as</b> they do for <b>the unwitting</b> transgression of a prohibition: One who engages in intercourse with a designated maidservant (see Leviticus 19:20–22), a nazirite who became ritually impure (see Numbers 6:9–12), one who takes a false oath that he does not know testimony on behalf of another (Leviticus 5:1), and one who takes a false oath on a deposit, i.e., that that an item belonging to another is not in his possession (Leviticus 5:21–26). <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of four?
The Gemara answers: By listing the tally, the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: The intentional</b> transgressor who takes a false <b>oath on a deposit is not given</b> the opportunity <b>for atonement</b> by bringing an offering. It is <b>for this</b> reason that the mishna <b>teaches four,</b> to emphasize that taking a false oath on a deposit is included in this list.
The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (9a): There are <b>five</b> people who <b>bring one offering for several transgressions,</b> i.e., for violating the same transgression several times; and the mishna then teaches: These individuals bring one offering for several transgressions: One who engages in several acts of intercourse with an espoused maidservant; a nazirite who became ritually impure via several instances of ritual impurity; one who issues a warning to his wife with regard to entering into seclusion with several men; a leper who was afflicted with several instances of leprosy; and a woman who gave birth to several offspring. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of five?
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna lists the tally <b>because</b> he <b>wants to teach the latter clause:</b> This also applies to <b>a nazirite if he became ritually impure with several</b> instances <b>of ritual impurity.</b> The tally of five includes the case of a nazirite. The Gemara explains what the novelty of this case is: <b>And you find this,</b> that a nazirite can contract ritual impurity several times consecutively, in a case <b>where he became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day. <b>And</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is it? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>the naziriteship of purity,</b> i.e., the naziriteship one must observe afresh after his purification, <b>takes effect on</b> the nazirite <b>from</b> the <b>seventh</b> day of his purification process.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>As, if you say</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, that is difficult: <b>Since</b> he says <b>that</b> the <b>naziriteship of purity does not take effect on</b> the nazirite <b>until</b> the <b>eighth</b> day, <b>how can you find</b> a case in which <b>these</b> circumstances apply, i.e., that a nazirite can be considered impure with several instances of ritual impurity in the same term of naziriteship?
The Gemara explains why, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, this is not possible: <b>If</b> this case involves a nazirite <b>who became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day, <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would hold that <b>all these</b> impurities <b>are</b> in fact one instance of <b>long ritual impurity.</b> His reasoning is that the nazirite never reached the eighth day, which would renew his observance of naziriteship in purity. If so, the mishna would not refer to this as a case of multiple impurities.
<b>And if</b> the mishna is referring to a nazirite <b>who became ritually impure on the eighth</b> day <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the eighth</b> day, the ruling of the mishna would not apply either. <b>Since he left</b> his state of impurity <b>at an appropriate time to bring</b> his <b>offering,</b> as he can bring his offering on the eighth day, it is not considered a continuation of the previous ritual impurity and he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate offering <b>for each and every</b> instance of impurity. <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> It is to emphasize this fact that the mishna lists the tally.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the source of this opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and what</b> is the source of this opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that discusses a nazirite who became ritually impure and brought two birds to the Temple: “And the priest shall prepare one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, for he sinned by the soul, <b>and he shall sanctify his head that same day”</b> (Numbers 6:11). The verse is referring <b>to the day of the bringing of his offerings,</b> which is the eighth day of his purification; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> the verse is referring <b>to the day of his shaving,</b> i.e., the seventh day of his purification.
The Gemara returns to its series of questions concerning the mention of tallies in <i>mishnayot</i>. The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (9a): And there are <b>five</b> people who <b>bring a sliding-scale offering,</b> which is determined by the financial status of the sinner; and the mishna then teaches (10b): These bring a sliding-scale offering: One brings such an offering for hearing the voice of an oath, and for a false oath of the utterance of the lips, and for the defiling of the Temple and its sacred foods, and the woman after childbirth, and the leper. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of five?
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna lists the tally <b>because</b> of the <i>halakha</i> taught in the latter clause, <b>as the latter clause teaches,</b> in a different mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 8b): The court is not liable for issuing a ruling with regard to the hearing of a voice, or for a false oath of the utterance of the lips, or for the defiling of the Temple and its sacred foods. The status of the <b>king is like</b> that of the court and he is exempt from bringing an offering in these cases. It is for this reason the mishna teaches <b>five, to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>a king brings a goat,</b> i.e., a fixed sin offering, instead of a sliding-scale offering for the defiling of the Temple and its sacred foods.
The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 2a): There are <b>four primary categories of damage:</b> The category of Ox, the category of Pit, the category of <i>Maveh</i>, and the category of Fire. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of four?
The Gemara answers: By listing the tally, the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Oshaya, who says</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 9:1): <b>There are thirteen primary categories of damage. And according to Rabbi Oshaya, why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of thirteen? By listing the tally, he serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya, who says: There are twenty-four primary categories of damage. And according to Rabbi Ḥiyya, why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of twenty-four? By listing the tally, he serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>an informer</b> who causes the authorities to confiscate the property of another, <b>and</b> a priest <b>who renders</b> another’s offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> as Rabbi Ḥiyya concedes that these are not included in the primary categories of damage.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>The Master said</b> earlier: By listing the tally, the mishna is teaching <b>that if he performed all of them,</b> i.e., he unwittingly violated every prohibition, <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive punishment <b>for each and every one,</b> i.e., to bring thirty-six sin offerings.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the prohibitions against engaging in forbidden intercourse: <b>Granted, you cannot say</b> that one who unwittingly violates every prohibition against engaging in forbidden intercourse is <b>entirely exempt, as it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations,</b> the souls that do them <b>shall be cut off</b> from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), and as they all are punishable by <i>karet</i> he is liable to bring a sin offering for his unwitting transgression. <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that if he <b>transgressed one</b> prohibition <b>he becomes liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering, and likewise if he <b>transgressed all of them in one lapse of awareness</b> he <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>for this</b> reason that <b><i>karet</i></b> which one incurs for engaging in intercourse <b>with one’s sister</b> is <b>singled out</b> and mentioned independently of the other acts of forbidden intercourse (Leviticus 20:17). This serves <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions and teach that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each individual prohibition against forbidden intercourse.
<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say:</b> With regard to one who engages in intercourse with <b>his sister, which the verse detailed</b> separately, <b>he becomes liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for it, but</b> with regard to <b>all</b> the other acts of forbidden intercourse, <b>once</b> he transgressed all of them <b>in one lapse of awareness he becomes liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering for all of them.
The Gemara objects: <b>And according to Rav Beivai bar Abaye, does he not</b> accept <b>that</b> hermeneutical principle <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any matter that was included in a generalization, but was singled out to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i>, <b>was singled out to teach</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> only <b>about itself but to teach</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>about the entire generalization.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>How so?</b> The verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings</b> that belong to the Lord, with his ritual impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). <b>But weren’t peace offerings included in the</b> general category of all <b>sacrificial</b> offerings; <b>why,</b> then, were <b>they</b> explicitly <b>singled out</b> in this verse?
The <i>baraita</i> answers: They were singled out <b>to juxtapose</b> the <i>halakha</i> of other offerings <b>to them,</b> teaching: <b>Just as peace offerings</b> are unique in <b>that they are consecrated for the altar and</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> partaking of <b>them</b> while impure, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> food <b>that is consecrated for the altar,</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> partaking of <b>them</b> while impure. This <b>excludes</b> from this <i>halakha</i> items that are <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance.</b> The same reasoning should apply to the singling out of the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s sister, as it teaches that one is liable separately for all the categories of forbidden relations.
<b>Rav Beivai</b> bar Abaye <b>said to</b> the Sage who raised this difficulty: The discussion of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement should be held <b>apart from that</b> <i>baraita</i>. As, <b>didn’t you say there</b> that the comparison to peace offerings <b>excludes</b> items that are <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance?</b> The matter that was singled out teaches its <i>halakha</i> only with regard to cases that are similar to it. The same reasoning should apply with regard to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s sister.
Rav Beivai elaborates: <b>Here too, just as</b> the case of <b>one’s sister is unique</b> in <b>that she is a forbidden relative who cannot be permitted during the</b> entire <b>life of</b> the one <b>who prohibits her,</b> i.e., her brother, as she will always be his sister, <b>so too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable to bring a sin offering for the transgression of each prohibition applies to <b>any</b> forbidden relative <b>who cannot be permitted in the life of</b> the one <b>who prohibits her.</b> This <b>excludes a married woman, who can be permitted in the life of</b> the one who prohibits her, i.e., <b>her husband,</b> as their relationship can be terminated by means of divorce. If so, one would not be liable to bring a separate sin offering for each instance of engaging in intercourse with a married woman, whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that one is liable to bring a sin offering for violating each of the prohibitions listed in the mishna, including the one concerning a married woman.
<b>Rabbi Yona said</b> in response, <b>and some say</b> this was stated by <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations,</b> the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>Since this is a juxtaposition,</b> it means that in this verse <b>all of those with whom relations are forbidden are juxtaposed to</b> the case of <b>one’s sister,</b> written in that passage, as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>one’s sister</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her alone, so too,</b> with regard to any one of <b>all</b> the cases of forbidden relations, one is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with that woman <b>alone.</b> When a <i>halakha</i> is derived by juxtaposition the cases do not have to be entirely similar.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> this presents a difficulty <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the people who commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> incurred by engaging in intercourse with <b>one’s sister singled out</b> in Leviticus 20:17? It was singled out <b>to judge it,</b> so that the transgressors receive the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i> and not</b> the punishment <b>of lashes.</b> Although they have violated a prohibition, which generally carries the punishment of lashes, they are not flogged, as they are liable to receive the more severe punishment of <i>karet</i>.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>From where does</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak learn <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions and teach that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each violation of the prohibition against forbidden intercourse? Unlike Rabbi Yoḥanan, he cannot derive it from the above verse, as he learns this aforementioned <i>halakha</i> from that verse. The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall not approach a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness <b>as long as she is impure by her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 18:19). Since the verse could have stated simply: And you shall not approach a menstruating woman, the lengthy expression of: “A woman…as long as she is impure by her menstruation,” serves <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render him liable to receive a punishment <b>for each and every woman</b> with whom he engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>let them also derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each violation of the prohibition against forbidden intercourse <b>from</b> the verse cited by Rabbi Yitzḥak: <b>“And</b> you shall not approach <b>a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness <b>as long as she is impure by her menstruation.”</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if they derive that <i>halakha</i> from the same source as Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>for what</b> purpose does the specific instance of <b><i>karet</i></b> stated <b>with regard to one’s sister come?</b> The Gemara answers: The Rabbis <b>require</b> it <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render one liable to bring a separate sin offering for engaging in intercourse <b>with his sister, and</b> for engaging in intercourse <b>with his father’s sister, and</b> for engaging in intercourse <b>with his mother’s sister,</b> in a single lapse of awareness.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it necessary for the verse <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render one liable to bring a separate sin offering with regard to <b>these</b> forbidden relatives? <b>Aren’t they separate categories</b> of prohibitions, <b>and aren’t they separate bodies,</b> i.e., three different people? It is obvious that each act of intercourse will require a separate sin offering. <b>Rather, say</b> as follows: The verse serves <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render one liable to bring a separate sin offering for unwittingly engaging in intercourse <b>with his sister who is</b> also <b>his father’s sister and who is</b> also <b>his mother’s sister,</b> i.e., one is liable to bring three sin offerings despite the fact that all three prohibitions are violated through one act of intercourse with the same person.
The Gemara turns its attention to the other opinion: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, from where does he</b> derive <b>this matter?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from the latter clause of the verse, as it is written: “He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:17). This seemingly superfluous phrase teaches this <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> concerning this mention of <b>“his sister” in the latter clause of the verse, what do they do with it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They require</b> it

Daf 3a

<b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>his sister who is</b> both <b>his father’s daughter and his mother’s daughter,</b> and this serves <b>to say that one does not administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference.</b> Although the verses state a punishment both for one who engages in intercourse with his half sister who is his father’s daughter and for his half sister who is his mother’s daughter, one cannot learn via an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that he should also be punished for engaging in intercourse with his sister from both parents, as punishments are applied only when the Torah expressly imposes them.
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak,</b> who does not interpret the verses in this manner, <b>maintains</b> that <b>one administers punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference. And if you wish, say</b> instead a different reason why Rabbi Yitzḥak does not require this exposition: He <b>derives</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> for engaging in intercourse with a sister from both parents <b>from</b> the <b>warning,</b> i.e., the prohibition that is stated with regard to her. Just as the verse explicitly prohibited engaging in intercourse with a sister from both parents, so too, the same punishment of <i>karet</i> applies to engaging in intercourse with her as it does to engaging in intercourse with other forbidden relatives.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya says: Anywhere you find two</b> different <b>prohibitions, and</b> only <b>one</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> is stated for both of them, you should <b>divide</b> the <b>sin offering between them,</b> i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. <b>And what is</b> this case? One who <b>blends the anointing oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness, for purposes other than use in the Temple, <b>and</b> one who <b>applies</b> this anointing oil to the skin of a person, <b>as it is written: “Upon the flesh of man it shall not be applied,</b> neither shall you make any like it <b>according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32). These are two prohibitions, one for applying the oil and the other for blending it, and <b>one <i>karet</i></b> is stated with regard to both, <b>as it is written: “Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people”</b> (Exodus 30:33).
The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But</b> accordingly, <b>once</b> there are <b>separate prohibitions</b> stated in the Torah with regard to engaging in intercourse with all forbidden relatives (Leviticus, chapter 18), and at the conclusion of that passage it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), it is indicated that the punishments of <i>karet</i> or a sin offering apply to all these prohibitions. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s sister,</b> in a separate passage: “And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:17)?
The Gemara explains: This verse is required to teach one <i>halakha</i> according to the opinion of the Rabbis, and one <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Rabbi Yitzḥak, per his</b> opinion. The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, they require</b> this verse <b>to say that one does not administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference. According to Rabbi Yitzḥak, he derives</b> that this verse comes <b>to deem</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring three separate sin offerings for unwittingly engaging in intercourse <b>with his</b> own <b>sister who is</b> also <b>his father’s sister and who is</b> also <b>his mother’s sister.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: One can say <b>that they derive it from</b> the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the first clause</b> of the verse: “And if a man shall take his sister” (Leviticus 20:17). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak holds</b> that one cannot derive a <i>halakha</i> from the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the first clause,</b> as <b>it is the manner of the verse</b> to describe the case in detail before stating the prohibition that applies to it. <b>And</b> therefore <b>he derives from</b> the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the latter clause</b> of the verse that this comes <b>to separate</b> between the prohibitions and render one liable to bring three separate sin offerings for engaging in intercourse <b>with his</b> own <b>sister who is</b> also <b>his father’s sister and who is</b> also <b>his mother’s sister.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to Rabbi Elazar’s statement that one who unwittingly blends the anointing oil and applies it to the skin is liable to bring two sin offerings. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well: And one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil, and one who blends the incense, and one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin.
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains his inference: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>tanna</i> <b>to teach</b> the clause: <b>One who blends the incense, in the middle,</b> between the two cases concerning the anointing oil? Is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: Just as</b> blending the <b>incense</b> is <b>an independent prohibition and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for it by itself,</b> and to bring a sin offering for its unwitting transgression, <b>so too,</b> with regard to one <b>who blends</b> the anointing <b>oil and</b> one <b>who applies</b> the anointing oil to his skin, <b>since</b> they are each <b>an independent prohibition, one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> each action <b>by itself,</b> and to bring a sin offering for the unwitting transgression of each of them.
<b>And if you would say</b> the mishna uses this order because <b>it wants to teach</b> the two cases involving <b>blending together, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> those two <i>halakhot</i> in the <b>reverse</b> order: <b>One who blends the incense, and one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil, and one who applies the anointing oil.</b> In this manner the two clauses addressing blending would be adjacent, and likewise the two clauses addressing the anointing oil would be adjacent. <b>Why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>divide</b> the cases involving <b>the</b> anointing <b>oil</b> by teaching the <i>halakha</i> of one who blends the incense in between them? Is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this teaches us that there is a separation between</b> the two prohibitions, requiring one to bring two <b>sin offerings?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is the case.
§ The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i> a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male</b> or one who copulates with an animal, and a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality. The Gemara asks: <b>According to what</b> criteria <b>does</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>tally</b> the prohibitions in the mishna? Rabbi Yoḥanan explained that the tally stated in the mishna serves to teach that one who violated every prohibition against engaging in forbidden intercourse in a single lapse of awareness is liable to receive punishment for each and every one. Which individual could have committed all these transgressions?
The Gemara elaborates: <b>If</b> he is referring to prohibitions transgressed <b>by men,</b> then one should <b>remove</b> the case of <b>a woman who brings an animal upon her</b> to engage in bestiality, <b>and</b> if so, <b>one</b> case of <i>karet</i> <b>is lacking from</b> the tally. <b>If</b> he is referring to prohibitions transgressed <b>by women,</b> one should <b>remove from them</b> the case of a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male or with an animal, and</b> if so, <b>two</b> cases of <i>karet</i> <b>are lacking from</b> the tally.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Actually,</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> is referring to prohibitions transgressed by <b>men.</b> One should remove the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, <b>and</b> instead <b>teach</b> the mishna <b>like this:</b> A male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male, and</b> a male <b>who brings</b> another <b>male upon him</b> to engage in intercourse. <b>And</b> this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that one who transgresses both of these prohibitions in a single lapse of awareness is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches in its latter clause</b> the case of one who <b>blasphemes, and we interpret</b> this clause <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it may be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is <b>also</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And if you would say</b> the entire mishna <b>is</b> in fact in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> listed in <b>the first clause he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that is not tenable, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Abbahu say:</b> In the case of a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male, and</b> a male <b>who brings</b> another <b>male upon him</b> to engage in intercourse, <b>according to</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who derives</b> these prohibitions <b>from two</b> separate <b>verses, from: “And you shall not lie with a man</b> as with a woman” (Leviticus 18:22), <b>and from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18), which is referring to one who engages in homosexual intercourse passively, one who transgresses both of these prohibitions in a single lapse of awareness is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings.
Rabbi Abbahu continues: By contrast, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>as he derives</b> both prohibitions <b>from one verse: “You shall not lie [<i>tishkhav</i>] with a man,”</b> in the active form, as one can <b>read</b> the verb <b>in</b> this verse, written in the Torah without vowels, as though it stated: <b>Enable your being lain with [<i>tishakheiv</i>],</b> in the passive. Evidently, Rabbi Akiva disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael with regard to a male who engages in intercourse with another male and a male who brings another male upon him to engage in intercourse.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and with regard to</b> one who <b>blasphemes he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also teach</b> two additional cases with regard to bestiality: <b>One who copulates with an animal,</b> derived from the verse: “And you shall not lie with any beast” (Leviticus 18:23); <b>and</b> a man <b>who brings an animal upon him</b> for bestiality, derived from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel” (Deuteronomy 23:18), which can be interpreted as applying to all forms of male anal intercourse, including with animals.
The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Abaye say:</b> With regard to <b>one who copulates with an animal, and who brings an animal upon him</b> to engage in bestiality, <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael he is liable to</b> bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>as when the verse:</b> “There shall not be a sodomite,” <b>is written, it is written with regard to men,</b> i.e., the term sodomite does not include one who engages in bestiality. In conclusion, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, the mishna is listing prohibitions transgressed by men, and therefore one should remove from the tally the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, and add the case of a man who brings another male upon him to engage in intercourse, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.
The Gemara cites another interpretation: <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is listing prohibitions transgressed by men and not women, but one should not remove from the tally the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality. The reason is that the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>teaches thirty-three</b> prohibitions for which a man brings <b>sin offerings, and he teaches</b> another <b>three</b> instances of <b><i>karet</i></b> in order <b>to complete</b> the list of transgressions for which one is liable to be punished <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b> Those three do not meet the same criteria as the other thirty-three, and the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality is one of those three.
What supports this interpretation? <b>As</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> And one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for failure to fulfill the mitzva of bringing the <b>Paschal offering and</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> which unlike the cases of prohibitions enumerated in the mishna, are <b>positive mitzvot. Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> the cases of the <b>Paschal offering and circumcision?</b>
<b>And if you say</b> the mishna mentions these positive mitzvot <b>to</b> teach that <b>one brings an offering for</b> unwittingly failing to perform <b>them, does one</b> in fact <b>bring</b> an offering in such a case? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The entire Torah is juxtaposed to idolatry, as it is written: “You shall have one law [<i>torah</i>] for him that does unwittingly. But the soul that does with a high hand,</b> whether he be home-born or a stranger, he blasphemes the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people” (Numbers 15:29–30).
The phrase “But the soul that does with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, he blasphemes the Lord” is referring to one who engages in idol worship, and it is derived from here: <b>Just as idol worship</b> is a situation in which the Torah says to a person: <b>Sit and refrain from action,</b> and one who transgresses this prohibition unwittingly must bring a sin offering, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>every</b> transgression in which the Torah says that one must <b>sit and refrain from action,</b> one is liable to bring a sin offering for performing the act. Accordingly, one is not liable to bring an offering for the unwitting failure to perform a positive mitzva, such as bringing the Paschal offering or circumcision.
The Gemara concludes its statement: <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>taught thirty-three</b> prohibitions for which a man brings <b>sin offerings,</b> which apply to <b>one who acts unwittingly, and he taught</b> another <b>three</b> instances of <b><i>karet</i></b> in order <b>to complete</b> the list of transgressions for which one is liable to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>?</b> These three instances are a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, one who fails to bring the Paschal offering, and one who fails to perform circumcision. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is the case.
§ The mishna’s list of prohibitions for whose unwitting violation one must bring a sin offering includes <b>one who desecrates Shabbat.</b> The Sages express their surprise at this ruling and <b>say:</b> The primary labors of <b>Shabbat are forty-less-one,</b> and one is liable to bring a sin offering for each primary labor he violates. That alone totals more than the thirty-six cases mentioned in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> a case where his action was <b>unwitting with regard to Shabbat,</b> i.e., he was unaware it was Shabbat, <b>and</b> his action was <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> in that he was aware that the acts he performed were labors that are prohibited on Shabbat. In that case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, as he committed only a single error.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul that sins in error, from all the commandments of God that may not be performed, and performs from one of them [<i>me’aḥat mehena</i>]” (Leviticus 4:2). The expression “<i>me’aḥat mehena</i>” is interpreted in several ways. One of them is: There is an instance of <b>“them [<i>hena</i>],”</b> i.e., many unwitting transgressions, <b>which is</b> like <b>“one [<i>aḥat</i>],”</b> a single unwitting transgression, in that one is liable to bring only one sin offering. How so? When one performed many labors where his action was <b>unwitting with regard to Shabbat but</b> his action was <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> he brings only one sin offering. That is the case referred to in the mishna.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> a case where his action was <b>intentional with regard to Shabbat,</b> i.e., he knew it was Shabbat, <b>but</b> his action was <b>unwitting with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> as he was unaware they were prohibited. In that case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is liable</b> to bring <b>forty-less-one</b> sin offerings, one for each primary category of labor.
The Gemara elaborates that this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And performs from one of them.”</b> This teaches that there are <b>times when</b> one is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all</b> of his transgressions, <b>and</b> there are <b>times when</b> one is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every</b> transgression. And <b>it is</b> further <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>“one [<i>aḥat</i>],”</b> i.e., the transgression of one prohibition, <b>which is</b> like <b>“them [<i>hena</i>],”</b> i.e., many unwitting transgressions, in that one is liable to bring multiple sin offerings. How so? When one performs many labors where his action was <b>intentional with regard to Shabbat but</b> his action was <b>unwitting with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> he brings multiple sin offerings.
The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i> prefers</b> to state the case of one who performed many labors where his action was <b>unwitting with regard to Shabbat but</b> it was <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> in order to emphasize <b>that he is not exempt from</b> bringing <b>at least</b> one <b>sin offering,</b> even though he performed the acts of labor intentionally.
The Gemara notes: <b>And likewise, you find</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna taught in this manner <b>with regard to idol worship, as he teaches</b> liability to bring one sin offering, despite the fact that the sinner may have performed four prohibited rites: Slaughtering, burning incense, pouring libations, and bowing. How so? This was a case where, as with Shabbat, his actions were <b>unwitting with regard to idol worship,</b> as he did not know he was worshipping an idol, <b>but</b> they were <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>rites,</b> i.e., he was aware these rites are prohibited.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of performing an act <b>unwittingly with regard to idol worship? If we say</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he was standing in a house of idol worship and thought</b> that <b>it was a synagogue and bowed</b> there, and it turned out that he bowed toward an idol, in this situation he commits no transgression: Since <b>his heart was</b> directed <b>toward Heaven</b> it is not even an unwitting transgression.
<b>Rather,</b> one might say it is referring to a case <b>where he saw a statue [<i>andarta</i>]</b> in the image of the king <b>and bowed to it.</b> Again, what are the circumstances of this case? <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where</b> he bowed because <b>he accepted</b> that image <b>upon himself as a god,</b> he engaged in idol worship intentionally and therefore <b>he is subject to</b> death by <b>stoning,</b> and he is not required to bring a sin offering. <b>And if he did not accept</b> that image <b>upon himself as a god</b> and bowed merely in deference to the monarch, <b>it is a meaningless</b> act, not idol worship at all.
<b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case where one bowed <b>out of love</b> for someone who requested that he bow before the statue, <b>or out of fear</b> of someone demanding of him to do so. He was under the impression that unless he wholeheartedly has the intention to worship the idol there is no prohibition involved. This is an unwitting transgression.
The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to Abaye, who says:</b> One who bows to an idol out of love or fear is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. <b>But according to Rava, who says:</b> One who bows to an idol out of love or fear is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering, <b>what can be said?</b> What are the circumstances of an unwitting transgression with regard to idol worship?

Daf 3b

<b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where one says</b> to himself that this is <b>permitted.</b> He is under the impression that idol worship is permitted, and his unwitting act was the result of ignorance, not forgetfulness. <b>As, Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman</b> with regard to Shabbat <b>only</b> so it could be determined <b>whether to deem</b> one who is unaware of both the essence of Shabbat and the specific prohibited labors <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering, <b>or whether to deem</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. <b>But</b> as for the possibility to <b>exempt him completely,</b> he did <b>not raise</b> such <b>a dilemma before him.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa says: You find</b> an act performed unwittingly with regard to idol worship <b>in</b> the case of <b>a child who was taken captive among the gentiles</b> and never taught about the Torah, <b>as</b> he <b>knows that idol worship</b> in general is <b>prohibited, but</b> with regard to <b>these</b> particular objects of <b>idol worship</b> that he is worshipping, he does <b>not know that they are prohibited.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> this ruling is stated <b>with regard to an adult,</b> i.e., one who was not captured by gentiles as a child, and it is speaking of a case <b>where he erred with regard to this verse: “You shall not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold,</b> you shall not make for yourselves” (Exodus 20:20). This person <b>thinks</b> that <b>when bowing</b> to an idol is <b>prohibited</b> it applies only <b>to</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> fashioned <b>of silver or gold; but</b> with regard to objects fashioned <b>of other substances,</b> such as wood or stone, it is <b>permitted. And that is</b> a case of an action that is <b>unwitting with regard to idol worship but intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>rites.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said</b> a different interpretation of the mishna <b>in the name of Rav Beivai:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i> teaches the</b> general <b>category of Shabbat and the</b> general <b>category of idol worship,</b> without mentioning the details of how many sin offerings one would be liable to bring for transgressing each prohibition. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> can one infer this is the case? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: One who engages in intercourse with a woman and her daughter, or with a married woman. But there is</b> the case of <b>one’s daughter from the woman he raped, which</b> the mishna <b>does not teach.</b> The case of a daughter from the woman one raped is included in the category of intercourse with a woman and her daughter, yet it is not taught explicitly. Evidently, it is included in the general category of intercourse with a woman and her daughter.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response to this inference: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> those prohibitions <b>that are written</b> explicitly in the Torah; he <b>does not teach</b> those prohibitions <b>that are not written</b> explicitly but are derived from the verses. That is the reason he does not teach the case of intercourse with a daughter from the woman one raped; it is not because he is teaching only general categories.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>one’s wife’s daughter, and the daughter of her daughter, and the daughter of her son, which are written</b> explicitly, <b>and</b> yet the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> them. <b>Rather,</b> you must say that <b>he teaches the</b> general <b>category of</b> intercourse with <b>a woman and her daughter,</b> which includes those cases. <b>So too, he teaches the</b> general <b>category of Shabbat and the</b> general <b>category of idol worship.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, raises a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of</b> Rav Beivai bar Abaye <b>and</b> another statement <b>of his: Did Rav Beivai bar Abaye</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches the</b> general <b>category of Shabbat and teaches the</b> general <b>category of idol worship? But wasn’t it stated: One who offers up the limbs of</b> an offering slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple <b>outside</b> the Temple, i.e., he slaughtered the animal within the Sanctuary in accordance with <i>halakha</i> but sacrificed its limbs on an altar outside the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering if he did so unwittingly. Likewise, if he sacrifices <b>limbs of</b> an offering slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>outside</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable.</b>
<b>And Rav Beivai bar Abaye</b> raised <b>a difficulty: If so,</b> consider <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna: There are <b>thirty-six</b> cases <b>in the Torah</b> with regard to which one who performs the action intentionally is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>. They are</b> actually <b>thirty-seven, as there is</b> the case of <b>one who offers up</b> the limbs of an offering slaughtered inside the Temple outside the Temple, <b>and one who offers up</b> limbs of an offering slaughtered outside the Temple outside the Temple. Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, explains the contradiction: If Rav Beivai bar Abaye maintains that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna does not tally all the relevant prohibitions but states general categories, <b>what</b> is <b>difficult to him? Let him answer</b> that <b>he teaches the category of offering up</b> in the clause: One who slaughters offerings and who sacrifices them outside the Temple. The <i>tanna</i> would not then need to list these individual transgressions.
The Gemara responds: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?</b> In the cases of <b>Shabbat and idol worship</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> their details <b>in their places [<i>abeinekheihon</i>],</b> on <i>Shabbat</i> 73a and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 60b, respectively. Consequently, <b>with regard to <i>karet</i>, where it is necessary</b> to mention them as part of a list of prohibitions that are punishable by <i>karet</i>, Rav Beivai bar Abaye <b>answers</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches the category of Shabbat and teaches the category of idol worship,</b> but he did not need to specify the details in this manner. By contrast, <b>with regard to bringing up</b> an offering, <b>does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach them</b> in <b>their place,</b> so <b>that</b> Rav Beivai bar Abaye can <b>answer</b> in <b>this</b> manner?
§ It was stated earlier that Rabbi Elazar says that Rabbi Oshaya says: Anywhere you find two different prohibitions but only one punishment of <i>karet</i> is stated for both of them you should divide the sin offering between them, i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If there are <b>two</b> punishments of <b><i>karet</i> and</b> only <b>one prohibition</b> written with regard to a certain act, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is one liable to bring a separate sin offering for each act? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Are you saying</b> this in reference to one <b>who slaughters</b> offerings outside the Temple <b>and</b> one <b>who offered up</b> the limbs of offerings outside the Temple? These do not match your description, as <b>these are two</b> separate <b>prohibitions.</b>
Rabbi Zeira elaborates: <b>If</b> one considers the matter <b>according to the one who derives</b> the prohibition <b>from a verbal analogy,</b> it is as though both prohibitions are written explicitly. As <b>it is stated here</b> an expression of <b>bringing:</b> “Or who slaughters it outside the camp, and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” (Leviticus 17:3–4), <b>and it is stated there</b> an expression of <b>bringing:</b> “Who sacrifices a burnt offering or sacrifice, and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” (Leviticus 17:8–9).
Since there is a verbal analogy linking slaughtering an offering outside the Temple to sacrificing one outside the Temple, it follows that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to sacrificing, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, as it is written: “Take heed to yourself, lest you sacrifice your burnt offerings in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act as a separate prohibition.
If one considers the matter <b>according to the one who derives</b> the prohibition <b>from a juxtaposition,</b> it is also as though both prohibitions are written explicitly. The juxtaposition is that <b>the verse states: “There you shall sacrifice</b> your burnt offerings <b>and there you shall do</b> all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14). Here the verse <b>juxtaposes slaughtering,</b> in the phrase: “And there you shall do,” <b>to offering up.</b> This teaches that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to offering up, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act. Whether one derives the prohibition by verbal analogy or juxtaposition, it is considered as though the Torah explicitly wrote a prohibition with regard to slaughtering, and therefore this would not meet the criteria of Rabbi Yirmeya’s dilemma.
Rabbi Zeira continues to address Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Perhaps you are stating</b> your dilemma with regard to <b>two</b> prohibitions punishable by the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> only <b>one prohibition</b> is written with regard to them, and your dilemma is whether one brings two sin offerings if one transgressed both unwittingly, despite the fact that only one prohibition is written with regard to both acts. <b>What is</b> such a circumstance? This applies in the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> who raises up the spirit of the dead, <b>and a sorcerer,</b> who places a certain bone in his mouth for it to speak of its own accord (see Leviticus 20:6, 27).
Rabbi Zeira further <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: This should not be a dilemma, <b>as this</b> matter is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. As</b> the Sages <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>, where they list those liable to be executed by stoning, <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Sanhedrin</i></b> (53a): <b>A necromancer and a sorcerer, and</b> the following presents <b>a difficulty to us: And what is different with regard to stonings</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer, but</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer with regard to</b> the list of transgressions punishable by <b><i>karet</i>,</b> thereby indicating that one is liable to bring only a single sin offering for both transgressions?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> in tractate <i>Karetot</i> does not count the case of the sorcerer on its own <b>since both</b> the sorcerer and the necromancer <b>were stated in one prohibition:</b> “Do not turn to the necromancers and the sorcerers” (Leviticus 19:31); therefore, there is no separate obligation to bring an offering for each of them. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer and let him not say</b> the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> rather than the reverse. The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>since the verse opened with</b> the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> it is proper to list that transgression and omit the case of a sorcerer.
<b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> The case of the sorcerer is not included in the list of transgressions punishable by <i>karet</i> <b>since it does not involve an action,</b> but only speech, through the use of a bone, and one does not bring a sin offering for a prohibition that does not involve an action. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish, what is the reason he does not state</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Reish Lakish disagrees with the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>because</b> the cases of a necromancer and a sorcerer <b>are divided</b> in the verse <b>with regard to</b> the issue of the <b>death</b> penalty, i.e., one is liable to receive the death penalty for transgressing either prohibition, as it is stated: “And a man also or a woman, who are a necromancer or a sorcerer shall be put to death” (Leviticus 20:27). Consequently, one would be liable to bring a separate sin offering for the unwitting transgression of either prohibition were it not for the fact that sorcery does not involve an action. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>a division of a prohibition is</b> considered <b>a division</b> that leads to separate sin offerings, whereas <b>a division of</b> separate <b>death</b> penalties <b>is not</b> considered <b>a division</b> in this regard.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason he does not state</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who says the prohibition with regard to a sorcerer is not counted because it does not involve an action? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>maintains: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the list of those liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>? It is Rabbi Akiva, who says: An action is not required</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish,</b> how does he respond to this claim? He could say that <b>although Rabbi Akiva does not require a significant action</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering, nevertheless he <b>does require a minor action.</b> The transgression of a sorcerer involves no action, as the voice emerges of its own accord, and therefore even Rabbi Akiva would not hold one liable to bring a sin offering for the unwitting violation of this prohibition.
The Gemara asks: In the case of <b>a necromancer, what action is there in</b> this transgression? The Gemara answers: <b>The striking of his arms</b> against each other to raise the spirit of the dead <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b> The Gemara further asks: In the case of one who <b>blasphemes,</b> who merely speaks, <b>what action is there in</b> this transgression? Since Rabbi Akiva holds that an unwitting blasphemer is liable to bring a sin offering, this apparently indicates that no action at all is necessary. The Gemara answers: <b>The twisting of his lips</b> while he speaks <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b>
The Gemara comments: It <b>enters our mind</b> that <b>the striking of</b> the necromancer’s <b>arms</b> against each other <b>is</b> considered <b>a minor action even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and they would deem him liable. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to idol worship, one is liable</b> to be punished <b>only for a matter that involves an action, for example where one slaughtered</b> an offering, <b>or burned</b> incense, <b>or poured</b> a libation, <b>or bowed. And</b> the following matter poses <b>a difficulty to us: Bowing does not involve an action.</b>
<b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: An action is not required</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering for transgressing a prohibition. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>the bending of his height</b> when he bows <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b> One can conclude from here <b>by inference that Reish Lakish maintains</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, the bending of his height is not</b> considered <b>an action.</b> If so, can it be said that <b>the striking of his arms</b> against each other, which is less of a movement than bending one’s height, <b>is</b> considered <b>an action?</b>
<b>But rather,</b> you must explain that <b>when Reish Lakish says the striking of his arms</b> against each other <b>is</b> considered <b>a minor action,</b> he is speaking only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva; but according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> it <b>is not</b> considered <b>an action.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that the Rabbis hold that the necromancer does not perform an action, <b>why</b> does the mishna <b>teach</b> that the Rabbis say: The list in the mishna is <b>excluding</b> one who <b>blasphemes, as he does not perform an action,</b> but rather he sins with speech. <b>Let it teach</b> instead: The list in the mishna is <b>excluding</b> one who <b>blasphemes and a necromancer.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches one of two</b> examples that the Rabbis could have mentioned.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> if that is so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the statement of the Rabbis with regard to <b>a necromancer and let it not teach</b> the statement of the Rabbis with regard to one who <b>blasphemes.</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention one who <b>blasphemes,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since its</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i> is written in the place</b> where the verse discusses <b>an offering</b> (see Numbers 15:28–30), one might <b>say</b> that in this case the Rabbis <b>concede to Rabbi Akiva</b> that one is liable to bring a sin offering despite the fact that no action is involved. To counter this, the mishna specifically mentions the exclusion of one who blasphemes to <b>teach us that</b> this is <b>not</b> the case.
<b>Ulla said:</b> The reason the Rabbis did not state: Excluding one who blasphemes and a necromancer, is that the action of the <b>necromancer that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>burns</b> incense <b>to a demon</b> in order to raise the dead, which is a full-fledged action. <b>Rava objects to this</b> answer from Ulla: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the necromancer burns incense to a demon, <b>this is</b> the same as <b>an idol worshipper,</b> which is already mentioned in the mishna. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The mishna is referring to one who <b>burns</b> incense <b>to a demon in order to gather it</b> together with other demons, i.e., he does not burn incense to a demon by means of a rite but in a manner of sorcery, to bring the demons to one place to then make use of them.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as <b>a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>,</b> one who gathers together, which is stated in the Torah as a separate prohibition (Deuteronomy 18:11) and which is a prohibition that does not carry the punishment of <i>karet</i>. Rava <b>said to him:</b> It is true that such an individual is also a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>, but <b>the Torah stated: A <i>ḥover ḥever</i> such as this,</b> who gathers demons together, is included in the category of a necromancer and therefore his punishment is death <b>by stoning,</b> and transgressing this prohibition also results in <i>karet</i>. Abaye inquired: <b>But</b> then the case of <b>a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>, which</b> is <b>a prohibition</b> that does not entail <i>karet</i>, <b>what</b> is <b>it?</b>
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And a <i>ḥover ḥaver</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:11), this is referring to both <b>one</b> who uses sorcery and thereby <b>gathers large</b> beasts into one place, <b>and</b> also to <b>one</b> who <b>gathers small</b> beasts into one place, <b>and even</b> to one who <b>gathers</b> into one place <b>snakes and scorpions;</b> all of these individuals are <b>liable.</b> With regard to this prohibition <b>Abaye says:</b> In the case of <b>this one, who</b> through sorcery <b>wants to gather</b> together <b>a hornet and a scorpion,</b> this is <b>prohibited. But if they are pursuing him</b> and he merely seeks to defend himself, it is <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says the bending of one’s height is</b> considered <b>an action, the twisting of</b>

Daf 4a

<b>his lips should be</b> considered <b>an action in</b> the case of one who <b>blasphemes. Rava said:</b> The case of one who <b>blasphemes is different, since it is</b> primarily <b>in the heart.</b> In other words, the transgression of blasphemy is not the actual speech but the verbalizing of a sentiment. One is not liable to bring a sin offering for such an action, as it is essentially a matter of the heart. <b>But in general, the twisting of one’s lips is</b> considered <b>an action.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from that which is taught in a different context. It is stated in a <i>baraita</i> that all who unwittingly transgress prohibitions punishable by death are liable to bring sin offerings, <b>except for conspiring witnesses,</b> who are not obligated to bring sin offerings, <b>as</b> their transgression <b>does not involve an action. But why</b> is that so? <b>It is written with regard to</b> such witnesses: <b>“At the mouth</b> of two witnesses” (Deuteronomy 17:6). They acted through speech, and the twisting of their lips should be considered an action, as they are liable for what they actually said, not for what was in their hearts. <b>Rava said:</b> The case of <b>conspiring witnesses is different, since their</b> transgression <b>is</b> primarily <b>through sight,</b> i.e., the important part of their testimony is what they saw, which is not an action.
§ The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i> <b>one who eats</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> which deals with the verse: <b>“You shall eat no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). This verse serves <b>to render one liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every one,</b> i.e., one who eats the fat of an ox, and a sheep, and a goat is liable to receive three sets of lashes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. And the Rabbis say he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rabbi Yishmael and the Rabbis <b>disagree about this</b> matter, <b>that Rabbi Yishmael maintains one is flogged for</b> violating <b>a general prohibition and the Rabbis maintain one is not flogged for</b> violating <b>a general prohibition.</b> This is referring to the violation of a prohibition that includes several different actions, such as this one, which pertains to eating the fat of an ox, sheep, and goat. The Rabbis contend that one does not receive multiple sets of lashes for transgressing each element of such a prohibition.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, Rabbi Yishmael</b> also <b>maintains</b> that <b>one is not flogged for</b> violating <b>a general prohibition, but here it is different, as</b> elements of <b>the verse are superfluous.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Let the verse write</b> only: <b>You shall eat no fat,</b> and all the individual types of fat would be included. <b>Why do I</b> need the additional terms: <b>“Ox, or sheep, or goat”? Learn from it</b> that the verse serves <b>to separate</b> between them and render one liable to receive a separate set of lashes for eating each type of forbidden fat.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> how do they respond to this reading of the verse? The Gemara answers: The Rabbis would say that no element of the verse is superfluous, since <b>if</b> it had <b>not written: “Ox, or sheep, or goat,” I would say</b> that <b>even</b> the <b>fat of an undomesticated animal is included</b> in the prohibition. <b>For this</b> reason the verse <b>writes: “Ox, or sheep, or goat,” to say that it is</b> the <b>fat of an ox, or a sheep, or a goat that is forbidden, but</b> all the fats <b>of an undomesticated animal are permitted.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this interpretation of the dispute: The Rabbis <b>spoke well to</b> Rabbi Yishmael, i.e., their response is persuasive. The Gemara suggests an alternative explanation: <b>Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yishmael, as he holds: If so,</b> that the verse serves to exclude the fat of only an undomesticated animal from the prohibition, then <b>let it write: You shall eat no fat of an ox,</b> which would be understood as a paradigm representing every type of domesticated animal. <b>Why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“Sheep or goat”? Learn from it</b> that the verse serves <b>to separate</b> between them and render one liable to receive a separate set of lashes for eating each type of forbidden fat.
<b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: You shall eat no <b>fat of an ox, I would say: Let us derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“ox”</b> stated here as a paradigm representing every type of domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>] and the word <b>“ox,”</b> i.e., <i>behema</i>, stated with regard to a mitzva given in preparation for the revelation at <b>Sinai:</b> “Whether it be animal [<i>behema</i>] or man, it shall not live” (Exodus 19:13).
The Gemara explains the meaning of this hypothetical verbal analogy: <b>Just as with regard to</b> the command at <b>Sinai, undomesticated animals and birds are</b> subject to the same prohibition <b>as</b> domesticated animals despite the use of the term <i>behema</i>, <b>so too, with regard to eating</b> their fat, <b>undomesticated animals and birds are</b> subject to the same prohibition <b>as</b> domesticated animals despite the verse employing the example of an ox. <b>For this</b> reason <b>the Merciful One writes: “Ox, or sheep, or goat,” to say that these are forbidden, but</b> all the fats of <b>an undomesticated animal and birds are permitted.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this interpretation of the dispute: The Rabbis <b>spoke well to</b> Rabbi Yishmael, i.e., their response is persuasive. How could he say the terms in the verse are superfluous? The Gemara suggests an alternative explanation: <b>Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yishmael, as he holds: Let</b> the verse <b>write: You shall eat no fat of sheep; alternatively,</b> let it state: <b>You shall eat no fat of goat. Why do I</b> need the verse to state all three: <b>“Ox, or sheep, or goat”? Learn from it</b> that the verse serves <b>to separate</b> between them and render one liable to receive a separate set of lashes for eating each type of forbidden fat.
<b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>if</b> the Torah <b>had written</b> merely: <b>You shall eat no fat of sheep, I would say</b> it is only <b>the fat of sheep</b> that is <b>forbidden, but</b> the fat of <b>an ox or a goat</b> is <b>permitted. And if you would say:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> the category <b>of sheep stronger,</b> i.e., more fitting to have its fats forbidden, than the categories of ox and goats, that one would think the prohibition applies only to sheep? The answer is that one might have thought so <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> there is <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to</b> a sheep’s <b>tail,</b> as it is sacrificed upon the altar, which is not the case with an ox or a goat.
<b>And</b> this is <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina taught: Why does the verse list</b> the obligation to burn the <b>sacrificial portions</b> on the altar <b>with regard to</b> a firstborn <b>ox, and</b> the obligation to burn the <b>sacrificial portions [<i>ve’eimurim</i>] with regard to</b> a firstborn <b>sheep, and</b> the obligation to burn the <b>sacrificial portions with regard to</b> a firstborn <b>goat? As it is written: “But the firstborn of a bull,</b> or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are sacred. You shall dash their blood against the altar, and shall make their fat smoke for an offering made by fire” (Numbers 18:17). The “fat” mentioned in this verse is their portions to be burned on the altar.
Rabbi Ḥanina explains: These repetitions <b>are necessary, as, if</b> the Torah <b>had written</b> this obligation only with regard to a firstborn <b>ox I would say</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sheep and a goat from it, as</b> that derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about an ox?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> an ox <b>has an increased</b> number <b>of</b> wine <b>libations,</b> more than those poured with sheep and goat offerings. Therefore, perhaps the additional obligation to burn the sacrificial portions applies only with regard to an ox.
And likewise, if you were to suggest: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions only <b>with regard to a sheep and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an ox and a goat from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sheep,</b> that derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about a sheep?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> there is <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to</b> a sheep’s <b>tail,</b> as explained earlier.
And similarly, if you suggest: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions only with regard to <b>a goat, and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an ox and a sheep from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a goat, this too <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about a goat?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a goat <b>has an increased</b> applicability <b>with regard to idol worship,</b> as one who sins unwittingly in the case of idol worship is liable to bring a goat as a sin offering (see Numbers 15:27), unlike one who transgresses other prohibitions unwittingly, for which they are liable to bring a sheep.
Rabbi Ḥanina continues: <b>We cannot derive</b> these <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of any <b>one</b> of the others, but <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write two</b> of them <b>and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one</b> of them <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the other <b>two. Which</b> is <b>this</b> animal that should not be written? If one suggests <b>we will derive</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions of a firstborn <b>ox from</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions of <b>a sheep and a goat,</b> this derivation <b>has a refutation: What</b> is notable <b>about a sheep and a goat?</b> They are notable <b>in that</b> that <b>they have increased</b> applicability, as they are suitable <b>for the Paschal offering,</b> whereas an ox is not suitable for this purpose.
If one suggests the verse should <b>not write</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions of <b>a sheep, and we will derive</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an ox and a goat,</b> this derivation <b>has a refutation: What</b> is notable <b>about an ox and a goat?</b> They are notable <b>in that they have increased</b> applicability as suitable offerings to atone <b>for</b> an unwitting transgression of <b>idol worship,</b> as when a community unwittingly sins with regard to idol worship they bring an ox as a burnt offering and a goat as a sin offering (see Numbers 15:24), while an individual brings a goat but not a sheep.
If one suggests that the verse should <b>not write</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions of <b>a goat, and we will derive</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an ox and a sheep,</b> this derivation <b>has a refutation: What</b> is notable <b>about an ox and a sheep?</b> They are notable <b>in that each</b> of them <b>has an increased aspect</b> of applicability with regard to the altar, as the libations for an ox are greater than those for a goat, and the tail of a sheep, but not that of a goat, is burned on the altar. Rabbi Ḥanina concludes: <b>Therefore,</b> all three cases are necessary, as <b>they cannot be derived from each other.</b>
The Rabbis have explained why all three mentions of an ox, a sheep, and a goat are necessary. Consequently, the Gemara again states: The Rabbis <b>spoke well to</b> Rabbi Yishmael, i.e., their response is persuasive. The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, the reason of Rabbi Yishmael</b> is <b>actually as we said at the outset, that if so,</b> that one who eats the forbidden fats of all three animals is liable to receive only one set of lashes, <b>let</b> the verse <b>write:</b> You shall eat no <b>fat, and be silent. What did you say</b> in response? That <b>this</b> fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>writes: “Ox, or sheep, or goat,”</b> serves <b>to permit</b> the <b>fat of an undomesticated animal?</b> This is not a valid objection.
The Gemara explains: <b>When the verse</b> concerning forbidden fat <b>is written</b> it is <b>in the context of sacrificial</b> animals, since the subsequent verse concerning the prohibition against eating forbidden fat states: “For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:25). The verse categorizes an animal whose fat one may not eat as an “animal of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord,” i.e., offerings. <b>And</b> one of the thirteen hermeneutical principles is: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context,</b> i.e., one interprets a verse according to the context in which it is written. Since offerings may be brought only from domesticated, not undomesticated, animals, the prohibition against eating forbidden fat applies only to such animals.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: Can one conclude <b>by inference that the Rabbis maintain we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> by employing the hermeneutical principle of: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context?</b> This cannot be correct, as it is an accepted basic principle of exegesis. The Gemara answers: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that <b>we do derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> by employing the hermeneutical principle of: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context, and here</b> it is <b>about this</b> issue <b>that they disagree: Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another <b>prohibition,</b> and this applies <b>whether</b> it is <b>from</b> a standard <b>prohibition,</b> whose transgression results in the punishment of lashes, <b>or whether from a prohibition</b> whose transgression results in the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i>.</b>
Accordingly, the prohibition <b>of:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat,”</b> can be derived <b>from the prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood”</b> (Leviticus 3:17), <b>which is written with regard to the matter of sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And there are no undomesticated animals in</b> the category of <b>sacrificial</b> animals. <b>So too,</b> with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox,</b> or sheep, or goat,” <b>when</b> the verse <b>writes it without</b> further <b>specification, there is no</b> reason <b>to be uncertain</b> whether or not it is referring also <b>to undomesticated animals. Therefore,</b> the phrase <b>“ox, or sheep, or goat” comes to separate,</b> i.e., <b>to render one liable for</b> eating the forbidden fat of <b>each and every one</b> of them.
All this teaches only that a separate prohibition applies to each type of animal. <b>And</b> with regard to the liability to receive lashes for eating each one <b>we derive the prohibition of:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat,” and the prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute,” from the</b> example of <b><i>karet</i></b> stated in the verse: <b>“For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal, of which people present</b> an offering of fire to the Lord, the soul that eats it shall be cut off from its people” (Leviticus 7:25). <b>Just as that</b> verse serves <b>to separate</b> and teach that if one unwittingly ate the fat of an ox, a goat, and a sheep he is liable to bring a sin offering for each one, <b>so too, this</b> verse serves <b>to separate</b> and teach that one is liable to receive lashes for eating the fat of each one.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one standard <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another standard <b>prohibition,</b> but <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a standard <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a prohibition whose transgression results in the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is the reason of the Rabbis: As Rav Mari said to Rav Zevid</b> when asked about a different issue: <b>If that is so,</b> that a sheep tail is categorized as fat by the verses and is included in the portions of an offering for which one is liable for the misuse of consecrated property, then the <b>tail of a non-sacred</b> animal <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption as forbidden fat. Rav Zevid <b>said to</b> Rav Mari: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> concerning forbidden fat: “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). This teaches that for the prohibition against eating forbidden fat to take effect <b>we require an item that is</b> found <b>equally in all three</b> types of animals, an ox, and a sheep, and a goat, <b>and that is not</b> the case here. Since an ox and goat do not have tails, the tail is not prohibited even in the case of a sheep.
<b>Therefore,</b> the same applies with regard to the issue at hand: <b>When</b> the verse <b>“ox, or sheep, or goat” comes, it comes to permit</b> consumption of the <b>tail of a non-sacred</b> animal, and one cannot learn from here that a separate prohibition applies to each type of forbidden fat. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael</b> could <b>say to you</b> in response: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>state:</b> You shall eat <b>no fat of ox or sheep; why do I</b> need the mention of <b>a goat? Learn from it</b> that the verse serves <b>to separate</b> between them and render one liable to receive lashes for eating each type of forbidden fat.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Although <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> maintains that one who unwittingly eats the fat of an ox, a sheep, and a goat is liable to receive a separate set of lashes for each one, he <b>concedes with regard to</b> bringing <b>an offering that</b> if he ate those types of forbidden fat in a single lapse of awareness he <b>brings only one sin offering. What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that this prohibition is not similar to the prohibition of those with whom relations are forbidden.</b> As derived in the Gemara on 2b, one who unwittingly engages in intercourse with many women to whom he is forbidden is liable to bring a sin offering for each act. In that context the verse states a separate prohibition for each forbidden relative, whereas in this case there is a single prohibition that applies to the forbidden fat of all domesticated animals.
§ With regard to the sin offering required of one who transgresses the prohibition against eating forbidden fat, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul that sins in error, from all the commandments of God that may not be performed, and from one of them” (Leviticus 4:2). This phrase should be interpreted as though it states: <b>And performs one,</b> and again states: <b>And performs them,</b> i.e., it serves <b>to render one liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every</b> transgression.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This teaches <b>that if one ate</b> forbidden <b>fat and</b> again ate forbidden <b>fat,</b> if it was from <b>one category,</b> i.e., the same type of forbidden fat, and he ate it <b>in two lapses of awareness,</b> that is, he was made aware of his sin after the first instance of consumption and then again ate unwittingly, he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. If he ate forbidden fat from <b>two categories,</b> as the Gemara will soon explain, <b>in one lapse of awareness,</b> he is likewise <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said to Rav Ḥisda: Granted,</b> one who ate forbidden fat from <b>one category in two lapses of awareness</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings, as this is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the lapses of awareness separate</b> between his transgressions; each time he becomes aware of his transgression he is liable to bring another sin offering. <b>But</b> in a case where he ate forbidden fat from <b>two categories in one lapse of awareness, why</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings? <b>We require separate lapses of awareness and that is not</b> the case here.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he ate</b> forbidden <b>fat left over from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>], as he is liable due to</b> eating <b><i>notar</i> and</b> is also liable <b>due to</b> eating forbidden <b>fat.</b> These are the two categories mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him: If so,</b> that the case involves more than one prohibition, <b>let him be liable due to</b> eating <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>as well,</b> and he should be liable to bring a guilt offering for the unwitting misuse of consecrated property (see Leviticus 5:14–16).
<b>Rather, Rav Sheshet said:</b> Here we are dealing with a case <b>where he ate</b> forbidden <b>fat of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>and</b> this ruling <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who renders one liable to bring two sin offerings for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial food. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat of an animal carcass,</b> or if he <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat of sacrificial</b> animals, he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes, either for transgressing the prohibitions of eating forbidden fat and eating an animal carcass, or for both eating forbidden fat and transgressing the prohibition forbidding a non-priest to partake of sacrificial animals. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat of sacrificial</b> animals he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes, because there are two separate prohibitions of forbidden fat in the case of sacrificial animals, as the Gemara will soon explain, in addition to the prohibition forbidding a non-priest to partake of sacrificial animals.
The Gemara comments: <b>They laughed at this</b> suggestion <b>in the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael: <b>And let us interpret</b> this <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where</b> he ate the forbidden <b>fat of an ox, and</b> of <b>a sheep, and</b> of <b>a goat, and</b> explain that <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes for the different types of fat, if he did so intentionally and was forewarned.

Daf 4b

<b>Why</b> does one <b>not interpret</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael?</b> The reason is <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Although <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> maintains that one who eats the fat of an ox, a sheep, and a goat is liable to receive a separate set of lashes for each one, he <b>would concede with regard to</b> bringing <b>an offering that</b> if he ate those types of forbidden fat in a single lapse of awareness <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one sin offering. Now too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should not be interpreted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer say: Rabbi Yehuda would concede with regard to</b> bringing <b>an offering that</b> if one ate forbidden fat of sacrificial animals he <b>brings only one sin offering?</b>
<b>Rather, Reish Lakish said in the name of</b> the Sage <b>bar Ta’utni: What are we dealing with here,</b> where one is liable to bring two sin offerings for eating forbidden fat of two categories? We are dealing with a case <b>in which he ate</b> the forbidden fat <b>from two dishes,</b> i.e., where each part was prepared in a different manner, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, who says</b> that <b>dishes</b> serve to <b>separate</b> the acts of eating. One who eats forbidden food from two different dishes in the course of a single lapse of awareness is considered to have transgressed two prohibitions and is liable to bring a sin offering for each one.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat of an animal carcass</b> he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes for transgressing the prohibitions of eating forbidden fat and consuming an animal carcass. If he <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat of sacrificial</b> animals, he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes, for both eating forbidden fat and transgressing the prohibition forbidding a non-priest to partake of sacrificial animals. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat of sacrificial</b> animals, he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes.
<b>Rav Sheizevi said to Rava: Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, this is</b> the meaning of the three <b>verses that are written: “It shall be a perpetual statute</b> throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17); <b>“You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23); <b>“And no non-priest shall partake of the sacred food”</b> (Leviticus 22:10), as <b>these</b> are <b>three prohibitions,</b> two for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial animals, as the two verses that mention fat are discussing sacrificial animals, and one for the prohibition forbidding a non-priest to partake of consecrated food. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is their reasoning?</b> Why is one liable to receive only two sets of lashes?
The Gemara answers: The Rabbis <b>maintain</b> that the <b>prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute,”</b> was stated <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, <b>but the prohibition of:</b> “You shall eat no <b>fat of ox,”</b> was stated <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals. Therefore, if one ate forbidden fat of sacrificial animals he is liable to receive only two sets of lashes. <b>And</b> both verses <b>are necessary,</b> as one could not have been derived from the other.
<b>As, had the Merciful One written</b> the prohibition against eating forbidden fat only <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals <b>I would say: It is</b> only in the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>whose</b> prohibitions are generally <b>stringent, that</b> their <b>fat is forbidden. But</b> with regard to <b>non-sacred</b> animals one might <b>say</b> their fat is <b>not</b> forbidden. It is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One writes:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox.”</b>
<b>And</b> by contrast, <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only: “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox,” I would say: It is</b> only the <b>fat</b> of <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>that is forbidden, since</b> there are <b>no</b> circumstances in <b>which its general prohibition was permitted,</b> i.e., those fats of domesticated animals are always forbidden. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>whose general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, i.e., with regard to the rest of its meat after the blood has been sprinkled, <b>I would say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that their meat was permitted, their fat was permitted as well.</b> Therefore, both verses <b>are necessary,</b> in order to teach that the prohibition against eating forbidden fat applies equally to sacrificial animals and non-sacred animals.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>when it is written:</b> “You shall eat no <b>fat of ox,” it is</b> also <b>written with regard to the matter of sacrificial</b> animals, as it is stated after the prohibition against eating forbidden fat: “For whoever eats the fat of the animal, of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:25), and this is derived by employing the hermeneutical principle: A matter is derived from its context.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> can one conclude from here <b>by inference that the Rabbis maintain we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> by employing the hermeneutical principle of: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context?</b> This cannot be correct, as it is an accepted, basic principle of exegesis.
The Gemara answers: <b>No; everyone</b> agrees we do derive <i>halakhot</i> by employing the hermeneutical principle of: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context. And</b> it is <b>about this</b> issue <b>that they disagree: Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another <b>prohibition, and</b> we derive the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a prohibition from</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and therefore he derives that the prohibition: “You shall eat no fat of ox,” is also written with regard to sacrificial animals from the nearby verse concerning <i>karet</i>, which is referring to sacrificial animals. <b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain that generally <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another <b>prohibition,</b> but <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a prohibition from</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial animals.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, then <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, for what</b> purpose does the verse: “It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that <b>you shall eat neither fat nor blood”</b> (Leviticus 3:17), <b>come?</b> After all, he has already derived the prohibition against eating the forbidden fat of sacrificial animals from the verse: “You shall eat no fat of ox.” The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it to juxtapose</b> the prohibition against consuming blood to the prohibition against eating forbidden fat. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall eat neither fat nor blood,”</b> which teaches that <b>just as</b> for eating forbidden <b>fat</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>so too,</b> for eating <b>blood</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: Only one prohibition applies to</b> blood.
The Gemara asks: Why is the juxtaposition necessary according to Rabbi Yehuda? <b>And what is different</b> about forbidden <b>fat that</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that one who eats it <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes even <b>without</b> needing to derive the double punishment from <b>a juxtaposition?</b> The reason must be <b>that two verses are written with regard to it: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood,”</b> and: <b>“You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep.”</b> With regard to <b>blood as well,</b> even <b>without</b> deriving the <i>halakha</i> from <b>a juxtaposition,</b> one who consumes it <b>should be flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>as two prohibitions are written with regard to it: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood,”</b> and the verse: <b>“And you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it is of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwellings”</b> (Leviticus 7:26).
<b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states the following: The juxtaposition teaches that <b>just as</b> for eating forbidden <b>fat</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes, two for eating forbidden fat of sacrificial animals and one for the prohibition of a non-priest partaking of sacrificial food, from the verse: “And no non-priest shall partake of the sacred food” (Leviticus 22:10), <b>so too,</b> for eating <b>blood</b> one <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes.
The Gemara again asks: <b>And what is different</b> about forbidden <b>fat that</b> it is obvious that one who eats it <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes? The reason must be <b>that these two prohibitions are written with regard to it, and</b> there is also the <b>prohibition of a non-priest</b> partaking of consecrated food, as explained earlier, which totals <b>three.</b> The same can be said with regard to <b>blood as well:</b> The two verses stated above, together with the prohibition of a non-priest partaking of consecrated food, likewise render one liable to receive three sets of lashes. If so, the juxtaposition is unnecessary.
The Gemara answers: The juxtaposition <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since blood is excluded from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>ritual impurity,</b> as one who consumes the blood of sacrificial animals in a state of ritual impurity has not transgressed the prohibition against consuming sacrificial food while impure, <b>let it</b> also <b>be excluded from</b> the prohibition of consumption as <b>a non-priest.</b> To counter this, Rabbi Yehuda <b>teaches us</b> that it is derived from the <b>juxtaposition</b> that one receives three sets of lashes for consuming the blood of sacrificial animals, including for transgressing the prohibition of a non-priest.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that only one prohibition applies to the consumption of the blood of sacrificial animals and that one is not liable to receive lashes for partaking of it as a non-priest, <b>for what</b> purpose does this <b>juxtaposition come?</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>they require it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall eat neither fat nor blood,”</b> which teaches that <b>just as</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> is <b>unique</b> in <b>that</b> the <b>fat of</b> the animal <b>is discrete from its flesh,</b> i.e., the fat is forbidden and the flesh is permitted, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they do not combine with each other,</b> i.e., if one ate half an olive-bulk of forbidden fat and half an olive-bulk of permitted meat he is not liable for eating an olive-bulk of forbidden food, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition concerning <b>blood</b> does not combine with the flesh of non-kosher animals to constitute the volume of an olive-bulk in the case of an animal <b>whose blood is discrete from its flesh,</b> as the penalty of <i>karet</i> applies only to the animal’s blood, whereas its flesh is prohibited by a standard prohibition.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Accordingly, <b>I will exclude</b> from this <i>halakha</i> the <b>blood of</b> the carcasses of <b>creeping animals, since their blood is not discrete from their flesh,</b> i.e., no separate prohibition applies to the blood of creeping animals, and consequently their flesh and blood <b>combine</b> with each other to form the volume of an olive-bulk of a creeping animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is this <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from here,</b> i.e., from the derivation from the verse: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood”? <b>It is derived from there,</b> from a different verse, as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And these are they that are impure</b> for you among the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:29). This <b>teaches with regard to</b> the <b>blood of</b> one of <b>the</b> eight <b>creeping animals</b> listed in the Torah <b>and</b> the flesh of <b>the creeping animal, that they combine with each other</b> to constitute the minimum volume.
The Gemara answers: <b>If not</b> for the <b>juxtaposition,</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say this statement</b> applies <b>with regard to ritual impurity,</b> that the blood of one of the creeping animals listed in the Torah and its flesh combine with each other to constitute the lentil-bulk measure required to impart impurity. <b>But with regard to consumption,</b> one might <b>say</b> they do <b>not</b> combine with each other. Therefore, the <b>juxtaposition teaches us</b> that they combine even <b>with regard to consumption.</b>
<b>Ravina said: Therefore,</b> the <b>blood of a snake and its flesh combine</b> with each other to constitute the volume of an olive-bulk. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Ravina <b>teaching us? This is</b> exactly the derivation from the <b>juxtaposition.</b> The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that with regard to <b>a creeping animal, whose</b> blood <b>is included with regard to ritual impurity,</b> it is also <b>included with regard to consumption;</b> whereas <b>a snake, whose</b> blood <b>is not included with regard to ritual impurity,</b> as it is not one of the eight creeping animals that are ritually impure (see Leviticus 11:29–30), is <b>not included with regard to consumption.</b> Therefore, the <b>juxtaposition teaches us</b> that <b>every item whose blood is not discrete from its flesh is included</b> in the derivation that its blood and flesh combine with each other.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> Concerning the <b>three</b> mentions of <b><i>karet</i> that are stated with regard to blood</b> (Leviticus 7:27, 17:10, 17:14), <b>about what</b> types of blood do they teach? <b>One</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of non-sacred</b> animals, <b>one</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>and one</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of exudate,</b> i.e., which exudes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of its slaughter.
The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>a prohibition</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> the <b>blood of exudate,</b> but one is not punished with <i>karet</i> for consuming it. This is not as severe as consuming regular blood, for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One is liable <b>to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for the blood of exudate, as this blood is regarded as full-fledged blood.
The Gemara continues: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say there is no punishment of <i>karet</i> for consuming blood of exudate, <b>for what</b> purpose does <b>that</b> third mention of <i>karet</i> concerning blood come? The Gemara adds: <b>And even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he derives</b> the <b><i>karet</i></b> that one receives for this blood <b>from</b> a different source, from the superfluous phrase: “Who eats <b>any manner of blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:10).
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eats any manner of blood, I will set My face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:10), that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse could have stated in the first part of the verse: That eats <b>blood. What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> there: “That eats <b>any manner of blood”?</b>
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the punishment of <i>karet</i> concerning the <b>blood of sacrificial</b> animals with regard to which <b>the soul</b> of the animal <b>leaves</b> the body when it emerges, as atonement is achieved through this blood, and the next verse states: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). Rabbi Yehuda continues: <b>From where</b> do I derive that the same punishment of <i>karet</i> applies to the <b>blood of a non-sacred</b> animal <b>and the blood of exudate? The verse states: “Any manner of blood.”</b> Rava’s statement, that the punishment of <i>karet</i> for consuming blood of exudate is derived from a different verse, does not accord with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda either.
<b>Rather, say</b> that this is what Rava means: <b>One</b> mention of <i>karet</i> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and one</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>and one is for</b> the <b>blood of covering,</b> i.e., the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird, with regard to which there is a mitzva to cover their blood (see Leviticus 17:13).
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>says: Why</b> are there <b>five prohibitions stated with regard to blood</b> (Leviticus 3:17, 7:26, 17:14; Deuteronomy 12:16–23)? <b>One</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and one</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>and one</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood of covering, and one</b> is <b>for</b> the <b>blood</b> left <b>in the limbs</b> of the animal, <b>and one is for the blood of exudate.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Illa says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> outside Jerusalem the second <b>tithe of grain, wine, and oil,</b> he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes (see Deuteronomy 12:17). The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But one is not flogged for</b> transgressing <b>a general prohibition.</b> The prohibition concerning consuming second tithe outside Jerusalem is a general one, as it includes all of these categories. The Gemara explains: <b>It is different here, as the verses are superfluous.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Since the Merciful One writes: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,</b> in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23), from which it is derived that <b>inside</b> the chosen place, Jerusalem, <b>yes,</b> one may eat second tithe, but <b>outside</b> Jerusalem, <b>no,</b> one may not eat second tithe; <b>why do I</b> need <b>the Merciful One to write: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17)? This verse serves <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions concerning tithes, to teach that one is separately liable to receive lashes for consuming each type of produce.
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> were derived only <b>from that</b> verse, i.e., “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,” <b>I would say this statement</b> applies only <b>to</b> the extent that there is a prohibition derived by inference from <b>a positive mitzva,</b> for which one does not receive lashes, as it has the status of a positive mitzva. <b>But</b> one might <b>say that</b> one does <b>not</b> transgress <b>a prohibition.</b> It is <b>due to this</b>

Daf 5a

reason that <b>the Merciful One writes: “You may not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>to establish</b> the consumption of second-tithe produce outside Jerusalem <b>as a prohibition.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But still, it is a general prohibition,</b> as all three types of second tithe are included in a single command. The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that one receives only one set of lashes, <b>let</b> the verse <b>say: You may not eat them within your gates,</b> as a previous verse already stated “your tithes” (Deuteronomy 12:11). <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to specify: <b>“The tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil”?</b> This serves <b>to designate</b> a prohibition and the punishment of lashes for the <b>consumption of each and every</b> type of produce.
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One who eats bread, parched grain, and fresh stalks</b> before the <i>omer</i> offering has been sacrificed <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes, as it states: “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh stalks until this day itself, until you have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:14). The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But one is not flogged for</b> transgressing <b>a general prohibition.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here, as the verses are superfluous;</b> the verse did not need to specify these three types of grain products.
The Gemara tries to ascertain which terms are superfluous. <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say “bread,” and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>parched grain and fresh stalks from</b> that of bread. The Gemara questions this suggestion: This derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about bread?</b> It is unique <b>in that it</b> has <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> which is separated only from the dough of bread, not from parched grain and fresh stalks not made into dough.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>write</b> only <b>“parched grain,” and let it not write bread</b> or fresh stalks, <b>and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of bread and fresh stalks <b>from</b> that of <b>parched grain.</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>bread cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>parched grain due to</b> the fact <b>that parched grain is in its unadulterated form,</b> whereas <b>bread is not in its unadulterated form,</b> i.e., it has been fully processed, and therefore it can be maintained that only produce that has not been changed is prohibited before the <i>omer</i>. Likewise, the <i>halakha</i> of <b>fresh stalks cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>parched grain due to</b> the fact <b>that parched grain</b> has <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to meal offerings,</b> as the <i>omer</i> meal offering is of parched grain, whereas <b>fresh stalks do not</b> have <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to meal offerings.</b>
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>write</b> only <b>“fresh stalks,” and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>bread and parched grain from</b> that of fresh stalks. The Gemara responds: This derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about fresh stalks?</b> They are unique <b>in that they have not changed from their original state</b> at all. The Gemara states: Clearly, the <i>halakha</i> of two of these types <b>cannot be derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of any <b>one</b> of the others. But <b>let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one</b> of them <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the other <b>two.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Let the verse not write bread, and let us derive</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> that of <b>parched grain and fresh stalks.</b> The Gemara responds: This derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about parched grain and fresh stalks?</b> They are unique in <b>that</b> relative to bread, which has been fully processed, <b>they are in their unadulterated form.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let the verse not write fresh stalks, and let us derive</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>bread and parched grain.</b> The Gemara responds: This derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about bread and parched grain?</b> They are unique <b>in that they</b> have <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to meal offerings.</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> could <b>say to you: Let the verse not write parched grain, and let us derive</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>bread and fresh stalks. What</b> would you say to <b>refute</b> this? <b>If you refute</b> it by saying: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about bread?</b> It is unique <b>in that it</b> has <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the example of <b>fresh stalks will prove</b> that this is not a decisive factor, as the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> does not apply to it and yet it is prohibited before the <i>omer</i>. <b>And if</b> you would refute the derivation <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>fresh stalks</b> differ from parched grain, as they have <b>not changed from</b> their <b>original state,</b> the case of <b>bread will prove</b> that this is not the key factor, as it has changed from its original state and yet it is prohibited. <b>Therefore,</b> one <b>is flogged</b> for each type, <b>as</b> the verse <b>is superfluous.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that for the consumption of <b>parched grain, whose</b> mention <b>is superfluous,</b> one <b>is</b> separately <b>liable</b> to receive <b>one</b> set of lashes, whereas <b>for</b> eating <b>all</b> the rest <b>of them,</b> i.e., bread and fresh stalks, one <b>is liable</b> to be flogged with only <b>one</b> set of lashes, as they are prohibited by a general prohibition? The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> of parched grain is unique, <b>let the verse write: Bread, fresh stalks, and parched grain; alternatively, let it write: Parched grain, bread, and fresh stalks. Why does it write</b> the example <b>of parched grain in between</b> the others? <b>This</b> is what the verse <b>is saying:</b> One who eats <b>bread is liable to</b> receive the punishment given for eating <b>parched grain, and</b> likewise one who eats <b>fresh stalks is liable to</b> receive the punishment given for eating <b>parched grain.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yannai says: A verbal analogy should never be lightly regarded in your eyes, as</b> the fact that one is punished with <i>karet</i> for consuming meat of <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its appointed time [<i>piggul</i>]</b> is <b>one of the fundamental</b> principles <b>of the Torah, and the verse taught it only through a verbal analogy.</b>
The Gemara explains that this is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Zavda bar Levi teaches: It is stated there,</b> with regard to meat of an offering left over after the appointed time for its consumption [<i>notar</i>]: <b>“But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 19:8), <b>and it is stated here,</b> with regard to intent to consume an offering after its appointed time: <b>“And the soul that eats it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). <b>Just as there</b> the punishment for eating <i>notar</i> is <b><i>karet</i>, so too here,</b> the punishment for eating <i>piggul</i> is <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
<b>Rabbi Simai says: A verbal analogy should never be lightly regarded in your eyes, as</b> the fact that one is punished with <i>karet</i> for consuming <b><i>notar</i>,</b> from which it is derived that one is punished with <i>karet</i> for partaking of <i>piggul</i>, is <b>one of the fundamental</b> principles <b>of the Torah, and the verse taught it only through a verbal analogy.</b>
<b>What is</b> this verbal analogy? One <b>derives</b> by verbal analogy of the word <b>“sacred”</b> in Leviticus and the word <b>“sacred”</b> in Exodus that the verse: “But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity,” is discussing <i>notar</i>. This verse states: <b>“But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the sacred thing of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8), <b>and it is written: “You shall burn the leftovers [<i>notar</i>] in fire;</b> they are not to be eaten, <b>for</b> they are <b>sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:34). Just as the verse in Exodus is referring to <i>notar</i>, the same is true of the verse in Leviticus.
<b>Abaye says: A verbal analogy should never be lightly regarded in your eyes, as</b> the fact that one is punished with <i>karet</i> for engaging in intercourse with <b>one’s daughter</b> born <b>from the woman he raped is</b> one of <b>the fundamental</b> principles <b>of the Torah, and the verse taught it only through a verbal analogy.</b>
Abaye elaborates: This is <b>as Rava says: Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the unusual form <b>“they [<i>henna</i>]”</b> and <b>“they [<i>henna</i>],”</b> written <b>with regard to the prohibition</b> against engaging in intercourse with one’s daughter born from the woman he raped. As it is written: “The nakedness of a woman and her daughter…you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen” (Leviticus 18:17). And it is stated: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter; for they [<i>henna</i>] are your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10). This latter verse is interpreted as referring to one’s granddaughter from the woman he raped (see <i>Yevamot</i> 97a). The verbal analogy teaches that although one’s daughter from the woman he raped is not mentioned in the verse, she too is included with one’s granddaughter, just as a daughter and a granddaughter are equated in Leviticus 18:17.
Furthermore, the punishment for this transgression of intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between: “It is <b>lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), which is written with regard to engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same term <b>“lewdness”</b> that appears elsewhere, which teaches that the transgressor is liable <b>to</b> be put to death by <b>burning.</b> As it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). This teaches that death by burning is the punishment for engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same applies to intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped, due to the verbal analogy of <i>henna</i> and <i>henna</i> linking the two cases.
<b>Rav Ashi says: A verbal analogy should not be lightly regarded in your eyes, as</b> the list of <b>those who are</b> liable to be put to death by <b>stoning is one</b> of <b>the fundamental</b> principles <b>of the Torah, and the verse taught it only through a verbal analogy.</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is stated here,</b> with regard to engaging in intercourse with specific relatives: <b>“Their blood shall be upon them”</b> (Leviticus 20:11–16), <b>and it is stated with regard to a necromancer and a sorcerer: “Their blood shall be upon them”</b> (Leviticus 20:27). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse specifies that a necromancer and a sorcerer are executed <b>by stoning, so too here,</b> with regard to one who engages in intercourse with those relatives, they are executed <b>by stoning.</b>
§ The mishna’s list of prohibitions for whose unwitting violation one must bring a sin offering includes <b>one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness (see Exodus 30:22–33). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil to learn</b> how <b>it</b> was prepared or <b>to transfer it to the community</b> for them to use in the Temple is <b>exempt.</b> But if he blends the anointing oil in order <b>to apply</b> it to his body he is <b>liable. And one who applies</b> to his body the oil prepared by another is <b>exempt, because he is liable for applying</b> the oil to his body <b>only</b> if he uses <b>the anointing oil that was prepared by Moses alone,</b> in accordance with the verse: “Or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger” (Exodus 30:33), which is referring to that specific oil.
<b>The Master said</b> earlier: One who blends the anointing oil <b>to learn</b> how <b>it</b> was prepared or <b>in order to transfer it to the community</b> for them to use in the Temple is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: This is <b>derived</b> via a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term: <b>“Its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32), written with regard to the oil and the term: <b>“According to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:37), written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>incense. And it is written with regard to</b> the <b>incense</b> in that verse: “You shall not prepare for yourselves,” from which it is inferred that <b>it is</b> incense prepared <b>for yourselves that is prohibited, but</b> if one prepares it <b>to transfer it to the community</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to</b> the anointing <b>oil as well,</b> one who blends it <b>to transfer it to the community</b> is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> in light of this verbal analogy, <b>let</b> the case of <b>incense return and let us derive</b> it <b>from</b> that of the anointing <b>oil: Just as</b> with regard to the anointing oil, <b>when one blends</b> it <b>in halves,</b> i.e., not all the specified amount at once, he is <b>exempt, so too,</b> with regard to the <b>incense, when one blends</b> it <b>in halves</b> he should be <b>exempt. Why,</b> then, does <b>Rava say:</b> In the case of <b>incense that one blended in halves,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> whereas with regard to anointing <b>oil that one blended in halves,</b> he is <b>exempt?</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: With regard to</b> the anointing <b>oil it is written: “Neither shall you prepare any like it according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32), which indicates that <b>it is</b> oil prepared precisely <b>like it that is prohibited, but</b> with regard to preparing <b>half of it,</b> one may <b>well</b> do so. By contrast, <b>with regard to incense, as it is written: “And the incense that you shall prepare,</b> according to its composition you shall not prepare for yourselves” (Exodus 30:37), which teaches that <b>any</b> act of <b>preparing of</b> this <b>incense</b> is prohibited, as it is <b>possible to burn a portion,</b> half of the <i>maneh</i> that must be prepared, <b>in the morning, and a portion in the afternoon.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The anointing oil</b> contains <b>pure myrrh</b> weighing <b>500</b> shekels, <b>cassia</b> of <b>500</b> shekels, <b>aromatic cinnamon</b> of <b>500</b> shekels, <b>and aromatic calamus</b> of <b>250</b> shekels. <b>It is found</b> that <b>all of them</b> together amount to <b>1,750</b> shekels.
The Gemara expresses surprise at the statement of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Does the <i>tanna</i></b> come to <b>teach us the tally?</b> Why is it necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to state the sum of the amounts? The Gemara answers that <b>this is difficult for the <i>tanna</i>:</b> Since the verse states: “And of aromatic cinnamon half so much, two hundred and fifty, and of aromatic calamus two hundred and fifty” (Exodus 30:23), one might <b>say</b> that the weight of <b>aromatic calamus</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>aromatic cinnamon: Just as half of</b> the amount of <b>aromatic cinnamon</b> is <b>two hundred and fifty, so too,</b> the verse means that <b>half of</b> the amount of <b>aromatic calamus</b> is <b>two hundred and fifty, which</b> would mean that the sum total <b>is two thousand.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that it is <b>indeed</b> so, that the total weight of calamus is five hundred? The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse write: And of aromatic cinnamon and of aromatic calamus half so much and half so much, two hundred and fifty.</b> The fact that the verse employs the term “half so much” only with regard to cinnamon indicates that their weights were different.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: When one weighs</b> these substances, <b>does he weigh</b> the ingredients <b>with</b> a slight <b>surplus,</b> so that they tip the scales, or <b>does he weigh</b> the ingredients <b>with precision?</b> Abaye <b>said to him</b> that <b>the Merciful One writes: “Of each there shall be a like weight”</b> (Exodus 30:34), which indicates a precise measure, <b>and you say</b> it is possible that one weighs the ingredients <b>with a surplus?</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say: The Holy One, Blessed be He, knows</b> the amount of <b>surpluses</b> that should be added. <b>Evidently, there is a surplus</b> involved <b>in these</b> measures.
<b>Rather,</b> one certainly weighs with a surplus, and this is what <b>Rav Yehuda says: With regard to aromatic cinnamon, why does one bring half of its</b> total <b>of five hundred,</b> i.e., <b>two hundred and fifty at one time, and two hundred and fifty at one time? Since its entire</b> amount <b>is five hundred, let him bring five hundred all at once. Conclude from</b> the fact <b>that one brings aromatic cinnamon at two</b> separate <b>times</b> that <b>there is a surplus</b> involved <b>in this</b> measure, i.e., one must add a little each time he weighs the cinnamon, <b>and the Holy One, Blessed be He, knows</b> the amount <b>of surpluses.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to Rav Yehuda’s opinion, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Of each there shall be a like weight”? Ravina said:</b> It means <b>that one should not place a weight</b> of one ingredient <b>against</b> the <b>weight</b> of another ingredient <b>and weigh</b> in this manner. In other words, after weighing one of the ingredients one may not weigh another ingredient against that one; rather, each ingredient must be weighed independently against the scales.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: How did they prepare <b>the anointing oil that Moses prepared in the wilderness?</b> They would <b>cook the roots</b> of the spices <b>in it;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei said to him: But</b> that amount of oil <b>is not sufficient</b> even <b>to apply</b> to <b>the roots,</b> as they would absorb the oil; how, then, could the roots be cooked in it? Instead, <b>how</b> did they <b>act? They brought the roots and boiled them in water</b> and the fragrant substance would rise to the top, <b>and one poured the anointing oil on</b> the water, <b>and</b> the oil would <b>absorb the fragrance</b> and retain it, <b>and</b> later he <b>removed</b> the oil <b>[<i>vekipeḥo</i>]</b> from off the top and place it in its flask. This is how the anointing oil was prepared.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> Rabbi Yosei:

Daf 5b

<b>And was</b> just <b>one miracle performed with the anointing oil? But many miracles were performed with it, from its initial</b> preparation <b>to its end.</b> He explains: <b>Its initial</b> preparation <b>was only</b> the measure of <b>twelve <i>log</i>, and</b> even so <b>the Tabernacle and its vessels were anointed with it, and</b> likewise <b>Aaron and his sons</b> were anointed with it <b>all the seven days of inauguration, and High Priests and kings were anointed with it</b> throughout the generations, <b>and</b> yet despite the reduction in the amount of oil during its preparation process, as well as its multiple uses throughout history, <b>it all</b> remains <b>intact for</b> its use in <b>the future.</b>
Rabbi Yehuda adds that this is <b>as it is stated: “This [<i>zeh</i>] shall be a sacred anointing oil to Me throughout your generations”</b> (Exodus 30:31). The word <b><i>zeh</i> has a numerical value [<i>bigimatriya</i>]</b> of <b>twelve,</b> which teaches that the original twelve <b><i>log</i></b> of oil that existed at the outset <b>are</b> extant throughout all the generations. If so, i.e., if such miracles were performed in connection with the oil, it is no wonder that its initial preparation was miraculous.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the Tabernacle</b> and all that was in it and sanctified them” (Leviticus 8:10). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the anointing oil that Moses prepared in the wilderness, many miracles were performed with it, from its initial</b> preparation <b>to its end. Its initial</b> preparation <b>was only twelve <i>log</i>;</b> consider <b>how much</b> of it <b>a cauldron absorbs</b> from what is cooked inside it, <b>and how much</b> of it the <b>roots</b> of the plants <b>absorb, how much</b> of it <b>the fire burns, and</b> yet <b>the Tabernacle, and its vessels,</b> and <b>Aaron, and his sons were</b> all <b>anointed with it all seven days of the inauguration.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And High Priests and kings were anointed with it, and even a High Priest, the son of a High Priest, requires anointing</b> with the oil. <b>But one does not anoint a king, the son of a king. And if you say:</b> If so, <b>for what</b> reason <b>did they anoint King Solomon,</b> who was the son of King David? It was <b>due to the dispute</b> over the throne instigated by his older brother <b>Adonijah,</b> who attempted to usurp the monarchy. <b>And</b> similarly <b>Joash,</b> son of Ahaziah, was anointed king (see II Kings 11:12) <b>due to</b> the threat of <b>Athaliah,</b> his paternal grandmother, who attempted to seize the monarchy for herself (II Kings 11:1–3). <b>And Jehoahaz,</b> son of Josiah, was anointed as king (II Kings 23:30) <b>due to</b> the competition from <b>Jehoiakim, his brother, who was two years older than his brother,</b> i.e., Jehoahaz. Ordinarily the older brother succeeds the father, but Jehoahaz was more worthy of the throne.
The Gemara clarifies several aspects of this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> earlier: <b>And even a High Priest, the son of a High Priest, requires anointing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons”</b> (Leviticus 6:15). <b>Let the verse say</b> merely: <b>The priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons. What</b> is taught by the addition of the term <b>“anointed”? This teaches us that even</b> when the new High Priest is <b>from among</b> the <b>sons</b> of the previous High Priest, only <b>that</b> priest <b>who is anointed</b> with oil <b>is</b> the <b>High Priest, but if</b> he is <b>not anointed</b> with oil he <b>is not</b> the <b>High Priest.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> earlier: <b>But one does not anoint a king, the son of a king.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that this is <b>as it is written: In order that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his sons, all the days</b> in the midst of Israel (see Deuteronomy 17:20). The mention of a king’s sons teaches that the kingdom <b>is an inheritance,</b> which does not need to be confirmed by anointing.
The <i>baraita</i> further taught: <b>And for what</b> reason <b>did they anoint King Solomon? Due to the dispute</b> over the throne instigated by his older brother <b>Adonijah.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> in a situation <b>where there is a dispute</b> the new king <b>requires anointing, and the</b> current <b>king cannot</b> simply <b>grant the kingship as an inheritance to whomever he desires? Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “He and his children <b>in the midst of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:20). <b>At a time when there is peace in Israel</b> the monarchy transfers smoothly to the king’s son, but not when there is a dispute.
It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Also Jehu,</b> son of Jehoshaphat, <b>son of Nimshi, was anointed</b> by Elisha the prophet <b>only due to</b> the <b>dispute</b> with <b>Joram, son of Ahab,</b> who was the incumbent king, against whose reign Jehu rebelled (see II Kings 9:1–6). The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it necessary to state this reason? <b>Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derive</b> that Jehu required anointing due to the fact <b>that he</b> was <b>the first king</b> of his lineage, as Jehu was not the son of a king. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: One anoints the kings of the house of David</b> with the anointing oil, but <b>one does not anoint the kings</b> from the kingdom <b>of Israel. And if you say: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> Elisha <b>anoint Jehu,</b> son of Jehoshaphat, <b>son of Nimshi?</b> This was <b>due to</b> the <b>dispute</b> with <b>Joram, son of Ahab.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> earlier: <b>One anoints the kings of the house of David</b> with the anointing oil, but <b>one does not anoint the kings of Israel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the anointing of David: <b>“Arise, anoint him; for this is he”</b> (I Samuel 16:12). <b>This</b> king, i.e., any king from the house of David, <b>requires anointing, but another</b> king, i.e., from the kingdom of Israel, whose kings were not descendants of the house of David, <b>does not require anointing.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> earlier that Jehu was anointed <b>due to</b> the <b>dispute</b> with <b>Joram.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And due to</b> the <b>dispute</b> with <b>Joram, son of Ahab, will we misuse</b> consecrated property by anointing someone unnecessarily <b>with the anointing oil,</b> which is called “a sacred anointing oil” (Exodus 30:31)? After all, kings of the kingdom of Israel do not require anointing. The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to Jehoahaz: They anointed him <b>with pure balsam</b> oil, rather than with the anointing oil. <b>Here too,</b> Elisha anointed Jehu <b>with pure balsam</b> oil, not the anointing oil.
It was further stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And Jehoahaz,</b> son of Josiah, was anointed <b>due to</b> the competition from <b>Jehoiakim, his brother, who was two years older than him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And was</b> Jehoiakim in fact <b>older</b> than Jehoahaz? <b>But isn’t it written: “And the sons of Josiah: The firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum”</b> (I Chronicles 3:15); <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The one who is called Johanan in that verse <b>is</b> also called <b>Jehoahaz,</b> and the one who <b>is</b> called <b>Zedekiah is</b> the same as the one called <b>Shallum.</b> If so, Jehoahaz is the eldest son, not Jehoiakim. Why, then, was it necessary to anoint Jehoahaz?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, Jehoiakim</b> was <b>actually older</b> than Jehoahaz. <b>And why</b> does the verse <b>call</b> Jehoahaz the <b>firstborn?</b> This is referring to the fact <b>that</b> Jehoahaz was the <b>firstborn with regard to the monarchy,</b> i.e., he became king first. The Gemara asks: <b>And do we establish the younger</b> son as king <b>before the older</b> son? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to Jehoshaphat: <b>“And he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn”</b> (II Chronicles 21:3)? The Gemara answers: Jehoram <b>was</b> one <b>who filled the place of his fathers,</b> i.e., he was fit to serve as king, and therefore as he was firstborn he received the kingship, whereas Jehoiakim was deemed unworthy of the honor, despite being the oldest among his brothers.
<b>The Master said</b> earlier: The one who <b>is</b> called <b>Shallum is</b> also called <b>Zedekiah.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>But the Torah counts</b> these individuals <b>in a row,</b> i.e., one after the other, as I Chronicles 3:15 mentions the first, second, third, and fourth sons. This indicates that they are different people. The Gemara answers: Shallum and Zedekiah are in fact one and the same, <b>and what</b> is the reason the verse <b>calls</b> Zedekiah the <b>third?</b> The reason is <b>that he is third of the sons,</b> i.e., the third in order of birth. <b>And what</b> is the reason the verse <b>calls</b> Shallum the <b>fourth?</b> The reason is <b>that he is fourth to the kingship, because Jeconiah reigned before him.</b> How so? <b>Initially Jehoahaz reigned, and afterward Jehoiakim</b> reigned, <b>and afterward Jeconiah</b> reigned, <b>and afterward Zedekiah</b> reigned. Accordingly, Zedekiah, called Shallum, was fourth to the kingship.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The one who <b>is</b> called <b>Shallum is</b> also called <b>Zedekiah, and why was he called Shallum? Because he was perfect [<i>shalem</i>] in his</b> good <b>deeds. Alternatively,</b> he was called <b>Shallum because in his days the kingdom of the house of David was completed [<i>shalam</i>],</b> as he was the last king in the Davidic dynasty. <b>And what</b> was <b>his</b> true <b>name? Mattaniah</b> was <b>his name, as it is stated: “And the king of Babylonia made Mattaniah, his father’s brother, king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah”</b> (II Kings 24:17).
The <i>baraita</i> explains: Why did the king of Babylonia, Nebuchadnezzar, call him by the name Zedekiah? The reason is <b>that</b> Nebuchadnezzar <b>said to him: God will justify [<i>yatzdik</i>] the judgment over you if you rebel against me, as it is stated</b> with regard to Nebuchadnezzar and Jehoiachin: <b>“And brought him to Babylon”</b> (II Chronicles 36:10), and with regard to Zedekiah it is stated: <b>“And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God”</b> (II Chronicles 36:13).
§ The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the statement that Jehoahaz was anointed: <b>And was there anointing oil</b> in the days of Jehoahaz? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 2:15) that <b>from when</b> the <b>Ark was sequestered,</b> along with it <b>was sequestered the jar of manna</b> that was next to it (see Exodus 16:33), <b>and the flask of the anointing oil, and Aaron’s staff</b> with its <b>almonds and blossoms</b> (see Numbers 17:23).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> also sequestered with the Ark was the <b>chest that the Philistines sent as a gift to the God of Israel</b> after they captured the Ark and were stricken by several plagues, <b>as it is stated: “And put the jewels of gold that you return to Him for a guilt offering, in a coffer by its side,</b> and send it away that it may go” (I Samuel 6:8). <b>And who sequestered</b> the Ark? <b>Josiah, king of Judah, sequestered it, as it is stated: And the king said to the priests: Put the sacred Ark</b> in the house that Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, built (see II Chronicles 35:3).
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> How do we know that all these items needed to be sequestered together with the Ark? The <i>halakha</i> that the jar of manna was to be kept with the Ark is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there.”</b> The word “there” is stated with regard to the Ark: “Where I will meet with you there” (Exodus 30:6), and it is also stated with regard to the manna: “And put there” (Exodus 16:33).
The <i>halakha</i> that the anointing oil was to be kept together with the Ark is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>“generations”</b> and <b>“generations.”</b> This term is stated with regard to the jar of manna: “To be kept throughout your generations” (Exodus 16:33), and also with regard to the anointing oil: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil to Me throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:31).
Finally, the <i>halakha</i> that Aaron’s staff was to be kept together with the Ark is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“to be kept”</b> and <b>“to be kept.”</b> This term is stated with regard to the jar of manna, and also with regard to Aaron’s staff: “To be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children” (Numbers 17:25). All these items, which are connected through these verbal analogies, including the anointing oil, were kept by the side of the Ark, and therefore they were sequestered together with the Ark. If so, how was Jehoahaz anointed with the anointing oil? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> They did not anoint Jehoahaz with the anointing oil, but <b>with pure balsam.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One anoints the kings</b> by placing the oil around the head in a shape <b>similar</b> to <b>a crown, and one anoints the</b> High <b>Priests</b> by placing the oil upon the head in the shape <b>similar</b> to <b>chi.</b> In explanation of this statement, <b>Rav Menashya says:</b> It is placed in a shape <b>similar</b> to the <b>Greek</b> letter <b>chi,</b> which looks like the letter Χ. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>First, one pours oil on</b> the <b>head of</b> the High Priest, <b>and afterward one places oil between his eyelashes. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>First, one places oil between his eyelashes, and afterward one pours oil on his head.</b> The <i>baraitot</i> contradict each other.
The Gemara explains: This <b>is</b> a matter of dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as <b>there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who says: Anointing</b> between his eyelashes is <b>preferable</b> to pouring on the head and therefore comes first, <b>and there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who says</b> that <b>pouring</b> on the head is <b>preferable</b> to anointing between his eyelashes, and therefore comes first. <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that <b>pouring</b> on the head is <b>preferable? As it is stated: “And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head</b> and anointed him to sanctify him” (Leviticus 8:12), which indicates that pouring is first, followed by anointing. <b>And</b> as for <b>the one who says</b> that <b>anointing</b> between his eyelashes is <b>preferable</b> to pouring on the head and precedes it, <b>he holds</b> that anointing is preferable <b>in that</b> its use <b>is increased,</b> i.e., it is performed <b>on the service vessels,</b> whereas pouring is not mentioned with regard to the service vessels.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> according to the opinion that anointing is preferable, <b>isn’t it written: “He poured,” and ultimately: “He anointed”</b> (Leviticus 8:12)? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> for <b>“he poured”?</b> This action was made possible <b>due to</b> the fact that he had already: <b>“Anointed him to sanctify him.”</b> In other words, the pouring came after the anointing, which is the primary act.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“It is like the precious oil upon the head</b> descending upon the beard; the beard of Aaron, that descends upon the collar of his garments” (Psalms 133:2). <b>Two drops</b> of anointing oil shaped <b>like pearls hung from Aaron’s beard. Rav Kahana says</b> it is <b>taught: When</b> Aaron <b>would speak</b> his beard would move, and these drops <b>would</b> miraculously <b>rise and sit on the roots of his beard,</b> so that they would not fall to the ground. <b>And with regard to this matter Moses, our teacher, was concerned,</b> thinking: <b>Perhaps, God forbid, I misused the anointing oil</b> by pouring too much, which resulted in these two additional drops.
<b>A Divine Voice emerged and said:</b> “It is like the precious oil upon the head, descending upon the beard; the beard of Aaron, that descends upon the collar of his garments, <b>like the dew of the Hermon that comes down upon the mountains of Zion”</b> (Psalms 133:2–3). This comparison serves to teach: <b>Just as the Hermon’s dew is not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated property, as it is not consecrated but can be used by all, <b>so too,</b> the anointing <b>oil that descends upon Aaron’s beard is not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated property.
<b>And still Aaron himself was concerned,</b> thinking: <b>Perhaps Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property <b>but I misused</b> the oil, as the additional oil is on my body and I derive benefit from it. <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: “Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity”</b> (Psalms 133:1). <b>Just as</b> your brother <b>Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property, <b>so too, you did not misuse</b> consecrated property.
§ The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> which discusses the anointing of kings. <b>The Sages taught: One may anoint kings only next to a spring.</b> This is done as a fortuitous sign, <b>so that their kingdom should continue</b> uninterrupted just as the waters of the spring flow uninterrupted throughout the year. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the coronation of Solomon in the days of King David: <b>And the king said to Benaiah:</b> Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, <b>and bring him down to Gihon. And</b> let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet <b>anoint him there</b> king over Israel (see I Kings 1:33–34). The Sages derived from here that all kings should be anointed near a spring.
Parenthetical to this matter of performing an act as a fortuitous sign, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rav Ami says: One who desires to know if he will</b> live <b>through</b> this current <b>year or not should bring</b> a lit <b>candle during those ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur and hang it in a house</b> through <b>which wind does not blow,</b> and he should watch it carefully: <b>If its light continues he shall know that he will live out his year.</b>
<b>And one who desires to conduct business and wants to know if</b> his <b>business will succeed or not should raise a rooster. If</b> the rooster <b>gets fat and beautiful he shall know that</b> the venture <b>will succeed.</b>
<b>This one who wishes to leave on a journey and wants to know whether he will return to his home should enter a dark house. If he sees</b>

Daf 6a

<b>the reflection [<i>bavua</i>] of a reflection of</b> his <b>reflection he shall know that he will</b> return and <b>come to his home.</b> The Sages say about this: <b>And this is nothing,</b> i.e., one should not practice these divinations, as <b>perhaps he will become despondent</b> if he does not see the positive sign <b>and his fortune will turn bad,</b> and this itself will result in his failure.
<b>Abaye said: Now that you have said</b> that <b>a sign is</b> a substantial <b>matter, a person should be accustomed to eat, at the start of the year, gourd, fenugreek, leeks, beets, and dates,</b> as each of these grow and multiply quickly, which is a good omen for the deeds of the upcoming year.
With regard to positive omens, <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to his sons: When you want to go to study in the presence of your teacher, initially study the <i>mishnayot</i> and then ascend before your teacher. And when you sit before your teacher, see your teacher’s mouth, as it is stated: “And your eyes shall see your teacher”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). <b>And when you learn a <i>halakha</i>, learn near</b> a source of flowing <b>water, as just as the water</b> flow <b>continues,</b> so too, <b>your learning should continue.</b>
Rav Mesharshiyya gave his sons additional advice: It is better for you to dwell <b>on the garbage piles [<i>akilkei</i>] of</b> the city <b>Mata Meḥasya and not</b> to dwell <b>in the palaces [<i>apadnei</i>] of</b> the city <b>Pumbedita.</b> It is <b>better to eat rotten fish [<i>gildana</i>] than</b> high-quality <b><i>kutḥa</i>, which</b> uproots and <b>tosses rocks</b> from their places, i.e., it is a very spicy, powerful flavoring.
The Gemara further discusses the issue of anointing and good omens. Hannah said in her prayer after her son Samuel was born: <b>“And Hannah prayed and said: My heart exults in the Lord, my horn is exalted</b> in the Lord” (I Samuel 2:1). The Gemara notes that Hannah said: <b>“My horn is exalted,” and</b> she did <b>not</b> say: <b>My jug is exalted.</b> With regard to <b>David and Solomon, who were anointed with</b> oil from <b>a horn,</b> this was a good omen for them, and <b>their kingships lasted.</b> But with regard to <b>Saul and Jehu, who were anointed</b> with oil <b>from a jug, their kingships did not last.</b>
§ The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>One who blends the incense</b> according to the specifications of the incense used in the Temple service, for purposes other than use in the Temple. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who blends the incense</b> in order <b>to teach</b> himself how to prepare <b>it or</b> in order <b>to transfer it to the community is exempt</b> from liability. But if he prepares it in order <b>to smell it</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i>, as it is stated: “He who prepares it in order to smell it shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:38). <b>And one who</b> actually <b>smells</b> the incense mixture is <b>exempt</b> from the punishment of <i>karet</i> and from bringing a sin offering; <b>but he has misused</b> consecrated property, and is therefore liable to bring a guilt offering if he acted unwittingly.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property with regard to smell? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara:</b> With regard to exposure to the <b>sound, or</b> to the <b>sight, or</b> to the <b>smell</b> of consecrated items, including incense, these <b>are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property?
The Gemara answers: With regard to exposure to the <b>smell</b> of the incense, the following distinction applies: The smell of the incense that is emitted when the spices are placed on the coals on the altar is subject to the prohibition, since this is the manner in which the mitzva is performed. By contrast, the smell emitted <b>after</b> the flame catches and <b>the column of smoke rises is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. The reason is that its mitzva has already been performed, and <b>you have no</b> case in which an <b>item</b> is at the stage <b>after its mitzva has</b> already <b>been performed and</b> yet one is liable for <b>its misuse.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And why not</b> say that misuse of consecrated property applies to an item whose mitzva has been already performed? <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>the</b> daily <b>removal of the ashes</b> of the offerings from the altar, <b>whose mitzva has been performed,</b> as the offerings have been burnt, <b>and</b> yet one who uses the ashes is liable for <b>misusing</b> the ashes, as derived from the verse: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3).
The Gemara answers: This case does not disprove the principle, <b>since the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the removal of the ashes and the priestly vestments</b> of white linen worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. In other words, if a <i>halakha</i> is stated twice with regard to two separate cases, this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those cases. Had the Torah wanted to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies to all other relevant cases as well, it would have mentioned it only once, and other cases would be derived from there. The fact that two cases are mentioned indicates they are exceptions.
The Gemara comments: The fact that the Torah mentions this <i>halakha</i> twice <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that the priestly vestments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur require interment. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, what can be said? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the sacred place, <b>and he shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). This phrase <b>teaches that</b> his vestments <b>require interment.</b> Although their use for the mitzva has been completed, it is prohibited to derive benefit from these garments. This is the opinion of the Rabbis.
<b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> These priestly vestments may no longer be used by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, <b>but they are fit for</b> use by <b>an ordinary priest,</b> as they are similar to those worn by ordinary priests on a daily basis. Rabbi Dosa adds: <b>And what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And he shall leave them there”?</b> This teaches <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>may not use them on another Yom Kippur.</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Dosa, only one verse teaches there is misuse of consecrated property with regard to an item that has already been used for performing its mitzva. Therefore, one should derive a principle from the verse discussing the removal of the ashes.
The Gemara answers: One cannot derive a general principle from this case, <b>because the removal of the ashes and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the heifer whose neck is broken,</b> from which one may not derive benefit after that rite has been performed, are <b>two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is</b> the case of <b>the removal of the ashes? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall put them beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This <b>teaches that they require interment. What is</b> the case of <b>the heifer whose neck is broken? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And they shall break the heifer’s neck in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). This <b>teaches that</b> such heifers <b>require interment.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> even <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>two verses that come as one</b> do <b>teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases, <b>here they certainly do not teach</b> that misuse of consecrated property applies to items whose mitzva has been performed. This is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>there are two</b> terms indicating <b>exclusions</b> with regard to these <i>halakhot</i>, limiting this <i>halakha</i> to those cases. <b>With regard to the removal of the ashes it is written: “And he shall put it.”</b> The word “it” teaches that in <b>this</b> particular case, <b>yes,</b> there is misuse of consecrated property, but with regard to any <b>other matter</b> this prohibition does <b>not</b> apply. <b>With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken it is written: “The</b> heifer <b>that had its neck broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). The word “the” indicates that with regard to the heifer that <b>had its neck broken, yes,</b> but with regard to any <b>other matter</b> the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property does <b>not</b> apply.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: How is <b>the blending of the incense</b> performed? <b>Balm, and onycha, and galbanum, and frankincense, each</b> of these by <b>a weight of seventy <i>maneh</i>,</b> i.e., seventy units of one hundred dinars. <b>Myrrh, and cassia,</b> and <b>spikenard, and saffron, each</b> of these by <b>a weight of sixteen <i>maneh</i>. Costus</b> by <b>a weight of twelve</b> <i>maneh</i>; <b>three</b> <i>maneh</i> of aromatic <b>bark; and nine</b> <i>maneh</i> of <b>cinnamon. Kersannah lye</b> of the volume of <b>nine <i>kav</i>; Cyprus wine</b> of the volume of <b>three <i>se’a</i></b> and <b>three</b> more <b><i>kav</i>,</b> a half-<i>se’a</i>. <b>If one does not have Cyprus wine he brings old white wine. Sodomite salt</b> is brought by the volume of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i>. Lastly, <b>a minimal</b> amount of <b>the smoke raiser,</b> a plant that causes the smoke of the incense to rise properly. <b>Rabbi Natan says: Also a minimal</b> amount <b>of Jordan amber.</b>
<b>And if one placed honey in</b> the incense he has <b>disqualified it,</b> as it is stated: “For you shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). If he <b>omitted any one of its spices</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: The balm</b> mentioned here <b>is nothing other than a resin</b> exuded <b>from the balsam tree,</b> not the bark of the tree itself. The <b>Kersannah lye</b> mentioned is not part of the ingredients of the incense itself, but it is necessary <b>as one rubs the onycha in it so that</b> the onycha <b>should be pleasant.</b> Likewise, the <b>Cyprus wine</b> is required <b>as one soaks the onycha in it so that it should be strong. And urine is good for</b> this purpose, <b>but one does not bring urine into the Temple</b> because it is inappropriate.
The Gemara comments: This final ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, who says</b> with regard to a verse that discusses the incense: <b>It is sacred, it shall be sacred to you</b> (see Exodus 30:36–37), that this teaches that <b>all of its actions should be</b> performed <b>only in the sacred</b> area of the Temple.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:6): With regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose, they are consecrated for Temple maintenance. <b>And</b> if <b>among them there were items suitable for</b> use as <b>communal offerings,</b> which may not be used for the maintenance of the Temple but only for sacrificial purposes, what is done with those items to remove their consecration for Temple maintenance so that they can be properly consecrated for sacrificial use? <b>They are given to</b> Temple <b>artisans as their wages,</b> and they are thereby desacralized. They can then be consecrated again for their proper purpose.
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>These items</b> that are <b>suitable</b> for use as communal offerings, <b>what are they? If</b> they are <b>domesticated animals and undomesticated animals,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>them</b> later in that same mishna. Likewise, <b>if</b> they are <b>wines, oils, and flours,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught them</b> in that mishna as well. <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to <b>incense</b> consecrated by a private individual? If so, this would mean that one can prepare and consecrate incense outside the Temple.
<b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to that</b> incense <b>which is given to the</b> Temple <b>artisans as their wages,</b> i.e., the incense was prepared in the sacred place and was desacralized when it was given to the artisans, who subsequently consecrated it. <b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): <b>The leftover incense</b> from one year could not be used the following year, as it had been purchased with the shekels collected for the previous year. <b>What would they do with it</b> in order to render it usable? The Temple treasurers <b>would remove</b> an amount <b>of it</b> equal to the value of <b>the wages of the artisans</b> who worked in the Temple. <b>And they</b> would then <b>desacralize</b> that incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to the money</b> owed <b>the artisans. They</b> would then <b>give</b> the incense <b>to the artisans as their wages. And</b> finally, <b>they</b> would <b>return and purchase</b> the incense from the artisans with funds <b>from the new collection</b> of shekels.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this</b> explanation: How can the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i> 4:6 be interpreted as referring to artisans who consecrated leftover incense? <b>With regard to all leftovers</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: They</b> would <b>return and purchase</b> the incense from the artisans with funds <b>from the new collection</b> of shekels, as stated in the mishna earlier. <b>And</b> yet <b>here,</b> in tractate <i>Shekalim</i>, the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> this clause, indicating that it is not speaking of incense paid to the artisans and repurchased from them.
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef says:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to one of the ingredients of the incense,</b> which an individual consecrated when it is not in the Temple. It is not speaking of incense that has already been blended, as this action may be performed only in the sacred area, as claimed by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>incense was prepared</b> from ingredients amounting to the weight of <b>368 <i>maneh</i>,</b> i.e., 368 units of one hundred dinars. Of these, <b>365</b> of them <b>correspond to the days of the solar year.</b> The <b>additional three <i>maneh</i></b> are those <b>from which the High Priest would bring in</b> to the Sanctuary <b>his handful</b> required <b>on Yom Kippur</b> (see Leviticus 16:12), <b>and the rest,</b> i.e., the incense that was not used over the course of the year, <b>was given to the artisans as their wages.</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in the aforementioned mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): With regard to <b>the leftover incense, what would they do with it?</b> The Temple treasurers would <b>remove</b> an amount <b>of it</b> equal to the value of <b>the wages of the artisans</b> who worked in the Temple. <b>And they</b> would then <b>desacralize</b> that incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to the money</b> owed to <b>the artisans. They</b> would then <b>give</b> the incense <b>to the artisans as their wages. And</b> finally, <b>they would return and purchase</b> the incense from the artisans with funds <b>from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b>

Daf 6b

§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The leftover of the incense,</b> from the three extra <i>maneh</i> each year, would accumulate so that <b>once every sixty or every seventy years they would blend</b> the incense for the new year <b>by halves,</b> i.e., they required only half the usual amount, and the other half would come from the leftover incense. <b>Therefore,</b> a private <b>individual who blended</b> incense <b>by halves</b> in order to smell it is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition: “And the incense that you shall prepare, according to its composition you shall not prepare for yourselves, it shall be to you sacred for the Lord” (Exodus 30:37). This is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said</b> it <b>in the name of the deputy</b> High Priest.
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel added: <b>But I did not hear</b> the same with regard to the blending of <b>one-third or one-quarter</b> of the amount of the incense. <b>And the Rabbis say: Every day</b> one <b>would prepare</b> incense for the day <b>according to its composition,</b> i.e., in the appropriate ratio for each ingredient, <b>and he would bring</b> it <b>in</b> the Sanctuary and burn it on the golden altar.
The Gemara comments: This opinion of the Rabbis <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>the anointing oil that one blended in parts,</b> i.e., in any amount, in order to apply it to the skin, he is exempt, but if one blended the incense to smell it, even in parts, he is <b>liable, as it is written: “And the incense that you shall prepare,</b> according to its composition you shall not prepare for yourselves” (Exodus 30:37). This teaches that <b>any</b> incense of the amount <b>that you prepare</b> for the Sanctuary is prohibited, as <b>it is possible to burn a portion,</b> i.e., one-half of the <i>maneh</i> that must be prepared, <b>in the morning, and a portion in the afternoon.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They would return</b> the incense <b>to the mortar</b> to regrind it <b>twice a year; in the summer</b> they would place it <b>scattered so</b> that <b>it should not grow moldy,</b> while <b>in the rainy season</b> it was kept <b>piled, in order that its scent should not dissipate. And when one would grind</b> the incense he would <b>say: Crush well, well crush;</b> this is <b>the statement of Abba Yosei ben Yoḥanan.</b>
<b>And</b> as for the <b>extra three <i>maneh</i></b> of incense <b>from which the High Priest would bring in his handful</b> required <b>on Yom Kippur, one would place it in the mortar on Yom Kippur eve and grind it thoroughly so that</b> the incense <b>should be extra fine. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, with regard to the incense on Yom Kippur, that it shall be: <b>“Finely ground</b> aromatic incense” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> with regard to all incense: <b>“And you shall grind some of it finely”</b> (Exodus 30:36)? <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “finely ground”?</b> This teaches that on Yom Kippur one must grind the incense more, <b>in order that it should be extra fine.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> earlier: <b>When one would grind</b> the incense he would <b>say: Crush well, well crush.</b> The Gemara notes that this <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Just as speech is detrimental to wine,</b> and therefore no words were spoken during its preparation, <b>so too, speech is beneficial to</b> the preparation of <b>the spices</b> of the incense.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>eleven ingredients</b> of the incense <b>were stated</b> by God <b>to Moses at Sinai,</b> as not all of them are specified in the verses. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? “Take for you spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; spices with pure frankincense” (Exodus 30:34). The plural form of the phrase: <b>“Take for you spices”</b> is referring to <b>two</b> ingredients; <b>“stacte, and onycha, and galbanum”</b> are three ingredients; <b>this</b> results in a total of <b>five; and</b> the <b>other</b> mention of <b>“spices”</b> indicates that there are another <b>five,</b> i.e., that one should double the previous total, and <b>this</b> results in a total of <b>ten. And</b> finally, <b>“pure frankincense”</b> is <b>one,</b> and <b>this</b> results in a total of <b>eleven.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> the first mention of <b>“spices”</b> is <b>a generalization; “stacte, and onycha, and galbanum,”</b> is <b>a detail;</b> and when the verse repeats <b>“spices” it</b> is <b>then generalized</b> again. This is the hermeneutical principle of: <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and therefore <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail: Just as the detail is explicit</b> in that it is referring to <b>an item whose smoke rises and its scent diffuses, so too,</b> it includes <b>any item whose smoke rises and its scent diffuses.</b>
<b>And if you would say: If</b> that is <b>so,</b> that this is a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, then <b>let the verse write</b> only <b>one detail</b> of the three; the fact is that <b>indeed [<i>la’ei</i>],</b> all the details <b>are necessary. As, if</b> the Torah <b>had written</b> merely <b>“stacte,” I would say</b> that spices from <b>a type of tree, yes,</b> they may serve as ingredients of the incense, <b>but</b> spices <b>grown from the ground, no,</b> they may not serve this purpose. It is <b>due to that</b> reason that the verse <b>wrote “and onycha.” And if</b> the Torah <b>had written</b> only <b>“and onycha,” I would say</b> that spices <b>grown from the ground, yes,</b> they may serve as ingredients of the incense, <b>but</b> spices from <b>a type of tree,</b> one might <b>say no,</b> they may not serve this purpose. It is <b>due to that</b> reason that the verse <b>wrote “stacte.”</b>
The Gemara concludes its rejection of the suggested resolution: <b>And</b> as for the mention of <b>galbanum,</b> this <b>comes for itself,</b> i.e., one would not otherwise have included this ingredient, <b>because</b> unlike the other spices <b>its smell is foul.</b> Consequently, all these details are necessary, and therefore it is possible to expound the verse as a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, which means that the difficulty remains: How is it derived that there were eleven spices? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse is a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, there is no need for the first mention of “spices,” as one could <b>derive</b> the generalization from the phrase <b>“Take for you.”</b>
The Gemara raises another difficulty: How is it derived from the verse that there are eleven spices? <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>the last</b> mention of <b>“spices”</b> signifies <b>two</b> ingredients, just <b>like the first</b> mention of <b>“spices”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>write “spices”</b> and <b>“spices” together, and afterward let it write “stacte, and onycha, and galbanum.”</b> The fact that the second mention of “spices” is written after all those specified ingredients indicates that its number corresponds to the total of all of them.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The first mention of <b>“spices”</b> is <b>a generalization; “stacte, and onycha, and galbanum,”</b> is <b>a detail;</b> and when the verse repeats <b>“spices” it then generalized</b> again. This is <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail: Just as the detail is explicit</b> in that it is referring to <b>an item whose smoke rises and its scent diffuses, so too,</b> it includes <b>any item whose smoke rises and its scent diffuses.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> that the second <b>generalization</b> is <b>in</b> the same category as the <b>first generalization, and</b> the second <b>detail</b> is <b>in</b> the same category as the <b>first detail. You</b> must <b>say</b> that this is <b>not</b> the case; <b>consequently, you cannot learn in accordance with the last version,</b> but <b>rather</b> you must learn <b>in accordance with the first version.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> that the second <b>generalization</b> is <b>in</b> the same category as the <b>first generalization, and</b> the second <b>detail</b> is <b>in</b> the same category as the <b>first detail. You</b> must <b>say</b> that this is <b>not</b> the case; <b>consequently, you cannot learn</b> in accordance with the last version, but rather you must learn in accordance with the first version. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the difficulty</b> alluded to here by the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> is <b>difficult to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: Let us say that <b>the last</b> mention of <b>“spices”</b> is referring to <b>two</b> ingredients, just <b>as the first</b> mention of <b>“spices”</b> is referring to <b>two</b> ingredients. The <i>tanna</i> <b>then answered as we answered</b> earlier, <b>that if so, let</b> the verse <b>write: Spices, spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum,</b> in that order.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the suggestion: The second <b>detail</b> is <b>in</b> the same category as the <b>first detail?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> is <b>difficult to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: Since it is derived by the principle of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization that all items similar to those specified in the verse are included, as stated earlier that spices from <b>types of trees are derived from</b> the mention of <b>stacte and</b> spices <b>grown from the ground are derived from</b> the mention of <b>onycha,</b> one might say as follows: <b>Let them also learn from</b> the mention of <b>pure frankincense, which includes one aspect,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> one should <b>include an item whose scent diffuses, even though its smoke</b> does not <b>rise.</b>
The Gemara continues: The <i>tanna</i> <b>then said</b> that this cannot be the case, as <b>if so, let the verse write “pure frankincense” in the middle,</b> between the two mentions of “spices,” alongside stacte, onycha, and galbanum, <b>and</b> then one would <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from it.</b> Since the frankincense is mentioned after the second mention of “spices,” it is not part of the generalization, detail, and generalization.
The Gemara questions this claim: <b>If</b> the verse were to <b>write “pure frankincense” in the middle, there</b> would be <b>twelve</b> ingredients in the incense, as that ingredient would also be included in the doubling of the second mention of “spices.” The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that frankincense is meant to be one of the details, <b>let the verse write “pure frankincense” in the middle and “galbanum” at the end,</b> after the second mention of “spices.” Since the verse placed frankincense at the end, one cannot derive <i>halakhot</i> from it as a detail. <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> can be derived <b>from</b> the word incense <b>itself: What</b> is the meaning of the <b>term incense [<i>ketoret</i>]?</b> It means <b>an item that</b> produces <b>smoke [<i>koter</i>] and rises.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: Any fast that does not include</b> the participation of some <b>of the sinners of the Jewish people is not a fast, as the smell of galbanum is foul and</b> yet <b>the verse lists it with the ingredients of the incense. Abaye says</b> that this is derived <b>from here:</b> “It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heavens <b>and has established His bundle on the earth”</b> (Amos 9:6), i.e., when the people are united as a bundle, including their sinners, they are established upon the earth.
§ The mishna includes in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>And one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who applies the anointing oil to animals or vessels</b> is <b>exempt,</b> and one who applies it <b>to gentiles or to corpses</b> is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> one is exempt in the case of <b>animals and vessels, as it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and animals and vessels are not</b> the flesh of <b>a person.</b> It is <b>also</b> clear why one is <b>exempt</b> if he applies it to <b>a corpse, as once someone has died,</b> the body <b>is called a corpse and not a person. But</b> if one applies anointing oil to <b>gentiles why</b> is he <b>exempt? Aren’t they</b> included in the meaning of the term <b>person [<i>adam</i>]?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Indeed</b> they are not. <b>As it is written: “And you My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, are people [<i>adam</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 34:31), from which it is derived that <b>you,</b> the Jewish people, <b>are called <i>adam</i>, but gentiles are not called <i>adam</i>.</b>
The Gemara raises an objection based on a verse discussing captives taken during the war against Midian. <b>But isn’t it written: “And the people [<i>nefesh adam</i>] were sixteen thousand”</b> (Numbers 31:40). This indicates that gentiles are also referred to as <i>adam</i>. The Sage who was asked this <b>said to</b> the questioner: <b>That</b> term serves <b>to exclude,</b> i.e., to distinguish between the people who were taken captive and the <b>animals</b> that were taken as spoils of war, which are also mentioned in that verse.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But isn’t it written: “And should I not have pity on Nineveh,</b> that great city, wherein are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people [<i>adam</i>] who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle” (Jonah 4:11). The inhabitants of Nineveh were gentiles. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> term serves <b>to exclude</b> them from the <b>animals</b> mentioned in the verse.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different reason why one who applies anointing oil to gentiles is exempt. This is <b>as a <i>tanna</i> teaches before Rabbi Elazar: Anyone included in</b> the obligation not to <b>apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is</b> likewise <b>included</b> as subject to the prohibition of: <b>It shall not be applied,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to apply the oil to him. <b>And anyone not included in</b> the obligation not <b>to apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is not included</b> as the object of: <b>It shall not be applied.</b> Only Jews are included in the prohibition against applying the anointing oil.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who applies the anointing oil to animals or vessels,</b> or <b>to gentiles or</b> on <b>corpses,</b> is <b>exempt.</b> If one applies the anointing oil <b>to kings or to priests</b> after they had already been anointed, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable and Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>exempt. And how much</b> oil must one <b>apply</b> to his skin <b>and be liable? Rabbi Meir says: Any amount. Rabbi Yehuda says: An olive-bulk.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that he is entirely <b>exempt?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> that is <b>with regard to</b> applying oil to <b>kings and priests,</b> whereas in the case <b>of an ordinary</b> person Rabbi Yehuda <b>deems</b> him <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Concerning what</b> matter do <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree? Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>they disagree concerning this</b> issue: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is based on the fact that <b>it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and it is written: “Or whoever places any of it upon a stranger,</b> he shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:33). The wording of the prohibition teaches with regard to the liability to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>Just as</b> the act of <b>applying</b> the oil to the skin prohibited by the verse refers to the application of <b>any amount,</b> as there is no specific measure stated in this regard, <b>so too,</b> the act of <b>placing</b> the oil mentioned with regard to <i>karet</i> refers to <b>any amount.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>placing [<i>netina</i>] that</b> is stated here, which is <b>upon a stranger,</b> i.e., one upon whom there is no mitzva to place the anointing oil, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>giving [<i>netina</i>] in general. Just as giving in general</b> is with the amount of <b>an olive-bulk, so too, placing</b> anointing oil <b>upon a stranger</b> is with the amount of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> The principle that giving [<i>netina</i>] in general is with the amount of an olive-bulk is derived from the verse: “And if a man eats a sacred thing in error then he shall add a fifth part in addition to it, and shall give [<i>venatan</i>] to the priest the sacred item” (Leviticus 22:14). This verse is referring to an item given for eating, and the minimum amount that must be consumed for an act to be considered eating is an olive-bulk. Rav Yosef adds: <b>But</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b>applying</b> the oil in order <b>to anoint kings and priests, everyone agrees</b> it is accomplished with <b>any amount.</b>
<b>And Rav Yosef</b> further <b>says: With regard to what</b> matter do <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree</b> in the case <b>of kings and priests</b> who had already been anointed? <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that since <b>it is written: “Or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger,” and</b> right <b>now</b> the <b>king and priest are strangers</b> because the mitzva to anoint them no longer applies, they are included in the prohibition. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> For the purposes of this prohibition <b>we require that</b> the individual in question <b>be a stranger from his beginning to his end, and</b> the <b>king and priest were initially not strangers.</b>
<b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: And</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda both <b>follow their</b> lines of <b>reasoning, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 7:2):

Daf 7a

With regard to <b>the daughter of a priest who married an Israelite and</b> then unwittingly <b>partook of <i>teruma</i>, she pays the principal,</b> as a thief would, as she partook of <i>teruma</i> to which she owns no rights. <b>But she does not pay the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, which is the fine paid by an Israelite who partakes of <i>teruma</i> unwittingly (see Leviticus 22:14). This is because she is not completely disqualified from the priesthood, since if she becomes widowed or divorced without having borne children she will again be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And</b> if she commits adultery <b>her death</b> penalty is administered <b>by burning,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the daughter of a priest (see Leviticus 21:9).
By contrast, if <b>she married one of those who are unfit</b> for her to marry due to his lineage, thereby disqualifying herself from the priesthood for the future, <b>she pays</b> the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and her death</b> is <b>by strangulation,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to Israelite women. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, whether she was married to an Israelite or to one unfit for her to marry, <b>she pays the principal but she does not pay the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and her death</b> is <b>by burning,</b> as she previously had the status of a daughter of the priesthood. This opinion of the Rabbis is presumably that of Rabbi Yehuda, who is usually the disputant of Rabbi Meir. As explained with regard to the anointing of a king, Rabbi Yehuda requires that the individual in question must have the status of a stranger, i.e., not a High Priest or a king, from beginning to end.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda applies <b>to the placing of the anointing oil, and</b> it is explained <b>by</b> those <b>answers that we answered</b> earlier, that according to Rabbi Meir one is liable for the placing of any amount, as the verse uses an expression of applying, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda one is liable only if one places oil that is the volume of an olive-bulk. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>placing in general,</b> e.g., the prohibition not to place frankincense on the meal offering of a sinner (see Leviticus 5:11), <b>everyone agrees</b> one is liable for placing only the volume of <b>an olive-bulk.</b>
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: A <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Elazar: Anyone included in</b> the obligation not to <b>apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is</b> likewise <b>included</b> as the object of: <b>It shall not be applied,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to apply the oil to him. <b>And anyone not included in</b> the obligation not <b>to apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is not included</b> as the object of: <b>It shall not be applied.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to</b> that <i>tanna</i>: <b>You are saying well,</b> as <b>it is written:</b> “Upon the flesh of a person <b>it shall not be applied [<i>lo yisakh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and</b> you <b>read into</b> the verse: <b><i>Lo yasikh</i>,</b> he shall not apply it to others. This dual reading indicates that one who is commanded not to apply the oil is the same as the one upon whom it is prohibited to apply the oil, as stated by the <i>tanna</i>.
§ <b>Rav Ḥananya taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rava: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a High Priest who took from the anointing oil that is on his head and placed it on his stomach; from where</b> is it derived <b>that he is liable?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32). <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is different between</b> this case and <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a priest who applied <i>teruma</i> oil</b> to himself, <b>the Israelite son of his daughter may rub against [<i>mitaggel</i>]</b> this oil <b>without concern</b> that he might be deriving benefit from <i>teruma</i>?
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> oil, <b>it is written: “They will die through it if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and <b>since</b> the priest <b>has</b> already <b>profaned</b> the oil by using it, it is considered <b>profaned. But with regard to the anointing oil it is written: “For the consecration</b> of the anointing oil of <b>His God is upon him”</b> (Leviticus 21:12). <b>The Merciful One calls it anointing oil</b> even at this stage, to teach <b>that even though it is upon</b> the High Priest it is <b>not</b> considered <b>profaned,</b> and instead remains sacred.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>For</b> any of <b>these</b> prohibitions, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for its intentional</b> violation and to bring a sin offering for its unwitting violation. And for violation in a case where it is unknown to him whether he transgressed, he is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering. The Gemara notes that the mishna further <b>teaches:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> for all the transgressions listed above <b>except for one who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he enters the Temple while ritually impure <b>or</b> renders <b>its consecrated items</b> ritually impure. The Gemara asks: <b>From what</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>exclude</b> these cases? After all, one who enters the Temple while impure or renders its consecrated items impure is also liable to receive <i>karet</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Except for one who defiles the Temple or</b> renders <b>its consecrated items</b> ritually impure, <b>as</b> he <b>does not bring a provisional guilt offering.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>also teach: Except for one who</b> sinned and <b>Yom Kippur passed, as</b> he too <b>does not bring a provisional guilt offering. Reish Lakish said: When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> these exceptions he is referring to those cases <b>where there is a sin and</b> nevertheless <b>the Merciful One exempts him</b> from bringing a provisional guilt offering. By contrast, in a case where <b>Yom Kippur passed, there is no</b> remaining <b>sin, as</b> Yom Kippur <b>atoned for him,</b> i.e., for his sin.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to one who rejects</b> the atonement of Yom Kippur, <b>who says: Yom Kippur does not atone</b> for one’s sins. In this situation Yom Kippur does not atone for him, which means <b>that if he retracted</b> from his sinful ways <b>after Yom Kippur</b> he is <b>required to bring a provisional guilt offering.</b> Therefore, it cannot be listed in the exceptions stated in the mishna. The Gemara notes: <b>And Reish Lakish</b> does not explain the mishna in this manner, as <b>he maintains</b> that <b>even</b> with regard to <b>one who rejects</b> its atonement, <b>Yom Kippur atones for his</b> sins.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> their dispute is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between later <i>amora’im</i>: Concerning <b>one who says: My sin offering,</b> which is sacrificed for me, <b>should not atone for me, Abaye said:</b> This sin offering <b>does not atone</b> for him. <b>Rava said: It atones</b> for him. The Gemara explains: In a case <b>where he said:</b> I do <b>not</b> want it <b>to be sacrificed, everyone agrees that it does not atone</b> for him, <b>as it is written: “He shall bring it in accordance with his will”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), which indicates that if the offering is brought against his will it is not effective. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>when he says:</b> The sin offering <b>should be sacrificed but it should not atone</b> for me. <b>Abaye said:</b> It <b>does not atone</b> for him, <b>as he said</b> that <b>it should not atone</b> for him. <b>Rava said: It does atone</b> for him, as <b>once he says</b> it <b>should be sacrificed,</b> the <b>atonement comes by itself.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rava retracted</b> his opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur atones for those who repent and for those who do not repent.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>And there is a logical inference</b> to negate this assertion: <b>Just as a sin offering and a guilt offering atone, and</b> likewise <b>Yom Kippur atones, just as a sin offering and a guilt offering atone only for those who repent, so too, Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this opinion: <b>No, if you said</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sin offering and a guilt offering, which do not atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> they do for <b>unwitting</b> sins, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to Yom Kippur, which does atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins? Yom Kippur effects atonement even in cases where offerings do not. <b>And since</b> it is the case that the atonement of Yom Kippur is far-reaching in that <b>it atones for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins, it follows that it <b>may atone</b> both <b>for those who repent and for those who do not repent.</b> To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states: “Yet</b> on the tenth day of this month it is Yom Kippur” (Leviticus 23:27). By means of the word “yet,” the verse <b>divided</b> and limited the atonement of Yom Kippur so that it atones only for those who repent. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Those who repent and those who do not repent? Shall we say those who repent</b> are those whose transgressions were <b>unwitting,</b> whereas <b>those who do not repent</b> are those whose transgressions were <b>intentional?</b> This cannot be the case, as the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: No, if you said</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a sin offering and a guilt offering,</b> which do not atone for intentional sins as they do for unwitting sins. Since the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the concepts of intentional and unwitting sins in this clause, the categories of those who repent and do not repent must have another meaning.
<b>Rather,</b> the category of those who do not repent is <b>like that which Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: If one unwittingly <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat and separated an offering</b> for this sin, <b>and became an apostate and subsequently retracted</b> his apostasy, nevertheless, <b>since</b> the offering <b>was rejected</b> from being sacrificed while he was an apostate, <b>it shall</b> remain <b>rejected.</b> Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> is suggesting that the same applies to one who became an apostate and Yom Kippur passed: Even if he retracts his apostasy, the following Yom Kippur should not atone for his transgression.
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: Granted, the <b>offering is rejected</b> from the altar, and therefore it cannot be sacrificed at a later stage. But the <b>man</b> himself <b>is fit for atonement,</b> and he can bring another sin offering. The Gemara suggests another interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the category of <b>those who repent</b> is referring to one <b>who says: My sin offering should atone for me, and</b> the category of <b>those who do not repent</b> is referring to one <b>who says: My sin offering should not atone for me.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that a sin offering does not atone for one who states beforehand: My sin offering should not atone for me, in contradiction of the earlier statement of Rava. Since Rava was aware of this <i>baraita</i>, he must have retracted his opinion.
The Gemara continues its analysis of this <i>baraita</i> by comparing it to another <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>raise a contradiction:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur shall atone only for</b> one <b>who fasted on it and did not perform labor on it and declared it a holy convocation.</b> With regard to one who <b>did not fast on it, or performed labor on it, or did not declare it a holy convocation,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur shall not atone</b> for him. To counter this <b>the verse states:</b> “Yet on the tenth day of this seventh month <b>it is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27); the additional emphasis of “it is” serves to teach that the day atones <b>in any case.</b> The ruling of this <i>baraita</i> disputes the one cited earlier, which states that Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent, <b>and both</b> are <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraitot</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>.</b> They <b>are difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other.</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and <b>that</b> second <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>in accordance with his own</b> opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> For <b>all transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah, whether one repented or whether one did not repent, Yom Kippur atones.</b>
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except for</b> one <b>who divests</b> himself of the <b>yoke</b> of God, by denying His existence, <b>and one who</b> impudently <b>reveals facets of the Torah</b> in a manner that departs from their true meaning, <b>and one who nullifies the covenant of</b> the <b>flesh,</b> i.e., circumcision. <b>With regard to</b> these, <b>if one repented, Yom Kippur atones, and if not, Yom Kippur does not atone.</b> This indicates that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, Yom Kippur atones even if one did not repent.
<b>Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>in accordance with his own</b> opinion, that Yom Kippur atones even for those who do not repent, <b>but</b> even <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes</b> that <b>with regard to</b> the <b>transgressions of</b> violating <b>Yom Kippur itself,</b> e.g., if one ate or performed labor on Yom Kippur, <b>that</b> Yom Kippur <b>does not atone</b> for those transgressions. He must necessarily concede this point, <b>as if you do not say so,</b> then <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, with regard to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> for</b> transgressing the prohibitions of <b>Yom Kippur, since each and every hour</b> of the day <b>atones</b> for one’s sins, <b>how can you find</b> the application of <i>karet</i> in this case?
The Gemara questions this proof: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps</b> you find a case <b>where he performed labor the entire night</b> of Yom Kippur <b>and died at dawn, as</b> in such a case <b>there was no daytime</b> of Yom Kippur, which is the part of Yom Kippur that effects atonement, <b>to atone for him.</b> The Gemara asks: That <b>works out well</b> with regard to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> for</b> transgressing at <b>night;</b> but with regard to <b><i>karet</i> for</b> transgressing at <b>daytime, how can you find these</b> circumstances, i.e., how can he be liable to receive <i>karet</i> for transgressing in the day?
The Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps while eating bread he choked on</b> a chunk of <b>meat</b> he ate with it, and died, <b>as there was not enough time in the day</b> after his transgression <b>to atone for him. Alternatively,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he performed labor close to sunset; alternatively,</b> it is referring to a case where <b>as he was performing labor, the hoe</b> with which he was working <b>cut his thigh and he died, as</b> in these cases too <b>there was no time</b> in the day after his transgression <b>to atone for him,</b> either because it was no longer Yom Kippur or because he died immediately.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is the same, i.e., there is no obligation to bring a sin offering, <b>even</b> with regard to <b>the one who blasphemes,</b> as it is stated with regard to the sin offering: “You shall have one law for him who performs the action unwittingly” (Numbers 15:29), excluding one who blasphemes, as he does not perform an action but sins with speech. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> caused the Rabbis to specify: <b>Even</b> one who <b>blasphemes, as he does not perform an action?</b> Why do the Rabbis mention this explanation?
The Gemara explains: <b>The Rabbis heard that Rabbi Akiva teaches</b> in his list of those who must bring a sin offering <b>a necromancer, and he does not teach a sorcerer</b> in his list, and therefore <b>they said to him: What is different</b> about a sorcerer <b>that he does not bring an offering?</b> It must be <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> his transgression <b>does not involve an action.</b> If so, with regard to the sin of one who <b>blasphemes as well,</b> it <b>does not involve an action.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): One who unwittingly <b>blasphemes brings an offering, since <i>karet</i> is stated with regard to it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15), as the Gemara will explain. The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> an established <b>principle</b> that <b>wherever it is written <i>karet</i> with regard to</b> a mitzva, one who violates it unwittingly <b>brings an offering? But there</b> is the case of the mitzva of the <b>Paschal offering, and</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, as</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> is written</b> for failing to perform <b>them, and</b> yet <b>one does not bring an offering</b> for failing to perform these mitzvot unwittingly.

Daf 7b

The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Akiva <b>is saying:</b> One who unwittingly <b>blasphemes brings an offering, since its</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i> comes,</b> i.e., is written, <b>in a place</b> where the Torah discusses <b>an offering,</b> i.e., <i>karet</i> is mentioned in a passage that discusses a sin offering (see Numbers 15:27–31). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> as <b>he maintains: Since</b> the verse <b>should have written <i>karet</i> in general,</b> i.e., without connecting it to bringing an offering, <b>and</b> yet this <b><i>karet</i> is written in a place</b> where the Torah discusses <b>an offering, conclude from it</b> that the unwitting blasphemer <b>brings an offering</b> for his transgression.
The Gemara analyzes the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). The Gemara explains: Here we <b>arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Akiva is saying to the Rabbis: You say</b> that the transgression of one who <b>blasphemes does not involve an action,</b> as <b>what is</b> the case of one who <b>blasphemes?</b> It is one who <b>blesses,</b> i.e., curses, <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God. <b>But</b> if so, then concerning the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that is written:</b> “That person blasphemes the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off [<i>venikhreta</i>] from among his people” (Numbers 15:30), <b>for what</b> purpose <b>does it come,</b> if not to render him liable to bring an offering?
The Rabbis <b>say to him:</b> It comes <b>to give</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> to one who curses</b> God, in order to teach that the phrase: “Shall bear his sin,” written in the verse: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin” (Leviticus 24:15), is referring to <i>karet</i>, so that one can derive by verbal analogy that an individual who was obligated to bring a Paschal offering for the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> and did not do so is likewise liable to receive <i>karet</i>. <b>As it is written with regard to one who curses</b> God: “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin,” and it is written with regard to</b> one who was obligated to bring a Paschal offering for the <b>second <i>Pesaḥ</i></b> and did not do so: “That man <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Numbers 9:13). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to one who curses God it is referring to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, so too here,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering it is referring to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
With regard to one who blasphemes, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That person <b>blasphemes [<i>megaddef</i> ] the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:30). <b>Isi ben Yehuda says:</b> This is <b>like a person who says to another: You cleaned [<i>geirafta</i>] the bowl and rendered it lacking,</b> i.e., the transgression of blasphemy is so severe that it is compared to one who does actual damage to God. Isi ben Yehuda <b>maintains</b> that the case of the <b>blasphemer is</b> identical to that of one who <b>blesses,</b> i.e., curses, <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God, which is a particularly severe transgression.
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says</b> that this is <b>like a person who says to another: You cleaned the bowl</b> and removed its contents, <b>but did not render it lacking,</b> i.e., the transgression of blasphemy is not compared to one who does actual damage to God. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>maintains</b> that the case of the <b>blasphemer is</b> the same as that of <b>an idol worshipper,</b> which is a less severe transgression.
This dispute as to the nature of the transgression of the blasphemer <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: “That person blasphemes <b>the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:30), and <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: The verse is speaking of an idol worshipper. And the Rabbis say: The verse comes only to give</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> to one who blesses,</b> i.e., curses, <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> some women who <b>bring</b> a sin <b>offering</b> of a woman after childbirth <b>and</b> the offering <b>is eaten</b> by the priests. <b>And there are</b> some women who <b>bring</b> a sin <b>offering but it is not eaten. And</b> there are <b>some</b> women who <b>do not bring</b> a sin offering at all.
The mishna elaborates: The following women <b>bring</b> a sin <b>offering and it is eaten</b> by the priests: <b>One who miscarries</b> a fetus with a form <b>similar to a domesticated animal,</b> one who miscarries a fetus with a form similar to <b>an undomesticated animal, or</b> one who miscarries a fetus with a form similar to <b>a bird;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> She does not bring a sin offering <b>unless</b> the fetus <b>has the form of a person.</b>
With regard to a woman <b>who miscarries a sandal</b> fetus, i.e., one that has the form of a flat fish; <b>or</b> if she miscarries the <b>placenta; or an amniotic sac</b> in which <b>tissue developed; or</b> a fetus <b>that emerged cut,</b> i.e., in pieces; <b>and likewise</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant,</b> owned by a Jew, <b>who miscarried;</b> in all these cases <b>she brings</b> a sin <b>offering and it is eaten</b> by the priests.
<b>And these</b> women <b>bring</b> sin offerings <b>but</b> their sin offerings <b>are not eaten: One who miscarries and does not know</b> the nature of <b>what she miscarried; and two women who miscarried,</b> in a case where <b>one</b> miscarried a fetus <b>of a type</b> for which a woman is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> miscarried a fetus <b>of a type</b> for which a woman is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering, and they do not know which miscarried which type. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: When</b> is their sin offering not eaten? It is <b>when</b> both women <b>went</b> to different places within the Temple to bring their offerings, e.g., <b>this</b> woman went <b>to the east and that</b> woman went <b>to the west. But if both of them were standing</b> together, <b>both of them</b> together <b>bring</b> one sin <b>offering, and it is eaten.</b>
<b>These</b> women <b>do not bring</b> a sin offering: A woman <b>who miscarries an amniotic sac full of water,</b> or one <b>full of blood,</b> or one <b>full of</b> different <b>colors;</b> and likewise a woman <b>who miscarries</b> a fetus with a form <b>similar to fish, or grasshoppers, or repugnant creatures, or creeping animals;</b> and a woman <b>who miscarries</b> on the <b>fortieth day</b> of her pregnancy; <b>and</b> a woman who gives birth by <b>caesarean section. Rabbi Shimon deems</b> a woman <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>in</b> the case where she gives birth by <b>caesarean section.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive that in the case of a Canaanite <b>maidservant,</b> owned by a Jew, who miscarried, she brings a sin offering and it is eaten? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The passage discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of a woman following childbirth begins with the verse: “Speak to <b>the children of Israel,</b> saying: If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male” (Leviticus 12:2). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the full-fledged <b>children of Israel</b> are included in these <i>halakhot</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a convert and</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant</b> are also included in these <i>halakhot</i>? <b>The verse states “a woman,”</b> which includes other women.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the special emphasis in the mishna: <b>And likewise</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant?</b> Why does the mishna deem it necessary to write this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>when we say:</b> With regard to <b>any mitzva in which a woman is obligated</b> a Canaanite <b>slave is</b> also <b>obligated in that</b> mitzva, <b>this statement</b> applies <b>with regard to a matter that is the same for a man and for a woman. But</b> with regard to the offerings of <b>a woman after childbirth, which is</b> a category that applies <b>to women</b> but <b>does not</b> apply <b>to men,</b> one might <b>say</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant is not obligated</b> to bring these offerings. It is <b>for this</b> reason the mishna <b>taught</b> the case of a Canaanite <b>maidservant.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>These</b> women <b>bring</b> a sin <b>offering</b> but their sin offerings are not eaten. It then teaches that in a case where one miscarried a fetus of a type for which a woman is exempt from bringing an offering and the other one miscarried a fetus of a type for which a woman is obligated to bring an offering, Rabbi Yosei maintains that if both are standing together they bring one offering together. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> exactly <b>do they do? The two of them bring one definite</b> burnt <b>offering, and a sin offering of a bird</b> due to <b>uncertainty, and they</b> each <b>stipulate</b> that if she is obligated to bring the sin offering the animal is hers, and if not then it belongs to the other woman.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rabbi Yosei of</b> the opinion that <b>a stipulation</b> is effective in the case of a sin offering? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (23a): With regard to a situation where one of two women unwittingly ate a piece of forbidden fat and is obligated to bring a sin offering, but it is unknown which woman, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They both bring one sin offering</b> together, and <b>Rabbi Yosei says: They do not both bring one sin offering</b> together. <b>Evidently, Rabbi Yosei is not of</b> the opinion that <b>a stipulation</b> is effective with regard to a sin offering.
<b>Rava said: Rabbi Yosei concedes</b> that a stipulation is effective <b>with regard to one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, as is the case concerning a woman after childbirth. <b>And likewise, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering that a stipulation is effective.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference between the sin offering of one who has not yet brought an atonement offering and standard sin offerings? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to a sin offering brought for a transgression, <b>the man requires</b> definite <b>awareness</b> of his transgression for him to be obligated to bring a sin offering, <b>as it is written: “If his sin,</b> which he has sinned, <b>be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28). <b>Therefore,</b> in the case where one of two women ate forbidden fat, <b>they do not bring</b> a sin offering together <b>and stipulate</b> that it should be for whichever of them ate the forbidden fat. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a woman after a miscarriage, <b>when</b> these <b>women bring</b> their sin offering they do so only in order <b>to become permitted in the consumption of sacrificial</b> food, and therefore the stipulation is effective.
The Gemara cites a proof that this distinction is in fact the opinion of Rabbi Yosei: <b>As it is taught in the latter clause of that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>any sin offering that comes</b> as atonement <b>for a sin, two</b> people <b>do not bring it</b> together. This indicates that if a sin offering does not atone for a sin, two people can bring it together.
§ The mishna teaches: And <b>these</b> women <b>do not bring</b> a sin offering, and among them are a woman who gives birth by caesarean section. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> a woman <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>in</b> a case where she gives birth by <b>caesarean section.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the verse states: “But if she bears a girl”</b> (Leviticus 12:5). The term “she bears” is superfluous in the context of the passage, and it serves <b>to include another</b> type of <b>birth,</b> and <b>what</b> is <b>it?</b> This is a birth by <b>caesarean section.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> their <b>reasoning? Rabbi Mani bar Pattish said</b> that their ruling is derived from the verse: <b>“If a woman conceives [<i>tazria</i>] and gives birth to a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). The word <i>tazria</i> literally means to receive seed, indicating that all the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in that passage do not apply <b>unless she gives birth through the place where she receives seed,</b> not through any other place, such as in the case of a caesarean section.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman who gives birth to a daughter counts fourteen days during which she is ritually impure. That is followed by sixty-six days during which she remains ritually pure even if she experiences a flow of blood. The Torah obligates a woman to bring her offering on the eighty-first day (see Leviticus 12:1–6). If the woman miscarries another fetus before that day, she is not required to bring an additional offering. In the case of a woman <b>who miscarries</b> a fetus <b>on the night of,</b> i.e., preceding, <b>the eighty-first</b> day, <b>Beit Shammai deem</b> her <b>exempt from</b> bringing a second <b>offering and Beit Hillel deem</b> her <b>liable</b> to bring a second offering.
<b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: What is different</b> between the <b>night of the eighty-first and</b> the <b>day of the eighty-first? If they are equal with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity,</b> i.e., the blood flow of this woman on the eighty-first night renders her ritually impure and all the standard strictures of ritual impurity apply to her, <b>will</b> the two time periods <b>not be equal with regard to</b> liability to bring an additional <b>offering</b> as well?
<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel: <b>No,</b> there is a difference between that night and the following day. <b>If you said with regard to</b> a woman <b>who miscarries</b> on the <b>eighty-first day</b> that she is obligated to bring an additional offering, this is logical, <b>as she emerged into a period that is fit</b> for <b>her to bring</b> her <b>offering.</b> Would you <b>say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> a woman <b>who miscarries on the night of</b> the <b>eighty-first</b> day, <b>where she did not emerge into a period that is fit</b> for <b>her to bring</b> her <b>offering,</b> as offerings are not sacrificed at night?
<b>Beit Hillel said to</b> Beit Shammai: <b>But let</b> the case of a woman <b>who miscarries on</b> the <b>eighty-first day that occurs on Shabbat prove</b> that this distinction is incorrect, <b>as she did not emerge into a period that is fit</b> for <b>her to bring</b> her <b>offering</b> because individual offerings are not sacrificed on Shabbat, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>she is obligated to bring</b> an additional <b>offering.</b>
<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel: <b>No,</b> there is a difference between these cases. <b>If you said</b> this ruling with regard to a woman <b>who miscarries on</b> the <b>eighty-first day that occurs on Shabbat,</b> the reason is <b>that although</b> Shabbat <b>is unfit for</b> the sacrifice of <b>an individual offering,</b> it is <b>fit for</b> the sacrifice of <b>a communal offering</b> whose time is fixed, e.g., the daily offering. Would you <b>say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> a woman <b>who miscarries on the night of</b> the <b>eighty-first</b> day, <b>as the night is completely unfit,</b> since <b>neither an individual offering nor a communal offering</b> is sacrificed at night?
Beit Shammai add: <b>And</b> as for the ritual impurity status of <b>the blood,</b> i.e., Beit Hillel’s opinion that the two time periods are equal with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, this <b>does not prove</b> what the <i>halakha</i> should be with regard to offerings, <b>as</b> with regard to a woman <b>who miscarries</b> before the <b>completion</b> of the term of eighty days, <b>her blood is impure</b> like the blood of a woman after childbirth, and nevertheless <b>she is exempt from</b> bringing <b>the offering.</b>

Daf 8a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In continuation of the discussion of the mishna, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai:</b> The verse <b>states:</b> “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or <b>for a daughter”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). The entire clause: “For a son or for a daughter,” is superfluous and serves <b>to include the night</b> preceding the <b>eighty-first</b> day, i.e., if she has a miscarriage at that point she is obligated to bring another offering.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Hoshaya would regularly</b> study <b>before bar Kappara. He</b> then <b>left him and came</b> to study <b>before Rabbi Ḥiyya. One day</b> Rabbi Hoshaya <b>encountered</b> bar Kappara and <b>raised</b> the following <b>dilemma before him:</b> With regard to <b>a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>],</b> who is obligated to bring an offering on the eighth day of his purification for three discharges, if <b>he saw</b> another <b>three sightings,</b> i.e., experienced an additional three discharges, <b>on the night</b> preceding the <b>eighth</b> day, <b>what do Beit Hillel say about this matter?</b> Must the <i>zav</i> bring a separate offering for this impurity as he would if he experienced the discharges on the eighth day?
Rabbi Hoshaya explains the sides of the dilemma: Is the <b>reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Beit Hillel that</b> a woman <b>who miscarries on the night</b> preceding the eighty-first day must bring an additional offering <b>due to</b> the derivation from the verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “For a son or <b>for a daughter”? But</b> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> who saw three sightings on the night</b> preceding the <b>eighth</b> day, <b>they</b> deem him <b>exempt, as</b> in this case there are <b>no superfluous verses</b> from which one could derive this obligation. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between these <i>halakhot</i>, and just as a woman who miscarried on the night preceding the eighty-first day after childbirth must bring another offering, as it is the night preceding the day upon which she can bring her offering, a <i>zav</i> must likewise bring another offering for this impurity.
<b>Bar Kappara said to</b> Rabbi Hoshaya: <b>What does</b> the <b>Babylonian,</b> i.e., Rabbi Ḥiyya, who came from Babylonia, <b>say about this matter? Rabbi Hoshaya was silent and did not say anything. Bar Kappara said to him:</b> Do <b>we require the statement of Iyya,</b> i.e., Ḥiyya? <b>Let us review the earlier</b> ruling, as the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the verse that <b>states:</b> “For a son or <b>for a daughter”</b> (Leviticus 12:6), serves <b>to include the night of</b> the <b>eighty-first</b> day. This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies only in the case of a woman after childbirth.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> this dilemma <b>is subject</b> to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> With regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> who saw three sightings on the night</b> preceding the <b>eighth</b> day, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that he <b>brings</b> an additional offering, <b>and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that he <b>does not bring</b> another offering. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>who taught</b> that he <b>brings</b> an additional offering <b>holds</b> that <b>night</b> is <b>not</b> considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, and therefore it is as though the eighth day itself has begun; <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>who taught</b> that he <b>does not bring</b> another offering <b>holds</b> that <b>night</b> is considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, and consequently it is not yet time to sacrifice his first offering of a <i>zav</i>.
<b>Rav Huna bar Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: These <i>tanna’im</i></b> both <b>hold</b> that <b>night</b> is considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, and therefore a <i>zav</i> who experienced three discharges on the night preceding the eighth day does not bring another offering. <b>And</b> the ruling of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>which taught</b> that he <b>brings</b> an additional offering, is stated <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced two sightings.</b> Since this <i>zav</i> has completed his purification process, as he is not obligated to bring an offering, these discharges constitute a new instance of ritual impurity. <b>And</b> the ruling of <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>which taught</b> that he <b>does not bring</b> another offering, is stated <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i> who</b> had <b>experienced three sightings.</b> This <i>zav</i> must bring an offering, and the time for the offering has not yet arrived on the eighth night. Therefore, he is not obligated to bring another offering.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If the ruling of that <i>baraita</i> is stated with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> who experienced two sightings, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious that this is a new instance of ritual impurity. The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us:</b> It is <b>specifically</b> if this <i>zav</i> <b>saw</b> a discharge <b>on the night</b> preceding the <b>eighth</b> day that he must bring an offering; <b>but</b> if he saw a discharge <b>on</b> the <b>seventh day</b> he is <b>not</b> obligated to bring an offering. This is because the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>holds: Any sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>that negates</b> the days of purity, i.e., which causes the <i>zav</i> to have to count seven clean days afresh, <b>does not bring</b> him <b>to</b> the point of being liable to bring another <b>offering.</b>
<b>Rava said: Why did you interpret that which is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that he <b>does not bring</b> another offering, as stating a ruling <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced three sightings?</b> If that is correct, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> this example <b>in</b> the list that appears in a mishna from the next chapter (9a): There are <b>five</b> people who <b>bring one offering for multiple transgressions,</b> i.e., for violating the same transgression several times. The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> did not include this case in that list because he could <b>not</b> state this <i>halakha</i> as <b>a definitive</b> ruling. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the <i>zav</i> <b>saw one</b> discharge <b>at night and</b> then <b>two on the</b> eighth <b>day,</b> he <b>brings</b> an additional offering for these discharges. By contrast, if he saw <b>two</b> discharges <b>at night and one in the day,</b> he <b>does not bring</b> an additional offering.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Know that</b> if a <i>zav</i> saw <b>one</b> discharge <b>at night and two in the day</b> he <b>brings</b> an additional offering. This is <b>because</b> the <b>first sighting</b> of any <i>zav</i> is considered <b>merely semen,</b> since one who has a single discharge of <i>ziva</i> immerses on that day and is rendered ritually pure at sundown, like one who experiences a seminal emission. <b>And yet</b> if he <b>sees two other</b> discharges <b>they combine</b> with the first one <b>to</b> establish <b>him</b> as a <i>zav</i> and render him liable to bring an offering. The same applies in this case with regard to the eighth day.
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: Are the cases comparable?</b> With regard to the <b>first sighting of a <i>zav</i>, he saw it at a time of</b> potential <b>liability</b> to bring an offering, which is why it combines with the next two discharges. By contrast, in a case where a <i>zav</i> sees <b>one</b> discharge <b>at night</b> preceding the eighth day, <b>since he saw it</b> when it was <b>not the time of</b> potential <b>liability</b> to bring an offering for the subsequent two sightings, as one who sees three discharges on the night preceding the eighth day does not bring an additional offering, <b>were it not</b> for the fact <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan teaches us that it combines</b> with the other two discharges <b>I would say</b> it <b>does not combine</b> with them.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>night</b> is considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, as indicated by his ruling that if a <i>zav</i> experienced two discharges at night and one in the daytime he does not bring an additional offering?
<b>But doesn’t Ḥizkiyya say</b> that if a nazirite contracted ritual impurity through contact with a corpse and underwent the purification rites, after which he must bring an offering on the eighth day, and he again <b>became ritually impure on the</b> eighth <b>day</b> itself, he <b>brings</b> a second set of offerings. But if he became ritually impure <b>on the night</b> preceding the eighth day he <b>does not bring</b> an additional set of offerings, because he could not have brought the offering at night. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if the nazirite became ritually impure <b>on the night</b> preceding the eighth day, he <b>brings</b> a second set of offerings. This indicates that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, night is not considered part of a date whose time has not yet arrived.
The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that if a <i>zav</i> experienced <b>two</b> discharges <b>at night and one on the</b> eighth <b>day</b> he <b>does not bring</b> an additional offering, he spoke <b>according to the statement of the one who says</b> that <b>night</b> is considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. He himself maintains that even if a <i>zav</i> experienced all three discharges at night he must bring an additional offering.
The Gemara objects: If he spoke only <b>according to the statement of the one who says</b> that night is considered part of a date whose time has not yet arrived, it is <b>obvious</b> that no new offerings are required. What novelty did Rabbi Yoḥanan intend to express? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for him</b> to teach the first case, of a <i>zav</i> who <b>saw one</b> discharge <b>at night and two in the day. Lest you say: Since he saw</b> the one at night <b>when it was not the time of</b> incurring <b>liability</b> to bring an offering, <b>it should not combine</b> with the other two discharges. Rabbi Yoḥanan therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the discharges do combine with each other.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a woman who has in her</b> case <b>uncertainty</b> concerning <b>five births, and</b> likewise a woman with regard to whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> concerning <b>five</b> irregular <b>discharges</b> of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>], <b>she brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her.</b> If she experienced <b>five definite discharges of a <i>zava</i> or five definite births, she brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are an obligation for her.</b>
There was <b>an incident where</b> the price of <b>nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds, <b>stood in Jerusalem at one gold dinar,</b> as the great demand for birds for the offerings of a woman after childbirth and a <i>zava</i> led to an increase in the price. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b> I swear by <b>this abode</b> of the Divine Presence that <b>I will not lie</b> down <b>tonight until</b> the price of nests <b>will be in</b> silver <b>dinars. Ultimately, he entered the court and taught: A woman who has in her</b> case <b>five definite discharges of a <i>zava</i> or five definite births brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her. And</b> as a result, the price of the <b>nests stood that day at one-quarter</b> of a silver dinar, as the demand for nests decreased.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:10): If a woman has the obligations of <b>five definite births and five uncertain discharges of a <i>zava</i>, or five definite births and five uncertain births, she brings two nests, one for the definite</b> obligation <b>and one for the uncertain</b> obligation. That which she brought <b>for</b> the <b>definite</b> obligation is <b>eaten</b> by the priests, <b>and the remaining</b> offerings <b>are an obligation for her.</b> That which she brought <b>for</b> the <b>uncertain</b> obligation is <b>not eaten, and the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says:</b> With regard to offerings brought <b>for</b> the <b>definite</b> obligation, <b>she should say:</b> I am bringing the offering <b>for the last</b> definite obligation, <b>and she is exempt</b> from bringing the rest of the offerings. The reason is so that she should not think that no atonement is required for the others. With regard to offerings brought <b>for</b> the <b>uncertain</b> obligation, <b>if there is a definite</b> obligation <b>among</b> the uncertain offerings <b>she should say:</b> I am bringing it <b>for the definite</b> obligation, <b>and she is exempt</b> from the rest. <b>But if</b> there is <b>no</b> definite obligation <b>she should say:</b> I am bringing the offering <b>for</b> any <b>one of them,</b> not necessarily for the last one, <b>and she is exempt. Rabbi Akiva says: Whether</b> she brings her offering <b>for the definite</b> obligation or <b>whether</b> she brings it <b>for the uncertain</b> obligation, <b>she should say:</b> I am bringing it <b>for one of them, and she is exempt.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rav Pappa: I will say</b> a statement <b>to you in the name of Rava:</b> With regard to <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, with regard to what</b> matter do they <b>disagree?</b> Their disagreement is <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who requires her to bring the offering for her definite obligation for the last definite obligation, <b>compares</b> the offerings of a woman after childbirth <b>to a sin offering</b> brought for a transgression. <b>As, one who is liable</b> to bring <b>five sin offerings</b> does not achieve atonement <b>until he brings all of them, and</b> only the offering that he brings at the <b>end atones for him. Here too,</b> it <b>is no different,</b> and therefore she achieves atonement and may consume sacrificial food only if she brings an offering for her last obligation.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva compares</b> the offerings of a woman after childbirth <b>to immersions</b> in a ritual bath. <b>As</b> with regard to <b>one who is obligated</b> to perform <b>five immersions, once he</b> has <b>immersed one time he is purified. Here too,</b> it <b>is no different,</b> and consequently as soon as she brings an offering for any of the obligations she is ritually pure and is permitted to partake of sacrificial food.
<b>Rav Pappa said to</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: <b>If</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri compares</b> the offerings of a woman after childbirth <b>to a sin offering, why</b> then, with regard to offerings brought <b>for</b> the <b>uncertain</b> obligation, <b>should she say:</b> I am bringing it <b>for</b> any <b>one of them, and she is exempt? If one who is obligated</b>

Daf 8b

to bring <b>five provisional guilt offerings, when he brings one</b> offering <b>is he exempt</b> from bringing the rest? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>this is the principle:</b> In <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> one’s transgressions <b>are divided with regard to sin offerings,</b> i.e., where one must bring a separate sin offering for each act when he becomes aware that he has sinned, they are likewise <b>divided with regard to</b> provisional <b>guilt offerings,</b> when there is uncertainty as to whether or not he sinned?
<b>Rather, everyone</b> agrees that <b>we compare</b> the sin offerings of a woman after childbirth and a <i>zava</i> <b>to immersions,</b> and therefore by Torah law it is sufficient for her to say: I am bringing it for one of them. <b>And they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>we are concerned for</b> her <b>negligence. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri maintains we are concerned for</b> her <b>negligence.</b> In other words, if she says: I am bringing it for one of my obligations, if she gives birth in the following years she might think that she does not need to bring an offering for each birth, and she will neglect to bring an offering. By requiring her to declare: I am bringing the offering for the last definite obligation, the Sages thereby remind her that all her births require offerings. <b>And Rabbi Akiva maintains we are not concerned for</b> her <b>negligence,</b> and therefore it is sufficient for her to say: I am bringing the offering for one of them.<br/>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>four</b> individuals whose halakhic status is defined as: <b>Lacking atonement [<i>khappara</i>],</b> which means they had been in a state of ritual impurity and underwent rituals to purify themselves, but since they have not yet brought the requisite atonement offering to complete the purification process, they may not partake of sacrificial meat. <b>And</b> there are also <b>four</b> individuals who <b>bring</b> an offering <b>for an intentional</b> transgression in the same manner <b>as</b> they do for <b>an unwitting</b> transgression.
<b>And these are</b> the four individuals <b>who lack atonement: The man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>], the woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>], the woman after childbirth, and the leper.</b> In all four of these cases, although the individual has completed all of the other steps of the purification process, the process is not complete until the atonement offering has been brought.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A convert</b> also <b>lacks atonement,</b> even after he has been circumcised and has immersed in a ritual bath, <b>until</b> the priest <b>sprinkles the blood</b> of his offering on the altar <b>on his</b> behalf. <b>A nazirite</b> also lacks atonement <b>with regard to his</b> permission for drinking <b>wine, and cutting his hair, and his</b> exposure to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by a corpse, until his offerings are sacrificed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna lists four individuals whose status is defined as lacking atonement until their offering is brought: The <i>zav</i>, the <i>zava</i>, the woman after childbirth, and the leper. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i>, that</b> the <i>tanna</i> decided to <b>count them as two</b> separate cases? The Gemara answers: They are different <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the impurity of</b> a <i>zav</i> <b>is distinct</b> from that of a <i>zava</i>, <b>as a <i>zav</i> does not become impure</b> if he has a discharge <b>by accident,</b> i.e., due to a cause such as an illness or having consumed certain foods, whereas there is no such exemption in the case of a <i>zava</i>; <b>and a <i>zava</i>,</b> unlike a <i>zav</i>, <b>does not become impure by</b> three <b>sightings</b> of menstrual-type blood on one day <b>like</b> she becomes impure <b>by</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When any man has a discharge from his flesh, his discharge is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). The term <b>“from his flesh”</b> teaches that the discharge is impure only if it is due to an internal cause, <b>and not due to his accident. And</b> furthermore, a <i>zav</i> <b>becomes impure by</b> three <b>sightings</b> of gonorrhea-like discharge on one day <b>like</b> he becomes impure <b>by</b> three such sightings on three consecutive <b>days, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The verse links</b> the impurity of <b>the male,</b> i.e., a <i>zav</i>, <b>to</b> the number of <b>sightings</b> on the same day or on consecutive days, <b>and</b> of <b>the female</b> <i>zava</i> <b>to</b> the number of consecutive <b>days</b> on which she experiences sightings of blood. <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>a <i>zava</i> becomes impure</b> if she has a discharge <b>by accident, and does not become impure by</b> three <b>sightings</b> on one day <b>like</b> she becomes impure <b>by</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days.</b> Therefore, the mishna counts them as two separate cases.
The Gemara objects: But <b>the impurities of a male leper and a female leper are also distinct, as a male leper requires letting</b> his <b>hair grow wild and rending</b> his <b>garments, as it is written: “His garments shall be rent and the hair of his head shall go wild”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), <b>and he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>sexual intercourse.</b>
<b>And</b> by contrast, <b>a female leper does not require letting</b> her <b>hair grow wild and rending</b> her <b>garments, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “He is a leprous man” (Leviticus 13:44): <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> can be a leper; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> can also be a leper? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “And the leper</b> in whom the mark is” (Leviticus 13:45), without specifying a man, the verse teaches that <b>there are two here,</b> i.e., a man and a woman.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If so, why</b> does <b>the verse state:</b> “A leprous <b>man”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse removed it from the matter</b> stated <b>earlier,</b> and applied it <b>to the matter</b> stated <b>later:</b> “His garments shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go wild,” <b>to say</b> that <b>a man</b> who is a leper <b>lets his hair grow wild and rends his garments, but the woman</b> who is a leper <b>does not</b> need to <b>let her hair grow wild and</b> does not <b>rend her garments. And</b> a female leper <b>is permitted to</b> engage in <b>sexual intercourse, as it is stated: “And he shall dwell outside his tent for seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:8), <b>and not: Outside her tent.</b>
The Gemara now resumes stating its objection: <b>Therefore, let us count</b> the male and female leper <b>as two</b> separate cases, as the mishna does with regard to the <i>zav</i> and <i>zava</i>. Why does the mishna not do so? The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> and <i>zava</i>,</b> they are treated as separate cases because the <b>essence of their impurity is distinct,</b> as the impurity of a <i>zav</i> is based on the number of sightings of discharge, whereas the impurity of a <i>zava</i> is based on the number of consecutive days on which she experiences sightings of menstrual-type blood. By contrast, with regard to <b>a male leper and female leper,</b> the <b>essence of their impurity is not distinct,</b> as in both <b>this</b> case of a male leper <b>and that</b> case of a female leper, the impurity <b>is</b> based on a leprous mark which is at least the area <b>of a split bean.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A convert</b> also <b>lacks</b> atonement until the priest sprinkles the blood of his offering on the altar on his behalf. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>the first <i>tanna</i> does not</b> also <b>teach a convert,</b> i.e., why does the first <i>tanna</i> not include him in the list of individuals lacking atonement? The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the first <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> those individuals who lack atonement, he includes any <b>matter where</b> the atonement offering completes the process of purification and thereby <b>permits</b> the individual <b>to partake of sacrificial</b> meat. But <b>when a convert brings</b> his atonement <b>offering,</b> it is <b>to qualify him to enter the congregation</b> of Israel through marriage, not to permit him to partake of sacrificial meat.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that the first <i>tanna</i> also <b>does not teach</b> that <b>a nazirite</b> lacks atonement? The Gemara answers: <b>Ultimately, as well, when a nazirite brings</b> his <b>offering, it is to permit him to drink non-sacred wine,</b> not to permit him to partake of sacrificial meat.
The Gemara objects: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov, <b>who teaches a nazirite</b> in the mishna’s list of those who lack atonement, because the nazirite brings his offering in order <b>to permit himself</b> to drink wine, <b>let</b> him <b>also teach,</b> i.e., include in the list, <b>a ritually impure nazirite.</b> The Gemara answers: A ritually pure nazirite brings an offering in order to render an action permitted, and therefore Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov considers him lacking atonement. By contrast, <b>when</b> a ritually impure nazirite <b>brings</b> his <b>offering, it is</b> not to render an action permitted, but rather <b>to effect upon himself</b> a new period of <b>naziriteship in purity.</b>
§ With regard to the atonement offering of a convert, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A convert is precluded from partaking of sacrificial</b> meat <b>until he brings his bird nest,</b> i.e., his offering of a pair of birds, either pigeons or doves. If he <b>brought one young bird [<i>perida</i>]</b> in the <b>morning,</b> he <b>may partake of sacrificial</b> meat <b>in the evening,</b> and may bring the second bird at a later time. Furthermore, with regard to <b>all</b> other cases <b>in the Torah</b> where <b>bird nests</b> are mandated as offerings, <b>one</b> of the birds is brought as <b>a sin offering and</b> the other <b>one</b> as <b>a burnt offering;</b> but <b>here,</b> in the case of the convert, <b>both of them</b> are <b>burnt offerings.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If, instead of birds, the convert <b>brought</b> a burnt offering <b>from an animal</b> as <b>his obligatory</b> offering, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, and if he brought <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering,</b> he has also <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation; but if he brought <b>a meal offering and a peace offering,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. This is because <b>a bird nest was stated</b> in the Torah <b>only to be lenient</b> for him. Therefore, if he voluntarily brought an animal, which is more expensive, as a burnt offering, he has fulfilled his obligation.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a meal offering and peace offering, that</b> if the convert brings these he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as it is written:</b> “And if a stranger dwell with you, or whosoever may be among you, throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma unto the Lord; <b>as you do, so he shall do”</b> (Numbers 15:14). From this verse it is derived: <b>Just as you</b> brought <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> when you entered the covenant on Mount Sinai, as it is stated: “And they sacrificed burnt offerings, and they sacrificed peace offerings” (Exodus 24:5), <b>so too, a convert</b> must bring <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> in a case where he brought <b>one</b> offering <b>from an animal</b> for <b>his obligation, that should not be enough for him, as isn’t it written: “As you do, so he shall do,”</b> which teaches that he must bring both a burnt offering and a peace offering? Why, then, does the <i>baraita</i> state that a single burnt offering from an animal is sufficient? <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> One <b>can say</b> that this is derived from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>If a bird</b> offering <b>was included</b> as an inexpensive way for a convert to fulfill his obligation, would the Torah <b>not all the more so</b> include a more expensive <b>animal burnt offering?</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even a meal offering</b> should fulfill the convert’s obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse restricts</b> the acceptable offerings, excluding a meal offering, as it states: “Just as you do, <b>so</b> he shall do,” meaning that he must not do less than that.
The Gemara asks: <b>And where was a bird</b> offering <b>included</b> as an option? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“As you do, so he shall do”</b> (Numbers 15:14): <b>Just as you</b> entered the covenant with <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering, so too,</b> a convert fulfills his obligation with <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering, as it is stated: “As you are, so</b> shall <b>the stranger</b> be” (Numbers 15:15). <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> the option of <b>the bird</b> offering instead of an animal? <b>The verse states: “An offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma unto the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:14). <b>Which item is</b> an offering that is <b>entirely for the Lord? You must say:</b> This is referring to <b>a bird burnt offering,</b> which is entirely consumed upon the altar.

Daf 9a

The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include</b> as an option <b>even a meal offering,</b> which would not be entirely consumed on the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “So</b> he shall do,” to exclude a meal offering.
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever may be among you, throughout your generations, <b>and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma unto the Lord,</b> as you do, so he shall do” (Numbers 15:14).From this verse <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that he fulfills his obligation with <b>any</b> offering <b>that is brought on the fire</b> of the altar, <b>even a meal offering.</b> Therefore, to negate that interpretation, <b>the verse states: “As you do, so he shall do,”</b> which teaches that <b>just as you</b> entered the covenant with <b>types</b> of offerings whose <b>blood</b> is sprinkled on the altar, <b>so too</b> must <b>they,</b> converts, bring <b>types</b> of offerings whose <b>blood</b> is sprinkled on the altar.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> so, why not derive similarly: <b>Just as you</b> entered the covenant with <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering, so too, they</b> must enter the covenant <b>with a burnt offering and a peace offering?</b> How is it derived that a convert may fulfill his obligation with a single burnt offering from an animal? The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “As you are, so shall the stranger be</b> before the Lord” (Numbers 15:15). This serves to emphasize: <b>I compared him to you</b> in order to derive that just like you, he too must bring types of offerings whose blood is sprinkled on the altar, <b>but</b> I did <b>not</b> extend this comparison <b>to another matter,</b> i.e., to insist that his offerings must be identical to all of <b>your offerings.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The offering of a convert is derived from the verse: <b>“As you are,</b> so shall the stranger be” (Numbers 15:15), which means <b>as your ancestors</b> were: <b>Just as your ancestors entered the covenant only through circumcision and immersion</b> in a ritual bath <b>and the sprinkling of blood</b> on the altar, <b>so too they may enter the covenant only through circumcision and immersion and the sprinkling of</b> some <b>blood,</b> which requires at least a bird offering.
The <i>baraita</i> adds: And it <b>is impossible to bring</b> only <b>one young bird</b> as an offering, <b>as we have not found</b> an offering of a single bird anywhere <b>in the entire Torah.</b> Consequently, if the requirement for the sprinkling of blood is fulfilled with a bird offering, the convert must bring at least two birds. By contrast, if he chooses he may bring a single animal as a burnt offering, because <b>a bird nest was stated</b> in the Torah <b>only</b> in order <b>to be lenient for him.</b>
The Gemara challenges Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>And</b> is it true that we have <b>not</b> found an offering of an individual bird anywhere in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a bird sacrificed as a burnt offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Since</b> it <b>is stated about doves: “And he shall sacrifice</b> his offering of doves” (Leviticus 1:14), in the plural, <b>I</b> might <b>derive</b> from here that <b>the one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a bird</b> as <b>a burnt offering, shall not bring less than two young birds.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15), in the singular, to teach that one may bring a gift offering of <b>even one</b> single <b>young bird.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>In any event, we have not found an obligatory</b> offering of just one bird.
The Gemara challenges this assertion as well: <b>But isn’t there</b> the offering of <b>a woman after childbirth, who brings</b> a single <b>pigeon or dove as a sin offering</b> (Leviticus 12:6)? The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, <b>because</b> in that case <b>there is a lamb with it</b> as part of her offerings; the bird is not brought as a complete offering by itself.
The Gemara returns to the main part of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement. <b>The Master said: Just as your ancestors entered the covenant only</b> through circumcision, immersion in a ritual bath, and the sprinkling of blood, converts must do the same. The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> they underwent <b>circumcision</b> prior to entering the covenant, <b>as it is written: “For all the nation that left</b> Egypt <b>was circumcised”</b> (Joshua 5:5). <b>Alternatively,</b> it may be derived <b>from here,</b> a verse describing the redemption from Egypt: <b>“And when I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said unto you: In your blood, live;</b> and I said unto you: In your blood, live” (Ezekiel 16:6). The Sages interpret the double mention of blood in this verse as referring to the blood of the Paschal offering and the blood of circumcision.
The Gemara continues: And granted as well, they entered the covenant through <b>the sprinkling of blood, as it is written: “And he sent the young men of the children of Israel,</b> and they sacrificed burnt offerings, and they sacrificed peace offerings” (Exodus 24:5). The Gemara asks: <b>But from where do we</b> derive that <b>immersion</b> in a ritual bath was also part of the process of entering the covenant? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Moses took half the blood</b>…<b>and sprinkled it on the people”</b> (Exodus 24:6–8), <b>and there is no sprinkling</b> of sacrificial blood <b>without immersion.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that these three rituals are required by Torah law for a convert to enter the congregation, then <b>now,</b> in our time, <b>when there are no offerings, we not should</b> have the ability to <b>accept converts.</b> In response, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> that the verse states: <b>“And if a stranger sojourn with you,</b> or <b>whosoever may be among you,</b> throughout your generations” (Numbers 15:14). This teaches that converts may be accepted throughout the generations, even when there is no Temple and sacrificial offerings are therefore impossible.
§ With regard to the offerings of a convert, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A convert in the present time is required to set aside a quarter</b> of a dinar <b>for his bird nest,</b> so that when the Temple is rebuilt he can purchase the offering with this money. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai already</b> assembled a panel of Sages who <b>voted and nullified</b> this ordinance, <b>due to</b> a potential <b>mishap.</b> If one would inadvertently use such money, he would be liable for the misuse of consecrated property. <b>Rav Idi bar Gershom says</b> that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that a convert should not set aside money for the purchase of offerings.
The Gemara comments: <b>And there are</b> those <b>who teach this</b> statement of Rav Adda bar Ahava <b>with regard to this</b> case, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>]</b> is <b>permitted to perform labor on Shabbat for himself in the same manner</b> that <b>a Jew</b> is permitted to perform labor <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> i.e., only for matters that, if unattended, will result in significant loss.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> A <i>ger toshav</i> may perform labor on Shabbat <b>in the same manner</b> that <b>a Jew</b> is permitted to perform labor <b>on a Festival,</b> i.e., only for the purpose of preparing food. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: A <i>ger toshav</i> may perform</b> labor <b>on Shabbat for himself in the same manner</b> that <b>a Jew</b> is permitted to perform labor <b>on a weekday. Rabbi Shimon says: Both a <i>ger toshav</i> and a resident male or female slave may perform labor on Shabbat for themselves in the same manner</b> that <b>a Jew</b> may perform labor <b>on a weekday.</b> According to this tradition, it is in relation to this <i>baraita</i> that Rav Adda bar Ahava said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> individuals <b>bring</b> an offering <b>for an intentional</b> transgression in the same manner <b>as</b> they do for <b>an unwitting</b> transgression: <b>One who engages in intercourse with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant,</b> who is liable to bring a guilt offering (see Leviticus 19:20–22); <b>and a nazirite who became ritually impure,</b> who is required to bring a sheep as a guilt offering and two doves or two pigeons, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering (see Numbers 6:9–12); <b>and</b> one who falsely takes <b>the oath of testimony,</b> asserting that he does not have any testimony to provide on a given issue (see Leviticus 5:1); <b>and</b> one who falsely takes <b>the oath on a deposit,</b> asserting that an item belonging to another is not in his possession (see Leviticus 5:21–26).
There are <b>five</b> individuals who <b>bring one offering for several transgressions,</b> i.e., for violating the same transgression several times; <b>and</b> there are <b>five</b> individuals who <b>bring a sliding-scale offering,</b> which is determined based on the financial status of the sinner. <b>These</b> are the five individuals who <b>bring one offering for several transgressions:</b> First, <b>one who engages in several</b> acts of <b>intercourse with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant, and</b> second, <b>a nazirite who became ritually impure</b> due to <b>several</b> instances <b>of</b> contact with <b>ritual impurity.</b>
gemara The mishna teaches that <b>one who engages in intercourse with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant</b> brings an offering for an intentional transgression as he does for an unwitting transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this?
<b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord <b>for his sin that he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 19:22). The superfluous phrase: That he has sinned, <b>teaches that</b> he <b>brings one offering for several transgressions.</b> Furthermore, the verse concludes: <b>“With the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord for his sin that he has sinned; <b>and he shall be forgiven for his sin that he has sinned.”</b> The second occurrence of the phrase “that he has sinned” serves <b>to render</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an unwitting</b> transgression the same <b>as</b> it is with regard to <b>an intentional</b> transgression, that one brings a guilt offering in either case.
§ The mishna teaches: A <b>nazirite who became ritually impure</b> brings an offering for an intentional transgression as he does for an unwitting transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“And if any man die unexpectedly [<i>befeta</i>], suddenly [<i>pitom</i>] beside him”</b> (Numbers 6:9). When the verse states: <b>“Unexpectedly,” this</b> is referring to <b>an unwitting</b> transgression, <b>and similarly, it states: “But if he thrust him unexpectedly without enmity”</b> (Numbers 35:22). And when the verse states: <b>“Suddenly,” this</b> is referring to <b>circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control, and similarly, it states: “And the Lord spoke suddenly to Moses,</b> and to Aaron, and to Miriam: Come out you three to the Tent of Meeting. And they three came out” (Numbers 12:4). The Lord’s speech came to them suddenly, in a manner that was beyond their control.
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Suddenly”; this</b> is referring to <b>an intentional</b> transgression, <b>and similarly</b> the verse <b>states: “A prudent man sees the evil, and hides himself; but the thoughtless pass on, and are punished”</b> (Proverbs 22:3). The <i>tanna</i> interprets the expression “the thoughtless [<i>peta’im</i>]” as related to the word “suddenly [<i>pitom</i>],” and one can be punished, as the thoughtless are punished in the verse, but only for an intentional transgression.
The Gemara objects: <b>Let the verse write</b> simply: <b>“Suddenly [<i>pitom</i>],” as</b> this term <b>indicates unwitting</b> transgression, <b>and</b> it also <b>indicates intentional</b> transgression, <b>and</b> it also <b>indicates</b> transgression due to <b>circumstances beyond his control.</b> The Gemara elaborates: “Suddenly” indicates <b>intentional</b> transgression <b>and</b> transgression due to <b>circumstances beyond his control, as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said</b> in the <i>baraitot</i> earlier; <b>and it also indicates unwitting</b> transgression, <b>as it is written: “The thoughtless one [<i>peti</i>] believes every word”</b> (Proverbs 14:15), and because he is misinformed, his transgression is unwitting. <b>And</b> if so, <b>let the verse not write: Unexpected [<i>peta</i>].</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>If the verse had written</b> only <b>“suddenly,” which indicates unwitting</b> transgression, <b>and</b> also <b>indicates intentional</b> transgression, <b>and</b> also <b>indicates</b> transgression due to <b>circumstances beyond his control, I would say: When</b> a nazirite <b>brings an offering,</b> it is in a situation where he transgressed <b>unwittingly, as is the case for</b> all mitzvot in <b>the entire Torah,</b> that one is generally liable to bring an offering for an unwitting transgression; <b>but</b> for a transgression due to <b>circumstances beyond his control or an intentional</b> transgression, I would <b>say</b> the nazirite is <b>not</b> liable to bring an offering.
Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote: Unexpected, which is</b> a term that indicates <b>unwitting</b> transgression, in order <b>to reveal about</b> the word <b>“suddenly” that it is</b> a term that indicates transgression due to <b>circumstances beyond his control or intentional</b> transgression. Consequently, it teaches <b>that even</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>the Merciful One rendered him liable</b> to bring an offering.
§ The mishna teaches that one who falsely takes <b>the oath of testimony</b> brings an offering for an intentional transgression in the same manner as he does for an unwitting transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all</b> those who are liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>it is stated: “And it be hid</b> from him” (see Leviticus 5:2–4). But <b>here,</b> with regard to the oath of testimony (Leviticus 5:1), <b>it is not stated: And it be hid</b> from him. This omission serves <b>to render</b> him <b>liable for an unwitting</b> transgression in the same manner <b>as an intentional</b> transgression.
The mishna teaches that one who falsely takes <b>the oath on a deposit</b> brings an offering for an intentional transgression as he does for an unwitting transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“shall sin,”</b> stated with regard to an oath on a deposit (Leviticus 5:21), and the term <b>“shall sin,”</b> stated <b>with regard to the oath of testimony</b> (Leviticus 5:1). It is derived from this verbal analogy that just as in the case of the oath of testimony one is liable for committing an intentional transgression in the same manner as an unwitting transgression, the same applies to the oath on a deposit.
§ The mishna teaches: There are <b>five</b> individuals who <b>bring one offering for several transgressions,</b> i.e., for violating the same transgression several times. Among them, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: One who engages in several</b> acts of <b>intercourse with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord <b>for his sin that he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 19:22). The superfluous phrase “that he has sinned” <b>teaches that</b> he <b>brings one offering for several transgressions.</b> Furthermore, the verse concludes: <b>“With the ram of the guilt offering</b> before the Lord for his sin that he has sinned; <b>and he shall be forgiven for his sin that he has sinned.”</b> The second instance of the phrase “that he has sinned” serves <b>to render</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an intentional</b> transgression the same <b>as</b> it is with regard to <b>an unwitting</b> transgression, that one brings a guilt offering in either case.
The Gemara objects: <b>But when this verse is written,</b> it is <b>written with regard to an intentional</b> transgression, as the verse states: “There shall be an inspection” (Leviticus 19:20), which indicates a punishment of lashes, and lashes are given only for an intentional transgression. The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, say</b> that the language of the <i>baraita</i> should be reversed, as follows: The phrase “that he has sinned” <b>renders</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an unwitting</b> transgression to be the same <b>as</b> it is with regard to <b>an intentional</b> transgression.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina of Tirna’a raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If <b>one engages in intercourse with five espoused maidservants [<i>shefaḥot ḥarufot</i>] in one lapse of awareness,</b> meaning that he was not informed of the prohibition in between his unwitting transgressions, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every one, or is he liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every one.</b>
Rabbi Ḥanina asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>What is different</b> about this instance compared <b>to</b> the case of <b>five lapses of awareness with regard to one</b> espoused <b>maidservant,</b> when he brings only one offering, as stated in the mishna? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> In a case of multiple transgressions with <b>one</b> espoused <b>maidservant,</b> there <b>are not separate bodies,</b> as he committed multiple transgressions with the same individual. By contrast, in a case of separate transgressions with <b>five</b> espoused <b>maidservants,</b> there are five <b>separate bodies,</b> and therefore each one requires a separate offering.
Rabbi Ḥanina further asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> there is halakhic significance to the <b>separate bodies</b> in the case <b>of</b> an espoused <b>maidservant?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Did you not state with regard to those with whom relations are forbidden</b> that when the verse states: <b>“And</b> you shall not approach unto <b>a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness” (Leviticus 18:19), this serves <b>to</b> require <b>separate</b> offerings <b>for each and every woman</b> with whom one committed unwitting transgressions? <b>With regard to</b> an espoused <b>maidservant it is also</b> similarly <b>written: “And if a man lies carnally with a woman,</b>

Daf 9b

<b>and she is a maidservant</b> designated to a man” (Leviticus 19:20). This verse likewise serves <b>to</b> require <b>separate</b> offerings <b>for each and every</b> espoused <b>maidservant.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A nazirite who became ritually impure</b> with <b>several</b> instances of contact with <b>ritual impurity</b> brings one offering for several transgressions. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught</b> this?
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> A new <b>naziriteship of purity,</b> which is required of a nazirite who became ritually impure, <b>takes effect from</b> the <b>seventh</b> day of the nazirite’s purification. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>you find</b> that the nazirite brings one offering for several transgressions in a case <b>where</b> he <b>became impure on the seventh</b> day of his purification, was pure for seven days, <b>and again became impure on the seventh</b> day of his purification. <b>And since for</b> each case where he became impure <b>the appropriate time to sacrifice an offering,</b> i.e., the eighth day of his purification, <b>had not</b> yet <b>emerged, he is liable to bring only one offering.</b>
Rav Ḥisda explains: The mishna must be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>as if</b> it follows the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, then it is not possible for a nazirite to bring one offering for several transgressions, <b>since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> A new <b>naziriteship of purity does not take effect until</b> a nazirite’s <b>eighth</b> day of purification. <b>If</b> there was a case <b>where</b> a nazirite <b>became impure on the seventh</b> day of his purification, was pure for seven days, <b>and</b> then <b>became impure again on the seventh</b> day of his purification, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>that is all</b> one <b>long</b> period of <b>impurity,</b> as the new term of naziriteship has not yet begun, and therefore the nazirite brings one offering for the entire period.
And <b>if</b> there was a case <b>where</b> a nazirite <b>became impure on the eighth</b> day of his purification, was pure for seven days, <b>and</b> then <b>again became impure on the eighth</b> day of his purification, then <b>since the appropriate time to sacrifice an offering had emerged, he is obligated</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every</b> time he became impure. Rav Ḥisda concludes: <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And what</b> is the statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a nazirite who begins a new naziriteship of purity after having become impure: “And on the eighth day he shall bring two doves or two pigeons…And the priest shall prepare one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead; <b>and he shall sanctify his head on that day”</b> (Numbers 6:10–11). This teaches that the new term of naziriteship begins <b>on the day of the bringing of his offerings,</b> which is the eighth day of his purification. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> The verse means that the new term of naziriteship begins <b>on the day of his shaving,</b> i.e., the seventh day of his purification.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues to list the five situations in which one offering is brought to atone for several transgressions: Third, <b>one who issues a warning to his wife</b> declaring himself jealous <b>with regard to several</b> different <b>men</b> with whom he suspects her of committing adultery, and forbidding her to be alone with them. If the wife was then found separately in seclusion with each of the men, he brings her to the Temple with one single meal offering of jealousy. <b>And</b> fourth, <b>a leper who was afflicted</b> with <b>several</b> instances of <b>leprosy,</b> meaning that he was purified from his leprosy, and before he brought his offerings, he suffered a relapse of the leprosy. When he is finally purified, he brings only one set of offerings.
If a leper <b>brought</b> the two requisite <b>birds</b> on the first day of his purification (see Leviticus 14:4–7), <b>and</b> prior to bringing his offerings on the eighth day of his purification he <b>was afflicted</b> with a relapse of leprosy, those birds <b>do not satisfy his obligation until he brings his sin offering. Rabbi Yehuda says: Until he brings his guilt offering.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a man issues a warning to his wife with regard to several different men, and the wife violates the warning and is secluded with each of them, he brings one meal offering of jealousy. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it is written: “This is the law of jealousies,</b> when a wife, being under her husband, goes aside, and is defiled” (Numbers 5:29). The plural form of the word “jealousies,” teaches that <b>one law,</b> meaning one sacrificial offering, can suffice <b>for several jealousies,</b> i.e., different warnings.
The mishna teaches that <b>a leper who was afflicted</b> with <b>several</b> instances of <b>leprosy</b> brings one single offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it is written: “This</b> shall be <b>the law of the leper</b> in the day of his purification” (Leviticus 14:2). The term “the law” teaches that <b>one law,</b> meaning one sacrificial offering, can suffice <b>for several lepers,</b> i.e., for several instances of leprosy in the same individual.
§ The mishna teaches: If a leper <b>brought</b> the two <b>birds</b> on the first day of his purification, <b>and</b> prior to bringing his offerings on the eighth day of his purification he <b>was afflicted</b> with a relapse of leprosy, those birds <b>do not satisfy his obligation until he brings his sin offering. Rabbi Yehuda says: Until he brings his guilt offering.</b> This apparently means that when he is healed from the relapse of his leprosy, he must bring additional birds to fulfill the obligation generated by the first instance of leprosy.
The Gemara challenges this assumption: <b>But didn’t you say</b> in the mishna that <b>he brings only one</b> set of <b>offerings</b> for several instances of leprosy? The Gemara answers: The text of the mishna <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> In the case of a leper who was afflicted with several instances of leprosy and was subsequently purified from his leprosy, if he <b>brought</b> the two <b>birds, and was</b> then <b>afflicted</b> with a relapse of leprosy, he <b>brings only one</b> set of <b>offerings. But</b> with regard to <b>establishing</b> whether a leper has a status <b>of poverty or of affluence</b> in order to determine whether he brings a poor man’s offering or a rich man’s offering (see Leviticus, chapter 14), that <b>is not established until he brings</b> his <b>sin offering. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The leper’s status of poverty or affluence is not established <b>until he brings his guilt offering.</b>
The Gemara cites a dispute that supports this interpretation: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:11): In a case of <b>a leper who</b> was poor when he <b>brought his guilt offering and then became wealthy</b> before bringing the other offerings, <b>all</b> differences in offerings between a leper with the status of a rich man or a poor man <b>follow</b> his status at the time he brought his <b>sin offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says: It all follows</b> his status at the time he brought his <b>guilt offering.</b> The Gemara cites an additional opinion: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: It all follows</b> his status at the time he brought the two <b>birds.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> All <b>three of them interpreted the same verse</b> to arrive at their respective opinions: “This is the law of he who has the mark of leprosy, <b>whose means do not suffice for that which pertains to his purification”</b> (Leviticus 14:32). <b>Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the term “his purification” is referring to the <b>matter that atones for his</b> sin, i.e., the sin offering. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that it is referring to the <b>matter that renders him fit</b> to consume sacrificial meat, which is the guilt offering. And <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> that it is referring to the <b>matter that causes him</b> to return to a state of <b>purity. And what are these?</b> The <b>birds.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues with the last of the five situations in which one offering is brought to atone for several transgressions: <b>A woman who gave birth to several offspring.</b> This is a case where a woman gave birth to a daughter, after which she is ritually impure for fourteen days and then enters a period of sixty-six days of ritual purity, even if she experiences uterine bleeding. Nevertheless, during this interim period, she is still somewhat impure, and it is therefore prohibited for her to enter the Temple or to partake of consecrated food, and at the end of the period she must bring an offering. <b>And</b> during those days of ritual purity, <b>she</b> became pregnant again and then <b>miscarried a female</b> fetus <b>within</b> the <b>eighty</b> days, <b>and then</b> became pregnant <b>again and miscarried</b> another <b>female</b> fetus <b>within eighty</b> days of the first miscarriage. In this situation, when she ultimately completes her process of purification, she brings one single offering for all the births and miscarriages.
<b>And</b> a similar <i>halakha</i> applies to a woman <b>who miscarries multiple</b> fetuses from a single pregnancy at different points in time, miscarrying each fetus before completing the purification period of forty days for a male or eighty days for a female for the previous fetus. When she finally completes her process of purification, she brings one single offering for all of the miscarriages.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In these cases, a single offering does not suffice for all the births or miscarriages. Rather, <b>she brings</b> an offering <b>for the first</b> birth or miscarriage and <b>does not bring</b> an offering <b>for the second</b> miscarriage, as it took place before the completion of the purification period for the first. <b>She</b> then <b>brings</b> an offering <b>for the third</b> miscarriage <b>and does not bring</b> an offering <b>for the fourth</b> fetus, as it was miscarried before the completion of the purification period for the third fetus.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a woman who gave birth to several offspring brings a single offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>As the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“This is the law for the woman who bears a child, whether a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 12:7). <b>This teaches that she brings one offering for several offspring.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that she brings one single offering <b>even</b> in a case where she becomes purified simultaneously both <b>for a birth and for</b> an irregular <b>discharge</b> of blood from the uterus <b>[<i>ziva</i>].</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> to exclude such a case.
The Gemara challenges the assumption that was refuted by the textual derivation: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that even in a case where she completes her purification at the same time <b>for a birth and for <i>ziva</i>, she should bring only one offering. If that is so,</b> then in a case where she <b>consumed blood</b> unintentionally, and is therefore liable to bring a sin offering, <b>and</b> she also <b>gave birth,</b> might one <b>also</b> have thought <b>that she should bring only one offering?</b> That is illogical, as these offerings are two completely different obligations. So too, the offerings after childbirth and <i>ziva</i> are two separate obligations.
The Gemara explains: Rather, <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> taught: One <b>might</b> have thought that she should bring only one offering <b>for a birth that</b> occurred <b>before the completion</b> of the term, i.e., the first birth, <b>and for a birth that</b> occurred <b>after the completion</b> of the purification period for the first one. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> to negate that assumption.
§ The mishna teaches that in a case of a woman who <b>miscarried within</b> the <b>eighty-</b>day purification period of a previous miscarriage, and then miscarried a third time within the eighty-day purification period for the second miscarriage, the first <i>tanna</i> says that she brings a single offering for all of them, and Rabbi Yehuda says that she must bring a separate offering for the third miscarriage, as it took place after the completion of the purification period for the first one. The Gemara states: When you analyze the matter <b>you will find</b> that one should <b>say</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the <b>first fetus</b> is the one that <b>causes</b> the obligation of the offering, <b>and she</b> therefore <b>counts</b> the purification period <b>from</b> the birth or miscarriage of the <b>first fetus;</b> and <b>according to</b> the <b>Rabbis,</b> it is the <b>second fetus</b> that <b>causes</b> the obligation of the offering, <b>and she counts</b> the purification period <b>from</b> the birth or miscarriage <b>of</b> the <b>second fetus.</b>
The Gemara asks: Why was it necessary to state that when you analyze the matter <b>you will</b> find that one should <b>say</b> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the first fetus causes the obligation and according to the Rabbis it is the second fetus which causes the obligation? This is <b>obvious,</b> as <b>it is</b> stated explicitly. The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> the Gemara to say this with regard to the case of a woman who <b>miscarries multiple</b> fetuses from the same pregnancy. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>in</b> a case of a woman who <b>miscarries multiple</b> fetuses from the same pregnancy, <b>Rabbi Yehuda concedes to the Rabbis</b> that as the fetuses were in the womb together, their births are deemed a single event, and therefore the woman counts eighty days from the miscarriage of the second fetus. Consequently, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with the Rabbis even in this case.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages:

Daf 10a

<b>Concerning ritual impurity, what does Rabbi Yehuda say? Do we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the <b>second offspring is</b> considered <b>as though it does not</b> exist <b>only with regard to the matter of an offering?</b> In other words, <b>since the time</b> in <b>which</b> it was <b>possible to sacrifice an offering</b> for the second fetus <b>had not</b> yet <b>emerged, since that is so,</b> the <b>second offspring is</b> considered <b>as though it does not</b> exist. <b>But concerning the matter of ritual impurity and purity,</b> we <b>say</b> that <b>he holds</b> that it is considered <b>as something that does</b> exist, <b>and</b> accordingly, the days of <b>impurity</b> brought on <b>by</b> the <b>second</b> birth <b>interrupt</b> the days of purity following the first birth. The woman must therefore observe the days of impurity for the second birth, <b>and</b> afterward <b>she completes the days of purity for</b> the <b>first</b> birth, <b>and then counts the days of purity</b> brought on <b>by the second</b> fetus.
<b>Or perhaps, according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the second offspring is considered as though it exists only where <b>there is a stringency</b> that results from that definition. <b>But here,</b> if the woman would complete the days of purity of the first birth after the days of impurity of the second, <b>this is a leniency,</b> as she is deemed pure even if she sees blood during these days, <b>and</b> therefore, perhaps Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not hold</b> that the offspring is considered existent where this results in <b>a leniency.</b>
<b>Rav Huna from Sura said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a woman after childbirth, one slaughters</b> the Paschal offering <b>and sprinkles</b> its blood <b>on her account</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan, if this occurs <b>on</b> the <b>fortieth day</b> after giving birth <b>to a male or on</b> the <b>eightieth day</b> after giving birth <b>to a female.</b> Although she is still impure at the time of the sacrifice, she will be able to partake of the Paschal offering on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan.
The Sages challenged this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is that so?</b> But <b>she is</b> still <b>impure</b> on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan, and she may not partake of sacrificial meat until she brings her offering on the forty-first day for a male or the eighty-first day for a female. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that the <b>second offspring is deemed as though it does not</b> exist. The <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case where the woman gave birth to two male offspring on two consecutive days, and the fourteenth of Nisan occurred on the fortieth day after the birth of the second offspring, which is the forty-first day following the birth of the first.
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>concerning impurity, Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the <b>second offspring is</b> considered <b>as though it is</b> extant, which means that the days of purity following the first birth are delayed by the second birth and the mother does not become pure until the second term is complete, <b>how may one slaughter</b> the Paschal offering <b>on her account on the fortieth day?</b> After all, <b>in the evening</b> of the fifteenth <b>she also may not eat</b> the Paschal offering, because only forty days will have passed from the time of the second birth, and she would still be impure. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> it that <b>concerning ritual purity and impurity, Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the <b>second offspring is</b> considered <b>as</b> though <b>it does not</b> exist?
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you:</b> Even <b>concerning impurity and purity, Rabbi Yehuda holds that</b> the <b>second offspring is considered as something that does</b> exist; <b>and when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is dealing with a case of a woman who gave birth to one child, and it is referring to a case <b>of a Paschal offering that is brought in impurity.</b> When the majority of a community is impure, the Paschal offering is brought even in impurity.
The Gemara objects: <b>And</b> in that case, <b>does she partake</b> of it, as the <i>baraita</i> suggests? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 95b): With regard to <b>a Paschal offering brought in impurity, men who experience a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zavim</i>], women who experience a discharge of uterine blood after their menstrual periods [<i>zavot</i>], menstruating women, and women after childbirth may not partake of it?</b>
The Gemara explains: In <b>that</b> case, <b>they do not partake</b> of it <b>because they did not immerse</b> themselves in a ritual bath. But <b>when that</b> mishna <b>is taught, that one slaughters</b> the Paschal offering <b>and sprinkles</b> its blood <b>on her account,</b> the reason is <b>that she</b> had already <b>immersed</b> herself on the eighth day after giving birth. The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>it is from</b> the <b>eighth</b> day following <b>his</b> birth <b>that</b> she <b>is fit</b> to eat a Paschal offering brought in impurity, and there is no reason for the <i>baraita</i> to specify that the offering is slaughtered on the fortieth day.
The Gemara explains: Actually, she <b>is not fit from</b> the <b>eighth day,</b> because the <i>tanna</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>a <i>zav</i> who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed <b>is considered</b> to have the status <b>of a <i>zav</i></b> and may not partake of a Paschal offering brought in ritual impurity. Similarly, a woman who immerses after giving birth is considered like one who immersed that day, and therefore she cannot partake of sacrificial meat until the end of the forty-day period.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>on</b> the <b>fortieth day she is also not fit</b> to eat the Paschal offering. The Gemara explains: This is <b>not so; on</b> the <b>fortieth day she is fit</b> to partake of the Paschal offering after nightfall, because the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>a <i>zav</i></b> who has immersed himself and waited for nightfall but is <b>lacking atonement,</b> i.e., he has not yet brought an atonement offering to complete the purification process, <b>is not considered</b> to have the status <b>of a <i>zav</i>.</b> Therefore, after completing the purification period, the woman may partake of the offering, despite the fact that she has not yet brought her atonement offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rava, who says</b> that <b>a <i>zav</i> who</b> is <b>lacking atonement is considered</b> to have the status <b>of a <i>zav</i>, how does he resolve</b> the problem in <b>this <i>baraita</i>? Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>Rava resolves it</b> as follows: The <i>baraita</i> is not referring to the fortieth day after the birth of a male, but to a miscarriage that occurred on the <b>fortieth day after the conception of a male, or</b> the <b>eightieth day after the conception of a female. And it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that it takes <b>forty-one</b> days <b>for a male</b> fetus to be formed, and <b>eighty-one</b> days <b>for a female</b> fetus to be formed. Since the miscarriage occurred before the forty-first or eighty-first day, it does not render the woman impure with the impurity of childbirth, and therefore she may partake of the Paschal offering.
The Gemara objects: But <b>ultimately,</b> one should <b>conclude that she is impure because</b> she has the status of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara explains: The mishna was stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a dry birth,</b> in which no blood was expelled, and therefore no impurity imparted. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating it?</b> The ruling in such a case is obvious. The Gemara answers: It was necessary to state it, <b>lest you say</b> that it is <b>impossible for the womb to open without blood</b> being expelled. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us that it is possible for the womb to open without blood</b> being expelled. Accordingly, Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to the impurity of a second birth cannot be deduced from this mishna.
<b>Rabbi Shemaya said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a woman who gave birth to a female: “And she shall continue in the blood of purification <b>sixty</b> days and six days” (Leviticus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that she counts the days <b>whether they are continuous or dispersed.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Sixty <b>days</b> and six days,” to teach that <b>just as a day is a continuous</b> time period, <b>so too all sixty</b> days <b>are continuous.</b> And <b>whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>are the Rabbis of</b> the opinion that it is possible for a woman who gave birth to count <b>dispersed</b> days? This is not the case, as the Rabbis count the days of purification from the second birth.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? And from</b> the fact that <b>he prescribes for her sixty continuous days</b> to be counted <b>together, conclude from it</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that the second offspring is considered extant only where <b>a stringency</b> results, but where <b>a leniency</b> results, in that she continues counting the days of purity of the first birth after completing the days of impurity for the second birth, <b>he does not maintain</b> that the second offspring is considered as though it exists.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> stated in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And what are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a woman who gives birth to a male within</b> the <b>eighty-</b>day period following the birth <b>of a female,</b> so that the forty-day period for the male is entirely subsumed within the purification period for the female. In such a case, even the Rabbis would maintain that the second birth does not interrupt the term following the first. She would observe the seven days of impurity for the male, and then complete the days of purity for the female. Consequently, the verse teaches that the sixty-six days of purity following the first birth are observed continuously, and there is no need to observe additional days due to the intervening days of impurity.
The Gemara objects: But <b>ultimately,</b> this scenario is impossible; the reason is that <b>the days of the first</b> birth <b>are completed while the days of the latter</b> birth <b>are not completed, as the Rabbis count the days following the second birth,</b> and therefore the term relating to the first birth is abandoned. The Gemara offers a different explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rather, you find</b> a case of counting dispersed days <b>according to the Rabbis</b> in a case <b>where a woman gives birth to twins, first a female and then a male, and for example, she gives birth to the latter</b> offspring, the <b>male, on</b> the <b>twentieth</b> day <b>of</b> the <b>days</b> of <b>purity</b> for the female, <b>as she is required to observe for him seven days of impurity for birth.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>where she gave birth to twins, a female initially and a male afterward,</b> that the <b>impurity of</b> the second <b>birth interrupts</b> the term following the first birth <b>in the middle, and she counts sixty-six dispersed days.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Sixty <b>days</b> and six days,” to teach that <b>just as a day is an entirely continuous</b> time period, <b>so too all sixty</b> days <b>are</b> to be <b>continuous.</b> Since the <i>baraita</i> could be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, no proof can be inferred with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> which discusses a woman who gave birth to a male. The verse states: “And she shall continue in the blood of purification three days and <b>thirty</b> days” (Leviticus 12:4). One <b>might</b> have thought that she counts the days <b>whether they are continuous or dispersed.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Three <b>days</b> and thirty days,” to teach that <b>just as a day is an entirely continuous</b> time period, <b>so too</b> all <b>thirty</b> days <b>are</b> to be <b>continuous.</b> And <b>whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>the Rabbis,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>are the Rabbis of</b> the opinion that

Daf 10b

it is possible for a woman who gave birth to count <b>dispersed</b> days? No, as <b>the Rabbis say</b> that <b>she counts</b> the days from the birth <b>of</b> the <b>second fetus. Rather, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? And</b> therefore, <b>conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>is of</b> the opinion that the second offspring is considered as though it exists only where <b>a stringency</b> results, but where <b>a leniency</b> results, <b>he is not of</b> the opinion that the second offspring is considered to have existed.
<b>And further, Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>, which discusses the verse: “Sixty days <b>and six days”</b> (Leviticus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that she counts these six days <b>whether they are continuous or dispersed,</b> so that if, for example, she miscarried on the sixty-third day, she would complete the remaining three days of purity for the first fetus after completing the period of purification for the second. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Sixty”</b> to teach that <b>just as the sixty days are all continuous, so too, the six days are all continuous. Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>are the Rabbis</b> of the opinion that it is possible for a woman who gave birth to count <b>dispersed</b> days? <b>Didn’t the Rabbis say</b> that <b>she counts for</b> the <b>second offspring?</b>
<b>Rather, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? And</b> therefore, may one <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda is of</b> the opinion that the second offspring is considered extant only where <b>a stringency</b> results; but where <b>a leniency</b> results, <b>he is not of</b> the opinion that the second offspring is considered to have existed? The Gemara rules: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is the case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> are the five situations mentioned in the mishna (9a) in which one <b>brings a sliding-scale offering: For hearing the voice</b> of an oath, i.e., where one took a false oath that he does not have any testimony to provide on a given issue; <b>and for</b> the <b>utterance of the lips,</b> which is a case where one took a false oath about a different matter; <b>and for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple,</b> by entering it while ritually impure, <b>or</b> defiling <b>its sacrificial</b> foods, by partaking of them while ritually impure; <b>and a woman after childbirth; and a leper</b> at the end of his purification process.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the nature of a sliding-scale offering, which varies depending on the owner’s financial status: <b>There is</b> a case in which <b>one brings</b> the offering in one of two possible states, either a bird offering if the individual is in a state <b>of poverty or</b> an animal offering if he is in a state of <b>wealth; and there is</b> a case in which <b>one brings</b> the offering in one of three possible states, of wealth, <b>of poverty,</b> or <b>of extreme poverty.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>A woman after childbirth brings</b> a sliding-scale offering either <b>in poverty,</b> i.e., two doves or two pigeons, one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering, <b>or</b> in <b>wealth,</b> i.e., a lamb as a burnt offering and a dove or a pigeon as a sin offering (see Leviticus 12:1–8). <b>A leper brings</b> the offering either <b>in poverty</b> in the form of a lamb for a guilt offering, and two doves or two pigeons, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, or in wealth in the form of a lamb for a guilt offering, a lamb as a burnt offering, and a female lamb as a sin offering (see Leviticus 14:10–22). For <b>the hearing of the voice,</b> i.e., taking a false oath that one cannot provide testimony, <b>or the utterance of the lips,</b> or the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, one <b>brings</b> an offering either in wealth, i.e., a female lamb or goat as a sin offering, <b>or in poverty,</b> i.e., two doves or two pigeons, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, <b>or in extreme poverty,</b> i.e., a meal offering.
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: When offerings are brought in poverty rather than wealth, <b>there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings one</b> offering <b>instead of</b> a different <b>one; there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings two</b> offerings <b>instead of two</b> other offerings; <b>there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings two</b> offerings <b>instead of one</b> offering; and <b>there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings one</b> offering <b>instead of two</b> offerings. <b>From here you may derive</b> that the offering <b>of one-tenth of an ephah</b> may be worth as little <b>as one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>A woman after childbirth brings one</b> offering <b>instead of one</b> offering: <b>One young bird,</b> as a sin offering that she would bring even in wealth, <b>and</b> another <b>bird</b> as a burnt offering <b>instead of</b> the <b>lamb. A leper</b> brings <b>two young birds instead of two lambs.</b> For <b>the hearing of the voice and the utterance of the lips and the defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, one <b>brings two young birds instead of one female lamb, and in</b> a case <b>of extreme poverty</b> one <b>brings one</b> meal offering of <b>one-tenth of an ephah instead of two young birds.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: From here you may derive</b> that the offering <b>of one-tenth of an ephah</b> may be worth as little <b>as one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> learn this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me to</b> bring an offering worth <b>one <i>sela</i> to the altar,</b> he <b>brings a lamb, as there is nothing that is sacrificed upon the altar</b> that is worth <b>one <i>sela</i> other than a lamb.</b>
<b>From where</b> is this <i>halakha</i> derived? It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the <b>ram</b> brought in its second year as <b>a guilt offering</b> must be “according to your valuation in <b>silver</b> by <b>shekels”</b> (Leviticus 5:15), i.e., it must be worth two <i>sela</i>. It may therefore be understood <b>by inference that a lamb,</b> i.e., a young ram, <b>in its</b> first <b>year is</b> worth <b>one <i>sela</i>.</b> And it is known that a lamb is brought when it is within its first year, <b>as it is written: “A lamb of the first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (8a): The price of <b>nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds brought by an impoverished person instead of a lamb, <b>stood that day at one-quarter</b> of a silver dinar. A quarter-dinar is one-sixteenth of a <i>sela</i>, the price of a lamb.
<b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One has mercy upon</b> one who brings an offering <b>in poverty,</b> in that He permits him to bring an offering <b>that is</b> worth <b>one-sixteenth</b> of the value of the lamb that is brought <b>in wealth,</b> it may be inferred that <b>the Merciful One takes pity upon</b> one who brings an offering <b>in extreme poverty,</b> and consequently He permits him to bring an offering <b>which is</b> worth <b>one-sixteenth</b> of the value of the offering brought <b>in</b> moderate <b>poverty.</b> Accordingly, the offering brought in extreme poverty may be equal to a two hundred fifty-sixth part of the value of a <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara examines the mathematics necessary to determine that the value of the offering brought in extreme poverty is equal to one <i>peruta</i>: <b>If so, how much is</b> the offering brought in <b>poverty</b> worth? It is worth <b>one-quarter</b> of a dinar. <b>And how many <i>perutot</i></b> are <b>in one-quarter</b> of a dinar? <b>Forty-eight <i>perutot</i>.</b> Accordingly, <b>how many</b> <i>perutot</i> <b>are</b> in the offering brought in extreme poverty, which is worth <b>one-sixteenth of</b> the offering brought in <b>poverty? Three <i>perutot</i>.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: From here you may derive</b> that the offering <b>of one-tenth of an ephah</b> may be worth as little <b>as one <i>peruta</i>, why</b> did the <i>baraita</i> teach that it may be worth <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> rather than three <i>perutot</i>? <b>Didn’t you say</b> that <b>one-tenth of an ephah is</b> brought in <b>extreme poverty, and you</b> also <b>said</b> that this offering should be worth <b>one-sixteenth of</b> the offering brought in <b>poverty, which we calculated to be three <i>perutot</i>?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> derives</b> the cost of an offering brought in poverty <b>from</b> the case of <b>a woman after childbirth, who brings one bird instead of a lamb, as</b> a bird <b>is</b> worth <b>one thirty-second</b> of the value <b>of a lamb.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But until now, how much</b> was the offering brought in <b>extreme poverty</b> calculated to be worth? <b>One-sixteenth</b> of the value of the offering brought <b>in poverty.</b> And <b>from where</b> is this <b>derived?</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the value of <b>the lamb and</b> the <b>ram,</b> as explained earlier. If so, <b>until now,</b> the calculations lead to the conclusion that the offering brought in extreme poverty <b>is</b> worth <b>one and one-half <i>perutot</i>,</b> as one thirty-second of the value of a lamb is equal to one-eighth of a silver dinar rather than one-quarter, which means that the offering brought in poverty is worth twenty-four <i>perutot</i>, one-sixteenth of which is equal to one and one-half <i>perutot</i>.
Rather, <b>Rava said</b> a different answer: <b>The entire matter is derived from</b> the offering brought by <b>a woman after childbirth, and this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One has mercy upon</b> one who brings an offering <b>in poverty, in</b> that he may bring an offering <b>which is</b> worth <b>one thirty-second</b> of the value of the offering brought <b>in wealth.</b> Rava adds parenthetically: <b>And</b> from <b>what</b> case <b>is this</b> principle derived? From the case of <b>a woman after childbirth. So too, the Merciful One has mercy upon</b> one who brings an offering <b>in extreme poverty, in</b> that he may bring an offering <b>that is</b> worth <b>one thirty-second</b> of the value of the offering brought in moderate <b>poverty.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> the value should <b>be one <i>peruta</i> minus one-quarter,</b> i.e., three-quarters of a <i>peruta</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>Indeed</b> that is so, <b>but</b> it is <b>not proper conduct to bring</b> an offering worth <b>less than one <i>peruta</i> before God.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What are</b> the differences <b>between</b> an espoused <b>maidservant and all those</b> others <b>with whom relations are forbidden?</b> The difference is <b>that</b> the status of the maidservant <b>is not equal to their</b> status, <b>neither with regard to punishment nor with regard to an offering, as</b> one who unwittingly engages in intercourse with <b>any of those with whom relations are forbidden</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin offering, and</b> by contrast, one who unwittingly engages in intercourse with an espoused <b>maidservant</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt offering.</b> One who unwittingly engages in intercourse with <b>any of those with whom relations are forbidden</b> brings <b>a female</b> animal, <b>and</b> one who unwittingly engages in intercourse with an espoused <b>maidservant</b> brings <b>a male</b> animal, as a sin offering is a female and a guilt offering is a male.
Furthermore, with regard to engaging in intercourse with <b>any of those with whom relations are forbidden, both the man and the woman are equal with regard to</b> liability to receive <b>lashes</b> if they were forewarned, <b>and with regard to</b> liability to bring <b>an offering</b> if they did so unwittingly. <b>And in</b> the case of one who engages in intercourse with <b>a maidservant,</b> the Torah <b>did not equate the man with the woman with regard to lashes,</b> as she alone is flogged, as will be explained, <b>and</b> the Torah <b>did not equate the woman with the man with regard to</b> bringing <b>an offering,</b> as she does not bring an offering.
<b>With regard to</b> intercourse with <b>any of those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> the Torah <b>rendered</b> the halakhic status of <b>one who engages in the initial stage</b> of intercourse [<i>hame’areh</i>] to be <b>like</b> that of one who <b>completes</b> the act, <b>and one is liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every</b> act of <b>intercourse</b> that he performs unwittingly. By contrast, in the case of relations with an espoused maidservant, one is liable only for completing the act of intercourse, and the man brings a single offering for several transgressions.
<b>This is a stringency</b> that the Torah <b>imposed with regard to the maidservant</b> relative to other individuals with whom relations are forbidden:

Daf 11a

<b>That</b> the Torah <b>established her</b> status so that <b>the</b> one who engages in intercourse with her <b>intentionally is like the</b> one who does so <b>unwittingly,</b> as both are liable to bring a guilt offering, whereas one who engages in intercourse with those with whom relations are forbidden is liable to bring a sin offering only when he does so unwittingly.
<b>Who is</b> the espoused <b>maidservant</b> in question? It is <b>any</b> woman <b>who is half-maidservant half-free woman,</b> i.e., a maidservant who belonged to two masters, one of whom liberated her, <b>as it is stated: “And she was redeemed and not redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), which means that she was partially but not completely redeemed. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> An espoused maidservant is a full-fledged <b>maidservant</b> whose status is <b>certain,</b> as the language of the verse does not mean redeemed and not redeemed; it is simply a way of stating that she was not redeemed. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: All those with whom relations are forbidden</b> are <b>enumerated</b> in the Torah, <b>and we have no exception other than one who is half-maidservant half-free woman.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in the case of an espoused maidservant the Torah did not equate the man with the woman. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that she is flogged and</b> that <b>he is not flogged? As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man lies carnally with a woman, and she is a maidservant designated for a <b>man…there shall be an inspection [<i>bikkoret tihye</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). This <b>teaches that she is flogged.</b> And as one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both are flogged, the verse states: “There shall be [<i>tihye</i>],”</b> in the feminine, to teach that <b>she is flogged and he is not flogged.</b>
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that this</b> word <b>inspection [<i>bikkoret</i>] is a term for flogging? Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> It indicates that <b>she shall be</b> subjected <b>to the reciting of [<i>bikra’ei</i>]</b> the verses, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The procedure for administering lashes is that before each lash is administered, <b>the eldest</b> or most prominent <b>of the</b> three <b>judges recites</b> the relevant verses in the Torah; the <b>second-</b>eldest one <b>counts</b> the lashes; and the <b>third says</b> to the attendant: <b>Strike him. Rav Ashi says</b> that it indicates that <b>she shall be</b> subject <b>to an assessment [<i>bikkur</i>], as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 22a): <b>One assesses</b> the number of lashes that the one sentenced to be flogged is capable of withstanding, but <b>only by</b> a number of <b>lashes fit to be</b> divided by <b>three.</b> This teaches that the assessment is an essential part of the flogging procedure.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At the time that,</b> i.e., in any case where, <b>the woman is flogged, the man brings an offering.</b> In a case where <b>the woman is not flogged, the man does not bring an offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rava said</b> that it is <b>as it is written: “And if a man lies carnally with a woman, and she is a maidservant designated for a man, and not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given her;</b> there shall be an inspection…He shall bring his guilt offering unto the Lord” (Leviticus 19:20–21).
The Gemara explains: <b>Since until here, the verse is dealing with a man, let it</b> first <b>write: “He shall bring his guilt offering unto the Lord,” and at the end let it write: “There shall be an inspection.” Why did the Merciful One first write: “There shall be an inspection,” and at the end write: “He shall bring his guilt offering unto the Lord”?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: If there will be an inspection,</b> meaning that the woman is to be flogged, then <b>“he shall bring his guilt offering unto the Lord.” But if there will not be an inspection,</b> then <b>he shall not bring his guilt offering.</b>
The Gemara objects: You can <b>say</b> that <b>the verse</b> in fact <b>excludes him</b> from being flogged due to the use of the term “there shall be,” thereby limiting his liability to bring a guilt offering; <b>but</b> even so, <b>she</b> should be <b>flogged and</b> also <b>bring an offering.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>“He shall bring his guilt offering unto the Lord,” is written</b> in the verse, instead of merely: He shall bring a guilt offering. This teaches that only he, and not she, brings a guilt offering.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Actually, he is liable only</b> in a case where he engages in intercourse with <b>a non-virgin maidservant, as it is stated: “And she is a maidservant designated [<i>neḥerefet</i>] for a man.” And from where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“designated [<i>neḥerefet</i>],” is a term of change,</b> i.e., that she has already changed from her status as a virgin to that of a non-virgin? Rabbi Yitzḥak explains: <b>As it is written: “And strewed groats [<i>harifot</i>] thereon”</b> (II Samuel 17:19). Since groats are grains that have been crushed or otherwise changed from their original form, the linguistic correlation between <i>harifot</i> and <i>neḥerefet</i> indicates that both terms are referring to some form of change. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that it is inferred from the verse: <b>“Though you should bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats [<i>harifot</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 27:22).
It is stated in another verse: “And among the sons of the priests there were found some that had married foreign women, namely: Of the sons of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. <b>And they gave their hand that they would divorce their wives; and being guilty, a ram of the flock for their guilt”</b> (Ezra 10:18–19). <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This <b>teaches that they had all engaged in intercourse with espoused maidservants,</b> as guilt offerings are brought for engaging in intercourse only with an espoused maidservant.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Which is</b> the espoused <b>maidservant?</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, it is any woman who is half-maidservant and half-free woman, whereas Rabbi Yishmael maintains that it is referring to a full-fledged maidservant. In relation to this dispute, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the verse: <b>“And she was redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 19:20): One <b>might</b> have thought that this means she was <b>entirely</b> redeemed. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And she was redeemed <b>and not redeemed,”</b> to teach that she was not entirely redeemed. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought that she <b>was not redeemed</b> at all. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And she was redeemed,”</b> to teach that it is discussing a maidservant who was partially redeemed.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>How so?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: The verse is referring to a maidservant who was both <b>redeemed and not redeemed,</b> as <b>half of her is a maidservant</b> owned by one master who did not redeem her, <b>and half of her is a free woman,</b> as the partner who previously owned the other half of her has freed her, <b>and she is betrothed to a Hebrew slave.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that <b>the verse is speaking of a Canaanite maidservant</b> who was not redeemed at all <b>and</b> who <b>is engaged to a Hebrew slave. If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “And she was redeemed and not redeemed”?</b> The repetition is not halakhically significant; it is there because <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> and the phrase simply means: And she was not at all redeemed.
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: All those with whom relations are forbidden are enumerated for us</b> explicitly in the Torah. The only case which is <b>excluded for us</b> from that generalization <b>is a half-maidservant half-free woman who is betrothed to a Hebrew slave. And <i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> that when it states: <b>“They shall not be put to death because she was not free,” the verse is speaking about a Canaanite maidservant who is betrothed to a Canaanite slave.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>According to Rabbi Yishmael, granted</b> that the phrase <b>“and she was redeemed and not redeemed”</b> is referring simply to a Canaanite maidservant, <b>as it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Torah spoke in the language of people. But from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> which <b>is taught,</b> i.e., that <b>she is betrothed</b> specifically <b>to a Hebrew slave?</b> The Gemara explains that it is <b>as it is written:</b> “They shall not be put to death, <b>because she was not free”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). <b>By inference,</b> it may be concluded <b>that he,</b> the man to whom she is betrothed, <b>is free.</b> A Hebrew slave is not the property of his owner, but is merely obligated to serve him for a period of time.
The Gemara raises an objection: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> Why was it stated separately in the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara explains: It is because Rabbi Elazar <b>is saying to Rabbi Yishmael: According to me, in general I hold in accordance with your</b> opinion, <b>that the Torah spoke in the language of people. But here it is different, since it is</b> also <b>written in the verse: “Because she was not free.”</b> If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“and she is redeemed and not redeemed”? Conclude from it that it comes for this</b> purpose, <b>to</b> teach that the verse is referring to a woman who is <b>half-maidservant half-free woman.</b>
The Gemara further objects: <b>According to <i>Aḥerim</i>, granted</b> that the phrase <b>“and she was redeemed and not redeemed”</b> is referring to a Canaanite maidservant, <b>as they</b> too <b>maintain</b> that <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people. But from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> she is betrothed to <b>a Canaanite slave?</b> The Gemara explains that the <b>verse states: “Because she was not free,”</b> and <b>if it is not needed</b> for the <b>matter of her</b> status as a maidservant, as it is already established that she is not free, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of his</b> status as a slave.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna cites an additional difference between the status of an espoused maidservant and the status of forbidden relatives. In <b>all</b> cases of intercourse with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> if <b>one is an adult and one is a minor,</b> the <b>minor is exempt;</b> if <b>one is awake and one is sleeping,</b> the <b>sleeping</b> one is <b>exempt;</b> if <b>one</b> commits the act <b>unwittingly and one</b> does so <b>intentionally,</b> the one who did so <b>unwittingly</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin offering and</b> the one who did so <b>intentionally</b> is liable to be punished <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b> By contrast, in a case of intercourse with an espoused maidservant, the man is liable to bring a guilt offering only if the woman is flogged, and that is the case only if she was an adult, awake, and committed the sin intentionally.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in all instances of intercourse with those with whom relations are forbidden, a minor is exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is that to say that <b>here,</b> in the case of an espoused maidservant, <b>a minor is liable?</b> But a minor is exempt from all liabilities in the Torah. <b>Rav Yehuda said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> In <b>all</b> cases of intercourse with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> if <b>one is an adult and one is a minor, the minor is exempt and the adult is liable. But here,</b> in the case of an espoused maidservant, <b>the adult is also exempt. What is the reason?</b> Their punishments are linked, <b>as they are juxtaposed to each other</b> in the verse: “There shall be an inspection…and he shall bring his guilt offering unto the Lord” (Leviticus 19:20–21).
The mishna teaches: In <b>all</b> cases of intercourse with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> if <b>one is awake and one is sleeping,</b> the one who is sleeping is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is that to say that <b>here</b> the one who is <b>sleeping is liable? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> In <b>all</b> cases of intercourse with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> if <b>one is awake and one is sleeping,</b> the one who is <b>sleeping is exempt and</b> the one who is <b>awake is liable. But here, even the one</b> who is <b>awake is exempt. What is the reason?</b> Their punishments are linked, <b>as they are juxtaposed to each other</b> in the verse: “There shall be an inspection…and he shall bring his guilt offering unto the Lord” (Leviticus 19:20–21).
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet:</b> The Sages <b>rendered one who completes</b> the act of intercourse <b>like one who engages in the initial stage</b> of intercourse; <b>one who</b> commits the act <b>intentionally like one who</b> does so <b>unintentionally;</b> one who engages in intercourse in <b>a typical</b> manner <b>like</b> one who engages in intercourse in <b>an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse; and <b>one who is awake like one who is sleeping.</b>
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: What are you saying? If</b> you <b>are teaching</b> this with regard to <b>an espoused maidservant, why</b> would you say that <b>they rendered one who completes</b> the act <b>like one who engages in the initial stage</b> of intercourse? This is not the case, as <b>one who completes</b> the act <b>with an espoused maidservant is liable,</b> but <b>one who engages in the initial stage</b> of intercourse <b>is not liable. And furthermore,</b> they did not make <b>one who</b> commits the act <b>intentionally like one who</b> does so <b>unintentionally: If she intended it,</b> she <b>is liable</b> to receive lashes; <b>if</b> she did <b>not</b> intend it, she <b>is not liable.</b>
<b>And</b> they <b>also</b> did not render engaging in intercourse <b>in a typical</b> manner <b>like</b> doing so <b>in an atypical manner:</b> One who engages in intercourse <b>in a typical</b> manner <b>with an espoused maidservant is liable, and</b> one who does so <b>in an atypical manner is not liable. What is the reason? It is written: “Lies carnally [<i>shikhvat zera</i>],”</b> and the literal meaning of this term is referring to intercourse that can lead to procreation, as <i>zera</i> means seed. <b>And</b> finally, in <b>what</b> way can it be said that they rendered <b>one who is awake like one who is sleeping?</b> One who is sleeping is always exempt, as the circumstances are beyond his control. Consequently, it seems that the <i>baraita</i> cannot be referring to intercourse with an espoused maidservant.
<b>And if</b> you <b>teach</b> this <i>baraita</i> in relation to intercourse <b>with all those others with whom relations are forbidden,</b> how is it that <b>they rendered one who completes</b> the act <b>like one who engages in the initial stage</b> of intercourse?

Daf 11b

<b>It should teach the opposite,</b> i.e., it should say: They made one who engages in the initial stage of intercourse like one who completes the act, as it is obvious that one who completes the act is liable.
The <i>tanna</i> <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>Should I remove</b> this <i>baraita</i>, as it is apparently corrupted? Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: No;</b> do not remove the <i>baraita</i>, as <b>this</b> is what it <b>is teaching:</b> The Sages <b>rendered one who completes an atypical</b> act of intercourse <b>with an espoused maidservant, for which</b> he <b>is not liable, like one who engages in the initial stage</b> of intercourse with her <b>in the typical manner,</b> for which he is also exempt. They derived this from the fact <b>that it is written: “Lies carnally.”</b>
Similarly, they rendered <b>one who</b> engages <b>intentionally</b> in <b>atypical</b> intercourse <b>with a maidservant,</b> for <b>which they are</b> both <b>exempt, like one who does</b> so in a typical manner <b>unintentionally, as it is written: “Lies carnally.”</b> And they also rendered <b>one who</b> engages in intercourse <b>in an atypical manner with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant</b> while he <b>is awake,</b> for <b>which they are</b> both <b>exempt, like one who</b> does so while <b>sleeping. What is the reason?</b> They derived this from the fact <b>that it is written: “Lies carnally.”</b>
The Gemara concludes: It <b>has been determined</b> that <b>one who</b> engages in intercourse <b>intentionally or engages</b> in the <b>initial stage of intercourse with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant is like one who</b> does so <b>unintentionally with all those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> meaning that he is exempt. Similarly, <b>one who</b> engages in intercourse with an espoused maidservant <b>in a typical manner</b> while <b>sleeping is like one who</b> does so, while <b>sleeping, with</b> all <b>those</b> others <b>with whom relations are forbidden,</b> and he is likewise exempt. Furthermore, it has also been <b>determined</b> that <b>one who</b> engages in <b>atypical</b> intercourse <b>with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant</b> while <b>awake is like one who</b> does so <b>with all those with whom relations are forbidden, while sleeping,</b> and he is also exempt.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If witnesses <b>said to</b> a person: We saw that <b>you ate</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> he is liable to <b>bring a sin offering</b> if he did so unwittingly. If <b>a witness says: He ate</b> forbidden fat, <b>and a witness says: He did not eat</b> forbidden fat, or if <b>a woman says: He ate</b> forbidden fat, <b>and a woman says: He did not eat</b> forbidden fat, he is liable to <b>bring a provisional guilt offering,</b> brought by one who is uncertain as to whether he committed a sin that requires a sin offering. If <b>a witness says: He ate</b> forbidden fat, <b>and</b> the person himself <b>says: I did not eat</b> forbidden fat, he is <b>exempt.</b>
If <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say: He ate</b> forbidden fat, <b>and</b> the person himself <b>says: I did not eat</b> forbidden fat, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> This conclusion can be derived <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>If two</b> witnesses could have <b>brought him</b> liability <b>to</b> receive the <b>severe</b> punishment of <b>death,</b> can <b>they not bring him</b> liability <b>to</b> sacrifice <b>an offering, which is</b> relatively <b>lenient?</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Witnesses are unable to render another person liable to bring an offering contrary to his statement, as <b>what if he wishes to say: I did</b> so <b>intentionally,</b> in which case he would be <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering?
If one unwittingly <b>ate</b> an olive-bulk of forbidden <b>fat and</b> then ate another olive-bulk of forbidden <b>fat during one lapse of awareness,</b> i.e., in a case where he did not discover in the interim that fat is forbidden, or that the food he is eating is forbidden fat, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering. If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat, and blood, and <i>piggul</i>, and <i>notar</i> in one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of them. <b>This is a stringency</b> that applies <b>to</b> one who eats <b>several types</b> of forbidden food and does not apply to one who eats <b>one type</b> of forbidden food.
<b>And a stringency</b> that applies <b>to</b> one who eats <b>one type</b> of forbidden food and not to one who eats <b>several types</b> of forbidden food is <b>that if one ate half an olive-bulk and then ate another half an olive-bulk during one lapse of awareness,</b> in a case where they were both <b>from one type</b> of forbidden food, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. If they were <b>from two types,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because he did not eat an olive-bulk of any specific forbidden food.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna <b>teaches:</b> If witnesses <b>said to him: You ate</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> he is liable to <b>bring a sin offering.</b> The Gemara analyzes the first clause of the mishna: Since the mishna employs the plural form of the word <b>said, how many</b> witnesses <b>are</b> involved in the case? There must be at least <b>two</b> witnesses. <b>And what does he say to them</b> in response? <b>If we say that he is silent and does not contradict them,</b> then it may be inferred that it is <b>only</b> when he responds with <b>silence</b> in response to the claim <b>of two</b> witnesses <b>that he brings a sin offering,</b> but <b>for silence</b> in response to the claim <b>of one</b> witness, he does <b>not</b> bring a sin offering.
But <b>say the middle clause:</b> If <b>a witness says</b> that <b>he ate</b> forbidden fat, <b>and</b> the person himself <b>says: I did not eat</b> it, he is exempt. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that he is exempt is <b>that he contradicts him. But</b> if he is <b>silent, he is liable, and all the more so</b> if he is silent when <b>two</b> witnesses claim that he ate forbidden fat. This contradicts the inference from the first clause that silence in response to one witness does not render one liable to bring a sin offering.
<b>Rather,</b> the first clause is referring to a case <b>where he contradicts</b> the claim of the two witnesses. <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? It <b>is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> in the continuation of the mishna that the person’s <b>contradiction</b> of the testimony <b>of two</b> witnesses <b>is not</b> considered <b>a contradiction,</b> and he is liable to bring a sin offering. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to this answer, <b>what</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach us</b> in the first clause? <b>From the latter clause you</b> already <b>learn</b> that according to Rabbi Meir, one is liable to bring a sin offering as a result of the testimony of two witnesses, even if he contradicts them. The Gemara answers: The latter clause is clarifying the first clause, and <b>this</b> is what it <b>teaches us: This matter</b> that was stated in the first clause is actually the subject of <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, and that</b> dispute pertains to a case <b>where he contradicts their</b> testimony.
<b>Some say</b> a different explanation of the first clause: The case is where only one witness asserts that the individual ate forbidden fat, and occasionally the plural verb form in the expression: Witnesses <b>said to him,</b> can <b>also</b> be used to <b>refer</b> to <b>one</b> witness. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 87b): With regard to <b>a woman whose husband went overseas, and</b> witnesses <b>came and said to her: Your husband died, and she married</b> another man on the basis of this testimony, <b>and afterward her husband came</b> back, <b>she must leave</b> both <b>this</b> man, her first husband, <b>and that</b> one, whom she married subsequently. This mishna indicates that the plural expression can be used in the case of a single witness, <b>as we maintain that</b> this mishna is referring <b>even</b> to a case <b>where one</b> witness testified that her husband died.
<b>From where</b> is this inferred? It is inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches:</b> If <b>she married without consent</b> and then her first husband returned, <b>she is permitted to return to him. What</b> does the mishna mean when it states that she remarried <b>without consent?</b> It means she remarried <b>without the consent of the court,</b> which would be granted based on the testimony of <b>one witness.</b> Rather, two witnesses testified that her husband had died. Since that is full-fledged halakhic testimony, she is permitted to remarry independently, even without the explicit consent of the court.
<b>By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that the first clause</b> is referring to a case where she married <b>with the consent of the court and</b> on the basis of the testimony <b>of one witness. Evidently,</b> that mishna <b>teaches</b> the plural form of the word: <b>Said,</b> when it is referring <b>to one witness, and here, too,</b> in this mishna <b>where it teaches</b> the phrase: Witnesses <b>said to him,</b> it <b>indicates</b> that <b>even one witness</b> renders one liable to bring a sin offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does he say</b> in response to the witness? <b>If we say that he contradicts</b> the witness, <b>does he bring</b> an offering? <b>But doesn’t the middle clause teach:</b> If <b>a witness says: He ate</b> forbidden fat, <b>and</b> the person himself <b>says: I did not eat</b> forbidden fat, he is <b>exempt?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> if it is referring to a case <b>where he is silent,</b> the clause is unnecessary, as one can <b>learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from the middle clause,</b> which states: If <b>a witness says:</b> He ate forbidden fat, and the person himself says: I did not eat forbidden fat, he is exempt from bringing a sin offering. This indicates that <b>the reason</b> he is exempt is <b>that he contradicts</b> the witness, <b>but</b> if <b>he was silent,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering.
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>Actually,</b> the first clause of the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he does not contradict</b> the witness but remains silent. <b>And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> If <b>they,</b> i.e., even one witness, <b>said to him: You ate</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> he is liable to <b>bring a sin offering.</b> The middle clause then clarifies: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>where he was silent</b> in response to this accusation, <b>but if he contradicts</b> the witness, he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that by Torah law that</b> if <b>he does not contradict</b> the witness, <b>he is liable</b> to bring a sin offering? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that deals with a sin offering: <b>“Or if his sin is known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), that this is referring to a case where he found out himself <b>but not</b> a case <b>where others informed him</b> of his sin. One <b>might</b> have thought he is exempt <b>even</b> if <b>he does not contradict</b> the claim of the witness. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Or if</b> his sin <b>is known to him,”</b> which teaches that <b>in any case</b> where he knows that he sinned, even if others informed him of it, he is liable. He is exempt only if he denies it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with,</b> in the case where he is informed by others? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to two</b> witnesses who inform him, in a case where <b>two</b> witnesses testify <b>and he does not contradict them</b> does one <b>need a verse</b> to render him liable?

Daf 12a

<b>Rather, isn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> referring to a case <b>of one</b> witness, <b>and it teaches</b> that <b>when he does not contradict</b> the testimony of the witness, the witness <b>is deemed credible? Learn from</b> it that one witness can render a person liable to bring a sin offering if the person does not contradict the testimony.
§ The mishna teaches that if two witnesses say that someone ate forbidden fat, and he denies it, Rabbi Meir deems him liable to bring a sin offering. <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> This conclusion can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>:</b> If two witnesses could have brought him liability to receive the severe punishment of death, can they not bring him liability to sacrifice an offering, which is relatively lenient? The Rabbis said to him: Witnesses are unable to render another person liable to bring an offering contrary to his statement, as what if he wishes to say: I did so intentionally, in which case he would be exempt from bringing an offering?
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who deem him exempt from bringing an offering? Is it <b>because</b> they hold <b>that a person is deemed credible about himself more than</b> the testimony of <b>one hundred people? Or perhaps</b> it is <b>because we say</b> that <b>since</b> he could advance a more advantageous claim <b>[<i>miggo</i>],</b> in <b>that if he wishes,</b> he could <b>say: I did</b> so <b>intentionally,</b> in which case he would be <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering, therefore, <b>also when he says: I did not eat, he is deemed credible and is exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> between the two possibilities? The Gemara answers: The difference is whether it is possible <b>to resolve from it</b> the case <b>of ritual impurity,</b> when witnesses testify that one became ritually impure before entering the Temple, and he claims that he did not become impure. <b>If you say</b> that <b>the Rabbis’ reasoning is that a person is deemed credible about himself more than</b> the testimony of <b>one hundred people,</b> then it <b>is no different</b> if it is a case of <b>new impurity,</b> where they testify that he became impure the day he entered the Temple, <b>and</b> it <b>is no different</b> if it is a case of <b>old impurity,</b> where they testify that he became impure at some earlier date. In either case, the person’s claim that he was not impure when he entered the Temple would be deemed credible.
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>the reasoning of the Rabbis is that</b> he can <b>say <i>miggo</i>,</b> then <b>the Rabbis</b> would <b>deem him exempt from</b> the obligation to bring a sliding-scale offering in a case of <b>old impurity, but</b> in a case <b>of new impurity</b> he <b>would be obligated</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>What is the reason?</b> With regard to <b>old impurity, since if he wishes, he could say: I immersed</b> in a ritual bath after becoming impure and at sunset I became ritually pure, in which case he would be <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for having entered the Temple the following day, then <b>also when he says: I did not become impure,</b> he is <b>exempt, as it can be said: What</b> does he mean <b>when he says: I did not become impure?</b> He means: <b>I did not remain in my</b> state of <b>impurity,</b> but <b>rather I immersed</b> in a ritual bath.
<b>But</b> in a case of <b>new impurity,</b> he <b>would be obligated</b> to bring an offering. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because even when he says: I immersed</b> in a ritual bath, he <b>would be obligated</b> to bring an offering if he entered the Temple, <b>as the witnesses would say to him: You became impure</b> just <b>now,</b> and you could not have purified yourself in the meantime.
<b>What,</b> then, is the reasoning of the Rabbis? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one witness said to</b> a person: <b>You became impure, and he says: I did not become impure,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering. One <b>might</b> have thought this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> where <b>two</b> witnesses said this. <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> This conclusion can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If two</b> witnesses could have <b>brought him</b> liability <b>to</b> receive the <b>severe</b> punishment of <b>death,</b> can <b>they not bring him</b> liability <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering, which is</b> relatively <b>lenient? And the Rabbis say: A person is deemed credible about himself more than</b> the testimony of <b>one hundred people.</b> The Gemara explains its suggestion: <b>Learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>the reasoning of the Rabbis is that they say</b> that <b>a person is deemed credible about himself more than</b> the testimony of <b>one hundred people.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ami said: Actually, the Rabbis’ reasoning</b> is <b>that we say <i>miggo</i>, and this</b> is what it <b>is teaching: Since if he wished to say: I did not remain in my</b> state of <b>impurity</b> but rather I immersed, then he would be <b>exempt, therefore a person is deemed credible about himself more than</b> the testimony of <b>one hundred people.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this</b> case <b>is</b> identical to that of eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> which the mishna already discussed.
The Gemara explains that the <i>baraita</i> mentions the case of ritual impurity <b>lest you say</b> the following: When he says: <b>I</b> did not <b>eat</b> forbidden <b>fat, he may explain his statement</b> to mean: <b>I did not eat</b> forbidden fat <b>unwittingly but intentionally,</b> and I am therefore not obligated to bring an offering. <b>But</b> if two witnesses say: <b>You have become impure, and he says: I have not become impure,</b> one might <b>say</b> that he <b>cannot explain his statement</b> in a manner that would exempt him, as it makes no difference whether he became impure unwittingly or intentionally. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>here too,</b> he can explain his statement in a different manner: <b>I did not remain in my</b> state of <b>impurity, but</b> rather <b>I immersed,</b> and he is therefore not obligated to bring an offering.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an explanation of the opinion of the Rabbis from another <i>baraita</i>, which discusses the case of the defiling of the Temple, by entering it while ritually impure, or its sacrificial foods, by partaking of them while ritually impure one who enters the Temple or eats sacred foods in a state of ritual impurity: The Torah states: “And it shall be, when he shall be guilty of one of these things, <b>that he shall confess</b>…and he shall bring…for a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:5–6). This verse indicates that only one who <b>confesses verbally</b> to sinning is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering, whereas one who does <b>not confess verbally</b> is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering. If <b>one witness said to him: You have become impure, and he says: I have not become impure,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering.
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>even</b> in a case where <b>two</b> witnesses <b>contradict</b> him, he is exempt from bringing an offering. <b>Rabbi Meir said: If two</b> witnesses could have <b>brought him</b> liability <b>to</b> receive the <b>severe</b> punishment of <b>death,</b> can <b>they not bring him</b> liability <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering, which is</b> relatively <b>lenient? Rabbi Yehuda says: A person is deemed credible about himself more than</b> the testimony of <b>one hundred people.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> whose opinion is cited in the mishna, <b>concede to Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</b> denying the accusation of two witnesses that he ate forbidden <b>fats, or with regard to entering the Temple</b> in a state of impurity, that if the person says that he did not eat the fats or enter the Temple, he is deemed credible. <b>But with regard to ritual impurity,</b> where witnesses say that he entered the Temple or ate sanctified food while impure and he says that he entered the Temple or ate the sanctified food but he was not impure, <b>they do not concede to him;</b> rather, they accept the opinion of Rabbi Meir that the testimony of two witnesses renders him obligated to bring an offering despite the fact that he denies that he transgressed.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> type of impurity <b>are we dealing with? If we say</b>

Daf 12b

that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>old impurity,</b> where the witnesses said to him: You became impure yesterday, <b>what is different</b> about the cases of eating forbidden <b>fat and entering the Temple</b> while impure, <b>where</b> the Rabbis <b>concede to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that one is not liable to bring a sin offering even though his denial is contradicted by two witnesses? He is exempt <b>since if he wished, he could say: I</b> did so <b>intentionally.</b> Therefore, his denial can be interpreted to mean: My eating the forbidden fat or entering the Temple was not unwitting but intentional. If so, if he denies that he is in a state of <b>old impurity,</b> he can <b>also explain his statement, since if he wished, he could say</b> that he meant: <b>I did not remain in my</b> state of <b>ritual impurity, but</b> rather <b>I immersed</b> in a ritual bath.
<b>Ravina said: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>old impurity,</b> and nevertheless the Rabbis distinguish between one’s denial that he is impure and one’s denial that he ate or entered the Temple. The case is one <b>where the witnesses say to him: You ate sacrificial</b> meat while <b>in</b> a state of <b>physical impurity, and he says to them: I did not become impure.</b> The reason he is liable to bring an offering is <b>that here he cannot explain his statement, as one cannot say</b> that the phrase: I did not become impure, can be explained to mean: <b>I did not remain in</b> a state <b>of impurity but</b> rather <b>I immersed.</b>
Ravina elaborates: <b>What</b> would he <b>say to them</b> to explain his statement that he did not become impure? If he says: <b>I immersed and I ate,</b> then <b>when he says this to them, his initial statement has been contradicted in any event with regard to his impurity</b> imparted by <b>contact.</b> His initial claim that he did not become impure has not been adjusted with regard to this matter, and that claim was contradicted by the two witnesses.
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that even if two witnesses testify that a person became impure, and he claims that he did not become impure, he is deemed credible about himself more than the testimony of one hundred people. <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said</b> that he is deemed credible when he states that he is pure against the testimony of witnesses <b>only when</b> the person is <b>by himself and</b> only <b>with regard to himself,</b> but as far as others are concerned, he is regarded as impure.
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> Although according to Rabbi Meir one is liable to bring an offering based on the testimony of two witnesses that he ate forbidden fat even if he denied it, <b>Rabbi Meir concedes to the Rabbis that if two</b> witnesses <b>said to him: You engaged in sexual intercourse with an espoused maidservant, and he says: I did not engage in sexual intercourse, he is deemed credible, since if he wishes,</b> he can <b>say to them: I did not complete my</b> act of <b>intercourse,</b> in which case, as stated earlier (10b), he is not liable to bring a guilt offering.
Likewise, <b>Rav Sheshet says: Rabbi Meir concedes to the Rabbis in</b> the case of <b>an impure nazirite,</b> i.e., one <b>to whom two</b> witnesses <b>said: You became impure</b> and are therefore liable to bring a sin offering, <b>and he says: I did not become impure,</b> that he is <b>exempt, since if he wishes, he can say: I requested</b> from a halakhic authority to dissolve <b>my nazirite vow,</b> and he dissolved it. Therefore, it was permitted for me to become impure. Nazirites are prohibited from becoming impure with the impurity imparted by a corpse, whereas non-nazirites may come into contact with a corpse.
Likewise, <b>Abaye says: Rabbi Meir concedes to the Rabbis that if two</b> witnesses <b>said to</b> a person: <b>You know testimony about so-and-so, and he says: I do not know,</b> and he takes an oath to this effect, he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for taking a false oath of testimony. The reason is <b>that if he wishes,</b> he can <b>say:</b> I did witness the event, but <b>I had not intended to</b> offer <b>testimony,</b> in which case he is exempt from bringing an offering for taking a false oath of testimony.
§ The mishna teaches that if one unwittingly <b>ate</b> an olive-bulk of forbidden <b>fat and</b> then ate another olive-bulk of forbidden <b>fat during one lapse of awareness,</b> he is liable to bring only one sin offering. <b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this: Why is he liable</b> to bring <b>only one sin offering? But didn’t he eat two olive-bulks of</b> forbidden <b>fat?</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: One is liable to bring two sin offerings only when he ate the olive-bulks of forbidden fat during <b>separate lapses of awareness,</b> e.g., he ate forbidden fat when he was unaware that it was prohibited, and subsequently became aware of the prohibition and then forgot about it and ate another olive-bulk of forbidden fat. This is derived from the verse: “If his sin, which he has sinned, is known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned” (Leviticus 4:28). <b>But here there is</b> only <b>one lapse of awareness.</b>
The Gemara cites a different version of the discussion between Rabbi Zeira and Abaye. <b>There are</b> those <b>who</b> claim that Rabbi Zeira <b>raised</b> his <b>difficulty</b> to Abaye <b>in this</b> manner: <b>The reason that</b> one is liable to bring only one sin offering for his two transgressions of eating forbidden fat is <b>that</b> both acts took place during <b>one lapse of awareness; but</b> if he ate forbidden fat <b>in two lapses of awareness,</b> he is liable to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. But <b>why? It</b> is <b>one category</b> of prohibition of forbidden <b>fat</b> that he has violated, and therefore he should bring only one sin offering. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: With regard to bringing sin offerings, <b>separate lapses</b> of awareness render him liable to bring multiple offerings.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one ate</b> forbidden <b>fat, and blood, and <i>piggul</i>, and <i>notar</i></b> in one lapse of awareness, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering for each and every one of them. In a case where one ate half an olive-bulk and then ate another half olive-bulk during one lapse of awareness, if the two half olive-bulks were both from one type of forbidden food, he is liable to bring a sin offering. If they were from two types, he is exempt.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: The ruling that if one ate two halves of an olive-bulk <b>of one type</b> of food he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering is <b>obvious,</b> as he ate an olive-bulk of a forbidden food. <b>Reish Lakish said in the name of bar Tutini:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where he ate</b> them from <b>two dishes, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, who says</b> that eating food from distinct <b>dishes differentiates</b> his acts of consumption and renders them separate transgressions.
This ruling was necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that separate dishes render his acts separate transgressions, it <b>is no different</b> if this principle results in <b>a leniency and</b> it <b>is no different</b> if it results in <b>a stringency.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> if he ate two half olive-bulks from two dishes, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>says</b> that eating food from separate dishes renders his acts of consumption separate transgressions only when this principle produces <b>a stringency,</b> but he <b>did not say</b> it as <b>a leniency.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this discussion referred <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: In a case where one ate half an olive-bulk and then ate another half olive-bulk during one lapse of awareness, if they were <b>from two types</b> of food, he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious,</b> as he did not eat an entire olive-bulk of one type? <b>Reish Lakish said in the name of bar Tutini:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> he ate an olive-bulk of one type, but <b>he ate it in two dishes, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, who says</b> that eating food from separate <b>dishes differentiates</b> his acts of consumption and renders them separate transgressions.
This ruling was necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that separate dishes render his acts separate transgressions, he <b>says</b> it only when it results in <b>a stringency,</b> but <b>he does not say</b> it when it results in <b>a leniency.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that if he ate an olive-bulk <b>from two types</b> of food, he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it states the case of eating <b>from two types</b> of food? <b>It</b> is actually a case of two half olive-bulks <b>from one</b> type of food; <b>and why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>call it two types?</b> It is <b>because he ate it in two dishes,</b> half an olive-bulk in each dish, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>exempt. Evidently,</b> it <b>is no different</b> if it results in <b>a leniency and</b> it <b>is no different</b> if it results in <b>a stringency;</b> in both cases <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that separate dishes render one’s acts of consumption separate transgressions.
The Gemara objects: <b>From</b> the fact that in <b>the latter clause,</b> when the mishna refers to two types of food it actually means <b>one type</b> of food <b>but</b> the case is where one ate it from <b>two dishes,</b> one can infer that when <b>the former clause</b> states that if one ate two half olive-bulks of one type of food he is liable to bring a sin offering, it must mean that it is <b>one type</b> of food <b>and</b> one ate it from <b>one dish.</b> But if so, why is it necessary to state this <i>halakha</i>; isn’t it <b>obvious?</b>
<b>Ravina said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> he ate the two half olive-bulks but <b>he had</b> a period of <b>awareness in the interim,</b> e.g., he unwittingly ate half an olive-bulk of forbidden fat, then he became aware that he had done so, and subsequently he unwittingly ate another half an olive-bulk of forbidden fat. <b>And</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel, who says: There is no awareness for a half-measure.</b> If one unwittingly performed a half-measure of a prohibited act and then became aware of his transgression, and then again unwittingly performed another half-measure of the prohibited act, his awareness in the interim does not prevent the two acts from combining. Accordingly, in the case here, it is as though he ate a full olive-bulk during one lapse of awareness.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 105a): With regard to <b>one who writes two letters</b> on Shabbat, which is the minimum that one must write in order to be rendered liable for this prohibited labor, and he did so unwittingly <b>in two</b> separate <b>lapses of awareness, one</b> letter in <b>the morning and one</b> letter <b>in the afternoon, Rabban Gamliel deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering for writing on Shabbat, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b>
The basis of this dispute is that <b>Rabban Gamliel holds</b> that <b>there is no awareness for a half-measure.</b> Therefore, the fact that he became aware of his transgression after writing the first letter is of no significance. His awareness does not divide between the first act of writing a letter and the second act of writing a letter. <b>And the Rabbis hold: There is awareness for a half-measure.</b> Consequently, the two half-measures are considered to have been performed during separate lapses of awareness, and they do not combine to render him liable to bring a sin offering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How much</b> time <b>can one expend</b> while eating an olive-bulk <b>of</b> forbidden <b>food</b> and still be liable for violating the prohibition? The duration is calculated <b>as though he were eating toasted grain,</b> which one eats one kernel at a time. If he eats the olive-bulk of forbidden food within the amount of time it would take to eat an olive-bulk of toasted grain, he is liable. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Unless</b> the amount of time <b>he expends from beginning to end</b> is more than the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf [<i>peras</i>]</b> of bread, he is <b>liable.</b>
Likewise, one who <b>ate</b> a quarter-loaf of <b>ritually impure foods or drank</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> of <b>ritually impure liquids</b> within the amount of time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread is rendered unfit to partake of <i>teruma</i>, the portion of the produce designated for priests, until he becomes pure. Similarly, if one <b>drank a quarter</b>-<b><i>log</i> of wine and entered the Temple, and he remained</b> there for the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, he is <b>liable. Rabbi Elazar says: If he interrupted</b> his drinking of the quarter-<i>log</i> of wine <b>or if he placed any amount of water into</b> the wine, he is <b>exempt.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does <b>Rabbi Meir state</b> his opinion, that the duration of time is calculated as though one were eating toasted grain, <b>as a stringency or</b> does <b>he state</b> it <b>as a leniency?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Does he state it as a stringency, and this</b> is what he <b>is teaching:</b> The duration is calculated <b>as though he were eating toasted grain</b> a little at a time, and therefore <b>even</b> if it takes him <b>the entire day</b> to consume an olive-bulk of the forbiden food, <b>and even though from beginning to end</b> he expends <b>more than</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, <b>since</b> he consumed a full olive-bulk in one <b>extended</b> act of <b>eating, he is liable; and the Rabbis said to him that unless he expends</b> less than the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, <b>he is liable,</b> but if he expends <b>more than</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, he is <b>exempt?</b>
<b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir <b>says</b> his opinion <b>as a leniency, as this</b> is what he <b>is teaching:</b> The duration is calculated <b>as though he were eating toasted grain, which is</b> eaten continuously one kernel after another, and therefore he is liable only if <b>he did not interrupt</b> at all <b>in between</b> his bites. <b>But</b> if <b>he interrupted in between</b> them, then <b>although</b> the duration <b>from beginning to end</b> was less than the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, he is <b>exempt; and the Rabbis said to him: Since</b> the amount of time <b>from beginning to end is</b> less than the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, he is <b>liable,</b> despite the interruptions.
The Gemara suggests a resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say: Unless</b> the amount of time <b>he expends from beginning to end</b> is the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread.

Daf 13a

<b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> issued his ruling <b>as a stringency,</b> and that one is liable even if he ate the olive-bulk over a long period of time, <b>this</b> is the reason <b>that the</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that the Rabbis say: <b>Unless</b> the amount of time <b>he expends,</b> meaning: <b>Unless his expenditure</b> of time is no more than the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, he is exempt.
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> issued his ruling <b>as a leniency,</b> meaning that if one interrupts in the middle of eating he is exempt, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should</b> have stated: <b>And the Rabbis say: If he expended</b> more than the time it takes to eat a half-loaf, he is exempt, which would indicate that if he expended less than this amount of time he is liable, even if he interrupted his eating in the middle. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> issued his ruling <b>as a stringency?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is correct.
§ <b>Ravnai says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: With regard to</b> forbidden <b>fats and with regard to</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> one is liable for eating an olive-bulk even with interruptions <b>unless</b> the time <b>he expends from beginning to end</b> is more than the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis in the mishna. If he ate <b>impure foods</b> in the volume of a quarter-loaf of bread, or he ate <b>repugnant creatures or creeping</b> animals, <b>or</b> drank a quarter-<i>log</i> of impure <b>liquids,</b> he becomes impure and may not partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>even</b> if consumption extended for <b>the entire day,</b> provided that they are eaten within the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Shmuel <b>saying? Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>this</b> is what he <b>is saying: Even</b> if he eats the quarter-loaf of food over the course of <b>the entire day</b> he becomes impure, <b>but that</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>where he ate</b> each <b>olive-bulk within</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All</b> impure <b>foods combine</b> together <b>to disqualify</b> one’s <b>body</b> from eating <i>teruma</i> <b>if</b> he ate <b>a quarter-loaf</b> of the impure food. <b>What, is</b> this <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where he ate the quarter-loaf within</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread? The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he ate each olive-bulk within</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, but he ate the full quarter-loaf in longer than that amount of time.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>All</b> impure <b>foods combine to disqualify</b> one’s <b>body</b> from eating <i>teruma</i> if he ate <b>a quarter-loaf</b> of the impure food <b>within</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. <b>How so?</b> In a case where <b>he ate and then ate again, if from the beginning of the first</b> period of <b>eating until the end of the last</b> period of <b>eating there is</b> no more than the amount of time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, <b>they combine</b> together. If the time spent eating is <b>more than that, they do not combine</b> together.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The Sages <b>did not permit</b> one <b>who ate less than the</b> minimum <b>measure</b> of impure foods, i.e., a quarter-loaf, <b>to descend and to immerse</b> in a ritual bath. If <b>he descended, immersed, ascended, and</b> then ate more impure food and thereby <b>completed</b> consumption of the full measure of a quarter-loaf, this second act <b>combines</b> with his previous consumption of impure food and renders the person unfit to consume <i>teruma</i>, despite the immersion in the interim. The Sages <b>permitted a pregnant woman to eat less than the</b> minimum <b>measure due to the danger</b> of her miscarrying.
<b>All</b> impure <b>liquids combine to disqualify</b> one’s <b>body</b> from eating <i>teruma</i> if one consumes <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>within</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread.<b>How so?</b> In a case where <b>he drank and then drank again,</b> and in total he drank a quarter-<i>log</i>, <b>if from the beginning of the first</b> act of <b>drinking until the end of the last</b> act of <b>drinking there is</b> no more than the amount of time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, <b>they combine</b> together. But if the period of drinking is <b>more than that</b> amount of time, <b>they do not combine.</b>
With regard to a woman who has the status of first-degree impurity because she came into <b>contact</b> with one who was <b>impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> the Sages <b>permitted her to nurse her child, and her child</b> remains <b>pure.</b> If the child touches <i>teruma</i> he does not render it disqualified, despite having consumed milk that presumably became impure upon leaving the body of the mother. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains its objection from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> that <b>if from the beginning of the first</b> period of <b>eating until the end of the last</b> period of <b>eating there is</b> no more than the amount of time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, <b>they combine</b> together. This apparently contradicts the opinion of Ravnai, who says that if one eats a quarter-loaf of impure food in total and ate each olive-bulk within the time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread, his acts of eating combine together and he is disqualified from consuming <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Ravnai</b> is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
§ The Gemara further discusses the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: The Sages <b>did not permit</b> one <b>who ate less than the</b> minimum <b>measure</b> of impure foods, i.e., a quarter-loaf, <b>to descend and to immerse</b> in a ritual bath. The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying;</b> why is this prohibited?
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he ate less than the</b> minimum <b>measure</b> that causes impurity, the Sages <b>did not permit him to descend and immerse. As, if he would descend and immerse and ascend and</b> eat more impure food and thereby <b>complete</b> the full measure of a quarter-loaf within the time it takes to eat a half-loaf, all the impure food he ate <b>would combine</b> together to disqualify him from eating <i>teruma</i>; <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> might <b>come to say:</b> My <b>first immersion</b> following my first consumption of impure food <b>was effective for me,</b> and no additional immersion is required now that I ate merely another half-measure of impure food. <b>But</b> in fact, <b>he does not know that immersion is</b> effective in purifying him <b>only at the end,</b> and that if he now makes contact with <i>teruma</i> he will render it disqualified. Therefore, the Sages prohibited immersion in such a case to prevent one from reaching this erroneous conclusion.
The Gemara analyzes another statement from the <i>baraita</i>: It was <b>taught</b> that the Sages <b>permitted a pregnant woman to eat less than the</b> minimum <b>measure due to the danger</b> of her miscarrying. Under the assumption that she is permitted to eat only less than the measure but not a full measure, the Gemara objects: Since it is permitted for her <b>due to the danger, let her even eat a lot,</b> i.e., more than the measure. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: They permitted a pregnant woman</b> to eat <b>less than the measure</b> of an olive-bulk within the time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread, <b>even</b> if she ultimately eats <b>a lot</b> in this manner, <b>due to the danger</b> of her miscarrying.
The Gemara further discusses the <i>baraita</i>: It was <b>taught</b> that with regard to a woman who came in <b>contact</b> with one who was <b>impure</b> due to <b>a corpse,</b> the Sages <b>permitted</b> her <b>to nurse her child, and her child</b> remains <b>pure</b> and may therefore be fed <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is he <b>pure? Once he nurses</b> from <b>the milk</b> of his mother, <b>he becomes impure from the milk.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that the mother’s milk <b>was not rendered susceptible</b> to impurity because it never came into contact with a liquid, which is necessary in order to render a food item susceptible to impurity, that is not so, as <b>it</b> is <b>rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>due to the drop</b> of milk that is <b>smeared on the nipple.</b> Since this drop is not consumed by the child, it attains the status of a liquid rather than a food, and it subsequently renders the rest of the milk that passes through the nipple susceptible to impurity. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the child nursed <b>with one strong</b> suck, and therefore it did <b>not leave a drop</b> of milk <b>smeared on the nipple.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>two refutations of</b> this <b>statement: One</b> is <b>that we see</b> that <b>the mouth of the infant is filled with milk,</b> which means that it is impossible for it to have sucked so powerfully that it immediately swallowed all the milk without leaving a drop on the nipple. <b>And furthermore,</b> the mother’s milk does not need to be rendered susceptible to impurity like other foods in order to become impure and transmit impurity. This is because <b>the location</b> from which <b>the milk</b> emerges <b>is a spring,</b> i.e., it has the same status as the woman’s body. Therefore, if the woman is impure, her milk is also impure.
Rava elaborates: <b>As</b> a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:8) <b>teaches: A woman’s milk renders</b> food with which it comes into contact susceptible to <b>impurity, whether</b> it <b>emerges to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the infant <b>or not to</b> its <b>satisfaction.</b> By contrast, the milk of <b>an animal renders</b> food susceptible <b>to impurity only</b> if it emerges <b>to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the animal’s owner.
<b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that when the mishna states that the milk emerged <b>not to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the infant, it means <b>that</b> the milk is <b>not amenable</b> to him at that time, <b>and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that it <b>renders</b> food susceptible to <b>impurity?</b> Since liquids generally render foods susceptible to impurity only if they come in contact with the food with the owner’s approval, it is clear that a woman’s milk has a different status than other foods or liquids. This means that it need not come into contact with a liquid in order to become impure or to impart impurity to another item. The question therefore remains: Why does the child remain pure when he drinks this impure liquid?
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this is the reason that her child</b> remains <b>pure:</b> The reason is <b>that</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>nursed the measure</b> of milk necessary to disqualify it from consuming <i>teruma</i>, <b>or</b> whether it did <b>not nurse</b> a sufficient amount of milk. <b>And</b> even <b>if you say</b> that it <b>nursed</b> a sufficient amount of milk, it is still <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>nursed</b> the required amount of milk <b>within</b> the time it takes to <b>eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, or whether it <b>nursed</b> that amount <b>in more than</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread and therefore is not disqualified from consuming <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> is it correct that <b>the location</b> from which the <b>milk</b> emerges <b>is</b> considered like <b>a spring, and</b> therefore if the woman is impure the milk is also impure, <b>and it does not need</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity by contact with a liquid?
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 8:11): In the case of a menstruating <b>woman who had milk dripping from her nipples, and it fell into the airspace of an oven, the oven</b> becomes <b>impure. And</b> this poses <b>a difficulty for us: In what</b> way was the milk <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, such that it can become impure or render the oven impure? <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It was rendered susceptible <b>by the drop</b> of milk <b>smeared on the nipple.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that a woman’s milk must be rendered susceptible in order to contract impurity.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rava does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as one <i>amora</i> is permitted to disagree with another, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>You are found saying</b> that there are <b>nine liquids with regard to a <i>zav</i>: The sweat, ill-smelling pus, and</b> liquid <b>excrement</b> are more <b>pure than all of them,</b> i.e., they do not become impure and do not render other items susceptible to impurity. <b>The tears</b> that emerge from his <b>eye, and the blood</b> that emerges from his <b>wound,</b>

Daf 13b

<b>and the milk of a woman</b> who is a <i>zava</i> <b>transmit impurity of liquids where</b> there is <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>. The <b>saliva, gonorrhea-like discharge</b> of a <i>zav</i>, <b>and urine transmit severe impurity in any amount.</b>
<b>And if you say</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rava that <b>the location</b> from which the <b>milk</b> emerges is considered <b>a spring,</b> then <b>milk also should transmit severe impurity in any amount, like the gonorrhea-like discharge</b> of a <i>zav</i> <b>and his saliva. Rather, conclude from it</b> that <b>the location</b> from which the <b>milk of a woman</b> emerges <b>is not</b> considered to be <b>a spring,</b> and the milk must be rendered susceptible to impurity in order to become impure or transmit impurity.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so, this mishna</b> in <i>Makhshirin</i> cited earlier (13a), which <b>Rava said</b> supports his opinion, <b>is difficult,</b> as it states that a woman’s milk <b>renders</b> food susceptible to <b>impurity whether</b> it emerged <b>to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the infant <b>or not to</b> his <b>satisfaction.</b> The mishna is difficult, as food is generally rendered susceptible to impurity only when the liquid comes into contact with it to the owner’s satisfaction.
The Gemara explains: <b>Do you maintain</b> that the term: <b>Not to</b> their <b>satisfaction, that</b> the mishna <b>states,</b> means <b>that</b> the emergence of the milk <b>is not amenable to him? No;</b> rather, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>Not to</b> his <b>satisfaction, that</b> the mishna <b>states?</b> It means that the child did not indicate whether he desires the milk or not, but <b>as a child’s mind is close to milk,</b> i.e., he generally enjoys the milk, an explicit indication of interest or satisfaction is unnecessary in order for the milk to be susceptible to ritual impurity or to render other food items impure. <b>But</b> if <b>he says,</b> i.e., indicates, explictly that the milk is <b>not amenable to him,</b> then the milk is not susceptible to ritual impurity, and it remains <b>pure.</b>
The mishna teaches that if one <b>ate</b> one quarter-loaf of <b>ritually impure foods</b> or drank a quarter-<i>log</i> of ritually impure liquids, or if one drank a quarter-<i>log</i> of wine, and he entered the Temple and remained there for the time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread, he is liable. The Gemara objects: <b>Why do I</b> need him to <b>remain</b> in the Temple in order to be liable, such <b>that it teaches: And remained</b> there? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> In the case of one who <b>ate</b> a quarter-loaf of <b>ritually impure foods or drank</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> of <b>impure liquids, or drank a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of wine, and remained</b> involved <b>in eating them or drinking them</b> for no more than the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, <b>and</b> then <b>entered the Temple,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If one interrupted his drinking of the quarter-<i>log</i> of wine, or if he placed any amount of water into the wine, he is exempt. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the Torah instructs Aaron the High Priest: <b>“Drink no wine nor intoxicating drink,</b> you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, that you shall not die” (Leviticus 10:9), one <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if he drank <b>any amount,</b> and <b>even</b> if he drank wine <b>from its press,</b> i.e., wine that has not finished fermenting.
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Nor intoxicating drink,”</b> indicating that <b>only</b> the consumption of a quantity of wine sufficient <b>to intoxicate</b> is <b>prohibited. And how much</b> wine is sufficient <b>to intoxicate?</b> It is a minimum of <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of <b>wine</b> that is <b>forty days old,</b> which has already fermented.
<b>If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state “wine,”</b> when the term “intoxicating drink” would have sufficed? It is <b>to tell you that</b> although one is not liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven for it, it is <b>prohibited</b> to drink <b>any amount of it,</b> even less than a quarter-<i>log</i>, and then enter the Temple; <b>and</b> similarly, it is <b>prohibited</b> to drink it <b>from its press</b> and then enter the Temple, and one who does so is liable to be flogged, as is the case with any other prohibition by Torah law.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> From the word <b>“wine” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>wine</b> is forbidden; <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>other intoxicating beverages</b> are forbidden as well? <b>The verse states: “Nor intoxicating drink.” If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state “wine”?</b> This comes to teach that <b>for</b> entering the Temple after drinking <b>wine</b> one is liable to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>but for</b> entering after drinking <b>other</b> intoxicating <b>drinks,</b> one violates only a regular <b>prohibition.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that the verse is interpreted to mean: <b>Wine you shall not drink, and intoxicating drink,</b> meaning that <b>you shall not drink it in the manner of its being intoxicating.</b> But <b>if one interrupted</b> his drinking, <b>or placed any amount of water into it</b> and drank it, he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? The first <i>tanna</i> holds: We learn</b> by verbal analogy that the term <b>“intoxicating drink”</b> is referring to wine, <b>from</b> the term <b>“intoxicating drink”</b> mentioned with regard to <b>a nazirite</b> in the verse: “He shall abstain from wine and intoxicating drink” (Numbers 6:3). There it is referring only to wine (see <i>Nazir</i> 4a).
<b>But Rabbi Yehuda does not derive</b> that the term <b>“intoxicating drink”</b> refers only to wine by the verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term <b>“intoxicating drink”</b> stated with regard to <b>a nazirite.</b> Consequently, he interprets the word as referring to an intoxicating drink that is not wine. <b>And Rabbi Elazar holds: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: “Wine and <b>intoxicating drink”?</b> It is not referring to two separate items, but rather to wine <b>in the manner that it intoxicates.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of one who <b>ate</b> a sweet <b>dried fig from Ke’ila, or drank honey or milk,</b> all of which can have an intoxicating effect, <b>and</b> he <b>entered the Temple and performed</b> the Temple service, he is <b>flogged. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that any item which intoxicates is included in the prohibition. <b>Rav Yehuda bar Aḥotai says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, and Rav referred to Rabbi Elazar as the most gratified of the Sages,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa</b> of the city <b>of Huzal had</b> taken <b>a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from his wife. He came before Rav Ashi</b> to request that he dissolve the vow. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Go now and come</b> back <b>tomorrow,</b> as I have just drunk wine, and it is prohibited for me to issue a halakhic ruling, <b>as Rav</b> would <b>not place a disseminator before him</b> to communicate his lectures to the masses <b>from</b> the meal of one <b>Festival</b> day <b>until the other,</b> i.e., the next morning, <b>due to drunkenness.</b> Since it was customary to drink wine during Festival meals, Rav would not deliver public lectures on Festival days, as one who has consumed wine may not issue halakhic rulings.
Rav Aḥa <b>said to him: But doesn’t Rav say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> that if one diluted the wine he drank with water and entered the Temple he is exempt; <b>and the Master is</b> one <b>who puts water into</b> his wine? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: That</b> is <b>not difficult; that</b> ruling of Rabbi Elazar applies in a case <b>where</b> one drank precisely <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of wine, whereas in <b>this</b> case I drank <b>more than a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of wine. In such a case one does not maintain a clear mind even if he mixed in a small amount of water.
§ In the continuation of the passage in which the Torah prohibits a priest from entering the Temple after drinking wine, the verse states: “And that you may differentiate between the sacred and the common, and between the impure and the pure; and that you may instruct the children of Israel in all the statutes which the Lord has spoken to them by the hand of Moses” (Leviticus 10:10–11). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And that you may differentiate between the sacred and the common.” These</b> terms are referring to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>values and valuations, dedications and consecrations,</b> and the verse is teaching that it is prohibited to issue a ruling concerning these matters after drinking wine.
<b>“Between the impure and the pure”; these</b> terms indicate that it is prohibited for one who drank wine to render decisions with regard to <b>ritually impure</b> items <b>and ritually pure</b> items. <b>“And that you may instruct”; this</b> is referring to <b>issuing a ruling</b> about what is permitted or prohibited. <b>“All the statutes”; this</b> is referring to the halakhic <b>expositions</b> of the Torah. <b>“Which the Lord has spoken”; this</b> is referring to <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted orally to Moses from Sinai. <b>“By the hand of Moses”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Talmud,</b> the deliberations on the Oral Law, from which halakhic conclusions are derived. It is prohibited to teach any of these subjects after drinking wine.
One <b>might</b> have thought that it is prohibited to teach <b>even Mishna</b> after drinking wine. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And that you may instruct,”</b> indicating that the prohibition is limited to material that provides practical halakhic instruction, whereas one does not derive practical rulings from the Mishna. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> teaching <b>Talmud</b> is prohibited. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And that you may instruct,”</b> indicating that the prohibition is limited to issuing halakhic rulings, but it does not include teaching material such as Talmud, although halakhic conclusions may be derived from it.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The rulings that a carcass of <b>a creeping animal is ritually impure and</b> that a carcass of <b>a frog is pure</b> are <b>excluded</b> from this principle, <b>as those who have drunk wine may issue</b> a halakhic <b>ruling</b> about these matters. <b>Let us say</b> that this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says it is permitted to teach Talmud, and these conclusions are obvious from the Talmud, <b>and</b> that it is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> that <b>this</b> case <b>is different, as</b> it <b>is</b> a topic that one could <b>go learn in a children’s school,</b> and teaching is not considered issuing a halakhic ruling.
<b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that it is permitted to teach material from which <i>halakha</i> may be derived, but it is prohibited to issue halakhic rulings. The Gemara objects: <b>But Rav</b> himself would <b>not place a disseminator before him</b> to communicate his lectures to the masses <b>from</b> the meal of one <b>Festival</b> day <b>until the other,</b> i.e., the next morning, <b>due to drunkenness.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rav is different, as he would issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings</b> during his lectures. The Gemara further objects: <b>And let him place</b> a disseminator and deliver a lecture <b>but not issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Wherever Rav sits</b> and delivers a lecture, it is <b>not possible</b> for him to do so <b>without</b> issuing a halakhic <b>ruling.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There is</b> a case where one can perform <b>a single</b> act of <b>eating</b> an olive-bulk of food <b>and</b> be <b>liable</b> to bring <b>four sin offerings and one guilt offering for it.</b> How so? This <i>halakha</i> applies to one who is <b>ritually impure who ate</b> forbidden <b>fat, and it was left over from a consecrated</b> offering after the time allotted for its consumption <b>[<i>notar</i>], on Yom Kippur.</b> He is liable to bring sin offerings for eating forbidden fat and <i>notar</i>, for eating the meat of an offering while impure, and for eating on Yom Kippur. He is also liable to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property.
<b>Rabbi Meir says: If it was Shabbat and he carried it out</b> from a private domain to a public domain while eating it, he would be <b>liable</b> to bring an additional sin offering for performing prohibited labor on Shabbat. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> That liability <b>is not from the</b> same <b>type</b> of prohibition, as it is not due to the act of eating, and therefore, it should not be counted.

Daf 14a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that it is evident from the mishna that <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists. The Gemara counters: <b>Although he does not</b> generally <b>hold</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, with regard to a more <b>inclusive prohibition and an expanded prohibition, he holds</b> that the second prohibition does take effect where a prohibition already exists. Under certain circumstances a second prohibition takes effect, and under other circumstances it does not. When the second prohibition is an expanded or inclusive prohibition, it takes effect.
Therefore, in the case in the mishna of a ritually impure person who ate leftover forbidden fat from an offering, one who was <b>initially pure was prohibited</b> from eating the food <b>only</b> due to the prohibition <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> Once the person <b>became impure, since he</b> became <b>prohibited from</b> eating even <b>pure pieces</b> of sacrificial meat, an additional <b>prohibition is also added</b> to the forbidden <b>fat.</b> The prohibition against an impure person eating sacrificial meat is considered an inclusive prohibition, and therefore it takes effect even though the prohibition against eating forbidden fat already applied.
<b>And</b> likewise, the forbidden <b>fat was initially forbidden only in consumption.</b> When he <b>consecrated</b> the animal, it became prohibited to derive benefit from it in any manner. Therefore, <b>since the prohibition</b> against <b>deriving</b> any form of <b>benefit was added to it, it was</b> also <b>added with regard to</b> eating the forbidden <b>fat.</b> Consequently, the prohibition against misusing consecrated property, which is an expanded prohibition, applies even to one who eats the forbidden fat.
<b>And still,</b> the consecrated forbidden fat is <b>prohibited</b> only <b>to an ordinary</b> person, <b>but it is permitted to the Most High,</b> i.e., the altar. When <b>it becomes leftover, since a prohibition was added with regard to the Most High,</b> as it is now prohibited to sacrifice it upon the altar, the expanded prohibition of leftover sacrificial meat is <b>added with regard to an ordinary</b> person as well. If <b>Yom Kippur,</b> during which the person is prohibited from eating anything, <b>takes effect with regard to it, since a prohibition was added with regard to</b> eating <b>non-sacred</b> food, a prohibition <b>is</b> also <b>added with regard to</b> food that had been consecrated <b>to the Most High.</b> The prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur is an inclusive prohibition, and therefore it takes effect even with regard to eating leftover sacrificial meat.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> There is a case where one can perform a single act of eating an olive-bulk of food and be liable to bring <b>five sin offerings,</b> rather than four, <b>and interpret it</b> as a case <b>where he ate an olive-bulk</b> from <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its appointed time [<i>piggul</i>].</b> The Gemara explains: The mishna is <b>referring</b> to a case <b>of one animal,</b> but is <b>not referring</b> to a case <b>of two animals, and you do not find</b> a case where the prohibitions of <b>leftover</b> sacrificial meat [<i>notar</i>] <b>and <i>piggul</i></b> apply <b>to one animal.</b> From the moment an offering is rendered <i>piggul</i> it may not be sacrificed or eaten, and therefore it is not subject to the prohibition of <i>notar</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it <b>not</b> possible for the prohibitions of <i>notar</i> and <i>piggul</i> to apply to the same animal? <b>You find it</b> in a case <b>where one brought upon the altar a limb</b> from an offering that was <b><i>piggul</i>, as</b> from that time <b>its <i>piggul</i></b> status has <b>been abrogated, and it becomes <i>notar</i></b> once the time that it may be sacrificed has passed.
<b>And</b> this is <b>as Ulla says:</b> In the case of <b>a handful of</b> a meal offering that is <b><i>piggul</i> that one brought upon the altar, its <i>piggul</i></b> status has <b>been abrogated and it becomes leftover.</b> Consequently, he is liable with regard to the limb that was offered for violating the prohibition of <i>notar</i>, and is liable with regard to the rest of the animal for violating the prohibition of <i>piggul</i>. The Gemara answers: The mishna is <b>referring to one limb,</b> but it is <b>not referring to two limbs, and you do not find <i>notar</i> and <i>piggul</i> with regard to one limb.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is there <b>no</b> such case? <b>You find it</b> in a situation <b>where one brought a limb</b> from <b>a <i>piggul</i></b> offering <b>upon the altar,</b> and <b>he placed half of it upon the altar and half of it outside of the altar.</b> In such a case, with regard to <b>that</b> portion of the limb which he placed upon the <b>altar,</b> its <b><i>piggul</i></b> status has <b>been abrogated and it becomes <i>notar</i>. And</b> this is <b>as Ulla says:</b> In the case of <b>a handful of</b> a meal offering that is <b><i>piggul</i> that one brought upon the altar, its <i>piggul</i></b> status has <b>been abrogated and it becomes <i>notar</i>.</b> By contrast, the part of the limb that was not placed upon the altar retains its status as <i>piggul</i>.
The Sage answering the question <b>said to</b> the questioner: <b>No,</b> the status of <i>piggul</i> cannot be abrogated from part of a limb. Rather, if <b>the majority</b> of the limb is <b>on the altar,</b> then <b>throw it on the altar,</b> i.e., the entire limb has the status of being on the altar. If <b>the majority</b> of the limb is <b>outside</b> the altar, <b>throw it outside,</b> i.e., it is considered as though the limb was not placed on the altar at all.
The Gemara objects: If so, one can <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>that Rami bar Ḥama raised:</b> Does one <b>follow the majority with regard to limbs or not?</b> According to the previous interpretation of the mishna, one does follow the majority with regard to limbs. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the reason that the mishna did not mention the prohibition of <i>piggul</i> is that it is <b>referring to</b> the consumption of <b>one olive-bulk</b> of forbidden fat, and is <b>not referring to two olive-bulks.</b> Even if parts of one limb can have the status of <i>piggul</i> and other parts can be leftover sacrificial meat, one single olive-bulk cannot have both statuses.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the mishna <b>not</b> referring to a case of more than one olive-bulk? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> that one is liable to bring a sin offering for eating on <b>Yom Kippur, and on Yom Kippur</b> it is only eating the <b>volume of a large date that obligates</b> one to bring a sin offering, <b>and</b> the <b>volume of a large date contains</b> the volume of <b>two olives?</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where he eats a kidney with the fat</b> attached to <b>it.</b> He is liable to bring three of the sin offerings enumerated in the mishna for eating the olive-bulk of fat, and the additional amount of kidney he eats brings his total consumption to the volume of a large date, so that he is liable for eating on Yom Kippur. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where he</b> ate an olive-bulk of the fat and <b>completed</b> the volume of a large date <b>with dates.</b>
<b>Rav Adda bar Aḥa teaches</b> that the mishna is stating that one can be liable to bring <b>five sin offerings</b> for one act of eating, not just four, <b>and he interprets it</b> to be referring to a case <b>where one ate an olive-bulk of <i>piggul</i></b> from another animal together with the olive-bulk of forbidden fat, <b>and he does not answer</b> in accordance <b>with these answers that we answered</b> in the name of Rav Pappa and Rabbi Zeira.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that one can be liable to bring <b>six sin offerings, and interpret it</b> as referring to a case <b>where he consumed an olive-bulk of blood</b> in addition to the other two olive-bulks. The Gemara explains: The mishna is <b>referring to one</b> act of <b>eating,</b> but is <b>not referring to two</b> acts of <b>eating, and the Sages calculated that</b> one’s <b>throat does not hold more than two olive-bulks</b> at once.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> If it was Shabbat and he carried it out from the private domain into the public domain while eating it, he would be liable to bring a sin offering for performing a prohibited labor on Shabbat. The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>teach: If he carried it out</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as the mishna is referring to one who ate on Yom Kippur, which is also a day when labor is prohibited. <b>What is the reason</b> that it <b>teaches: If it was Shabbat</b> and he carried it out he is liable? Why mention Shabbat at all? <b>Rafram said: That is to say</b> that the <b>joining</b> of courtyards in order to permit carrying, <b>and</b> the general prohibition against <b>carrying</b> from one domain to another, apply <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> but the <b>joining</b> of courtyards <b>and</b> the prohibition against <b>carrying do not</b> apply <b>with regard to Yom Kippur.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this conclusion derived? <b>Perhaps</b> the <b>joining</b> of courtyards <b>and</b> the prohibition against <b>carrying do</b> apply <b>to Yom Kippur, and this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: If it was Shabbat and he carried it out</b> from one domain to another he is <b>liable due to</b> the prohibition against carrying on <b>Shabbat and also</b> due to the prohibition against carrying on <b>Yom Kippur.</b>
<b>Rather, if</b> the statement <b>of Rafram was stated,</b> it <b>was stated with regard to this</b> case, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the scapegoat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall send it away with an appointed man</b> into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:21). The word <b>“man”</b> is mentioned in order <b>to render a non-priest fit</b> for this task. The term <b>“appointed”</b> indicates that the scapegoat is always sent away at the appropriate time, <b>even</b> when the appointed man is <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity, and even</b> when Yom Kippur occurs <b>on Shabbat.</b> In addition, the word <b>“appointed”</b> is referring <b>to</b> one who was <b>designated</b> for the task the day before.
The <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> that the word <b>“appointed”</b> indicates that the scapegoat is sent away <b>even on Shabbat,</b> and in this context <b>Rafram says: That is to say</b> that the <b>joining</b> of courtyards <b>and</b> the prohibition against <b>carrying</b> apply <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> but the <b>joining</b> of courtyards <b>and</b> the prohibition against <b>carrying do not</b> apply <b>with regard to Yom Kippur.</b>
The Gemara objects to Rafram’s inference: <b>From where</b> does he cite proof for this inference? The case of <b>the scapegoat is different, as its validity on Yom Kippur is in this</b> manner. Even if the prohibition against carrying does apply on Yom Kippur, the Torah explicitly commanded that the scapegoat be sent away on that day, and therefore it is permitted. <b>Rather,</b> the statement cited in the name <b>of Rafram is an error [<i>beruta</i>],</b> and it was not actually stated in the study hall.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There is</b> a case where <b>one</b> can <b>engage in a single</b> act of <b>intercourse and</b> be <b>liable</b> to bring <b>six sin offerings for it. How so?</b> It is possible for <b>one who engages in intercourse with his daughter</b> to be <b>liable due to</b> having violated the prohibitions of engaging in intercourse with <b>his daughter, his sister, the wife of his brother, the wife of his father’s brother, a married woman, and a menstruating woman.</b>

Daf 14b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: How could one become liable to bring multiple sin offerings? <b>But Rabbi Meir does not hold</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists. The Gemara answers: <b>Although he</b> generally <b>does not hold</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, with regard to <b>an expanded prohibition and a more inclusive prohibition, he does hold</b> that it takes effect where another prohibition already exists.
Consequently, the ruling stated in the mishna applies in a case <b>where one engaged in intercourse with his mother and</b> thereby <b>fathered a daughter, so</b> that <b>the prohibitions</b> against engaging in intercourse with <b>his daughter and</b> with <b>his sister come</b> into effect <b>simultaneously.</b> If that daughter <b>married his brother,</b> then <b>since a prohibition was added with regard to</b> his other <b>brothers,</b> to whom she has now become forbidden, it is an expanded prohibition, and therefore a further <b>prohibition is added with regard to him</b> as well.
If <b>she</b> later <b>married his father’s brother,</b> then <b>since a prohibition is added with regard to</b> the sons of <b>his father’s other brothers,</b> a prohibition <b>is</b> also <b>added with regard to him.</b> If <b>she becomes,</b> or remains, <b>a married woman, since a prohibition is added with regard to</b> every man in <b>the world</b> other than her husband, <b>a prohibition is added with regard to him as well.</b> If <b>she</b> then <b>becomes a menstruating woman, since a prohibition is added with regard to her husband, a prohibition is added with regard to him as well.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is possible for <b>one who engages in intercourse with his daughter’s daughter</b> to be <b>liable</b> to bring sin offerings <b>due to</b> the unwitting violation of the prohibitions of engaging in intercourse with <b>his daughter’s daughter, and his daughter-in-law, and the wife of his brother, and the wife of his father’s brother, and his wife’s sister, and a married woman, and a menstruating woman. Rabbi Yosei says: If</b> the <b>elder,</b> i.e., the man’s father, who is the woman’s great-grandfather, <b>transgressed and married her,</b> the man would also be <b>liable for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her due to</b> the prohibition of intercourse with <b>the wife of his father.</b>
<b>And likewise,</b> it is possible for <b>one who engages in intercourse with the daughter of his wife</b> to be liable to bring six sin offerings, similar to one who engages in intercourse with his own daughter, for violating the prohibitions against engaging in intercourse with his wife’s daughter, his sister, the wife of his brother, the wife of his father’s brother, a married woman, and a menstruating woman. <b>And</b> it is possible for one who engages in intercourse <b>with</b> his wife’s <b>daughter’s daughter</b> to be liable to bring seven sin offerings, similar to one who engages in intercourse with his own daughter’s daughter, for violating the following prohibitions: Engaging in intercourse with his wife’s daughter’s daughter, his daughter-in-law, the wife of his brother, the wife of his father’s brother, his wife’s sister, a married woman, and a menstruating woman.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in the mishna that Rabbi Yosei says: If the elder, i.e., the man’s father, who is the woman’s great-grandfather, transgressed and married her, the man would also be <b>liable for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>the wife of his father.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is she permitted to</b> marry the man’s father? She had already been married to the man’s father’s brother, and therefore even if she was widowed or divorced from him, marriage would not even take effect with the man’s father, to whom she is forbidden as the wife of his brother. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The marriage can take effect in a case <b>where she happened to</b> become designated to <b>him for levirate marriage,</b> when his brother died without children.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so,</b> that they were married legitimately through levirate marriage, <b>what</b> is the reason for Rabbi Yosei’s statement that he <b>transgressed</b> and married her? <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said:</b> It means <b>that he transgressed</b> by marrying her <b>due to</b> her status as <b>his son’s daughter-in-law,</b> which renders her <b>a secondary relative,</b> forbidden to him by rabbinic law, albeit not by Torah law. Consequently, it was prohibited for him to enter into the levirate marriage.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One’s daughter-in-law is a forbidden relative</b> by Torah law, and <b>his son’s daughter-in-law is a secondary relative,</b> prohibited to him by rabbinic law, <b>and similarly, you find with regard to the daughter of his son,</b> who is prohibited to him by Torah law, <b>and with regard to the daughter of his son’s son, until the end of all generations;</b> the daughter of his son’s son, or of his son’s grandson, etc. They are all secondary relatives, prohibited to him by rabbinic law.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rabbi Yosei of</b> the opinion that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 81a): If one <b>violated a transgression that</b> renders him liable to <b>two death penalties, he is sentenced to the harsher</b> one. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: He is sentenced according to</b> the <b>first prohibition that applied to him.</b>
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what case did Rabbi Yosei say</b> that <b>he is sentenced according to</b> the <b>first prohibition that applied to him?</b> If <b>his mother-in-law</b> was widowed or divorced, and therefore forbidden to him only due to her status as his mother-in-law, and later she married <b>and became</b> forbidden as <b>a married woman,</b> and he engaged in intercourse with her, then <b>he is sentenced</b> to death by burning <b>due to</b> his violation of the prohibition proscribing intercourse with <b>his mother-in-law,</b> as this was the first prohibition to take effect.
By contrast, if she was <b>a married woman,</b> and then he married her daughter and she thereby <b>became his mother-in-law,</b> and he subsequently engaged in intercourse with her, <b>he is sentenced</b> to death by strangulation <b>due to</b> his violation of the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman,</b> despite the fact that burning is considered the more severe death penalty. This proves that Rabbi Yosei maintains that a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Rabbi Yosei concedes</b> that <b>in</b> the case of <b>an expanded prohibition</b> it takes effect even when another prohibition already exists. Consequently, he maintains in the mishna that the prohibition against intercourse with the wife of his father applies in addition to the previously existing prohibitions. <b>And similarly, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to an expanded prohibition.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What expanded prohibition is there here?</b> The Gemara answers: The expanded prohibition applies <b>when there is</b> another <b>son of the grandfather,</b> i.e., another son of the father of the subject of the mishna. Consequently, <b>since a prohibition</b> against intercourse with the woman <b>is added with regard to his</b> father’s other <b>son,</b> when his father marries this woman, another <b>prohibition</b> against intercourse with her <b>is added with regard to him</b> as well.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is possible for <b>one who engages in intercourse with his mother-in-law</b> to be <b>liable</b> to bring seven sin offerings <b>for</b> doing so, <b>due to</b> the unwitting violation of the prohibitions of engaging in intercourse with <b>his mother-in-law, and his daughter-in-law, and the wife of his brother, and the wife of his father’s brother, and his wife’s sister, and a married woman, and a menstruating woman. And likewise,</b> the same applies with regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse with the mother of his father-in-law or with the mother of his mother-in-law.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says:</b> It is possible for <b>one who engages in intercourse with his mother-in-law</b> to be <b>liable due to</b> the unwitting violation of the prohibitions of engaging in intercourse with <b>his mother-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law, and the mother of his father-in-law.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: Those three</b> prohibitions <b>are</b> all <b>one category</b> of prohibition, derived from the same verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter” (Leviticus 18:17). Consequently, one is not liable to bring separate sin offerings for violating these prohibitions.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya says: Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and Sumakhos said the same thing.</b> With regard to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> this is referring to <b>that which we stated</b> in the mishna. With regard to <b>Sumakhos, what is</b> the equivalent ruling that he stated? It is the following ruling, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 82a):

Daf 15a

If <b>one slaughtered</b> an animal <b>and its daughter’s daughter and afterward slaughtered</b> the original animal’s <b>daughter, he incurs the forty</b> lashes for transgressing the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day (see Leviticus 22:28). <b>Sumakhos says in the name of Rabbi Meir: He incurs eighty</b> lashes for slaughtering the third animal, as its mother and its daughter had already been slaughtered on that day. This indicates that Sumakhos also maintains that when a person commits a single act and thereby commits two transgressions that are derived from a single verse, he is liable to receive punishment for both violations.
<b>Rava said: Perhaps it is not so,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri would not agree with the ruling of Sumakhos. It is possible that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says</b> that one is liable to bring multiple sin offerings <b>only here,</b> in the case of one who engaged in intercourse with his mother-in-law, <b>only due to</b> the <b>differentiated names</b> of the prohibitions, <b>as she is called his mother-in-law, and she is called his mother-in-law’s mother, and she is called his father-in-law’s mother,</b> and the Torah prohibits each of these relationships separately.
<b>But with regard to</b> the case of slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring</b> in a single day, <b>where all of</b> the permutations <b>are called: A mother and its offspring, as there are no differentiated names</b> given in the Torah for slaughtering a mother animal and then its offspring or for slaughtering the offspring and subsequently its mother, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri might maintain that one is <b>not</b> liable to receive multiple sets of lashes.
By contrast, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Perhaps Sumakhos says</b> that one is liable to receive two sets of lashes <b>only with regard to</b> the case of slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring</b> on the same day, <b>as</b> there are <b>differentiated bodies.</b> Although he violated the same prohibition twice, he did so by slaughtering three different animals.
<b>But here,</b> with regard to a mother-in-law, <b>where</b> there are <b>not</b> several <b>differentiated bodies,</b> as the man engaged in intercourse with only one woman, one might <b>say</b> that Sumakhos <b>holds in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The verse that introduces the prohibitions against engaging in intercourse with one’s mother-in-law, one’s mother-in-law’s mother, and one’s father-in-law’s mother concludes with the phrase: <b>“They are near kinswomen; it is lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17). This teaches that although these are different relationships, <b>the verse rendered them all one</b> single prohibition of <b>lewdness,</b> for which only a single sin offering is brought.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Akiva said: I asked Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua in the meat market [<i>itlis</i>] in Emmaus, where they went to purchase an animal for the</b> wedding <b>feast of the son of Rabban Gamliel:</b> In the case of <b>one who</b> unwittingly <b>engages in intercourse with his sister, and the sister of his father, and the sister of his mother,</b> during one lapse of awareness, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all</b> three prohibitions, <b>or</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of the prohibitions?
<b>They said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We did not hear</b> a ruling from our teachers about that case, <b>but we heard</b> the following ruling: <b>One who engages in intercourse with</b> each of <b>his five wives</b> while they are <b>menstruating, during one lapse of awareness,</b> we heard <b>that he is liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> having engaged in intercourse with <b>each and every one</b> of them. <b>And it appears to me that these matters</b> can be derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If he is liable to bring separate sin offerings for having engaged in intercourse with five menstruating women, who are forbidden by one prohibition, he should certainly be liable to bring separate sin offerings for having engaged in intercourse with his sister, the sister of his father, and the sister of his mother, who are forbidden by three separate prohibitions.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rabbi Akiva’s question: <b>What are the circumstances</b> about which Rabbi Akiva inquired? <b>If we say</b> that the circumstances are precisely <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> them, that one unwittingly engaged in intercourse with his sister, and the sister of his father, and the sister of his mother, then for <b>what</b> purpose did Rabbi Akiva <b>raise this dilemma</b> before Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua? <b>Aren’t they differentiated names</b> of prohibitions and <b>aren’t they</b> also <b>differentiated bodies?</b> Since the man engaged in intercourse with three women, who are forbidden by three distinct prohibitions, it is obvious that he is obligated to bring three separate sin offerings.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> Rabbi Akiva asked: In the case of <b>one who</b> unwittingly <b>engages in intercourse with</b> his sister who is also <b>the sister of his father</b> and <b>who is</b> also <b>the sister of his mother,</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring only <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for</b> violating <b>all of those</b> prohibitions, <b>or is he liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>they are differentiated names</b> of prohibitions, and since he violated distinct prohibitions, he is liable to bring separate sin offerings? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say: <b>It is not</b> a case of <b>differentiated bodies;</b> since he engaged in intercourse with only one woman, he is liable to bring only a single sin offering.
And in response, <b>they said to him: We did not hear</b> a ruling from our teachers about that case, <b>but we heard</b> the following ruling: With regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse with</b> each of <b>his five wives</b> while they are <b>menstruating, at the same time,</b> i.e., during one lapse of awareness, <b>which is</b> five instances of violating <b>one category</b> of prohibition, we heard <b>that</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> having engaged in intercourse with <b>each and every one</b> of them, <b>due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman.</b>
<b>And it appears to us that these matters</b> can be derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If one who engages in intercourse with his five wives</b> while they are <b>menstruating, at the same time, which is</b> only <b>one name</b> of a prohibition, is nevertheless <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of them, then in the case of one who engages in intercourse with <b>his sister who is</b> also <b>the sister of his father</b> and <b>the sister of his mother, which are three</b> separate prohibition <b>names, is it not logical that he should be liable for each and every one</b> of them?
The Gemara raises an objection: This line of reasoning <b>can be refuted,</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>five menstruating women</b> that would render one liable to bring a separate sin offering for having intercourse with each one of them? It is notable <b>in that</b> they are <b>differentiated bodies,</b> which is not the case with regard to one’s sister who is also the sister of his father and the sister of his mother, as she is a single person.
<b>Rather,</b> the reason one is liable to bring three separate sin offerings for engaging in intercourse with his sister who is also the sister of his mother and the sister of his father is that <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man takes his sister…and they shall be cut off [<i>venikhretu</i>] in the sight of the children of their people; <b>he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:17). The final clause in this verse serves <b>to render him liable</b> to receive three separate penalties of <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> intentional intercourse, or to bring three separate sin offerings for unwitting intercourse, with <b>his sister who is</b> also <b>the sister of his father</b> and <b>who is the sister of his mother.</b>
The Gemara explains how there could be a case where one’s sister is also the sister of his father and the sister of his mother: <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says: You find it in</b> the case of <b>a wicked man, the son of a wicked man.</b> The case applies if a man <b>engaged in intercourse with his mother and fathered two daughters, and then engaged in intercourse with one of those</b> daughters <b>and fathered a son, and his son engaged in intercourse with his mother’s sister who is</b> also <b>his</b> own <b>sister,</b> because they share a father, and who <b>is</b> also <b>his father’s sister.</b> This individual <b>is a wicked man, the son of a wicked man,</b> as both he and his father engaged in incestuous relationships.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one unwittingly <b>engages in intercourse with</b> a woman who is forbidden to him under the penalty of excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>], <b>and then</b> again <b>engages in intercourse with her, and then</b> yet again <b>engages in intercourse with her,</b> all during one lapse of awareness, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of the acts of intercourse with her. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Rabbis say: He is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering.
<b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to one who engages in intercourse with his five wives</b> while they are <b>menstruating,</b> where the prohibition was violated unwittingly by both the man and the woman, <b>at the same time,</b> i.e., during one lapse of awareness, <b>that he is liable for each and every one</b> of them, <b>since he caused</b> each of <b>them</b> to be liable to bring a sin offering.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Do we</b> really <b>say</b> that <b>since he caused</b> each of <b>them</b> to be liable to bring a sin offering, he himself is liable to bring five separate sin offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one unwittingly engages in intercourse five times with a woman who is forbidden to him, and <b>he</b> does so <b>during one lapse of awareness,</b> without realizing over the course of that time period that the act is forbidden, <b>but she</b> does so <b>during five lapses</b> of awareness, as she repeatedly became aware of the prohibition and then forgot it before the next transgression, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>but she is liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of the five transgressions? In this case, although he caused her to bring several sin offerings, he himself brings only one sin offering.
<b>Rather,</b> one must <b>say</b> that this is the reason he brings five sin offerings for engaging in intercourse with his five wives while they were each menstruating, during one lapse of awareness: It is <b>because</b> they are <b>differentiated bodies.</b>
The Gemara discusses the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer that one who repeatedly engages in intercourse with a woman who is forbidden to him is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each act of intercourse, even if this all occurred in a single lapse of awareness. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>reaped</b> a fig-bulk of grain on Shabbat, which is the measure for which one is liable to bring a sin offering, <b>and</b> then <b>reaped</b> another fig-bulk, in a single lapse of awareness, <b>what</b> would <b>Rabbi Eliezer say?</b>
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Is <b>the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Eliezer there,</b> with regard to forbidden relations, <b>that</b> the sinner <b>performed two</b> separate prohibited acts, <b>and therefore</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>says</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of the acts? If so, <b>here too, where he performed two</b> separate acts of reaping, he is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each act.
<b>Or, perhaps the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer there,</b> in the case of forbidden relations, is <b>that it is impossible for</b> the sinner <b>to combine the</b> acts of <b>intercourse with one another,</b> and <b>therefore Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of the acts of intercourse. <b>But</b> if one <b>reaped a fig-bulk</b> of grain, <b>and then reaped</b> another <b>fig-bulk, in a single lapse of awareness, since it is possible for him to combine the two fig-bulks</b> of grain together and reap them <b>at the same time, he</b> would be <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering. <b>What</b> is the correct explanation for Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling?
<b>Rabba said: The reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer there,</b> in the case of forbidden relations, is <b>that</b> the sinner <b>performed two</b> separate prohibited acts; and <b>here too, he has performed two</b> separate acts of reaping and is liable to bring two sin offerings. <b>And Rav Yosef said: The reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer there,</b> in the case of forbidden relations, is <b>that it is impossible for him to combine</b> the two transgressions into a single act; <b>but</b> if it is <b>possible for him to combine them,</b> e.g., by reaping two fig-bulks of grain, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: Each type of labor prohibited on Shabbat comprises acts that are primary categories of that labor and acts that are subcategories of that labor, both prohibited by Torah law. <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring separate sin offerings <b>for</b> the performance of <b>subcategories</b> of prohibited <b>labor</b> on Shabbat <b>in a situation</b> where he also performed the corresponding <b>primary categories of</b> prohibited <b>labor</b> during the same lapse of awareness. For example, if one planted grain on Shabbat and then watered the field, which is a subcategory of the prohibited labor of planting, he is liable to bring two sin offerings.
It may be inferred from this statement that: <b>But</b> if one performed <b>a primary category</b> of labor <b>and</b> then performed the same <b>primary category at the same time,</b> i.e., during the same lapse of awareness, he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a second sin offering. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> in the case of one who engages in repeated acts of intercourse with a woman forbidden to him is <b>because</b> the sinner <b>performed two</b> separate prohibited acts, then <b>why</b> is one <b>exempt</b> from bringing a second sin offering for repeatedly performing a primary category of prohibited labor on Shabbat, when he too has performed distinct prohibited acts?
<b>Mar, son of the Sages, said: Rav Naḥumi bar Zekharya and I interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>What are we dealing with here,</b> in the case where one is liable to bring two sin offerings for performing a primary category of prohibited labor and its subcategory?
It is a case <b>of a climbing grapevine that is trellised over a fig tree, and he cut them</b> both, the grapevine and the figs, <b>at the same time,</b> during one lapse of awareness. Detaching the figs is one of the primary categories of the prohibited labor of harvesting, while pruning the vine in order to use it as fuel for a fire is a subcategory of harvesting. <b>Due to that</b> reason <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring two sin offerings, <b>since</b> it is a case of <b>differentiated names</b> of prohibitions, as he violated both the primary category of the labor and a subcategory, <b>and</b> it is also a case of <b>differentiated physical entities,</b> as he detached figs and part of a grapevine.
<b>In the corresponding</b> situation, where one <b>reaped</b> a fig-bulk of grain on Shabbat <b>and</b> then <b>reaped</b> another fig-bulk in a single lapse of awareness, <b>how can you find</b> circumstances in <b>which he is exempt</b> from bringing a second sin offering? You find this in a situation <b>where he reaped two fig-bulks simultaneously,</b> in which case he performed only a single prohibited act. <b>But</b> if one <b>reaped a fig-bulk</b> of grain <b>and then reaped</b> another <b>fig-bulk,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring two sin offerings, as he performed two separate acts.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Akiva asked</b> Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua in the meat market of Emmaus: <b>What is</b> the status of <b>a dangling limb of an animal?</b> Does it impart ritual impurity like a severed limb? <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We have not heard</b> a ruling from our teachers in that specific case, <b>but we have heard</b> with regard to <b>a dangling limb of a person that it is ritually pure. And</b> in <b>this</b> manner <b>would</b>

Daf 15b

the people <b>afflicted with boils,</b> whose limbs were dangling due to their affliction, <b>act in Jerusalem:</b> Each of them <b>would go on Passover eve to the doctor,</b> who <b>would cut</b> the affected limb almost completely <b>until he would leave</b> it connected <b>by a hairbreadth</b> of flesh, so that neither the doctor nor the afflicted would be rendered ritually impure by a severed limb. Then, the doctor would <b>impale</b> the limb <b>on a thorn</b> attached to the floor or the wall, <b>and</b> the afflicted <b>would pull away from</b> the thorn, thereby completely severing the limb.
<b>And that</b> person afflicted with boils <b>would perform</b> the rite of <b>his Paschal offering, and the doctor would perform</b> the rite of <b>his Paschal offering,</b> as neither had come into contact with the limb once it was severed. In any case, as long as it was dangling, the limb did not impart impurity. <b>And I consider that these matters</b> can be derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. If a person’s limb, the impurity of which when amputated is severe, does not impart impurity when it is dangling, it is all the more so logical that an animal’s limb, the impurity of which when amputated is lenient, does not impart impurity when it is dangling.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 1:5): With regard to <b>one who</b> forcefully <b>wipes</b> rainwater from the surface of <b>a leek or squeezes out</b> water absorbed <b>in his hair or in his clothing, the liquid that</b> remains <b>within it is not</b> included <b>under</b> the rubric of the verse: <b>“If</b> water <b>be put</b> upon the seed, and some of their carcass fall on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38). Therefore, it cannot render food susceptible to contracting ritual impurity. <b>But</b> the liquid <b>that is released from it,</b> in this process of wiping or squeezing, <b>is</b> included <b>under</b> the rubric of the verse: <b>“If</b> water <b>be put,”</b> and therefore it renders any food it touches susceptible to ritual impurity, as the person has accorded it significance.
<b>Shmuel says: And the leek itself is rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The reason is that <b>at the moment of</b> the water’s <b>separation</b> from the leek, the leek <b>is rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity by the very water which is released from it.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But we learned</b> in the mishna: A person afflicted with boils <b>would go on Passover eve to</b> the doctor to sever his dangling limb, and the doctor and the afflicted individual would remain pure. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>at the moment of</b> the water’s <b>separation</b> from the leek, the leek <b>is rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, <b>there is also</b> a parallel situation in <b>that</b> case of the <b>dangling limb; at the moment of its separation from the person</b> with boils <b>it should render that person ritually impure.</b>
The Gemara answers: The explanation is <b>as Rav Yosef says</b> in a different context, that it is referring <b>to</b> a situation where the liquids <b>are removed with great force. Here too,</b> in the case of the dangling limb, it can be explained as referring <b>to</b> a situation where the limbs <b>are removed with great force.</b> Since the limb is pulled off in one powerful motion it is not considered to have touched the person after it was detached. By contrast, the water wiped off the leek is not discharged all at once, and therefore as the drops of water separate from the leek they render it susceptible to ritual impurity.
<b>And where,</b> i.e., in connection to which case, <b>was</b> this explanation <b>of Rav Yosef stated?</b> It was stated <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] and one</b> who is <b>ritually impure</b> through contact with <b>a corpse were walking</b> along <b>and rain fell on them, although they squeeze</b> the garments of <b>one another</b> in order to remove the water, those <b>liquids that flow down from the upper section</b> of a garment <b>to the lower section</b> remain <b>pure.</b> They do not become impure from contact with the impure person or his garments, <b>as</b> these liquids <b>are not considered</b> liquids that can become ritually impure <b>unless they have emerged from</b> those garments <b>entirely.</b>
Once the liquids <b>have emerged from</b> those garments <b>entirely they render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, as the people have accorded it significance by squeezing it out of their garments. But the water itself is still not impure, <b>as it is considered</b> liquid that is susceptible to ritual impurity <b>only after it has</b> completely <b>emerged from the body</b> of those garments. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The reason the water does not become impure when it separates from the garment is that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case where <b>it is removed with great force.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Akiva asked</b> Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua: With regard to <b>one who</b> unwittingly <b>slaughters five offerings outside</b> the Temple <b>during one lapse of awareness, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring five sin offerings, one <b>for each and every</b> act of slaughter, <b>or</b> is he liable to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all</b> the acts of slaughter? <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We have not heard</b> a ruling from our teachers in that specific case.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I have heard with regard to one who eats</b> meat <b>from one offering from five</b> different <b>pots</b> in which they were prepared, <b>during one lapse of awareness, that he is liable</b> to bring five guilt offerings, which are <b>for</b> the meat prepared in <b>each and every</b> pot, <b>due to misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And I consider that these matters</b> can be derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If one is liable to bring five guilt offerings for one offering prepared in five pots, all the more so is he liable to bring five sin offerings for slaughtering five offerings outside the Temple.
<b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> It was <b>not that</b> question that <b>Rabbi Akiva asked</b> them. <b>Rather,</b> it was <b>with regard to one who eats <i>notar</i> from five offerings during one lapse of awareness. What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all</b> the offerings from which he ate <i>notar</i>, <b>or</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring five sin offerings, one <b>for each and every one</b> of the offerings from which he ate <i>notar</i>? <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We have not heard</b> a ruling from our teachers in that specific case.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I have heard with regard to one who eats</b> meat <b>from one offering</b> that was prepared <b>in five</b> different <b>pots, during one lapse of awareness, that he is liable</b> to bring separate guilt offerings <b>for</b> the meat prepared in <b>each and every</b> pot, <b>due to misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And I consider that these matters</b> can be derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If one is liable to bring five guilt offerings for one offering prepared in five pots, all the more so is he liable to bring five sin offerings for eating the <i>notar</i> of five separate offerings.
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>If</b> you are reporting <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> that you received from your teachers with regard to one who eats <i>notar</i> from five offerings, <b>we will accept</b> it, but <b>if</b> it is based merely <b>on</b> the <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> from misuse of consecrated property, <b>there is a response</b> that refutes the inference. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>Respond.</b>
Rabbi Akiva <b>said: And no;</b> one cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> of <i>notar</i> through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference from misuse of consecrated property: <b>If you said with regard to misuse</b> of consecrated property that one is liable to bring five guilt offerings, perhaps that is because there are additional stringent elements unique to misuse. <b>As, with regard to</b> misuse, the Torah <b>established</b> that the status of <b>one who feeds</b> another person sacrificial meat is <b>like</b> that of <b>one who eats</b> sacrificial meat, <b>and</b> the status of <b>one who gives benefit</b> to another from consecrated property that is not food is <b>like</b> that of <b>one who derives benefit</b> himself, in that each is liable to bring a guilt offering for misuse.
In addition, the Torah <b>joined the misuse</b> of consecrated property that was performed <b>over an extended period,</b> i.e., if one derived benefit worth half a <i>peruta</i> one day and half a <i>peruta</i> the next, he is liable to bring a guilt offering for misuse. <b>Would you say</b> the same <b>with regard to <i>notar</i>, which has none of these</b> <i>halakhot</i>?
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>difficult for Rabbi Shimon</b> with the first version of Rabbi Akiva’s question, that he insists that Rabbi Akiva had asked about one who eats <i>notar</i> from five offerings? The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what is <b>difficult for him:</b> If Rabbi Akiva asked about one who unwittingly sins by slaughtering, why is the answer derived from an unwitting sin involving eating? After all, <b>what proof</b> can be cited <b>for</b> a case of <b>one who slaughters from</b> a case of <b>one who eats? What</b> is notable <b>about one who eats?</b> It is notable <b>in that he derives benefit</b> from the act of eating, whereas one who slaughters does not derive physical benefit.
<b>Rather, he</b> must have <b>asked him this:</b> In the case of <b>one who eats <i>notar</i> from five offerings during one lapse of awareness, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of the offerings, <b>or</b> only <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all of them? They said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We have not heard</b> a ruling from our teachers in that specific case.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I have heard with regard to one who eats</b> meat <b>from one offering from five</b> different <b>pots, during one lapse of awareness, that</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate guilt offering <b>for</b> the meat prepared in <b>each and every</b> pot, <b>due to misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And I consider that these matters</b> may be derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> one who eats <b>from one offering</b> prepared in five pots, <b>in</b> which case the different parts of the offering do <b>not</b> come from <b>differentiated physical entities,</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate guilt offering <b>for</b> the food prepared in <b>each and every</b> pot <b>because</b> he ate from <b>differentiated pots,</b> with regard to one who eats <i>notar</i> from <b>five</b> separate <b>offerings, which</b> are <b>differentiated physical entities,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> logical that he is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each and every offering?
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> It was <b>not that</b> question that Rabbi Akiva <b>asked</b> them. <b>Rather,</b> it was <b>with regard to one who eats <i>notar</i> from five offerings during one lapse of awareness. What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all</b> the offerings from which he ate <i>notar</i>, <b>or</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring five sin offerings, one <b>for each and every one</b> of the offerings from which he ate <i>notar</i>? <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We have not heard</b> a ruling from our teachers in that specific case.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I have heard with regard to one who eats</b> meat <b>from one offering from five</b> different <b>pots</b> in which it was prepared, <b>that he is liable</b> to bring a separate guilt offering <b>for</b> the meat prepared in <b>each and every</b> pot, <b>due to misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And I consider that these matters</b> may be derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>If</b> you are reporting <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> that you received from your teachers with regard to one who eats <i>notar</i> from five offerings <b>we will accept</b> it, but if it is based on the <i>a fortiori</i> logical inference from misuse of consecrated property there is a response that refutes the inference.
The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rabbi Yehoshua accept that refutation from Rabbi Akiva or not?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof in this regard, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>ate five pieces of <i>notar</i> from one offering during one lapse of awareness,</b> and the pieces were cooked <b>in five</b> different <b>pots, he brings only one sin offering. And in</b> a situation where it is <b>not known</b> to him with certainty whether he unwittingly ate <b>from them, he brings only one provisional guilt offering,</b> which is sacrificed by one who is uncertain whether he committed a sin that renders him liable to bring a sin offering.
By contrast, if one ate <i>notar</i> from a single offering <b>from five</b> different <b>pots during five</b> separate <b>lapses of awareness he brings a sin offering for each and every one, and in</b> a situation where it is <b>not known</b> to him with certainty whether he unwittingly ate <b>from them he brings a provisional guilt offering for each and every one.</b> If he ate <i>notar</i> <b>from five</b> separate <b>offerings during one lapse of awareness</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering for each one, as he ate from differentiated physical entities.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Even</b> if he <b>ate five pieces</b> of <i>notar</i> <b>from five</b> separate <b>offerings during one lapse of awareness he brings only one sin offering,</b> as he transgressed one prohibition repeatedly during a single lapse of awareness. <b>And</b> if he is <b>uncertain</b> whether he unwittingly ate from <b>them</b> he <b>brings only a single provisional guilt offering. The principle of the matter</b> is that in <b>any</b> situation <b>where</b> one’s transgressions are <b>differentiated with regard to sin offerings,</b> i.e., when he is liable to bring multiple sin offerings if he knows that he unwittingly transgressed, <b>they are differentiated with regard to</b> provisional <b>guilt offerings</b> if he is unsure whether he unwittingly transgressed.
If one <b>ate five pieces</b> of meat prepared <b>in five</b> separate <b>pots from a single offering before</b> the meat became permitted for consumption through the <b>sprinkling of the blood</b> on the altar, <b>even</b> if this occurred <b>during a single lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate guilt offering <b>for</b> the meat from <b>each and every</b> pot, <b>due to misuse</b> of consecrated property.

Daf 16a

The Gemara notes: <b>And yet</b> in the final case in the <i>baraita</i>, it <b>does not teach</b> that <b>in</b> a situation where he is <b>uncertain</b> whether he ate from <b>it he brings a provisional guilt offering. Whose</b> opinion is <b>this? If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, let him also teach</b> in <b>the last clause: For</b> a case where he is <b>uncertain</b> whether he ate from <b>them he brings a provisional guilt offering, as we learned</b> in the mishna (22b) that <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for uncertainty</b> about <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.
<b>Rather, isn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva and holds that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertainty about misuse of consecrated property? <b>And it teaches</b> that one who eats <i>notar</i> from one offering cooked in five pots <b>during five</b> separate <b>lapses of awareness brings five sin offerings,</b> which indicates that if he did so during a single lapse of awareness he would be liable to bring only one sin offering, in accordance with the opinion stated by Rabbi Akiva in the mishna. <b>And</b> one can <b>conclude from</b> here that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>accepted</b> the refutation <b>from</b> Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara responds: <b>But on the contrary,</b> one can infer otherwise <b>from the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches:</b> If he ate <b>from five</b> separate <b>offerings, even during one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one.</b> One can <b>conclude from</b> this statement that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not accept</b> the refutation <b>from</b> Rabbi Akiva.
<b>Rather, what is there to say</b> about this <i>baraita</i>? It must be said that <b>it is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, that there is a <i>tanna</i></b> who maintains <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>accepted</b> Rabbi Akiva’s refutation, <b>and there is a <i>tanna</i></b> who maintains <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not accept it.</b>
But once the <i>baraita</i> is interpreted in accordance with two different <i>tanna’im</i>, <b>you</b> may <b>even say</b> that the earlier clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> and not Rabbi Yehoshua. <b>And this <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Akiva <b>in one</b> matter <b>and disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>in one</b> matter: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Akiva <b>with regard to a lapse of awareness,</b> that if one eats from five offerings during a single lapse of awareness he is liable to bring only one sin offering. <b>But he disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to misuse</b> of consecrated property, as he does not deem one liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertainty about whether he misused consecrated property.
§ The mishna teaches that if one eats five pieces from a single offering, each of which was cooked in a separate pot, he is liable to bring five guilt offerings for misuse of consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> which require <b>five</b> guilt offerings for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property? <b>Shmuel says:</b> The five pieces must be from separate parts of the offering, <b>like that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 15b) with regard to a different topic: <b>Five items from a burnt offering combine</b> to form an olive-bulk that renders one liable for sacrificing an offering outside the Temple: <b>The meat, and the</b> forbidden <b>fat, and the wine</b> from the libations of the burnt offering, <b>and the fine flour</b> from the meal offering brought with the libations, <b>and the oil</b> for mixing with the meal offering.
<b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> The obligation to bring five guilt offerings applies in a case <b>where he ate from five</b> different <b>limbs</b> of one offering. <b>Reish Lakish says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that he ate <b>from one limb,</b> and <b>you find</b> this <b>in</b> a case where he ate from <b>the shoulder</b> of an offering, which has several different sections. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says:</b> It applies in a case <b>where he ate</b> pieces of meat prepared <b>as five</b> different <b>types of cooked dishes. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It applies in a case <b>where he ate</b> five pieces of meat that had <b>five</b> different <b>flavors,</b> as they were prepared with different types of seasonings.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Akiva said: I asked Rabbi Eliezer with regard to</b> one who <b>performs multiple</b> prohibited <b>labors on several <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> and all those labors were <b>subsumed</b> as subcategories of <b>one</b> primary category of prohibited <b>labor,</b> and he performed them <b>during one lapse of awareness. What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for</b> unwitting performance of <b>all</b> these labors <b>or</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for</b> violation of <b>each and every one</b> of the labors?
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: He is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for</b> violation of <b>each and every one</b> of the labors, and this is derived <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>a menstruating woman, with regard to whom there are not multiple</b> actions that <b>result</b> in transgression <b>and</b> that result in <b>multiple sin offerings,</b> but rather only the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with her, and nevertheless <b>one</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one</b> of his acts of unwitting intercourse; in the case of <b>Shabbat, with regard to which there are multiple</b> primary categories and subcategories of labor that <b>result</b> in transgression <b>and</b> that result in <b>multiple death</b> penalties or sin offerings, <b>is it not right that he will be liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for</b> performance of <b>each and every one</b> of the prohibited labors?
Rabbi Akiva continues: <b>I said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer that the inference is not valid: <b>If you said</b> one is liable to bring multiple sin offerings <b>in the</b> case of <b>a menstruating woman, with regard to whom there are two prohibitions, as</b> the man <b>is prohibited</b> from engaging in intercourse <b>with the menstruating woman and the menstruating woman is prohibited</b> from engaging in intercourse <b>with him, would you say</b> the same <b>in the</b> case of <b>Shabbat, with regard to which there is only one prohibition?</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to me:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who engages in intercourse with minor</b> menstruating <b>girls will prove</b> this refutation is not valid, <b>as in</b> that case <b>there is only one prohibition,</b> because the minor is exempt from the mitzvot, <b>and</b> nevertheless the man is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> intercourse for <b>each and every one</b> of the acts of intercourse.
Rabbi Akiva said: <b>I said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer that the cases of Shabbat and minor menstruating girls are not comparable. <b>If you said in the</b> case of <b>minor girls that although it is not</b> prohibited <b>for them at present it is</b> prohibited <b>for them after</b> the passage of <b>time,</b> when they reach majority, <b>would you say</b> the same <b>in the</b> case of <b>Shabbat, with regard to which there are neither</b> two prohibitions <b>at present, nor</b> will there be <b>after</b> the passage of <b>time?</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to me:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who copulates with an animal will prove</b> this refutation is not valid, as there are never two prohibitions in that case, and nevertheless the person is liable to bring a sin offering for each and every act. Rabbi Akiva said: <b>I said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer that no proof can be cited from the case of an animal, as in my opinion the case of <b>the animal is like</b> that of <b>Shabbat;</b> there is uncertainty with regard to both cases.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> precise <b>dilemma</b> did Rabbi Akiva <b>raise</b> before Rabbi Eliezer? <b>If he raised a dilemma</b> about <b>whether</b> different <b><i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable to</b> separate <b>entities or not,</b> i.e., if performing one labor on several <i>Shabbatot</i> during one lapse of awareness is similar to engaging in intercourse with multiple menstruating women during one lapse of awareness, <b>let him raise</b> the <b>dilemma</b> as follows: If <b>one performs one</b> prohibited <b>labor on</b> each of <b>several <i>Shabbatot</i></b> during a single lapse of awareness, what is the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps <b>he raised a dilemma</b> about <b>whether</b> different <b>subcategories of</b> a single prohibited <b>labor are comparable</b> to different <b>primary categories,</b> which would mean one is liable separately for each, <b>or not.</b> But if so, <b>let him ask raise</b> the <b>dilemma</b> in the following manner: In the case of <b>one who performs multiple</b> prohibited <b>labors,</b> all <b>subsumed</b> as subcategories of <b>one</b> primary category of <b>labor, on</b> a single <b>Shabbat,</b> during a single lapse of awareness, what is the <i>halakha</i>? Why did Rabbi Akiva specify a case of one who performed multiple prohibited labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i>?
<b>Rava said: They say</b> in <b>the school of Rav [<i>bei Rav</i>]</b> that Rabbi Akiva <b>raised two dilemmas before him: He raised a dilemma</b> about <b>whether <i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities or whether</b> they are <b>not</b> comparable to separate entities, and he also raised a dilemma about whether different <b>subcategories of</b> a single prohibited <b>labor are comparable</b> to different primary categories of <b>labor,</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>not.</b> Rabbi Eliezer answered that multiple <i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable to separate entities, and that one who performs different subcategories of a single category of prohibited labor is like one who performs multiple primary categories of labor.
The Gemara raises another question with regard to the mishna: <b>And</b> in connection to the performance of the same category of prohibited labor on each of several <b><i>Shabbatot</i></b> during a single lapse of awareness, <b>what</b> is the precise case about which Rabbi Akiva <b>raises</b> his <b>dilemma?</b> If the individual was <b>unwitting</b> in that he was unaware that it was <b>Shabbat but</b> acted <b>intentionally</b> with regard to the prohibited <b>labors,</b> i.e., he knew that these labors are prohibited on Shabbat, perhaps it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>that</b> the <b>intervening days</b> constitute <b>an awareness</b> of his sin, which serves <b>to differentiate</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i> and render the individual liable to bring separate sin offerings for each Shabbat.
<b>And</b> if so, <b>it is</b> in reference to a case where the individual acts <b>intentionally</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> i.e., he knows that it is Shabbat, <b>but</b> he acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know that the prohibited <b>labors</b> he is performing are prohibited on Shabbat, <b>that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>raises</b> his <b>dilemma.</b> His dilemma is <b>whether</b> the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities,</b> which would mean that he is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each Shabbat, or <b>whether</b> they are <b>not</b> comparable to separate entities and therefore he is liable to bring only one sin offering.
<b>Or perhaps</b> in the case where he acts <b>intentionally</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> with regard to prohibited <b>labors,</b> it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>that</b> the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities</b> and he is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each Shabbat. <b>And</b> it is in reference to a case where he acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know it is <b>Shabbat, but</b> he acts <b>intentionally</b> in that he knows that the <b>labors</b> he is performing are prohibited on Shabbat, <b>that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>raises</b> his <b>dilemma.</b> His dilemma is whether the <b>intervening days</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>are</b> considered <b>awareness</b> of his sin, which would serve <b>to differentiate</b> between one sin and the next, <b>or not.</b>
<b>Rabba said:</b>

Daf 16b

<b>It stands to reason,</b> based on a proof from a mishna, to say that in a case where he acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know that it is <b>Shabbat, and intentionally</b> in that he knows that the <b>labors</b> he is performing are prohibited on Shabbat, it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>that</b> the <b>intervening days</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>are</b> considered <b>awareness</b> of his sin, which would serve <b>to differentiate</b> between one sin and the next. <b>And it is</b> in reference to a case where he acts <b>intentionally</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> with regard to prohibited <b>labors that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>raises his dilemma,</b> which is about whether the <i>Shabbatot</i> are <b>comparable</b> to separate <b>entities or not.</b>
<b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>resolved</b> his dilemma <b>for him</b> by stating <b>that</b> in a case where he acts <b>intentionally</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> with regard to prohibited <b>labors,</b> the <i>Shabbatot</i> are <b>comparable</b> to separate <b>entities. But</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>did not accept</b> this resolution <b>from him. And</b> with regard to Rabbi Akiva’s other dilemma, Rabbi Eliezer <b>resolved</b> it <b>for him</b> by stating <b>that subcategories of labors</b> are <b>comparable</b> to primary categories of <b>labor,</b> and one is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each act. <b>But</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>did not accept</b> this resolution <b>from him</b> either.
<b>Rabba said: From where do I say this? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 67b): The Sages <b>stated a significant principle with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who forgets the essence of Shabbat,</b> i.e., one who is entirely ignorant that labor is prohibited on Shabbat, <b>and</b> he <b>performed multiple</b> prohibited <b>labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i>, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, as there is only a single, comprehensive lapse of awareness.
With regard to <b>one who knows the essence of</b> the prohibition against labor on <b>Shabbat, and</b> he <b>performed multiple</b> prohibited <b>labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i></b> because he was unaware that those days were Shabbat, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every Shabbat,</b> as the intervening days are considered awareness which differentiates between the <i>Shabbatot</i>. <b>One who is aware that</b> the day <b>is Shabbat and performed multiple</b> prohibited <b>labors,</b> which he did not know were prohibited, <b>on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every primary category of labor</b> that he performed.
Rabba comments: <b>But</b> in the latter case, the mishna <b>does not teach</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each</b> act of <b>a primary category of labor</b> that he performed <b>on each and every Shabbat.</b> He is liable to bring one sin offering for each primary category of labor, despite the fact that he performed the act on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i>. This indicates that the different <i>Shabbatot</i> are not considered separate entities.
<b>Whose</b> opinion is <b>this? If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, say the last clause</b> of that mishna: <b>One who performs multiple</b> prohibited <b>labors subsumed,</b> as subcategories, under <b>one</b> primary category of prohibited <b>labor</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering. <b>And if</b> this were the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> it should state: He is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each of</b> the different <b>subcategories of labors as</b> though they were separate primary categories of <b>labor.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. And</b> you can <b>learn from</b> the mishna that when one acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he did not know it was <b>Shabbat and</b> he acts <b>intentionally</b> in that he knows that these <b>labors</b> are prohibited on Shabbat, it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>that</b> the <b>intervening days are</b> considered <b>awareness</b> of his sin, which serves <b>to differentiate</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i> and render the individual liable to bring separate sin offerings for each Shabbat. It is for this reason that the mishna states that if one performs multiple labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i> because he was unaware that it was Shabbat, he is liable to bring a sin offering for each Shabbat.
Consequently, it is clear that <b>it is</b> in a case where one acted <b>intentionally</b> in that he knew it was <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> in that he did not know that the acts he was performing were prohibited <b>labor, that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>raises his dilemma,</b> as he is uncertain about <b>whether</b> the <i>Shabbatot</i> are <b>comparable</b> to separate <b>entities. And</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>resolved</b> the dilemma <b>for him</b> by stating that the different <i>Shabbatot</i> are <b>comparable</b> to separate <b>entities,</b> and different <b>subcategories of labors are comparable</b> to primary categories of <b>labor,</b> and therefore one is liable for each act. <b>And</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>did not accept either of these</b> resolutions <b>from</b> Rabbi Eliezer.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: You cannot prove your claim from the mishna. <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that in a case where one acts <b>intentionally</b> in that he knows it is <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> in that he does not know that his actions are prohibited <b>labors,</b> it is <b>obvious to Rabbi Akiva that <i>Shabbatot</i> are not comparable</b> to separate <b>entities,</b> as it can be inferred from the latter clause of this mishna that one is not liable to bring a separate sin offering for each primary category of labor performed on each individual Shabbat. <b>And it is</b> in reference to a case where one acted <b>unwittingly</b> in that he did not know it was <b>Shabbat and intentionally</b> in that he knew his actions are prohibited <b>labors, that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>raises his dilemma to</b> Rabbi Eliezer. The dilemma is whether the <b>intervening days are</b> considered <b>awareness to differentiate</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>or not.</b>
<b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>resolved</b> the dilemma <b>for him</b> by stating <b>that</b> the <b>intervening days</b> are considered awareness <b>to differentiate</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i>. <b>And</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>accepted</b> this resolution <b>from him,</b> due the ruling of the mishna that one who knows the essence of the prohibition against labor on Shabbat and performs multiple prohibited labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i> is liable to bring a sin offering for each and every Shabbat. <b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer also <b>resolved</b> his other dilemma <b>for him</b> by stating that <b>subcategories of labors are comparable</b> to primary categories of <b>labor</b> and one is liable for each act, <b>but</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>did not accept</b> this resolution <b>from him.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> In a case where one acts <b>intentionally</b> in that he knows it is <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> in that he does not know that his actions are prohibited <b>labors, even Rabbi Akiva holds that</b> the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities; and when he raises the dilemma</b> to Rabbi Eliezer, <b>it is</b> in reference to a case where one acted <b>unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat and intentionally</b> with regard to prohibited <b>labor. And he raises the dilemma</b> in order to clarify whether or not the <b>intervening days are</b> considered <b>awareness to differentiate.</b>
<b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>resolved</b> the dilemma <b>for him</b> by stating that the <b>intervening days are</b> considered <b>awareness to differentiate</b> the transgressions, <b>and</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>accepted</b> this resolution <b>from him.</b> This is in accordance with the mishna in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> (67b) cited earlier, that one who knows the essence of the prohibition against labor on Shabbat and performed multiple prohibited labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i> is liable to bring a sin offering for each and every Shabbat.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer also <b>resolved</b> Rabbi Akiva’s other dilemma <b>for him</b> by stating <b>that</b> different <b>subcategories of</b> prohibited <b>labors</b> are <b>comparable</b> to primary categories of <b>labor</b> and one is liable for each one separately. <b>But</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>did not accept</b> this resolution <b>from him,</b> due to the final clause of that mishna, which states that one who performs multiple prohibited labors that are subsumed as subcategories under one primary category of prohibited labor is liable to bring only one sin offering.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: From where do I say</b> that according to Rabbi Akiva each Shabbat is considered a separate entity? This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who writes two letters</b> on Shabbat <b>during one lapse of awareness</b> is <b>liable,</b> as writing two letters renders one liable for performing the prohibited labor of writing. If he does so <b>in two</b> separate <b>lapses of awareness,</b> e.g., he wrote one letter without realizing it was Shabbat, then became aware that it was Shabbat, and then again became unaware it was Shabbat and wrote a second letter, <b>Rabban Gamliel deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt. And Rabban Gamliel concedes that if he wrote one letter on this Shabbat and one letter on another Shabbat</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>a different</b> <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who writes two letters on two <i>Shabbatot</i>, one on this Shabbat and one on that Shabbat, Rabban Gamliel deems</b> him <b>liable and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b> Rav Ḥisda explains: It <b>enters your mind that Rabban Gamliel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>as I say</b> that in a case where one acts <b>intentionally</b> in that he knows it is <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> in that he does not know his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors, even Rabbi Akiva says that</b> the <b><i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities.</b> Consequently, <b>that which is taught</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that Rabban Gamliel concedes that if one wrote one letter on Shabbat and another letter the following Shabbat he is <b>exempt,</b> can be interpreted as referring <b>to</b> a case where one acts <b>intentionally</b> in that he knows it is <b>Shabbat but unwittingly</b> in that he does not know his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors. Since</b> separate <b><i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities,</b> the two acts do not combine to form the minimal act of writing that would render one liable to bring a sin offering.

Daf 17a

<b>And that which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that Rabban Gamliel deems a person <b>liable</b> if he wrote two letters over two <i>Shabbatot</i>, can also be explained: It is referring to a case <b>where</b> he acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know it is <b>Shabbat, and intentionally</b> in that he knows his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors.</b> In such a situation he deems an individual liable despite the fact <b>that</b> different <b><i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities, as he holds</b> that although the intervening days are generally considered awareness of his transgression, <b>there is no awareness for a half-measure.</b> Since he performed only half the prohibited labor on the first Shabbat, he is not considered to have become aware of his transgression on the intervening days.
<b>But according to Rava, who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and presumably also Rabban Gamliel, <b>holds that</b> separate <b><i>Shabbatot</i> are</b> considered <b>as one</b> single <b>entity,</b> how can both <i>baraitot</i> be explained?
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, that which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that Rabban Gamliel deems one who writes a letter on each of two <i>Shabbatot</i> to be <b>liable,</b> is understandable. <b>You</b> can <b>find both</b> a case <b>where</b> one acted <b>intentionally</b> in that he knew it was <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> in that he did not know his actions constituted prohibited <b>labors, as</b> he holds that <b><i>Shabbatot</i> are</b> considered <b>as one</b> single <b>entity, and</b> a case <b>where</b> he acted <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know it is <b>Shabbat and intentionally</b> in that he knows his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors.</b> The reason in the second case is <b>that he holds there is no awareness for a half-measure,</b> and therefore the actions on the two <i>Shabbatot</i> are considered to have taken place during one lapse of awareness.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that one who writes a letter on each of two <i>Shabbatot</i> is <b>exempt, in what</b> case <b>can you interpret it,</b> i.e., in what circumstances would this ever apply? This ruling does <b>not</b> apply <b>in this</b> case, where he is aware that it is Shabbat but unaware that his action constitutes a prohibited labor, because Rabbi Akiva, and presumably Rabban Gamliel, maintains that each Shabbat is considered a single entity and therefore it is considered as though he wrote two letters on one Shabbat, and he is liable. <b>And</b> this ruling also does <b>not</b> apply <b>in that</b> case, where one is unaware that it is Shabbat and aware that his action constitutes a prohibited labor, because Rabban Gamliel maintains there is no awareness for a half-measure. Consequently, the two letters are considered to have been written in one lapse of awareness.
The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says: <i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities,</b> and therefore an individual who wrote one letter on one Shabbat and another letter on a different Shabbat is exempt.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: And Rabban Gamliel concedes</b> to the Rabbis that if he wrote one letter on one Shabbat and one more letter on a different Shabbat he is exempt, it can be derived <b>by inference that they disagree about another</b> <i>halakha</i>. <b>Granted, if you say</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the opinion of the Rabbis is that of Rabbi Akiva, <b>this is</b> referring to the fact <b>that they disagree</b> in the other <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the case where one acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know it is <b>Shabbat and intentionally</b> in that he knows his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors, as Rabban Gamliel holds</b> that although the intervening days are considered awareness to differentiate between the <i>Shabbatot</i>, <b>there is no awareness for a half-measure,</b> and therefore he is liable.
<b>And Rabban Gamliel concedes</b> to Rabbi Akiva <b>in</b> a case where one acts <b>intentionally</b> in that he knows it is <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> in that he does not know his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors, that he is exempt. Evidently,</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that <b><i>Shabbatot</i> are comparable</b> to separate <b>entities,</b> and therefore the letters written on different <i>Shabbatot</i> do not combine, which is why he is exempt. <b>But if you say Rabban Gamliel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> and from the fact that one <i>baraita</i> states that Rabban Gamliel concedes that he is exempt it can be derived <b>by inference that they disagree</b> about another similar <i>halakha</i>, this raises the question: <b>About what</b> case do they disagree?
<b>If</b> you suggest that they disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where one acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know it is <b>Shabbat and intentionally</b> in that he knows his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors,</b> then that cannot be correct. After all, <b>even Rabbi Eliezer holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel that there is no awareness for a half-measure, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who writes two letters on two</b> separate <b><i>Shabbatot</i>, one letter on this Shabbat and one letter on that Shabbat, Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable.</b>
<b>But rather,</b> you might suggest that Rabban Gamliel’s concession that he is exempt is referring to a disagreement <b>with regard to</b> adding <b>one</b> thread <b>to</b> a preexisting <b>woven fabric.</b> If one weaves three threads together he has violated the prohibited labor of weaving on Shabbat. It might be suggested that if one adds a single thread to a preexisting woven fabric, Rabban Gamliel would deem him liable whereas Rabbi Eliezer would deem him exempt. And yet Rabban Gamliel concedes that if one writes one letter next to a letter written on the previous Shabbat he is exempt. This suggestion is also difficult, as Rabbi Eliezer <b>deems</b> one <b>liable</b> in the case of adding a single thread, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 105a) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who weaves three threads at the beginning</b> of a new fabric, <b>or</b> adds <b>one</b> thread <b>to</b> a preexisting <b>woven fabric,</b> is <b>liable.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> When it was derived <b>by inference that</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>disagrees about one</b> other <i>halakha</i>, that disagreement is referring to the following case, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One who <b>carried out half of a dried fig</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>and then carried out</b> another <b>half of a dried fig, in one lapse of awareness,</b> is <b>liable;</b> if he carried them out <b>in two lapses of awareness</b> he is <b>exempt. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Even in a case where this occurred <b>in one lapse of awareness,</b> if they were both carried <b>to one</b> public <b>domain</b> he is <b>liable;</b> but if they were carried <b>to two</b> public <b>domains</b> that are separated from each other he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>As</b> in such a case, <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who says that the separate domains do not cause the two acts to be considered separate; therefore, as he carried out a full dried fig, which is the minimum measure for the prohibited labor of carrying from one domain to another, he is liable. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who says the separate domains cause the acts to be considered separate, and he is exempt. Another <i>baraita</i> then states that although Rabban Gamliel maintains that the separate domains do not cause the two acts to be considered separate, he concedes that individual <i>Shabbatot</i> are considered separate entities, and therefore writing two letters on two different <i>Shabbatot</i> is considered two separate acts and the individual is exempt.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for Rav Ḥisda’s opinion from the mishna: Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: He is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for</b> violation of <b>each and every one</b> of the labors, and this is derived <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>a menstruating woman, with regard to whom there are not multiple</b> actions that <b>result</b> in multiple sin offerings, one is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each act of unwitting intercourse; in the case of Shabbat, with regard to which there are multiple primary categories and subcategories of labor, is it not right that one will be liable to bring a sin offering for each prohibited labor?
<b>Granted, according to Rav Ḥisda, who says</b> that Rabbi Akiva <b>raises</b> his <b>dilemma</b> in reference to a case where one acted <b>unwittingly</b> in that he did not know it was <b>Shabbat and intentionally</b> in that he knew his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors,</b> and the basis of the dilemma was <b>whether</b> the <b>intervening days are</b> considered <b>awareness to differentiate</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>or not, that is</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> in the singular; in order to indicate that just as in the case of a menstruating woman one is liable for each act of intercourse due to the intervening days, so too with regard to Shabbat.
<b>But according to Rava, who says it was</b> in reference to a case where one acted <b>intentionally</b> in that he knew it was <b>Shabbat and unwittingly</b> in that he did not know his actions constituted prohibited <b>labors that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>raises</b> his <b>dilemma,</b> and the basis of the dilemma was <b>whether <i>Shabbatot</i></b> are <b>comparable to</b> separate <b>entities or not, let</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> with the plural phrase: <b>Menstruating women.</b> This would indicate that just as a man who engages in intercourse with five different menstruating women is liable to bring a sin offering for his transgression with each woman, as they are separate entities, the same applies to <i>Shabbatot</i>, which are also separate entities.
The Gemara responds that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you:</b> Indeed, <b>teach</b> the mishna with the plural term <b>menstruating women.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>Shmuel teaches</b> the mishna with the singular term <b>menstruating woman,</b> and <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava teaches</b> the mishna with the term <b>menstruating woman;</b> but <b>Rav Natan bar Oshaya says: Teach</b> the mishna with the plural term <b>menstruating women.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rav Ḥisda, who says: It was</b> in reference to a case where he was <b>unwitting</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat and intentional</b> with regard to prohibited <b>labors that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>raises</b> his <b>dilemma,</b> and the question was <b>whether</b> the <b>intervening days are</b> considered <b>awareness to differentiate</b> between the <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>or not,</b> how could Rabbi Eliezer attempt to resolve the dilemma by a comparison to a menstruating woman? In the case of <b>a menstruating woman, what intervening days apply to her</b> that can <b>be</b> considered <b>awareness</b> of his sin, which serves <b>to differentiate</b> the acts of intercourse into distinct transgressions?
<b>Rava said:</b> This is possible in a case <b>where he</b> unwittingly <b>engaged in intercourse with her</b> while she was menstruating, <b>and</b> then <b>she immersed</b> in a ritual bath and became pure, <b>and</b> then <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood <b>and he engaged in intercourse with her again, and</b> then <b>she immersed</b> and then saw menstrual blood <b>and he engaged in intercourse with her again. As</b> here <b>the immersions</b> which purify her <b>are</b> considered <b>like intervening days.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rava from the continuation of the mishna: Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Akiva: The case of <b>one who engages in intercourse with minor</b> menstruating <b>girls will prove</b> this refutation is not valid. <b>Granted, according to Rava,</b> who says that Rabbi Akiva’s dilemma was about whether <i>Shabbatot</i> are considered separate entities, <b>this</b> is the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>teaches</b> his resolution by using the plural term <b>minor girls,</b> to indicate that just as one is liable to bring a separate sin offering for each girl, as she is a separate entity, the same applies to prohibited labor performed on different <i>Shabbatot</i>.
<b>But according to Rav Ḥisda,</b> who said Rabbi Akiva’s dilemma referred to whether the intervening days are considered awareness to differentiate between the <i>Shabbatot</i>, <b>what</b> is the reason Rabbi Eliezer employed the plural term <b>minor girls?</b> The Gemara answers that the plural term is referring to <b>minor girls in general,</b> i.e., to men who engage in intercourse with minor girls, but it should not be taken to mean that one man engages in intercourse with multiple minor women.
§ The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna,</b> which states that Rabbi Akiva raised a dilemma with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat and Rabbi Eliezer offered a resolution based on the <i>halakhot</i> of a menstruating woman, <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: That is not what Rabbi Akiva asked Rabbi Eliezer. Rather, this is what he asked him:</b> In the case of <b>one who</b> unwittingly <b>engaged in intercourse with his wife</b> while she was <b>menstruating, and then again engaged in intercourse with his wife</b> while she was <b>menstruating, during a single lapse of awareness, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>liable</b> to bring only <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all of the</b> acts of intercourse, <b>or</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every one?</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>liable for each and every one,</b> and this is derived <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as</b> in the case of <b>Shabbat, with regard to which there is only one prohibition because he is prohibited</b> to perform labor <b>on Shabbat but Shabbat is not prohibited with regard to him,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every</b> prohibited labor; in the case of <b>a menstruating woman, with regard to whom there are two prohibitions, as</b> the man <b>is prohibited</b> to engage in intercourse <b>with the menstruating woman and the menstruating woman is prohibited</b> to engage in intercourse <b>with him, is it not right that he</b> should <b>be liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for each and every</b> act of intercourse?
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: No, if you said</b> that one is liable to bring multiple sin offerings <b>in</b> the case of <b>Shabbat, with regard to which there are multiple</b> categories of labor that <b>result in</b> liability to bring <b>multiple sin offerings, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> the same <b>in</b> the case of <b>a menstruating woman, with regard to whom there are not multiple</b> actions that <b>result</b> in <b>multiple</b> transgressions and <b>multiple sin offerings,</b> as there is only the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with her?
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> The case of <b>one who engages in intercourse with</b> five <b>minor</b> menstruating <b>girls will prove</b> it, <b>as with regard to it there are not multiple</b> actions that <b>result in multiple sin offerings, and</b> yet one is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> having engaged in intercourse with <b>each and every one</b> of the girls.
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: No, if you said</b> that one is liable for each one <b>with regard to minors, who</b> are <b>separate entities,</b> shall you also say that he should be liable for each act with regard to one who engages in intercourse five times with his wife while she is menstruating? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> The case of <b>one who copulates with an animal</b> multiple times during a single lapse of awareness <b>will prove</b> that one should be held separately liable for each act, <b>as there are no separate entities, and</b> yet one is <b>liable for each and every</b> act. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him:</b> The case of <b>the animal is like</b> the case of <b>the menstruating woman,</b> and one is liable to bring only one sin offering.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one ate</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one did not eat</b> forbidden <b>fat, or even</b> if <b>one ate</b> forbidden fat and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>there is the measure</b> that determines liability <b>in</b> the piece he ate <b>and uncertainty</b>

Daf 17b

whether <b>there is not</b> the measure that determines liability <b>in</b> the piece he ate, he must bring a provisional guilt offering.
If one has a piece of permitted <b>fat and</b> a piece of forbidden <b>fat before him and he ate one of them and he does not know which of them he ate;</b> or if <b>his wife and his sister</b> were <b>with him in the house</b> and <b>he unwittingly</b> engaged in intercourse <b>with one of them and he does not know with which of them he unwittingly</b> engaged in intercourse; or if he confused <b>Shabbat and a weekday and he performed labor</b> prohibited on Shabbat <b>on one of</b> the days <b>and he does not know on which of them he performed</b> the labor, in all of those cases he is liable to <b>bring a provisional guilt offering.</b>
<b>Just as</b> in a case <b>where one</b> unknowingly <b>ate</b> a piece of forbidden <b>fat and</b> then another piece of forbidden <b>fat in a single lapse of awareness</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one sin offering, so too, in</b> a case where their status is <b>unknown</b> to him and he ate them both unwittingly during a single lapse in awareness, he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one provisional guilt offering.</b>
But <b>if</b> he <b>had</b> gained <b>knowledge between</b> the first and second instance of eating that there is a possibility the fat might be prohibited, then the <i>halakha</i> is different: <b>Just as he</b> would be liable to <b>bring a sin offering for each and every</b> piece when he gained knowledge of their prohibited status in between each act of consumption, <b>so too,</b> he must <b>bring a provisional guilt offering for each and every</b> instance in which he consumed food that might be forbidden after learning of their uncertain status in between each unwitting act of consumption.
<b>Just as</b> in a case <b>where one ate</b> forbidden <b>fat, and blood, and <i>piggul</i>, and <i>notar</i> in one lapse of awareness he is liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every one, so too, with regard</b> to a case where <b>their</b> status is <b>unknown</b> to him and he ate them unwittingly during one lapse of awareness, he must <b>bring a provisional guilt offering for each and every</b> item.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s mention of one who ate a piece of fat whose status was uncertain, it <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: We learned</b> that one is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering in the case of <b>one</b> single <b>piece</b> that is <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>of</b> permitted <b>fat. Ḥiyya bar Rav</b> disagreed and <b>said: We learned</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the case of an uncertainty involving one <b>piece out of two pieces,</b> one of which is forbidden fat and the other permitted fat, but in the case of a single piece, one who consumes it is not liable to bring an offering.
The Gemara inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> matter do Rav Asi and Ḥiyya bar Rav <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: It is stated in a verse discussing the obligation to bring a provisional guilt offering: “And if anyone sin, and do any of the commandments [<i>mitzvot</i>] of the Lord that are not to be done, though does not know it; yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). <b>Rav Asi holds:</b> The <b>tradition</b> of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written <b>is authoritative,</b> and one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the spelling of the words. Therefore, the obligation to bring a provisional guilt offering applies only when there is uncertainty with regard to a single piece, because the word <b>is written</b> as “<b><i>mitzvat</i>,”</b> in the singular form.
<b>And Ḥiyya bar Rav says:</b> The <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative,</b> meaning that one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the pronunciation of the words, even if it diverges from the spelling. Therefore, since <b>we read</b> the word in the plural, as <b><i>mitzvot</i>,</b> the obligation to bring a provisional guilt offering applies only when two pieces are present.
<b>Rav Huna raised an objection to Rav Asi, and some say</b> it was <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav</b> who raised the objection <b>to Rav Asi:</b> The latter clause in the mishna states: If one has a piece of permitted <b>fat and</b> a piece of forbidden <b>fat before him and he ate one of them. What, is it not</b> correct to infer <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna is referring to <b>two pieces</b> that <b>the first clause,</b> which introduces the topic, is <b>also</b> referring to <b>two pieces?</b>
<b>Rav said to them: Do not go after the opposite,</b> i.e., do not cite a proof from a source that could be understood in the reverse manner, <b>as</b> Rav Asi <b>can answer you</b> by claiming that whereas <b>the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to two pieces, the first clause</b> is referring <b>to one piece.</b> The Gemara questions this claim: <b>If so, one can say</b> that once the mishna has taught that the consumption of <b>one piece</b> of fat that might be forbidden <b>renders</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering, does it <b>need to be said</b> that the same applies in a case involving <b>two pieces,</b> where one of them is definitely forbidden? The Gemara answers that the mishna is employing the style: <b>This, and it is unnecessary to say that,</b> i.e., it first teaches the more difficult and novel case, then teaches the easier, more straightforward one.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav, who says</b> that <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna is referring to <b>two pieces, the first clause</b> is <b>also</b> is referring <b>two pieces, why do I</b> need <b>two</b> clauses to teach the same <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that the mishna <b>is explaining</b> itself, as follows: If there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one ate</b> forbidden fat and <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one did not eat</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> he must <b>bring a provisional guilt offering. How so? For example,</b> in a case <b>where there was</b> forbidden <b>fat and</b> permitted <b>fat before him,</b> and he ate one of them.
§ The Gemara cites a series of virtually identical statements attributed to Rav, followed by different rationales for his opinion, after each of which it raises several objections from a <i>baraita</i> or a mishna. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In a case where <b>one had two pieces</b> of fat <b>before him, one of</b> permitted <b>fat and one of</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> if <b>he ate one of them and he does not know which of them he ate,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering. But if there was only <b>one piece</b> before him and there was <b>uncertainty</b> whether it was <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it was <b>of</b> permitted <b>fat, and he ate it,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav?</b> He derives it from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states:</b> “And if anyone sin, <b>and do any of the commandments [<i>mitzvot</i>] of the Lord</b> that are not to be done, <b>though he does not know it;</b> yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 4:22). Rav derives from the plural <i>mitzvot</i> that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering <b>until he is unwitting with regard to</b> one of <b>two</b> items, which in this case is two pieces of fat. The Gemara asks: But isn’t it <b>written “<i>mitzvat</i>,”</b> in the singular form? The Gemara answers: <b>We read</b> it as <b><i>mitzvot</i>,</b> in the plural. In other words, according to Rava, Rav maintains that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both a domesticated animal and a non-domesticated animal, <b>one is obligated to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for</b> eating <b>its</b> fat. The prohibition of forbidden fats applies only to those of a domesticated animal; the corresponding fats are permitted in the case of a non-domesticated animal. Since a <i>koy</i> is of uncertain status, one must bring a provisional guilt offering for eating its fat. Evidently, one is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering even in a case where there was uncertainty involving a single item.
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the <b>tradition</b> of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written <b>is authoritative.</b> Consequently, as the singular form <b>“<i>mitzvat</i>” is written,</b> he maintains that a provisional guilt offering must be brought in a case of uncertainty involving a single item, such as the fat of a <i>koy</i>.
The Gemara <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: If one consummates levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> and seven months later she gives birth, there is <b>uncertainty whether</b> the child <b>is nine</b> months <b>old,</b> i.e., counting from conception, and is the offspring <b>of the first</b> husband, which would mean the levirate bond did not take effect, or <b>whether</b> the child is only <b>seven</b> months <b>old</b> and is the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband, i.e., the <i>yavam</i>, not the deceased, in which case the levirate bond did take effect. In such a situation, due to the possibility that she is forbidden to him as his brother’s wife, <b>he must divorce her. But the offspring is</b> of <b>unflawed</b> lineage, as whether it was born from the first or the second husband, its conception involved no transgression.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And</b> to atone for the possibility that they engaged in forbidden intercourse they are each <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b> This indicates that one is obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering even when the uncertainty involves a single item. The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who, as stated above, maintains that one is obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertainty involving a single item.
The Gemara <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> Rav from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 14a): It is the custom of Jewish women to engage in intercourse with their husbands with two cloths, one for her husband to wipe himself with to see if any of her blood is on him after intercourse, and one for her to check herself to ascertain after intercourse whether her menstrual flow has begun. If after intercourse blood <b>was found on his</b> cloth, the woman and her husband <b>are</b> both <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a menstruating woman and a man who engages in intercourse with her, <b>and they are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering</b> for unwittingly performing an action punishable by <i>karet</i>.
The mishna continues: If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>immediately [<i>otyom</i>]</b> after intercourse, the woman and her husband are likewise <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days <b>and are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering.</b> If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>after time</b> passed, they are both <b>impure due to uncertainty,</b> as it is possible the blood appeared only after intercourse, <b>and they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering. And it is taught with regard to</b> this last case in the mishna: They are each nevertheless <b>liable to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b> The Gemara again answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In a case where <b>one had two pieces</b> of fat <b>before him, one of</b> permitted <b>fat and one of</b> forbidden <b>fat, and he ate one of them and he does not know which of them he ate,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering. But if there was only one <b>piece</b> before him and there was <b>uncertainty</b> whether it was <b>of</b> permitted <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it was <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat, and he ate it,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rav? He holds</b> one is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering only in a case involving <b>two pieces,</b> as <b>it is possible to identify its prohibition.</b> As, an expert might later examine the remaining piece and determine whether or not one ate the prohibited piece. By contrast, in a case of uncertainty involving only <b>one piece, it is impossible to identify its prohibition</b> and ascertain whether one ate a forbidden or permitted piece of fat.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the <b>reason</b> given earlier <b>by Rava</b> for Rav’s ruling and the <b>reason</b> stated here <b>by Rabbi Zeira?</b> The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> them is a case where there were two pieces before a person, one measuring <b>an olive-bulk and</b> the other measuring <b>one-half</b>  of an olive-bulk. Since according to <i>halakha</i> a measure of less than an olive-bulk is of no relevance in such a case, it is considered as though only one piece is present before him.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to Rava,</b> who contends that Rav maintains that the plural vocalization of the Torah is authoritative, this <b>is not</b> a case of uncertainty involving two items, as required by the plural form <b><i>mitzvot</i>, and</b> therefore he is <b>exempt.</b> By contrast, <b>according to Rabbi Zeira,</b> this is a case where <b>it is possible to identify its prohibition</b> by examining the remaining piece, and he is therefore obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised an objection to Rabbi Zeira</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>, one is obligated</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for</b> eating <b>its fat.</b> Evidently, one must bring a provisional guilt offering even in a case where the uncertainty involves only a single item. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds we do not require</b> a case where it is possible <b>to identify its prohibition</b> in order for one to be obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering.

Daf 18a

The Gemara <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Zeira from a <i>baraita</i>: If one consummates a levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> and seven months later she gives birth, there is <b>uncertainty whether</b> the child <b>is nine</b> months <b>old</b> and is the offspring <b>of the first</b> husband, or <b>whether</b> the child is only <b>seven</b> months <b>old</b> and is the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband, i.e., the <i>yavam</i>. In such a case <b>he must divorce her, but the offspring is</b> of <b>unflawed</b> lineage. <b>And</b> to atone for the possibility that they engaged in forbidden intercourse, they are each <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b> The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
The Gemara <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> Rabbi Zeira from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 14a): If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>immediately</b> after intercourse, the woman and her husband <b>are impure</b> for seven days <b>and are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering.</b> If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>after time</b> passed, they are both <b>impure due to uncertainty and they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering. And it is taught with regard to</b> this last case that they are each <b>liable to</b> bring a <b>provisional guilt offering.</b> The Gemara again answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In a case where <b>one had two pieces</b> of fat <b>before him, one of</b> permitted <b>fat and one of</b> forbidden <b>fat, and</b> he <b>ate one of them and he does not know which of them he ate,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering. But if there was only one <b>piece</b> before him and it was <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>of</b> permitted <b>fat, and he ate it,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav? He holds</b> that one is liable in the case of <b>two pieces</b> because the <b>prohibition was established,</b> i.e., there was definitely a prohibited piece before him, and nevertheless he proceeded to eat one of them. By contrast, he is exempt in the case of <b>one</b> uncertain <b>piece,</b> as <b>the prohibition was not established.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the reasoning for Rav’s opinion given by Rav Naḥman, that one is liable in the case of two pieces because the <b>prohibition was established,</b> and the reasoning given by Rabbi Zeira, <b>that</b> if there is one piece <b>it is impossible to identify its prohibition?</b>
The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is in a case <b>where</b> someone <b>had two pieces</b> of fat <b>before him, one of</b> forbidden <b>fat and one of</b> permitted <b>fat. And a gentile came and ate the first piece, and</b> then <b>a Jew came and ate the second</b> piece. <b>According to Rava</b> he is exempt, because <b>at the time when the Jew ate</b> the uncertain piece there was only one piece present, which does <b>not</b> fulfill the requirement of two items, as derived from the word <b><i>mitzvot</i></b> in the verse. <b>According to Rabbi Zeira</b> he is exempt because <b>it is impossible to identify its prohibition,</b> as both pieces are gone. But <b>according to Rav Naḥman</b> he is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering, as the presence of a <b>prohibition was established,</b> i.e., there was definitely a forbidden piece there at one point.
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>, one is obligated to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for</b> eating <b>its fat.</b> Rav Naḥman answered: <b>Rabbi Eliezer does not require the prohibition to be established</b> in order for one to be obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering.
Rava <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i>: If one consummates a levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> and seven months later she gives birth, there is <b>uncertainty whether</b> the child <b>is nine</b> months <b>old</b> and is the offspring <b>of the first</b> husband, or <b>whether</b> the child is only <b>seven</b> months <b>old</b> and is the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband, and therefore <b>he must divorce her; but the offspring is</b> of <b>unflawed</b> lineage. <b>And they are</b> each <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b> Once again, the Gemara responds: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
Rava <b>raised</b> a final <b>objection to</b> Rav Naḥman from a mishna: If blood <b>was found on his</b> cloth, the woman and her husband are both <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days <b>and they are</b> each <b>liable</b> to bring a sin <b>offering.</b> If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>immediately</b> after intercourse, <b>they are impure</b> for seven days <b>and are</b> each <b>liable</b> to bring a sin <b>offering.</b> If it <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>after time</b> passed, they are both <b>impure due to uncertainty and they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering. And</b> it <b>is taught with regard to</b> this last case that they each is <b>liable to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b>
When presented with this last objection, Rav Naḥman <b>was silent</b> and did not reply. <b>After</b> Rava <b>left he said: What is the reason I did not say to him,</b> i.e., I should have said to him, <b>that</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who does not require the prohibition to be established</b> in order for one to be obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one slaughters</b> an animal designated as <b>a provisional guilt offering outside</b> the Temple, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b> Rabbi Meir deems him obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering despite the fact that it is possible the owner of the first provisional guilt offering never violated any transgression and therefore was never obligated to bring his provisional guilt offering. This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Meir it is not necessary for the prohibition to be established for one to be obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> did Rav Naḥman say that he could have responded to Rava’s contradiction by claiming the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>Let him say to him that</b> the mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as was the response to the previous objections. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rav Naḥman <b>is teaching us: That</b> the reason for the ruling of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is that he <b>holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says an established prohibition is not required for one to be obligated in a provisional guilt offering.
§ <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If there was <b>a piece</b> of fat before someone and it was <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>of</b> permitted <b>fat, and he ate it, we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis.</b> In a mishna on 25a, Rabbi Eliezer states that one may bring a voluntary provisional guilt offering whenever he pleases. The Rabbis disagree and maintain that a provisional guilt offering may be brought only in a case of actual uncertainty whether one performed a sin for which he would be liable to bring a sin offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did Rav <b>specifically</b> choose a case <b>where one ate</b> the item of uncertain status in order <b>to</b> exemplify the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer? Even</b> if he had <b>not eaten</b> anything, Rabbi Eliezer would <b>also</b> permit him to bring a provisional guilt offering, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person may volunteer</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering every day.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Rav mentioned a case involving the consumption of an item whose status is uncertain in order to teach the ruling of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Bava ben Buta, as we learned</b> in the mishna: They said about Bava ben Buta that he would volunteer to bring a provisional guilt offering every day except for the day after Yom Kippur, as Yom Kippur atones for all uncertain sins. He said: If they would have allowed me to do so I would have brought a provisional guilt offering even on that day. <b>But they say to him: Wait until you enter into a situation of potential uncertainty.</b> For this reason Rav presents a scenario where an item whose status is uncertain was consumed, in order to allow for the potential uncertainty that would justify bringing a provisional guilt offering.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>one had before him two pieces</b> of fat, <b>one of</b> permitted <b>fat and one of</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> if <b>a Jew came and ate the first</b> piece and then <b>a gentile came and ate the second,</b> the Jew is <b>liable</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering. <b>And the same</b> applies if <b>a dog</b> ate the second piece <b>and the same</b> is true if <b>a raven</b> ate it. But if <b>a gentile came and ate the first</b> piece and then <b>a Jew came and ate the second</b> piece, the Jew is <b>exempt,</b> because at the time that he ate the uncertain piece there was only one item of uncertainty. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering, as he does not maintain that two items are required for one to be obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the Jew <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>unwittingly and the second intentionally,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering for the first piece. But if he ate <b>the first</b> piece <b>intentionally and the second</b> piece <b>unwittingly,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because at the time that he ate the second piece, only one piece was present. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring an offering. If he <b>ate both of them intentionally,</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> bringing <b>anything.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: If two Jews each ate one of <b>two</b> items, each <b>of them unwittingly, each of them is liable</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering, albeit for different reasons. The first is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering in case he ate the forbidden piece. By contrast, <b>the second</b> one is <b>not</b> strictly obligated <b>by law,</b> as he unwittingly ate the uncertain piece when there was no other piece present. <b>Rather,</b> the reason he is obligated is <b>that if you say</b> he is <b>exempt, you have</b> in effect <b>established</b> that <b>the first</b> individual is obligated <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin offering.</b> One might think that the second individual is exempt because he definitely ate the permitted piece, which would mean the first one ate the forbidden piece and he must therefore bring a sin offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in accordance <b>with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, why does the <i>baraita</i> say the second individual is obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering merely as a precaution and not by law? <b>It is certainly by law</b> that the second is obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that one is obligated even for an uncertainty involving a single item. <b>If</b> it is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> can it be correct that merely <b>in order</b> to prevent a misunderstanding and ensure <b>that we do not establish</b> the <b>first</b> one as obligated to bring <b>a sin offering,</b> that <b>we would say to the second</b> individual: <b>Bring</b> and slaughter <b>a non-sacred animal in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b> After all, he is not obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response:

Daf 18b

<b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says a person may volunteer</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering every day. Therefore, we say to</b> the second person: Volunteer and <b>bring a provisional guilt offering,</b> to prevent the first individual from bringing an unwarranted sin offering. <b>And</b> he should <b>stipulate: If</b> the <b>first</b> person <b>ate</b> the piece of permitted <b>fat,</b> that means that <b>he</b> himself <b>ate</b> the forbidden <b>fat</b> and consequently the offering <b>should be an atonement</b> for his own transgression. <b>And if not,</b> i.e., if the first person ate the forbidden fat and he himself committed no transgression, <b>let it be a gift</b> offering.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A person unwittingly <b>ate</b> a piece of fat about which it was <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>forbidden fat</b> or permitted fat, <b>and he was</b> subsequently <b>informed</b> of its questionable status. He then unwittingly ate another piece of fat about which it was <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>forbidden fat</b> or permitted fat, <b>and he was</b> again <b>informed</b> of its questionable status. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>just as he</b> would be liable to <b>bring a sin offering for each and every one</b> if he was later informed that they were all pieces of forbidden fat, <b>so too,</b> in these cases of uncertainty <b>he</b> must <b>bring a provisional guilt offering for each and every one.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda; Rabbi Elazar; and Rabbi Shimon</b> all <b>say:</b> He is obligated to <b>bring only one provisional guilt offering, as it is stated:</b> “And the priest shall make atonement <b>for him concerning the unwitting error which he committed unwittingly</b> and he shall be forgiven” (Leviticus 5:18). It is derived from the verse’s double mention of his unwitting status, for which he is liable to bring one offering, that a person is <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering <b>even for many unwitting sins,</b> despite the fact that he was informed of the uncertainty in between each instance of consumption.
With regard to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Here Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> a principle with regard to the obligation to bring sin offerings for several unwitting transgressions: <b>Knowledge of</b> the questionable status of <b>an uncertain</b> case prior to each subsequent transgression <b>divides</b> them into obligations <b>to</b> bring multiple <b>sin offerings</b> when one later learns that he definitely committed unwitting transgressions. In the case of the <i>baraita</i>, as he was informed prior to each instance of consumption of the uncertain status of the fat he ate before his subsequent consumption of uncertain fat, he is obligated to bring a sin offering for each instance of consumption if he later discovers he actually sinned.
<b>Rava says: Knowledge of uncertainty</b> prior to each possible transgression <b>does not divide</b> them <b>into</b> obligations to bring multiple <b>sin offerings. Rather, this</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is teaching</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as if he had had definite knowledge</b> prior to each instance of consumption that the piece he ate was prohibited before eating each subsequent piece he would have been liable to <b>bring a sin offering for each and every one, so too, if he had knowledge of</b> the <b>uncertain</b> status of the piece he ate before eating each subsequent piece, he is obligated to <b>bring a provisional guilt offering for each and every one.</b> According to Rava, uncertain knowledge does not divide the unwitting transgressions to the extent that one is obligated to bring multiple sin offerings. Only definite knowledge renders one liable to bring multiple sin offerings.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>And you? Do you not hold that knowledge of uncertainty</b> prior to committing each transgression <b>divides</b> them with regard to the obligation <b>to</b> bring <b>sin offerings</b> for each one? <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>knowledge of uncertainty</b> prior to committing each transgression does <b>not divide</b> them <b>with regard to</b> multiple <b>sin offerings, and</b> therefore one <b>brings</b> only <b>one sin offering, why</b> does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rule that he <b>brings a provisional guilt offering for each and every one,</b> when he had knowledge of uncertainty prior to each instance of consumption?
After all, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>principle with regard to</b> the <b>matter</b> is as follows: In <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> separate transgressions are <b>divided for</b> the purpose of determining liability to bring multiple <b>sin offerings,</b> they are also considered <b>divided for</b> the purpose of determining liability to bring multiple provisional <b>guilt offerings</b> in cases of uncertainty. If one does not bring several sin offerings in a case of definite transgression, he is not obligated to bring several provisional guilt offerings in a case of uncertainty either.
<b>Rava bar Ḥanan said to Abaye: And according to you, that you said knowledge of uncertainty</b> prior to each transgression <b>divides</b> them into obligations <b>to</b> bring separate <b>sin offerings, if that is so,</b> what would you say about the following case: Someone <b>ate an olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat before Yom Kippur and</b> another <b>olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat after Yom Kippur.</b> Since <b>Yom Kippur</b> itself <b>stands in place of a provisional guilt offering,</b> i.e., it atones for any prior uncertain transgression, if he later learned that both pieces were in fact forbidden fat, would you say that <b>so too,</b> Yom Kippur divides the two actions and <b>that</b> he is obligated to <b>bring two sin offerings?</b>
<b>But</b> this cannot be correct, as <b>he ate</b> both of <b>them in a single lapse of awareness</b> and there was no knowledge of sin to divide them. Rather, it stands to reason that like Yom Kippur, knowledge of uncertainty does not divide transgressions into multiple sin offering obligations. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava bar Ḥanan: That case in which Yom Kippur occurred in between transgressions is not comparable to having knowledge of uncertainty between each transgression. <b>Who shall say to us that Yom Kippur atones for</b> sins <b>that were unknown to him? Perhaps</b> it atones only for sins <b>that were known to him. Rava said to him</b> in reply: <b>We learned</b> this explicitly in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 2b): Yom Kippur atones for sins whether <b>one became aware</b> of them before Yom Kippur <b>or did not become aware</b> of them.
The Gemara cites another version of the difficulty raised against Abaye’s opinion: <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rava bar Ḥanan said to Abaye:</b> Since Yom Kippur serves to divide the two acts of consumption into two obligations, similar to knowledge of the questionable status of fat according to Abaye, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in the following case: <b>If</b> one <b>ate an olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> on the <b>morning of Yom Kippur and an olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat in</b> the <b>afternoon of Yom Kippur, so too</b> would he <b>be obligated</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings?</b> This cannot be correct, as both olive-bulks were consumed in a single lapse of awareness.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava bar Ḥanan: <b>Who shall say to us that Yom Kippur provides atonement at every hour</b> of the day? <b>Perhaps the entire day</b> as a single unit serves to provide atonement only when it begins, <b>in the evening? Rabba bar bar Ḥana said to him: Fool [<i>terada</i>]! It is taught</b> in a mishna (25a): With regard to <b>one who encountered uncertainty</b> concerning whether he performed <b>a sin on Yom Kippur, even if</b> it was <b>at nightfall</b> at the end of the day, he is <b>exempt, as the entire day atones</b> for uncertain sins.
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin raises</b> another <b>objection</b> to Abaye’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 81a): If <b>one ate and drank</b> unwittingly on Yom Kippur <b>in one lapse of awareness,</b> e.g., he forgot it was Yom Kippur, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one sin offering. But</b> according to Abaye he should be liable to bring two sin offerings, as <b>between</b> the <b>eating and</b> the <b>drinking it is impossible that there was no</b> interval of even a minimal amount of <b>time during the day. That</b> interval of time would allow <b>him to</b> gain <b>knowledge</b> of the possible transgression, <b>and</b> therefore it should serve to <b>atone for him, as Yom Kippur stands in place of a provisional guilt offering. And</b> yet <b>it is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>He is liable</b> to bring <b>only one sin offering.</b>
Rav Idi bar Avin concludes his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>knowledge</b> of <b>uncertainty</b> prior to each possible transgression <b>divides</b> them into obligations <b>to</b> bring separate <b>sin offerings</b> for each one, this lapse of time on Yom Kippur should serve to divide his two transgressions and therefore <b>he should be liable</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>When Rabbi Zeira said</b> that knowledge of uncertainty prior to each unwitting transgression divides them into obligations to bring separate sin offerings, he was clarifying the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. By contrast, <b>this</b> mishna, which indicates that the passage of time on Yom Kippur does not divide transgressions into obligations for separate sin offerings, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, it follows that the first clause is also in accordance with his opinion. This is significant, <b>as</b> that same mishna later <b>teaches</b> (<i>Yoma</i> 81a): If on Yom Kippur one <b>drank</b> the salty <b>liquid</b> in which fish are pickled, <b>or fish brine [<i>morayes</i>],</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> One can infer: <b>But</b> if he drank <b>vinegar</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
<b>And who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna? <b>It is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Vinegar does not revive the spirit,</b> i.e., it does not have the status of a beverage, and therefore one who drinks it on Yom Kippur is exempt. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>vinegar does revive the spirit</b> and is therefore considered like a beverage. <b>And from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>the first clause</b> must <b>also</b> be in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: That is not necessarily so, as one can say <b>the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi whereas <b>the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<b>Rava raised</b> another <b>objection</b> to Abaye from a <i>baraita</i>: One is obligated to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property only if he derived benefit of at least the value of one <i>peruta</i> from the property. If one unwittingly <b>ate</b> from consecrated property <b>today</b> and <b>ate</b> again <b>tomorrow,</b> or if he <b>derived benefit</b> from consecrated property <b>today</b> and again <b>derived benefit tomorrow,</b> or if he <b>ate</b> from the property <b>today</b> and <b>derived benefit</b> from it <b>tomorrow,</b> or if he <b>derived benefit</b> from it <b>today</b> and <b>ate</b> from it <b>tomorrow, even</b> if the time between them was as long as <b>from now until three years</b> later, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that they combine with each other</b> to amount to one <i>peruta</i>-worth of benefit and thereby render him obligated to bring a guilt offering?
The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “If anyone <b>commits a misuse [<i>tim’ol ma’al</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 5:15). The double verb [<i>tim’ol ma’al</i>] <b>extended</b> the obligation to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property to a case where the value of individual instances of misuse at different times amount to a total of one <i>peruta</i>. Rava concludes his objection: <b>But why</b> should that be the <i>halakha</i> according to Abaye, who maintains that knowledge of uncertainty, and similarly the day of Yom Kippur, which has the same effect as a provisional guilt offering, divides his actions into separate entities? When the second misuse occurs after Yom Kippur, <b>isn’t his</b> sin <b>atoned</b> for <b>by Yom Kippur?</b> Since his acts of possible transgression are divided, how can they combine to the value of one <i>peruta</i>?
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>When</b> does <b>Yom Kippur atone</b> for sins? Only <b>with regard to ritual prohibitions.</b> But it does <b>not atone with regard to monetary matters.</b> Misuse of consecrated property entails a monetary obligation to restore the value of the principal with the addition of one-fifth. Since Yom Kippur does not exempt one from the monetary obligation entailed by a sin, the two acts of misuse combine to render one obligated to bring a guilt offering.
The Gemara suggests another answer. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead: <b>When does Yom Kippur atone</b> for sins? It atones for sins only if they were committed <b>in their full measure,</b> but it does <b>not atone for</b> sins that one transgressed only by <b>half of</b> their full <b>measure.</b> Consequently, Yom Kippur does not atone for misuse of consecrated property of the value of less than one <i>peruta</i>, which is why the two acts of misuse combine.
§ The Gemara cites the opinions of other <i>amora’im</i> with regard to this matter. <b>Similarly,</b> like Rabbi Zeira, <b>Reish Lakish says: Here,</b> in his statement in the <i>baraita</i> above, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> that <b>knowledge of uncertain</b> status prior to each possible transgression <b>divides</b> them into separate obligations <b>to</b> bring <b>sin offerings</b> for each one. And like Rava, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagrees and <b>says: Knowledge of uncertainty does not divide</b> them into obligations <b>to</b> bring separate <b>sin offerings.</b>
<b>Rather, this</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is teaching</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as if he had had definite knowledge</b> prior to each instance of unwitting consumption <b>he</b> would <b>bring</b> a sin offering <b>for each and every one, so too, if he had had knowledge of</b> the <b>uncertainty</b> of each piece prior to his subsequent instance of unwitting consumption he would be obligated to <b>bring a provisional guilt offering for each and every one.</b> But knowledge of uncertainty prior to each instance of consumption does not render him obligated to bring multiple sin offerings if he later finds out they were all definitely prohibited.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, this is</b> why the <i>baraita</i> is formulated in a manner that indicates the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a provisional guilt offering is dependent upon</b> the <i>halakhot</i> governing the <b>sin offering.</b> Just as knowledge of an unwitting transgression renders one liable to bring a sin offering, so too, knowledge of uncertainty renders one liable to bring a provisional guilt offering. <b>But according to Reish Lakish,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have taught</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sin offering</b> is <b>dependent upon</b> the knowledge of uncertainty necessary to render one liable to bring a provisional <b>guilt offering,</b> rather than the other way around. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <b>difficult.</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction from</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan to</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and</b> it likewise <b>raises a contradiction from</b> one statement of <b>Reish Lakish to</b> another statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are <b>two paths: one</b> is <b>ritually impure</b> due to a corpse that is buried there <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>ritually pure, and</b> it is unknown which path is which. If an individual <b>walked on the first</b> path <b>and did not</b> yet <b>enter</b> the Temple, <b>and</b> then he walked <b>on the second</b> path <b>and</b> afterward unwittingly <b>entered</b> the Temple, being that he certainly contracted ritual impurity after walking down both paths he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering for entering the Temple in a state of ritual impurity.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If he <b>walked on the first</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering. But if he then walked <b>on the second</b> path <b>and</b> afterward <b>entered</b> the Temple he is <b>obligated</b> to bring a sin offering, as he was definitely impure on one of the occasions that he entered the Temple. If he <b>walked on the first</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, <b>and</b> subsequently went through the process of ritual purification, i.e., he received the <b>sprinkling</b> of the ashes of the red heifer on the third day <b>and again</b> on the seventh day, <b>and immersed, and</b> then <b>walked on the second</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering, as he definitely entered the Temple while ritually impure, either on the first occasion or on the second.

Daf 19a

The <i>baraita</i> continues by citing a dispute concerning Rabbi Shimon’s opinion. <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him from the obligation to bring an offering <b>in this</b> particular case. Since he became pure in between, at no point did he have definite knowledge that he was impure. For one to be liable to bring an offering for entering the Temple in a state of ritual impurity he must have knowledge of the impurity at the beginning and the end, and a lack of knowledge in the middle. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda deems</b> him <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to bring an offering in <b>all of those</b> cases, and he reports this opinion <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon.</b>
Before explaining the contradictions between the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, the Gemara asks a question about Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda’s statement: Can it be that Rabbi Shimon holds that one is exempt <b>even in the first case?</b> Since he walked down both paths prior to entering the Temple, he had definite knowledge of his impure status. <b>Rava said: What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he walked on the first</b> path, <b>and at the time of his walking on the second</b> path <b>he forgot that he</b> had previously <b>walked on the first</b> path. Consequently, the knowledge that would render him liable to bring a sin offering is incomplete. <b>And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> point that they <b>disagree: The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>partial knowledge is considered like</b> full <b>knowledge, and Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>partial knowledge is not considered like</b> full <b>knowledge.</b>
The Gemara returns to discuss the contradictions for which it cited this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> If he <b>walked on the first</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, <b>and</b> then he received the <b>sprinkling</b> of the ashes of the red heifer on the third and seventh days, <b>and immersed, and</b> subsequently <b>walked on the second</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is he <b>liable?</b> After all, <b>he did not have</b> definite <b>knowledge</b> of his ritual impurity each time he entered the Temple. Although it is certain that after walking on the second path he had contracted ritual impurity at some point, as he had been purified in between, there was no specific point at which he had knowledge of definite impurity.
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who does not require knowledge at the outset,</b> before an unwitting transgression, in order to render one liable to bring a sin offering. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that definite knowledge is necessary to render one liable to bring a sin offering, as <b>here they rendered uncertain knowledge like</b> full <b>knowledge.</b>
The Gemara explains the contradiction: <b>It enters your mind</b> to say that Rabbi Yoḥanan meant that <b>here they rendered</b> uncertain knowledge like full knowledge, <b>and the same is true for the entire Torah.</b> Therefore, it is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> above and this statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Here, Rabbi Yoḥanan says that uncertain knowledge is considered like full knowledge, whereas earlier he stated that uncertain knowledge, unlike full knowledge, does not divide separate unwitting transgressions to render one obligated to bring multiple sin offerings.
<b>And</b> likewise it is <b>difficult</b> with regard to the apparent contradiction between the statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> earlier and the statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> here. Reish Lakish previously stated that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that uncertain knowledge divides unwitting transgressions to render one obligated to bring separate sin offerings, whereas here he explains that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, not Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> One can answer that when he said: <b>Here they rendered</b> uncertain knowledge like full knowledge, he meant specifically here, <b>but with regard to the entire Torah</b> it is <b>not</b> considered like full knowledge.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that this particular case is an exception? <b>Here, with regard to ritual impurity, it is written:</b> “Or if anyone touch any impure thing…<b>and it was concealed from him that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). This indicates that even when one has <b>knowledge that has an uncertainty to it, the verse renders</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring an offering. <b>But with regard to</b> the rest of <b>the entire Torah it is written:</b> “If his sin, <b>which he has sinned, be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28). This teaches that <b>it is</b> only <b>if he has</b> full <b>knowledge that he is obligated</b> to bring an offering.
<b>But</b> the contradiction between one statement of Reish Lakish and the other statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> is <b>difficult: Instead of interpreting</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, he should interpret it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what Reish Lakish <b>is teaching us</b> by establishing the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with Rabbi Yishmael: <b>That Rabbi Yishmael also does not require knowledge at the outset,</b> before an unwitting transgression, in order to render one liable to bring a sin offering.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> that is already taught explicitly in <b>a mishna, as we learned</b> (<i>Shevuot</i> 14b) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“It was concealed from him”</b> (Leviticus 5:2–3), <b>twice.</b> One mention of the phrase serves <b>to render one obligated</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> of his state of <b>ritual impurity</b> when he entered the Temple, <b>and</b> the other mention of the phrase teaches that he is obligated to bring a sin offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> during which he forgot that the building he was entering while impure was the <b>Temple.</b> Since this is the same verse that is the source for the requirement of knowledge at the outset, evidently Rabbi Yishmael disagrees with this opinion, as he derives a different <i>halakha</i> from the verse.
The Gemara explains: It <b>was necessary</b> for Reish Lakish to state that Rabbi Yishmael does not require knowledge at the outset, as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> Although Rabbi Yishmael <b>has no verse</b> from which he could derive this requirement, perhaps <b>he has a tradition</b> with regard to the requirement of prior knowledge. By establishing that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, Reish Lakish <b>teaches us</b> conclusively that Rabbi Yishmael does not require knowledge at the outset.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one has pieces of forbidden <b>fat and <i>notar</i> before him and he ate one of them and he does not know which of them he ate;</b> or if <b>his menstruating wife and his sister</b> were <b>with him in the house</b> and <b>he unwittingly</b> engaged in intercourse <b>with one of them and he does not know with which of them he unwittingly</b> engaged in intercourse; or if <b>Shabbat and Yom Kippur</b> occurred adjacent to one another <b>and he performed</b> prohibited <b>labor</b> during the intervening <b>twilight</b> period <b>and he does not know on which of</b> the days <b>he performed</b> the labor, in all of these cases, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the transgressor <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering,</b> as he certainly sinned, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> the transgressor <b>exempt,</b> as he does not know the nature of his sin.
<b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not disagree with regard to one who performs</b> prohibited <b>labor</b> during the intervening <b>twilight</b> period because they concur <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt, as I say: He performed part</b> of the labor <b>today, and he performed part</b> of the labor <b>the following day.</b>
<b>With regard to what</b> case <b>did they disagree? With regard to</b> the case of <b>one who performs</b> prohibited <b>labor in the midst of the day, and he does not know whether</b> it was <b>on Shabbat</b> that <b>he performed</b> the labor or <b>whether</b> it was <b>on Yom Kippur</b> that <b>he performed</b> the labor; <b>or with regard to one who performs</b> a prohibited labor <b>and he does not know which labor he performed. As,</b> in those cases <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>exempt. Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Yehoshua would deem him exempt even from</b> bringing <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Shimon Shezuri say:</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not disagree with regard to</b> a case involving <b>a matter</b> where his lack of knowledge involves items <b>from one category,</b> e.g., he picked a grape from a vine on Shabbat and does not know which vine it was, as in that case they both agree <b>that he is liable,</b> since he knows the nature of his sin. <b>With regard to what</b> case <b>did they disagree? With regard to</b> a case involving <b>a matter</b> where his lack of knowledge involves items <b>from two categories,</b> e.g., he picked fruit from a tree on Shabbat and does not know whether it was from a vine or from a fig tree. <b>As,</b> in that case <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering,</b> since he certainly sinned, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua deems him exempt,</b> as he does not know the nature of his sin.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Even</b> if one <b>intended to pick figs and he picked grapes,</b> or to pick <b>grapes and he picked figs,</b> or to pick <b>black</b> figs <b>and he picked white</b> figs, or to pick <b>white</b> figs <b>and he picked black</b> figs, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>exempt.</b> Rabbi Yehuda added: <b>I wonder if Rabbi Yehoshua deemed</b> him <b>exempt in</b> that case, as even in his opinion the person intended to perform a prohibited labor. The mishna asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so,</b> that he is not exempt according to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>why is it stated:</b> “If his sin, <b>wherein he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), from which it is derived that one is liable only if the object of the sin was the one that he intended? The mishna answers: This serves to <b>exclude one who acts unawares</b> and does not intend to perform a prohibited action at all.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the first clause of the mishna and the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Whichever way you</b> look at it he is liable to bring a sin offering. <b>If</b> it was forbidden <b>fat</b> that <b>he ate,</b> he is <b>liable;</b> and <b>if</b> it was <b><i>notar</i></b> that <b>he ate,</b> he is also <b>liable. If</b> it was with <b>his menstruating wife</b> that <b>he engaged in intercourse,</b> he is <b>liable;</b> and <b>if</b> it was with <b>his sister</b> that <b>he engaged in intercourse,</b> he is also <b>liable. If</b> it was <b>on Shabbat</b> that <b>he performed</b> the forbidden <b>labor,</b> he is <b>liable;</b> and <b>if</b> it was <b>on Yom Kippur</b> that <b>he performed</b> the <b>labor,</b> he is also <b>liable.</b> The result of any one of these scenarios is that he is liable to bring a sin offering.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him</b> in response: The verse <b>states:</b> “If his sin, which he has sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish” (Leviticus 4:23). It is derived from the phrase: <b>“Wherein he has sinned,”</b> that he is not liable <b>until it becomes known to him</b> specifically <b>with which</b> item <b>he sinned.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Eliezer, what does he do with this</b> phrase: <b>“Which</b> he has sinned”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that only one who is aware of his action is liable, as this phrase <b>excludes one who acts unawares</b> and inadvertently commits a transgression.

Daf 19b

The Gemara asks: The <i>halakha</i> that one who <b>acts unawares</b> is exempt is stated <b>in which</b> case? <b>If</b> you say it applies to the cases <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fats and those with whom intercourse is forbidden</b> this cannot be correct, as in those cases one who acts unawares is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. <b>As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who acts unawares</b> and transgresses the prohibitions <b>of</b> eating forbidden <b>fats or</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>those with whom intercourse is forbidden,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>because he derived pleasure.</b>
<b>And if</b> you say it is referring a case of one <b>who acts unawares on Shabbat</b> this cannot be correct either, as it is already established that one who acts unawares on Shabbat is <b>exempt. What is the reason? The Torah prohibited</b> only <b>planned,</b> constructive <b>labor</b> on Shabbat. Acts of labor that are not intended, or whose result is unintended, or whose consequence is destructive, are not included in this category. Therefore, it is already a known <i>halakha</i> that one who performs labor unawares on Shabbat is exempt.
The Gemara answers: <b>According to Rava, you find</b> it is necessary to teach that one is exempt from bringing a sin offering for performing labor unawares on Shabbat in a case <b>where</b> one <b>intended to cut a detached</b> plant <b>and he</b> mistakenly <b>cut</b> a plant still <b>attached. According to Abaye,</b> who maintains he is liable in such a case, <b>you find</b> it necessary to teach that one who acts unawares is exempt in a case <b>where he intended to lift</b> a plant <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>and</b> mistakenly <b>cut</b> a plant still <b>attached</b> to the ground.
<b>As it was stated:</b> With regard to one who <b>intended to lift</b> a plant <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>and</b> mistakenly <b>cut</b> a plant still <b>attached</b> to the ground, all agree he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he did not intend</b> to act <b>for the sake of cutting,</b> i.e., he merely intended to lift the plant. By contrast, if one intended <b>to cut a detached</b> plant <b>and</b> he mistakenly <b>cut</b> a plant that is still <b>attached, Abaye said</b> he is <b>liable, due to</b> the fact <b>that he intended</b> to act <b>for the sake of cutting.</b> Although his intention was not to perform a prohibited cutting, nevertheless he had intent to cut, and therefore he is liable for the prohibited cutting he performed in practice. <b>Rava said:</b> He is <b>exempt, due to</b> the fact <b>that he did not intend to</b> perform <b>a prohibited cutting.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not disagree</b> with regard to one who performs prohibited labor during the intervening twilight period; rather, they both agree that he is exempt, as I say: He performed part of the labor today and he performed part of the labor the following day. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said to</b> the other Sages: <b>You were diligent</b> to examine <b>my</b> opinion, and you found a refutation of my statement.
The Gemara asks: <b>What did they say to him that</b> led Rabbi Yosei to <b>say to them: You were diligent</b> to examine <b>my</b> opinion? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what <b>they said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where one <b>lifted</b> an item <b>at twilight</b> between Shabbat and Yom Kippur and carried it from one domain to another? If the domains are adjacent, this act can be performed so quickly that even at twilight it does not span two days. For this reason, Rabbi Yosei <b>said to them: You were diligent</b> to examine <b>my</b> opinion.
Since according to Rabbi Yosei the period of twilight is instantaneous, the Gemara objects: <b>But let him say to them:</b> In this case as well, <b>part of the lifting was</b> performed <b>today and part of it was</b> performed <b>tomorrow.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>That is also what he is saying to them: You were diligent</b> to examine <b>my</b> opinion, <b>and</b> yet <b>you have not accomplished anything,</b> as I remain steadfast in my opinion.
The Gemara objects: <b>And according to Rabbi Yosei,</b> had the start of the labor been on Shabbat and the <b>completion of</b> the <b>labor</b> on Yom Kippur, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua would agree that he is exempt. But <b>according to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> would he really be <b>exempt? Didn’t we hear that</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>deems</b> one <b>liable</b> for the final stage of a prohibited labor? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 105a) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who weaves</b> on Shabbat is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering if he weaves <b>three threads at the beginning</b> of work on a new item, <b>or</b> if he adds <b>one</b> thread <b>to</b> a preexisting <b>woven fabric.</b> Although the minimum number of threads required for the prohibited labor of weaving is generally three, Rabbi Eliezer deems one liable for a single thread that he adds to a woven fabric.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> in response: <b>Rabbi Yosei, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> would explain that <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>teaches: Rabbi Eliezer says: One who weaves</b> on Shabbat is <b>liable</b> if he weaves <b>three threads at the beginning</b> of work on a new item, <b>or</b> if he adds <b>two</b> threads <b>to</b> a preexisting <b>woven fabric.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Yehoshua would deem exempt</b> one who does not know the nature of his sin <b>even from</b> bringing <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Yehoshua would deem exempt</b> one who does not know the nature of his sin <b>even from</b> bringing <b>a provisional guilt offering, as it is stated:</b> “And <b>if</b> anyone <b>sin,</b> and do any of the commandments of the Lord that are not to be done, <b>though he does not know it;</b> yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). The verse <b>excludes this</b> case, <b>where he knew that he sinned. Rabbi Shimon said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: It can be inferred from <b>this</b> same verse that <b>he does</b> in fact <b>bring a provisional guilt offering.</b> The phrase <b>“and do…though he does not know it”</b> indicates that one brings an offering in a case such as <b>this,</b> when <b>he did not know with which</b> item <b>he sinned.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> in a case where there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one ate</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one did not eat</b> forbidden fat, which is a situation where he did not know if he sinned at all, it is unclear whether Rabbi Shimon maintains he is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering. Therefore, <b>go and ask about it,</b> to determine <b>whether</b> one <b>brings a provisional guilt offering</b> in such a case <b>or not.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one sinned and did not know with what</b> item <b>he sinned, or</b> if there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he sinned</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he did not sin,</b> he <b>brings a provisional guilt offering.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Whom did you hear who says</b> that if <b>one sinned and did not know with what</b> item <b>he sinned</b> he must <b>bring a provisional guilt offering?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Consequently, this <i>baraita</i> must be in accordance with his opinion, <b>and it teaches:</b> If there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one sinned</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>one did not sin,</b> he <b>brings a provisional guilt offering. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> If there is <b>uncertainty</b> if <b>one sinned</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> if <b>one did not sin,</b> he <b>brings a provisional guilt offering.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Shimon Shezuri say:</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not disagree</b> with regard to a case where his lack of knowledge involves items from one category. And the last clause in the mishna concludes: <b>If</b> it is <b>so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “If his sin, <b>wherein he has sinned”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), from which it is derived that one is liable only if the object of the sin was the one he intended? It serves to <b>exclude one who acts unawares</b> and does not intend to perform a prohibited action at all.
In connection to this <i>halakha</i> about one who acts unawares, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who acts unawares</b> and transgresses the prohibitions <b>of</b> eating forbidden <b>fats or</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>those with whom intercourse is forbidden,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>because he derived pleasure</b> from his actions. By contrast, <b>one who acts unawares</b> and performs a prohibited labor <b>on Shabbat</b> is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>the Torah prohibited</b> only <b>planned,</b> constructive <b>labor</b> on Shabbat, which does not include an act of labor that is not intended, or whose result is unintended.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: But isn’t</b> the case of the two <b>babies considered like</b> a case where <b>one acts unawares, and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 137a): In the case of <b>one who had two babies</b> to circumcise, <b>one</b> of whom he was required <b>to circumcise on Shabbat and one</b> whom he was required <b>to circumcise</b> the day <b>after Shabbat, and he forgot and circumcised the one</b> that should have been circumcised <b>after Shabbat on Shabbat, Rabbi Eliezer deems him liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering,</b> as circumcision before its appointed time does not override Shabbat. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering.
Rava explains his objection: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua deemed him exempt only here,</b> in that particular case, <b>because he holds</b> that if <b>one erred with regard to a mitzva and did not perform the mitzva</b> but committed a transgression instead, he is <b>exempt. But</b> in a case where <b>one acts unawares in a matter that</b> does <b>not</b> involve <b>a mitzva, even Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>liable.</b> This indicates that according to both opinions, in general one who commits a transgression on Shabbat while acting unawares is liable.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Leave aside</b> the case <b>of</b> the <b>babies.</b> No proof can be derived from there, as the transgression in that case is the act of inflicting a wound on Shabbat. This is an exceptional case, <b>since one who inflicts a destructive wound</b> is <b>liable</b> despite the fact that one is usually exempt from liability if he performs perform non-constructive acts on Shabbat. Consequently, the standard requirement of constructive labor on Shabbat does not apply, which is why <b>one who acts unawares and inflicts a wound</b> is also <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara cites another difficulty with regard to the claim that one who acts unawares when he performs a labor on Shabbat is exempt. <b>Rav Yehuda raised an objection to Shmuel</b> from the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even if one intended to pick figs and he picked grapes,</b> or to pick <b>grapes and he picked figs,</b> or to pick <b>black</b> figs <b>and he picked white</b> figs, or to pick <b>white</b> figs <b>and he picked black</b> figs, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>exempt.</b>
Rav Yehuda explained his objection: <b>And this</b> case <b>here is</b> concerning one who <b>acts unawares,</b> and yet not only does Rabbi Eliezer deem him liable, <b>but Rabbi Yehoshua too deemed</b> him <b>exempt from</b> bringing a sin offering <b>only</b> if he unwittingly switched one <b>type for</b> another <b>type,</b> e.g., grapes for figs, or white figs for black figs. <b>But</b> in a case where he unwittingly switches one for another <b>within one type, even Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>liable.</b>
Shmuel <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda in response: <b>Large-toothed one [<i>shinnana</i>], leave the mishna and follow after me,</b> i.e., it should not be understood as you think. <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where the picker lost his</b> train of <b>thought.</b> He had initially <b>intended to pick grapes and</b> then <b>he forgot</b> his initial intention <b>and thought:</b> It is <b>figs</b> that <b>I want. But his hand</b> unwittingly <b>went among the grapes</b> and he picked the grapes he had initially intended. In <b>that</b> case <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> he is liable, as <b>his</b> initial <b>intention was fulfilled. And Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> f <b>his</b> current <b>intention and thought</b> are <b>not fulfilled,</b> and therefore he is exempt. By contrast, in a standard case where one acts unawares, both agree that he is exempt.

Daf 20a

<b>Rav Oshaya raises an objection</b> from the mishna to Shmuel’s opinion that all agree that one who acts unawares on Shabbat is exempt: <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>did not disagree with regard to</b> a case involving <b>a matter</b> where his lack of knowledge involves items <b>from one category, as</b> in that case they both agree he is <b>liable. Rather,</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case involving <b>a matter</b> where his lack of knowledge involves items <b>from two categories, as</b> in that case <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering, and Rabbi Yehoshua deems him exempt.</b>
Rav Oshaya continues: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> about <b>what</b> matter <b>is he saying that they disagree?</b> If you say he maintains that they disagree in a case <b>where one intended to pick grapes and he picked figs,</b> or to pick <b>black ones and he picked white ones,</b> that is problematic. Rav Oshaya explains: <b>Grapes and figs, black ones and white ones, what are they?</b> Aren’t they <b>two categories?</b> If so, <b>this is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Shimon Shezuri,</b> who say that Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua disagree specifically with regard to a mistake involving two categories. If so, <b>what is Rabbi Yehuda coming to teach us?</b>
Rav Oshaya concludes: <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that that the difference <b>between them</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning one who performs a transgression while <b>acting unawares? As Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that one who <b>acts unawares</b> when committing a transgression is <b>liable, and</b> Rabbi Shimon and <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri hold</b> that one who <b>acts unawares</b> when committing a transgression is <b>exempt.</b> If so, the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda refutes Shmuel’s statement that all agree that one who acts unawares while performing a prohibited labor on Shabbat is exempt.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this is not a refutation. In fact, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one who <b>acts unawares is exempt.</b> The difference between the opinions involves a case where the picker lost his train of thought. He initially intended to pick one item, then he forgot and thought that he wanted a different item, and subsequently he unwittingly picked the item he had initially intended to pick. <b>And here</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> matter that <b>they disagree: As Rabbi Shimon Shezuri holds</b> that when the picker <b>forgot his</b> initial train of <b>thought</b> and instead thought he wanted a different fruit, and both fruits are <b>of one category, all agree</b> he is <b>liable</b> if he ends up unwittingly picking the fruit he initially intended to pick.
<b>When</b> do Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case involving <b>two categories,</b> i.e., when the picker forgot his initial thought and instead thought he required a fruit of a different category. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that there <b>is no difference</b> between a case <b>of one category and</b> a case <b>of two categories:</b> In both cases <b>they disagree,</b> as Rabbi Yehoshua rules he is exempt because his action did not follow his current intention. But in a case where one acts fully unawares, all agree he is exempt.
The Gemara cites another answer: <b>Rava said</b> that the difference <b>between</b> them is <b>with regard to</b> a case where one intended to perform two transgressions in a specific order and he mistakenly <b>performed</b> the second transgression <b>first.</b> According to Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua disagree with regard to a situation where one intended to pick two fruits of two different categories and he unwittingly picked them in the reverse order. In such a case Rabbi Yehoshua holds he is exempt. But when he intended to pick two pieces of fruit of the same category and he unwittingly reversed the order, Rabbi Yehoshua agrees he is liable. According to Rabbi Yehuda, whether the case involves one category or two categories, in both instances Rabbi Yehoshua holds that he is exempt.
With regard to Rava’s explanation, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that supports the claim that if one intended to perform two prohibited labors in one order and mistakenly reversed the order, he is exempt. <b>And it is taught:</b> If someone <b>had before him two long candles</b> that were <b>lit, and</b> he <b>intended to extinguish this</b> one <b>and</b> instead he <b>extinguished that</b> one, or if he intended <b>to light this</b> one <b>and</b> instead he <b>lit that one,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> But in a case where he intended <b>to light</b> one <b>and</b> then <b>extinguish</b> the other, <b>and</b> instead he drew a breath and blew the flame from one candle to the other, as he accomplished his intention and <b>extinguished</b> one <b>and lit</b> the other, albeit <b>with one breath,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> This indicates that if he had not performed the two acts simultaneously, but in the reverse order, he is exempt.
With regard to the last ruling, the Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> Since he accomplished his act as he had intended, he is clearly liable. The Gemara answers that the ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say: He did not</b> actually <b>perform</b> the labors in accordance with <b>his thought, as</b> he <b>wanted to light</b> one <b>initially and ultimately to extinguish</b> the other, <b>but when he performed</b> the <b>action, it</b> might be considered as though <b>he</b> first <b>extinguished</b> one <b>and ultimately lit</b> the other. <b>And</b> therefore one might <b>say</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>although he did not perform</b> the lighting <b>first,</b> as he had intended, nevertheless he <b>also did not</b> perform the lighting <b>after</b> the extinguishing, as they occurred simultaneously. Since his action did not entirely contradict his intention, he is liable.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who stokes coals on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings, <b>because he extinguishes the upper</b> coals that are moved to the bottom, due to lack of oxygen, <b>and he ignites the bottom</b> coals as he moves them to the top. The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with</b> here? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he intends to extinguish and kindle, what is the reason of the one who exempts</b> him? <b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that</b> he <b>does not intend to kindle,</b> but only to extinguish. If so, <b>what is the reason</b> of <b>the one who deems him liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings?
<b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Ḥanina both say</b> in explanation: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> a blacksmith needed the coals on top and <b>he</b> therefore <b>intended to extinguish the upper</b> coals, and <b>in order</b> to do that he knew he would <b>ignite the bottom</b> ones. The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to an undesired act of kindling on Shabbat, which is tantamount to a destructive act. <b>As, the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that one who produces an undesired or <b>destructive</b> outcome when he performs the labor <b>of kindling</b> is <b>exempt, and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> he is <b>liable. And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> That disagreement was <b>taught with regard to</b> the case of <b>a blacksmith.</b> And <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Until</b> it was taught that the case involves a blacksmith, <b>the reason for this <i>halakha</i> was not revealed.</b>
<b>Ami bar Avin and Rav Ḥananya bar Avin both say</b> another explanation:

Daf 20b

This is referring to a case <b>where he intended</b> both <b>to extinguish and to kindle.</b> The Torah singles out the labor of kindling on Shabbat, as it is written: “You shall not kindle fire in all your dwelling places on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3). The Sages disagree with regard to the interpretation of this verse. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says: Kindling was</b> singled <b>out</b> from the general category of prohibited labors in order to teach that it is unlike other labors, teaching <b>that</b> it is a regular <b>prohibition,</b> i.e., it is punishable only with lashes and does not entail <i>karet</i> or stoning for an intentional transgression, or a sin offering for an unwitting transgression. Consequently, he is not liable to bring a sin offering for the kindling.
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, who says: Kindling was</b> singled <b>out</b> in the Torah <b>to divide</b> the various primary categories of labor and to establish liability for the performance of each of them. According to this opinion, the prescribed punishments for kindling are the same as for the rest of the prohibited labors.
<b>Rava said</b> yet another explanation of the disagreement in the <i>baraita</i>: The difference <b>between them</b> involves a case where one intended to ignite the lower coals and subsequently extinguish the upper coals, and instead he extinguished the upper ones and ignited the lower ones simultaneously. Since he <b>performed</b> the extinguishing <b>first</b> and did not perform it after he ignited as he had intended, the first <i>tanna</i> rules he is liable to bring only one sin offering. By contrast, Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, maintains there is no exemption for performing the prohibited labors in a different sequence than intended.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> another explanation: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he intended to extinguish</b> a flame <b>and</b> he was not aware that the bottom coals would be kindled. Rather, <b>they ignited by themselves,</b> as he moved aside and extinguished the upper coals. <b>And the first <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> If one commits <b>an unintentional act,</b> an action from which an unintended prohibited result ensues on Shabbat, as he did not intend to perform a prohibited labor, he is <b>exempt. And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> One who commits <b>an unintentional act</b> from which a prohibited labor inadvertently results is <b>liable.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning <b>one who stokes coals on Shabbat</b> with the intention to move them in order <b>to be warmed by them, and they ignited by themselves; it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that he is <b>liable and it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara explains: The reason for <b>that which is taught</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that he is <b>liable,</b> is that this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that one who performs <b>a labor</b> on Shabbat that is <b>not necessary for its own sake,</b> i.e., he performs the labor for a purpose other than the direct result of the action, is held <b>liable for it. And</b> the reason for <b>that which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that he is <b>exempt,</b> is that <b>he holds</b> that one who performs <b>a labor</b> that is <b>not necessary for its own sake is exempt</b> from liability <b>for it.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one consumed</b> an olive-bulk of <b>blood</b> that spurted during the <b>slaughter of a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird, whether</b> it is <b>a kosher or non-kosher</b> species; or if one consumed <b>blood</b> that flowed after <b>stabbing</b> an animal or killing it in a manner other than by ritual slaughter, or <b>blood</b> that spurted after <b>ripping</b> the animal’s windpipe or gullet, or <b>blood</b> that spurted during <b>bloodletting with which the soul departs, one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> consuming <b>it</b> intentionally or to bring a sin offering for consuming it unwittingly.
But with regard to <b>blood of the spleen, blood of the heart, blood of eggs, blood of grasshoppers,</b> or <b>blood of exudate [<i>tamtzit</i>],</b> i.e., that oozes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of its slaughter concludes,<b>one is not liable for</b> consuming <b>it. Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> one <b>liable in</b> the case of <b>blood of exudate.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall consume no manner of blood”</b> (Leviticus 7:26). <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> from here that <b>even</b> with regard to the <b>blood of bipeds,</b> i.e., human beings, and the <b>blood of eggs,</b> the <b>blood of grasshoppers,</b> and the <b>blood of fish, all</b> these are <b>included</b> in the prohibition against consuming blood. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whether it is of bird or of animal”</b> (Leviticus 7:26).
The <i>baraita</i> explains the derivation from the verse: <b>Just as birds and animals are unique</b> in <b>that they have</b> the capacity for both <b>a light</b> form of <b>ritual impurity,</b> if they become impure after they are slaughtered, in which case they are considered impure food, <b>and a severe</b> form of <b>impurity,</b> if they die without valid ritual slaughter, <b>and they have</b> the possibility of being <b>forbidden or permitted, and they are a type of meat, so too, everything</b> that has the capacity for both <b>a light</b> form of <b>impurity</b> and a severe form of ritual impurity, and has the possibility of being forbidden or permitted, and is a type of meat, is included in the prohibition.
<b>I will</b> therefore <b>exclude</b> the <b>blood of bipeds, as they have</b> the capacity for <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity,</b> i.e., the impurity of a corpse, <b>but they do not have</b> the capacity for <b>a light</b> form of <b>ritual impurity,</b> since the <i>halakhot</i> of the impurity of food do not apply to the human body.

Daf 21a

<b>I will</b> likewise <b>exclude</b> the <b>blood of creeping animals, which do not have a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity.</b> Impurity transmitted to a person by the carcass of a creeping animal does not render clothing impure, whereas impurity transmitted by the carcass of an animal or bird does render one’s clothing impure. <b>I will</b> also <b>exclude the blood of eggs, as</b> they <b>are not a type of meat,</b> and finally I will exclude <b>the blood of fish</b> and <b>the blood of grasshoppers, as they are entirely permitted,</b> as explained on 21b.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states: “And you shall consume no manner of blood, <b>whether it is of bird or of animal,</b> in any of your dwellings” (Leviticus 7:26). The verse mentions both “bird” and “animal,” because <b>if</b> the verse had stated only “bird,” one might have said that <b>just as a bird</b> is a creature <b>concerning which</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> does <b>not</b> apply, as will be explained, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition against consuming blood applies only to <b>an animal concerning which</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> does <b>not</b> apply, whereas the blood of other animals is not forbidden. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Or of animal.”</b>
And <b>if</b> the verse had mentioned only “animal,” one might have said that <b>just as an animal is not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against taking the <b>mother</b> bird <b>with</b> her <b>young</b> (see Deuteronomy 22:6–7), <b>so too, a bird</b> whose blood is forbidden is that <b>which is not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against taking the <b>mother</b> bird <b>with the young,</b> i.e., non-kosher birds, whereas the blood of kosher birds is permitted. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whether it is of bird or of animal.”</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But say</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: The phrase <b>“no manner of blood”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> and the mention of <b>“bird or animal” is a detail.</b> This is <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and the hermeneutical principle in such cases is that <b>the generalization includes only what</b> is mentioned <b>in the detail.</b> Consequently, with regard to <b>a bird and an animal, yes,</b> it is prohibited to consume their blood, but with regard to <b>anything else,</b> the prohibition does <b>not</b> apply.
The Gemara explains that when the next verse states: <b>“Whoever consumes any blood,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:27), <b>it then generalized</b> again. Therefore, this is a case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> in which case the relevant hermeneutical principle dictates that <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> Accordingly, the verse includes everything that has the following three components, as stated above: The capacity for both a light form of ritual impurity and a severe form of ritual impurity; the possibility of being forbidden or permitted; and categorization as a type of meat.
The Gemara objects: <b>But the last generalization is not similar to the first generalization. The first generalization,</b> where it states: “You shall consume no manner of blood,” indicates a regular <b>prohibition,</b> punishable by lashes, whereas <b>the last generalization,</b> where it states: “That soul shall be cut off from his people,” indicates that the prohibition is punishable by <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Consequently, the hermeneutical principle for cases of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization should not apply.
The Gemara responds: <b>This <i>tanna</i>,</b> whose opinion is recorded in this <i>baraita</i>, is of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who maintains that <b>we expound generalizations and details</b> even <b>in a case</b> like <b>this, even though the last generalization is not similar to the first generalization.</b>
The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> that there is <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and therefore <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail is explicit</b> in that it is referring to <b>an item that has</b> the capacity for both <b>a light</b> form of <b>impurity and a severe</b> form of <b>impurity, and it has</b> the possibility of being <b>forbidden or permitted, and it is a type of meat, so too, every item that has</b> the capacity for both <b>a light</b> form of <b>ritual impurity and a severe form of ritual impurity,</b> and has the possibility of being forbidden or permitted, and is a type of meat, is included in the prohibition against consuming blood.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does this phrase: <b>So too every</b> item, <b>which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches,</b> serve <b>to include</b> beyond birds and animals, which are mentioned explicitly in the verse? After all, the blood of human beings, creeping animals, fish, and grasshoppers have already been excluded from the prohibition.
<b>Rav Adda bar Avin said:</b> It serves <b>to include</b> the <b>blood of a <i>koy</i>,</b> an animal that is not definitively categorized as either a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Rav Adda bar Avin <b>maintain</b> in this regard? <b>If he maintains</b> that <b>a <i>koy</i> is an uncertain</b> case, <b>is a verse necessary to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case of <b>uncertainty? Rather,</b> Rav Adda bar Avin <b>maintains</b> that the <i>koy</i> <b>is a distinct entity,</b> i.e., it is not in the category of domesticated animals or undomesticated animals, and therefore its <i>halakha</i> must be taught.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the prohibition against consuming the <b>blood of</b> a <i>koy</i>. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>its fat</b> is also forbidden? The Gemara answers that this is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall not eat <b>any [<i>kol</i>] fat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). The additional word “<i>kol</i>” serves to include the fat of a <i>koy</i> as being forbidden. The Gemara inquires further: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>its carcass</b> is prohibited? The Gemara answers that this is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall not eat <b>any [<i>kol</i>] animal carcass”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). Here too, the additional word “<i>kol</i>” serves to include the carcass of a <i>koy</i> as being prohibited.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the sciatic nerve</b> of a <i>koy</i> is prohibited? The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One rendered</b> the prohibition of the sciatic nerve <b>dependent on</b> the presence of <b>the spoon of the thigh,</b> as it is stated: “Therefore the children of Israel shall not eat the sciatic nerve which is upon the spoon of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33), <b>and this</b> <i>koy</i> <b>has a spoon [<i>kaf</i> ] of the thigh,</b> i.e., a round protrusion of flesh in its thigh that is shaped like a spoon.
The Gemara further asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <b>impurity</b> status of the carcass of a <i>koy</i>, <b>and</b> that ritual <b>slaughter</b> renders its meat permitted for consumption? The Gemara answers that these <i>halakhot</i> are derived by logical <b>reasoning: From</b> the fact <b>that in all</b> the <b>matters</b> mentioned above <b>the Merciful One included</b> the <i>koy</i> and rendered it <b>like a domesticated animal,</b> it is logical that the <i>halakhot</i> concerning <b>its impurity and its slaughter</b> are <b>also like</b> those concerning <b>a domesticated animal.</b>
§ The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>I will</b> therefore <b>exclude</b> the <b>blood of bipeds, as they have</b> the capacity for <b>a severe</b> form of <b>impurity,</b> the impurity of a corpse, <b>but they do not have</b> the capacity for <b>a light</b> form of <b>impurity,</b> since the <i>halakhot</i> of the impurity of food do not apply to human flesh. <b>But</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>one who cuts</b> flesh <b>from</b> a living <b>person</b> for food, there are two conditions under which it becomes impure with the impurity of food: First, the flesh <b>requires intent</b> to eat it or feed it to others, <b>and</b> second, it must <b>be rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming into contact with water or one of the other six liquids that render food items susceptible to impurity.
Before explaining the contradiction between this mishna and the <i>baraita</i> cited above, the Gemara seeks to clarify the mishna itself: <b>And</b> the following was <b>difficult for us: Why do I</b> need <b>intent? Let his</b> act of <b>cutting serve as intent</b> to eat the flesh. <b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> This is referring <b>to one who cuts</b> the flesh in order to feed it <b>to a dog, and intent</b> to feed it <b>to a dog is not</b> considered <b>intent</b> to use the flesh as food.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is intent to feed a dog <b>not</b> considered intent to use the flesh as food? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:6): The Sages <b>stated a principle with regard to ritual impurity:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> food <b>that is</b> assumed to be <b>food designated</b> for <b>a person,</b> once it becomes impure with the impurity of food, it remains <b>impure until it is rendered unfit to be consumed by a dog?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mishna is referring <b>to removing impurity from it. Since</b> the food <b>was initially fit to</b> be eaten by <b>a person,</b> its status of <b>impurity</b> cannot be <b>removed from</b> it <b>until it is rendered unfit to be consumed by a dog.</b> By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to one who cuts flesh, the mishna is referring <b>to granting it</b> susceptibility to <b>impurity.</b> In this case, <b>if</b> it is <b>fit for a person</b> then it is <b>fit for a dog,</b> i.e., it is susceptible to the impurity of food; <b>if</b> it is <b>not fit for a person, it is not fit for a dog,</b> i.e., it is not susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara addresses the contradiction between the mishna in <i>Teharot</i> and the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>In any case,</b> that mishna <b>teaches</b> that human flesh requires <b>intent, and intent is for a light</b> form of <b>ritual impurity,</b> i.e., this requirement of intent is necessary only for the flesh to become susceptible to ritual impurity as a food item. This apparently contradicts the claim of the <i>baraita</i> that the impurity of food items does not apply to human flesh. The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> of the mishna that human flesh is susceptible to impurity as a food item applies <b>while</b> the person <b>is alive. But after death</b> his corpse <b>is impure</b> by <b>a severe</b> form of <b>impurity</b> and is no longer susceptible to impurity as a food item, and that is the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara objects: The <i>baraita</i> contrasts animals, which are susceptible to both light and more severe forms of impurity, and people, who are susceptible only to severe ritual impurity, and the Gemara has explained the <i>baraita</i> as referring to a human being after death. But <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to an animal after death, if</b> one is referring to its <b>meat,</b> then it <b>transmits impurity</b> by <b>a severe</b> form of <b>impurity,</b> the impurity of a carcass, <b>and if</b> one is referring to its <b>blood,</b> it likewise <b>transmits impurity</b> by <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity,</b> and not a light form of ritual impurity.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): With regard to <b>the blood of</b> animal <b>carcasses, Beit Shammai deem</b> it <b>pure, and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>impure</b> just like the carcass itself, which transmits severe ritual impurity. Why, then, does the <i>baraita</i> differentiate between people and animals and indicate that dead animals are susceptible to a light form of ritual impurity?
The Gemara answers: The statement of the <i>baraita</i> that animals are susceptible to a light form of impurity after death while people are not <b>is necessary only for that which we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to the impurity of food (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>A carcass of a non-kosher animal,</b> e.g., a horse or donkey, found <b>in any location,</b> and likewise an unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird</b> found <b>in villages,</b> where there are not many people and it is unlikely to be eaten, <b>require</b> express <b>intent</b> to be eaten in order for them to be considered food and susceptible to impurity of food. But <b>they are not required</b> to come into contact with a liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity.
By contrast, <b>the carcass of a kosher animal anywhere, and the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird or</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> found <b>in marketplaces,</b> will presumably be eaten, and therefore they <b>require neither intent</b> to be eaten <b>nor</b> contact with liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity.
<b>And Rav said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: Why do I</b> need <b>intent for</b> a carcass to be eaten so that it will be considered food and therefore susceptible to the impurity of food, which is <b>a light</b> form of <b>ritual impurity?</b> After all, the carcass <b>itself is</b> already impure with a severe form of <b>impurity.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to</b> Rav: It is necessary for a case <b>where there is less than an olive-bulk</b> of the <b>carcass,</b> which is not susceptible to the impurity of a carcass, <b>and one combined it with less than an egg-bulk</b> of <b>food,</b> so <b>that this and that</b> together <b>are an egg-bulk,</b> which is the minimum amount of food that is susceptible to food impurity.
Rav raised a difficulty to Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>If so,</b> that less than an olive-bulk of an animal carcass does not transmit impurity, <b>it should also require</b> contact with a liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity as a food. <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that with regard to the impurity of foods, the verse states: <b>“Upon any sowing seed which is to be sown”</b> (Leviticus 11:37), which teaches: <b>Just as seeds are unique</b> in <b>that they will not ultimately become impure</b> with <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity and</b> they <b>require</b> contact with liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, <b>so too, anything that will not ultimately become impure</b> with <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity requires</b> contact with liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity.
Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to</b> Rav: <b>This statement</b> applies <b>to foods in general, which do not contain less than an olive-bulk of an animal carcass. But here, where</b> the food <b>does contain less than an olive-bulk of an animal carcass,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is different: <b>Since</b> it would be impure with a severe form of ritual impurity <b>if one were to add to</b> the amount of animal carcass so that there would be a full <b>olive-bulk,</b> it <b>does not require</b> contact with a liquid in order <b>to be rendered susceptible</b> to impurity. In any case, this <i>halakha</i> that less than an olive-bulk of a carcass combines with less than an egg-bulk of food to equal a full egg-bulk that is susceptible to food impurity, applies only to the flesh of an animal,

Daf 21b

<b>to the exclusion of</b> less than an olive-bulk of a human <b>corpse.</b> With regard to a human corpse, <b>even if one completes its</b> amount to an egg-bulk, it <b>does not become impure</b> by the <b>impurity of food, because his intention is</b> rendered <b>irrelevant by</b> the opinions of <b>all</b> other <b>people,</b> since people do not eat human corpses. This explains why the <i>baraita</i> stated that animals are susceptible to light and severe forms of ritual impurity whereas people are susceptible only to severe ritual impurity.
<b>Rav Ḥananya said:</b> With regard to the assertion that the carcass of a non-kosher animal becomes susceptible to the impurity of food only if one intends to eat it, <b>you may even say that</b> the piece of the carcass <b>is an olive-bulk. What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where one covered it with</b> less than an egg-bulk of <b>dough.</b> Since it is covered with dough the carcass cannot come into contact with anything else in order to transmit impurity to it, and since there is less than an egg-bulk of dough, the dough itself is not susceptible to the impurity of food. But if the carcass and the dough combined are a full egg-bulk, they are susceptible to the impurity of food and can transmit that impurity to other food items.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so, let it also require</b> contact with a liquid in order <b>to be rendered susceptible</b> to the impurity of food. The Gemara responds: <b>That statement</b> applies <b>with regard to other</b> kinds of <b>food, which do not transmit impurity</b> at all, <b>neither through</b> direct <b>contact nor through carrying. But here, granted that</b> the piece of animal carcass <b>does not transmit impurity through contact, as it is covered with dough, it should at least transmit impurity through carrying, as it is laden upon him,</b> despite the fact that he does not touch it.
According to Rav Ḥananya, it is in this regard that a light form of impurity, the impurity of food, applies to an animal after death. This is <b>to the exclusion of</b> a human <b>corpse, as even if one covered it with dough it transmits a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity, as</b> the <b>impurity</b> of a corpse <b>breaks through and ascends,</b> and <b>breaks through and descends,</b> even when it is covered.
§ The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i> cited above (20b–21a). <b>The Master said:</b> The blood of <b>creeping animals</b> has been <b>excluded, as they do not have</b> a severe form of <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do creeping animals <b>not</b> have a severe form of impurity? After all, by Torah law the carcass of <b>a creeping animal transmits impurity through contact.</b> The Gemara answers that even so, <b>it does not transmit impurity through carrying,</b> in the manner of an animal carcass.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: The <b>blood of fish and</b> the <b>blood of grasshoppers</b> have been <b>excluded, as they are entirely permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the clause: <b>They are entirely permitted? If we say</b> it is referring to the fact <b>that</b> all the <b>fat</b> of fish and grasshoppers is <b>permitted,</b> one may respond that all the <b>fat of an undomesticated animal</b> is also <b>permitted, and</b> yet <b>its blood is forbidden.And</b> if you say: <b>Rather,</b> fish and grasshoppers are referred to as entirely permitted <b>because the prohibition of the sciatic nerve does not apply to them,</b> this is also untenable; <b>but</b> in the case of <b>a bird there is no prohibition</b> against eating <b>the sciatic nerve and</b> even so, <b>its blood</b> is <b>forbidden.</b>
<b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the statement that fish and grasshoppers <b>are entirely permitted?</b> This is referring to the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> fish and grasshoppers <b>do not require</b> ritual <b>slaughter</b> to permit their consumption.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If the verse had stated only “bird,” one might have said that <b>just as a bird</b> is a creature with regard to <b>which</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds does not</b> apply, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition of consuming blood applies only to <b>an animal</b> that is not subject to the prohibition of diverse kinds, whereas the blood of other animals is not forbidden. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of animal.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> form of <b>diverse kinds</b> is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is the prohibition against <b>mating diverse kinds</b> together, <b>or</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing diverse kinds</b> together, that is difficult: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 54b): Similarly, <b>undomesticated animals and birds</b> are subject to the same <i>halakhot</i> <b>as them,</b> i.e., just as it is prohibited to plow with or to mate two species of domesticated animals together, the same applies to undomesticated animals and birds. Consequently, these prohibitions apply to all animals.
<b>Rather, Abaye said that</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>its wool,</b> i.e., its feathers, and indicating that <b>one is not liable for</b> mixing <b>it</b> with linen <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The prohibition of diverse kinds in clothing applies only to mixing sheep wool with linen, but not to the hair or feathers of other animals and birds.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the <b>blood of creeping animals, one is flogged for</b> consuming <b>it in</b> the amount of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>blood of the spleen, blood of the heart, blood of the kidneys,</b> and <b>blood of limbs,</b> all <b>these are</b> forbidden for consumption <b>by</b> a regular <b>prohibition,</b> punishable by lashes, but their consumption is not punishable by <i>karet</i>. By contrast, the <b>blood of bipeds,</b> i.e., human beings, and the <b>blood of creeping animals and crawling things</b> are <b>forbidden but one is not liable for</b> their consumption. This indicates that one is not even flogged for consuming the blood of creeping animals.
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the clause: <b>One is not liable for</b> its consumption? It means that one is not liable to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for consuming it, but one <b>is liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition.</b>
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>One</b> reason this is not a good explanation is <b>that this is</b> the same as <b>the first clause.</b> The first clause of the <i>baraita</i> lists types of blood whose consumption is a violation of a regular prohibition and is not punishable by <i>karet</i>. Clearly, the latter clause cannot also be referring to types of blood in the same category. <b>And furthermore, a <i>tanna</i> excludes</b> consumption of this blood <b>from</b> a regular <b>prohibition as well, as</b> the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier <b>teaches:</b> The <b>blood of creeping animals</b> has been <b>excluded, as it does not have a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> When Rav said that one is flogged for consuming the blood of creeping animals, he meant that if witnesses <b>forewarned him</b> that if he consumes the blood he will be liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>a creeping animal,</b> then <b>he is flogged.</b> The reason is that the prohibition against eating a creeping animal includes its blood. But if they forewarned him that he will be liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition of consuming <b>blood, he is not flogged.</b>
§ <b>Rav says: Fish blood that one collected</b> in a receptacle is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption because it would look as though one is consuming the blood of an animal or bird. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> cited above: The <b>blood of fish</b> and the <b>blood of grasshoppers are permitted, and</b> this indicates that they are permitted <b>even <i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he did not collect</b> the blood in a receptacle; <b>when Rav said</b> that it is prohibited, he was referring to a situation <b>where he did collect</b> the blood in a receptacle.
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>In the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to</b> the <b>blood of bipeds,</b> which the <i>baraita</i> states is forbidden, the case must also be one <b>where one did not collect</b> the blood in a receptacle. In such a case, <b>is</b> the blood really <b>forbidden? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If some human <b>blood was on a loaf</b> of bread, one <b>scrapes off</b> the blood <b>and</b> then he <b>may eat</b> the bread. But with regard to blood that is <b>between</b> one’s <b>teeth, he may suck it and swallow it without concern,</b> as the blood is permitted if it has not been removed from the body. This indicates that even human blood that has not been collected in a receptacle is permitted.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> rules that fish blood is permitted even when it has been collected in a receptacle, and <b>when that <i>baraita</i> is taught,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there are scales in it</b> and therefore it is clearly fish blood. By contrast, <b>when Rav said</b> that it is <b>prohibited</b>, he was referring to a case <b>where there are no scales in</b> the blood, and therefore it is not evident that it is fish blood.
<b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> With regard to the <b>blood</b> of <b>bipeds, there is not even a command to abstain</b> from consuming it <i>ab initio</i>. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Blood of the spleen, blood of the heart, blood of the kidneys,</b> and <b>blood of limbs,</b> all <b>these are</b> forbidden for consumption <b>by</b> a regular <b>prohibition.</b> By contrast, the <b>blood of bipeds,</b> i.e., human beings, and the <b>blood of creeping animals and crawling things</b> are <b>forbidden but one is not liable for</b> their consumption. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> it <b>is taught</b> in that <i>baraita</i> that human blood <b>is forbidden,</b> that is referring to a case

Daf 22a

<b>where</b> the blood was <b>separated</b> from a person. By contrast, <b>when Rav</b> Sheshet <b>said</b> that one need not abstain from human blood even <i>ab initio</i>, he was referring to a case <b>where</b> it was <b>not separated</b> from a person. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>blood was on a loaf</b> of bread, one <b>may scrape off</b> the blood <b>and</b> then <b>consume</b> the bread. If blood <b>was between</b> the <b>teeth, he may suck</b> it <b>and swallow</b> it <b>without concern.</b>
<b>Some teach this</b> statement <b>of Rav Sheshet with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it is taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who consumes</b> the <b>milk</b> of <b>bipeds would violate a prohibition. And</b> this conclusion could be derived based upon <b>a logical inference: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a non-kosher animal, where you were lenient with regard to its contact,</b> i.e., it cannot render people or items impure through contact when it is alive, <b>you were stringent with regard to its milk,</b> which is prohibited, so too in the case of <b>bipeds, where you were stringent with regard to their contact,</b> as living people can render other people and objects impure, <b>isn’t it logical that you should be stringent with regard to their milk?</b>
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And these are they which are impure to you”</b> (Leviticus 11:29), which indicates that <b>these</b> animals enumerated in that chapter are <b>non-kosher</b> and their milk is forbidden for consumption, <b>but the milk of bipeds is not impure</b> but <b>rather pure,</b> i.e., kosher.
Furthermore, one might have thought that <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the milk</b> of women from forbidden status, as the forbidden status of milk <b>does not</b> apply <b>equally to all</b> creatures, since the milk of kosher animals is permitted, but <b>I should not exclude</b> human <b>blood</b> from the prohibition against consuming blood, <b>which</b> does apply <b>equally to all</b> creatures, since even the blood of kosher animals is forbidden. Consequently, <b>the verse states: “And these are they which are impure to you,”</b> which indicates that <b>this is impure, but the blood of bipeds is not impure</b> but <b>rather pure,</b> i.e., kosher. It was in this context that <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> With regard to the blood of bipeds, <b>there is not even a command to abstain</b> from consuming it <i>ab initio</i>.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ḥullin</i> 109a): One who wants to eat <b>the heart</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its blood,</b> and only then may he cook it and eat it. If <b>he did not tear</b> the heart before cooking it and he ate it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition and is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for consuming blood. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: They taught</b> this <b>only with regard to the heart of a bird, since it does not contain an olive-bulk</b> of blood. <b>But the heart of an animal, which does contain an olive-bulk</b> of blood, <b>is forbidden and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for its</b> consumption.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> cited above: With regard to <b>blood of the spleen, blood of the heart, blood of the kidneys,</b> and <b>blood of limbs,</b> all <b>these are</b> forbidden for consumption <b>by</b> a regular <b>prohibition,</b> punishable by lashes, but their consumption is not punishable by <i>karet</i>. By contrast, the <b>blood of bipeds,</b> i.e., human beings, and the <b>blood of repugnant creatures and crawling things</b> are <b>forbidden but one is not liable for</b> their consumption. This proves that one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for consuming the blood of the heart.
The Gemara answers that <b>when</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is not liable for</b> consuming the blood of the heart, it is referring <b>to its</b> own <b>blood,</b> i.e., the blood absorbed in the walls of the heart. By contrast, <b>when Rav said</b> that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, he was referring to blood <b>that comes from the outside,</b> i.e., from elsewhere in the body, and which is found in the cavity of the heart.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Its</b> own <b>blood is</b> the same as the <b>blood of limbs,</b> which is already included in the list. What is the difference between the blood absorbed in the walls of the heart and blood absorbed in any other limb? The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the blood of</b> the <b>kidneys, and</b> yet <b>it</b> also <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the blood of limbs? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of the kidneys, <b>and then teaches</b> the principle with regard to the blood of limbs. <b>Here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of the heart, <b>and then teaches</b> the principle with regard to the blood of limbs.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where does</b> blood <b>come to</b> the heart <b>from outside? Rabbi Zeira said: At the time when the soul departs,</b> i.e., when the animal is dying, the heart <b>draws [<i>sharif</i> ]</b> blood from elsewhere, and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for consuming this blood.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>blood</b> that spurted during bloodletting with <b>which the soul departs, one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> consuming <b>it</b> intentionally or to bring a sin offering for consuming it unwittingly. <b>It was stated: What</b> is defined as the <b>blood</b> that spurts during <b>bloodletting upon which the soul depends,</b> whose consumption entails <i>karet</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: As long as it is spurting</b> forcefully, it is included in this category of blood. <b>Reish Lakish says: From the</b> last <b>black drop and onward,</b> i.e., even before the blood spurts out forcefully, it is included in this category. The first drops of blood are black, and once these have ended and the first red drops have begun to emerge, it is the blood upon which the soul depends.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> defined as <b>blood</b> that spurts during <b>bloodletting with which the soul departs? As long as it is spurting</b> forcefully, it is considered this type of blood. This <b>excludes blood of exudate,</b> i.e., that oozes from the animal after the spurt concludes, <b>because</b> at this stage the blood merely <b>flows</b> rather than spurting forcefully. The Gemara infers: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>even</b> with regard to the <b>first and last</b> appearances of blood to emerge, if <b>it flows it is considered as blood of exudate?</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to exclude</b> only <b>black blood; but</b> with regard to the <b>first and last</b> appearances of red <b>blood,</b> which emerge, respectively, after the black blood but before the blood spurts and after the blood is no longer spurting forcefully, <b>even though it flows, this is</b> considered <b>blood</b> with which <b>the soul</b> departs.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> defined as the <b>first</b> appearance of <b>blood? As long as it is spurting</b> forcefully, it is considered the first appearance of blood. This <b>excludes</b> the <b>first and last</b> appearances of blood, <b>because</b> that blood <b>flows.</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish.</b> The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish could <b>say to you</b> that this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the blood</b> with which <b>the soul</b> departs? <b>As long as it is spurting</b> out, it is considered this type of blood; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Shimon says: From the</b> last <b>black drop and onward</b> it is considered blood with which the soul departs.
The Gemara mentions a related <i>halakha</i> involving blood. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: “And drinks the blood of the slain”</b> (Numbers 23:24). This teaches that the blood that is considered a halakhically recognized liquid, and therefore renders other items susceptible to ritual impurity, is only blood that is exuded after death. This serves to <b>exclude blood</b> that <b>spurts</b> out forcefully at the time of the slaughter, before the animal is actually dead. Consequently, this type of blood <b>does not render seeds susceptible to</b> ritual impurity.
§ The Gemara returns to the prohibition against consuming blood. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If <b>one performed bloodletting upon an animal and received its blood in two cups,</b> from which he drank, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>With regard to the first</b> cup, <b>everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> as it contains blood that spurted forcefully. <b>With regard to the last</b> cup, which does not contain blood that spurted forcefully from the animal, <b>is he liable or not?</b>
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, as it was stated:</b> If <b>one performed bloodletting upon an animal and received its blood in two cups, Reish Lakish says</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings</b> if he drank the contents of the cups in two lapses of awareness, as one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> even for blood that emerges after spurting; <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, for the blood in the first cup.
§ The mishna teaches that one is not liable for consuming blood of exudate, i.e., that oozes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of blood concludes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> one <b>liable in</b> the case of <b>blood of exudate.</b> The Gemara adds that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Yehuda concedes with regard to atonement</b> that if one sacrifices an offering and the priest sprinkles the blood of exudate on the corners of the altar, the blood does not atone. This is <b>as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul”</b> (Leviticus 17:11), which teaches that <b>blood with which the soul departs,</b> i.e., the blood that spurts immediately upon slaughter, <b>atones, but</b> blood <b>with which the soul does not depart,</b> i.e., the blood that drains out after the initial spurt, <b>does not atone.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We learn</b> this in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as well, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “And any man from the house of Israel, or from the stranger who resides among them, who consumes any blood, I will set My face against that soul that consumes blood, and will cut him off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:10). The verse could simply have stated <b>“blood”; what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “any blood”?</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul,” I have</b> derived <b>nothing other than</b> the fact that consuming the <b>blood of sacrificial</b> animals <b>with which the soul departs</b> renders one liable to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>as</b> this blood <b>atones. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>blood of non-sacred</b> animals <b>and blood of exudate? The verse states: “Any blood.” Who is</b> presumed to be the author of any <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> found in the <b><i>Sifra</i>,</b> a collection of halakhic midrash on Leviticus, which is the source of this <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is Rabbi Yehuda.</b> This proves that according to Rabbi Yehuda, blood of exudate does not effect atonement.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna resumes discussion of the provisional guilt offering addressed in the previous chapter. <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for</b> a case where he is <b>uncertain</b> whether he is guilty of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, a transgression that renders one liable to bring a definite guilt offering (see Leviticus 5:15). <b>And the Rabbis deem him exempt,</b> as one brings a provisional guilt offering only in a case of uncertainty as to whether he is liable to bring a sin offering, not a guilt offering. <b>And Rabbi Akiva concedes that one does not bring</b> payment for <b>his misuse until it becomes</b> definitely <b>known to him</b> that he is guilty of misuse, <b>as</b> then <b>he will bring a definite guilt offering with</b> his payment.
<b>Rabbi Tarfon said: For what</b> purpose <b>does that</b> person <b>bring two guilt offerings,</b> one provisional and one definite? <b>Rather,</b> at the outset <b>one brings</b> the payment for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>and its</b> additional payment of <b>one-fifth,</b> as mandated by Torah law, <b>and he will</b> then <b>bring a guilt offering</b> worth <b>two <i>sela</i> and say: If</b> it is <b>certain</b> that <b>I misused</b> consecrated property, <b>this is</b> payment for <b>my misuse and this is my</b> definite <b>guilt offering. And if</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>I misused</b> consecrated property, <b>the money is a contribution</b> to the Temple fund for the purchase of communal offerings <b>and the guilt offering</b> is <b>provisional, as from the</b> same <b>type</b> of animal <b>that one brings</b> a guilt offering <b>for</b> a case where it is <b>known</b> to him that he is guilty of misuse, he likewise <b>brings</b> a guilt offering <b>for</b> a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to him.
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: The statement of</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>appears</b> correct <b>in</b> the case of <b>minimal misuse,</b> but in a case <b>where he is confronted with</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>misuse</b> valued at <b>ten thousand dinars, would it not be preferable for him that he will</b> now <b>bring</b> a provisional <b>guilt offering</b> valued <b>at two <i>sela</i> and he will not bring</b> payment now for <b>uncertain misuse</b> valued <b>at ten thousand dinars?</b> The mishna concludes: Apparently, <b>Rabbi Akiva concedes to Rabbi Tarfon in</b> the case of <b>minimal misuse.</b> He agrees that at the outset one brings payment for misuse and its additional payment of one-fifth, and conditionally brings a guilt offering.

Daf 22b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the issue of whether one brings a provisional guilt offering for an uncertain misuse of consecrated property, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Immediately following the passage in the Torah discussing a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property the Torah introduces the <i>halakhot</i> of a provisional guilt offering by stating: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin” (Leviticus 5:17). The term “and” serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse</b> of consecrated property; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> in such a case.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about this</b> following method of halakhic derivation: <b>That Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that when the Torah connects two topics with the term “and” <b>one learns</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>earlier</b> passage <b>from</b> those in the <b>later</b> passage. Consequently, it can be derived that one who is uncertain about whether he misused consecrated property must bring a provisional guilt offering. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one does not learn</b> the <i>halakhot</i> in the <b>earlier</b> passage <b>from</b> those of the <b>later</b> passage.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> In fact, <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>one learns</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>earlier</b> passage <b>from</b> those of the <b>later</b> passage, <b>as if</b> one does not say <b>so, you will not find</b> a source for the requirement <b>that a young bull</b> brought as a burnt offering must be slaughtered in the <b>north</b> section of the Temple courtyard. This is derived from the fact that the Torah states the <i>halakhot</i> of a young bull brought as a burnt offering (Leviticus 1:3–9) and then states: “And if his offering is of the flock, from the sheep or from the goats, as a burnt offering, an unblemished male he shall present it, and he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward” (Leviticus 1:10–11).
<b>Rather, here,</b> in the case of one who is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property, <b>this is</b> the <b>reason that the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from bringing a provisional guilt offering: It is <b>because they derive</b> the details of the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the provisional guilt offering written in the verse: “And if anyone sin, and perform one of all the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 5:17), by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse stated with regard to <b>a sin offering:</b> “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in his performance of any of the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that may not be performed” (Leviticus 4:27).
The verbal analogy indicates that <b>just as there,</b> the sin offering is brought only for <b>an act that renders one liable to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> violation <b>and</b> liable to bring <b>a sin offering for its unwitting</b> violation, <b>and</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for its uncertain</b> violation, <b>so too,</b> for <b>every</b> transgression <b>for which one is liable to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> violation <b>and</b> one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering for its unwitting</b> violation, one is also liable to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for its uncertain</b> violation.
This verbal analogy serves <b>to exclude misuse</b> of consecrated property from the transgressions for which one would bring a provisional guilt offering in a case of uncertainty, <b>as one is not liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> violation. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who intentionally misused</b> a consecrated item, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that he is liable to the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> He has violated a standard <b>prohibition,</b> and is flogged. Everyone agrees that he is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> with regard to the verbal analogy cited above as the source of the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> the following: <b>When we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of provisional guilt offerings based upon the term <b>“the commandments of”</b> used in that context (Leviticus 5:17) and the identical expression <b>“the commandments of”</b> stated with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> brought for the consumption of forbidden <b>fat</b> (Leviticus 4:27), i.e., a standard sin offering, it is <b>for this</b> purpose <b>that we derive it: Just as there,</b> the verse is referring <b>to a fixed</b> sin offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering, one brings it only for the uncertain transgression <b>of</b> a sin for which one would be liable to bring <b>a fixed</b> offering.
This serves <b>to exclude</b> transgressions for which one brings <b>a sliding-scale</b> sin offering, i.e., the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, taking a false oath of testimony, and violating an oath (see Leviticus 5:1–13). Since one who unwittingly violated these prohibitions brings an animal, bird, or meal offering depending on his financial status, if he is uncertain whether he violated one of these prohibitions he does <b>not</b> bring a provisional guilt offering.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree with Rabbi Akiva and <b>hold</b> that <b>there is no verbal analogy for half</b> of a matter. Once a verbal analogy is accepted, the two cases are treated as entirely similar, which in this case means that the provisional guilt offering is brought only for a sin punishable by <i>karet</i> for its intentional violation. The Gemara asks: Should one conclude <b>by inference that Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>there is a verbal analogy for half</b> of a matter? There is no record of any <i>tanna</i> maintaining this opinion. <b>Rather, everyone agrees that there is no verbal analogy for half</b> of a matter.
<b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, as the verse states</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin” (Leviticus 5:17). The term “and” in the form of the letter <b><i>vav</i>, adds to the previous matter.</b> When a sentence begins with the conjunction <i>vav</i>, it is a continuation of the previous discussion, <b>and</b> therefore the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>earlier</b> passage, in this case misuse of consecrated property, <b>are learned from the later</b> passage. Consequently, one brings a provisional guilt offering even for uncertain misuse of consecrated property.
<b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that it is the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>later</b> passage that <b>are derived from the earlier</b> passage. Consequently, the ram brought <b>for</b> a provisional <b>guilt offering</b> must be <b>worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels,</b> just like the ram brought as a guilt offering in a case where one is certain that he misused consecrated property (see Leviticus 5:15).
<b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this opinion? He <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no juxtaposition for half</b> of a matter. Consequently, one must also derive the <i>halakhot</i> of the earlier passage from the later passage, and one is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Should one conclude <b>by inference that the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>there is a juxtaposition for half</b> of a matter? <b>But</b> this is difficult, because <b>we maintain</b> as a principle <b>that there is no juxtaposition for half</b> of a matter.
Rather, <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>there is no juxtaposition for half</b> of a matter. <b>And here, this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, as they derive</b> from the verbal analogy of the expression <b>“the commandments of</b> the Lord” (Leviticus 5:17) stated with regard to the provisional guilt offering and the identical expression <b>“the commandments of</b> the Lord” (Leviticus 4:27) stated with regard to the sin offering that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property. One does not derive the <i>halakhot</i> of the earlier passage based upon the later passage, as this aspect of the comparison has been explicitly <b>excluded from</b> the comparison of these two passages based upon their <b>juxtaposition.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Akiva derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the provisional <b>guilt offering</b> must be worth at least two <b>silver shekels from</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1). This teaches that there is <b>one law for all of the guilt offerings,</b> and therefore each <b>guilt offering</b> must be <b>worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels.</b> Since it is not necessary for him to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the juxtaposition of the passages concerning misuse of consecrated property and the provisional guilt offering, and the verbal analogy cannot entirely negate the comparison indicated by this juxtaposition, Rabbi Akiva derives from the juxtaposition that one is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> would reply that <b>even though it is written: “This is the law of the guilt offering,”</b> nevertheless it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to write: “And if anyone</b> sin,” in which the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter and</b> indicates that the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>later</b> passage <b>are learned from the earlier</b> passage. This teaches that a provisional guilt offering must be worth at least two silver shekels.
<b>And if</b> you would say that this could be derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering,”</b> that is impossible, as <b>I would say: When I say</b> that there is <b>one law for all of the guilt offerings, that statement</b> applies only <b>to other definite guilt offerings.</b> In other words, just as the guilt offering for definite misuse of consecrated property must be worth at least two silver shekels, the same applies to all definite guilt offerings.
<b>But</b> with regard to the <b>provisional guilt offering, since it comes for an uncertain</b> violation, e.g., in a case where one is uncertain whether he ate forbidden <b>fat,</b> one might <b>say</b> that the offering one brings for <b>its uncertain</b> violation <b>should not be</b> more <b>stringent than</b> the offering one brings for <b>its definite</b> violation: <b>Just as</b> for <b>its definite</b> violation one may bring <b>a sin offering worth</b> even <b>one-sixth [<i>danka</i>]</b> of a dinar, <b>so too,</b> for <b>its uncertain</b> violation one may bring <b>a guilt offering worth</b> even <b>one-sixth</b> of a dinar. It is <b>for this</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One wrote: “And if anyone</b> sin,” in which the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter.</b> By contrast, since Rabbi Akiva does not derive the requirement for a provisional guilt offering to be worth at least two silver shekels from this verse, he derives from it that one brings a provisional guilt offering in a case of uncertain misuse of consecrated property.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who expounds</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering,”</b> as Rabbi Akiva derives from here that a provisional guilt offering must be worth at least two silver shekels. <b>But according to the one who does not expound</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering,” what is there to say?</b> From where does he derive that all guilt offerings must have the same minimum value? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“your valuation”</b> stated with regard to other guilt offerings (see Leviticus 5:18, 5:25), and the identical term <b>“your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 5:15) <b>from</b> the case of <b>a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property, which the verse indicates must be worth at least two silver shekels.
The Gemara asks: What is the source of this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>guilt offering</b> for engaging in intercourse with <b>an espoused maidservant, about which</b> the term <b>“your valuation”</b> is <b>not written</b> in the Torah? The Gemara answers: <b>We derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“ram”</b> (Leviticus 5:15) in the verse about a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property and the word <b>“ram”</b> (Leviticus 19:21) in a verse concerning the espoused maidservant.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Akiva concedes</b> that one does not bring payment for his misuse of consecrated property until it becomes known to him that he is guilty of misuse, as then he brings a definite guilt offering with his payment. Rabbi Tarfon said: One brings payment for misuse and its additional payment of one-fifth, and a guilt offering worth two <i>sela</i>, and says: If it is certain that I misused consecrated property, this is payment for my misuse and this is my definite guilt offering. <b>And if</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether I misused consecrated property, the money is a contribution to the Temple fund for the purchase of communal offerings and the guilt offering is provisional.
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Tarfon, <b>what is</b> this individual <b>saying?</b> How can he say: If it is uncertain, when he clearly is uncertain about whether he misused consecrated property? <b>Rava said</b> that one should <b>teach</b> the mishna as follows: <b>If its uncertainty persists forever,</b> this offering <b>should be a provisional guilt offering,</b> whereas if it becomes known that I misused consecrated property, this should be a regular guilt offering. This is an effective stipulation, <b>as</b> the offering <b>one brings</b> in a case where it is <b>known</b> to him that he misused consecrated property is <b>from</b> the same <b>species</b> as the offering <b>he brings</b> in a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to him whether he misused consecrated property.
The Gemara objects: <b>Ultimately,</b> even according to Rabbi Tarfon one cannot necessarily avoid bringing two guilt offerings. Since at the time when he brought his first offering he was uncertain whether he had misused consecrated property, <b>when it becomes known to him</b> that he misused consecrated property <b>he is required to bring a definite guilt offering.</b>
In response to this question <b>Rava said: From the statement of both of</b> the <i>tanna’im</i>, i.e., Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva, it can <b>be learned</b> that <b>a definite guilt offering does not require knowledge</b> that the individual definitely sinned <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Consequently, as long as it eventually becomes known that he sinned, he has fulfilled his obligation to bring a definite guilt offering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Apropos the previous case in which one brings the same type of animal when liability is certain as when liability is uncertain, this mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a woman who brought a bird sin offering</b> in a case of uncertainty whether she miscarried a fetus that would have rendered her liable to bring a sin offering or whether what she expelled would not render her liable to bring an offering, in which case this sin offering may not be eaten by priests, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If <b>before</b> the nape of the neck of the bird <b>was pinched it became known to her that she certainly gave birth,</b> i.e., miscarried, in a manner that obligates her to bring a sin offering, <b>she should render</b> the offering <b>a definite</b> sin offering, <b>as from the</b> same <b>type</b> of animal <b>that she brings</b> a sin offering <b>for</b> a case where it is <b>known</b> to her that she miscarried, <b>she brings</b> a sin offering <b>for</b> a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to her.
The mishna resumes discussion of the provisional guilt offering. If one had <b>a piece of non-sacred</b> meat <b>and a piece of sacrificial</b> meat, and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property. <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering,</b> in accordance with his opinion in the previous mishna that one brings a provisional guilt offering even in a case of uncertainty with regard to misuse. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings a definite guilt offering,</b> as it is certain that he ate the sacrificial meat.
If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> first person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering and that</b> second person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon says: Both of them bring one</b> definite <b>guilt offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that the one who ate the non-sacred meat grants his share of the animal to the one who ate the sacrificial meat, and the guilt offering is sacrificed on his behalf. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b>

Daf 23a

<b>Two</b> people <b>do not bring one guilt offering,</b> as one may not sacrifice atonement offerings conditionally.
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of non-sacred</b> meat, and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a provisional guilt offering,</b> as perhaps he ate the forbidden fat. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings a sin offering,</b> as it is certain that he ate the fat. If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering and that</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon says: Both of them bring one sin offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that the sin offering should be credited to the one who ate the fat. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Two</b> people <b>do not bring one sin offering.</b>
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> permitted fat and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a provisional guilt offering,</b> as perhaps he ate the forbidden fat. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings a sin offering,</b> as he certainly ate the fat, <b>and a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property. If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering and that</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering. Rabbi Shimon says: Both of them bring a sin offering and a guilt offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that each offering should be credited to the one who is liable to bring it. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Two</b> people <b>do not bring one sin offering and</b> one <b>guilt offering.</b>
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a sin offering</b> as he certainly ate forbidden fat. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He <b>also</b> brings <b>a provisional guilt offering,</b> as perhaps he ate the sacrificial fat, in accordance with his opinion that one brings a provisional guilt offering even in the case of uncertainty with regard to misuse of consecrated property. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings two sin offerings,</b> as he ate two pieces of forbidden fat, <b>and a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property.
If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering. Rabbi Akiva says: This</b> person <b>and that</b> person each <b>bring a provisional guilt offering</b> as well, due to the uncertainty as to which of them ate the sacrificial fat. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: This</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and both of them bring one guilt offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that the offering should be credited to the one who ate the sacrificial fat. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The two of them do not bring one guilt offering.</b>
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> that is <b><i>notar</i>,</b> an offering whose designated time has passed for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> if he ate it intentionally and liable to bring a sin offering if he ate it unwittingly, and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a sin offering,</b> as he certainly ate forbidden fat, <b>and a provisional guilt offering,</b> due to the possibility that he ate the <i>notar</i>. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings three sin offerings,</b> two for the forbidden fat and one for the prohibition against eating <i>notar</i>.
If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and a provisional guilt offering,</b> as he certainly ate forbidden fat and it is uncertain whether he ate the <i>notar</i>, <b>and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and a provisional guilt offering. Rabbi Shimon says: This</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and both of them bring one</b> additional <b>sin offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that the offering should be credited to the one who ate the <i>notar</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Two</b> people <b>do not bring any sin offering that comes</b> as atonement <b>for a sin.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in a case where there was a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of non-sacred meat and each piece was eaten by a different person, Rabbi Shimon maintains that both of them bring one sin offering by stipulating that the sin offering is credited to the one who ate the fat, whereas Rabbi Yosei says that two people do not bring one sin offering. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to Rabbi Yosei, it is</b> apparently <b>a sin offering that they both do not bring,</b> whereas <b>they do both bring a provisional guilt offering.</b> If so, his opinion <b>is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who explicitly stated that each of them brings a provisional guilt offering.
<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yosei and the first <i>tanna</i> with regard to the requirement of <b>one piece from two pieces,</b> i.e., according to Rabbi Yosei only the first individual is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering, as he had two pieces before him, whereas the second is exempt, since there was only one piece before him when he ate it, this cannot be correct: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: This</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering and that</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava in response: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us, that who is the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>
§ The mishna discusses the case of <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> permitted fat, the case of <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> and the case of <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> that is <b><i>notar</i>.</b> In the final case, if someone ate one of the pieces and then ate the second piece, he brings three sin offerings, two for the forbidden fat and one for the prohibition against eating <i>notar</i>. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: And let him also bring a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property, <b>as <i>notar</i> is sacrificial</b> food. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the piece <b>does not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>,</b> and one is not liable for misusing consecrated property of such little value.
Rava raised a difficulty to Rav Naḥman: <b>But at the outset</b> of the mishna <b>we are dealing with</b> a piece <b>that does have the value of one <i>peruta</i>, as</b> it <b>teaches</b> that if one ate both a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of sacrificial permitted fat, he brings <b>a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>That</b> clause of the mishna <b>is</b> referring to <b>a piece that is not <i>notar</i>,</b> and that piece is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The case of the piece of <i>notar</i> is different. Since it has been left over for a while, most people would not eat it, and it is no longer worth one <i>peruta</i>.
Rava raised another difficulty to Rav Naḥman: <b>But</b> the mishna (13b) states: <b>There is</b> a case where <b>one performs one</b> act of <b>eating</b> and is liable for having violated five transgressions, and that mishna <b>teaches</b> that the case is where a ritually impure person ate forbidden fat that was <b><i>notar</i></b> from sacrificial meat on Yom Kippur, <b>and it teaches</b> that he <b>brings four sin offerings and one guilt offering.</b> Since the guilt offering is for misusing consecrated property, the piece of meat, which is <i>notar</i>, is evidently worth at least one <i>peruta</i>.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>That</b> mishna is referring <b>to</b> an act of <b>excessive</b> eating, i.e., to a large piece of meat that is <i>notar</i>, which is worth one <i>peruta</i>, <b>and this</b> mishna here is referring <b>to</b> an act of <b>light</b> eating, i.e., a small piece of meat that is <i>notar</i>, which is not worth one <i>peruta</i>, <b>and</b> therefore it is <b>not difficult.</b> Alternatively, <b>that</b> mishna is referring <b>to</b> <i>notar</i> <b>in the rainy season,</b> when the meat does not spoil so quickly and therefore it is still worth one <i>peruta</i>, and <b>this</b> mishna here is referring <b>to</b> <i>notar</i> <b>in the summer,</b> when it spoils quickly.
§ The mishna further teaches with regard to the case of a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of forbidden fat that is <i>notar</i>, that if <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece and another ate the second piece, Rabbi Shimon says: Each brings a sin offering for having eaten forbidden fat, and they bring an additional sin offering for the transgression of eating <i>notar</i>, with the stipulation that the offering is credited to the one who ate the <i>notar</i>. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b> This indicates that the prohibition of <i>notar</i> takes effect despite the fact that the prohibition of forbidden fat already applied to this piece. <b>And did Rabbi Shimon say</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who</b> unwittingly <b>eats</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass on Yom Kippur is exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering for the sin of eating on Yom Kippur because the prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur does not take effect upon the meat of an animal carcass, which is already prohibited?
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he ate a kidney with its</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> Since the kidney is not forbidden fat, the prohibition against eating <i>notar</i> applies with regard to the kidney. The Gemara asks: <b>But even</b> with regard to <b>a kidney with its</b> forbidden <b>fat, the prohibition of</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> upon the altar <b>applies to it,</b> i.e., it is already forbidden for consumption because it is supposed to be burned on the altar. Consequently, <b>how does the prohibition of <i>notar</i> come</b> and <b>apply to it?</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon maintains that <i>notar</i> is a severe prohibition, and</b> therefore it <b>applies where</b> the relatively <b>lenient prohibition of</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> upon the altar has already taken effect, this cannot be correct. The Gemara explains: <b>But</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an animal carcass is a lenient prohibition,</b> as it is punishable merely by lashes, <b>and</b> eating on <b>Yom Kippur is a severe prohibition,</b> as its violation is punishable by <i>karet</i>; <b>and</b> yet according to Rabbi Shimon <b>the prohibition</b> against eating on <b>Yom Kippur, which is severe, does not come</b> and <b>apply where</b> the prohibition of <b>an animal carcass, which is lenient,</b> has already taken effect.
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that specifically <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> food <b>the Merciful One revealed that a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists.

Daf 23b

<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition against eating sacrificial meat in a state of ritual impurity: “But the soul that eats from the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The phrase <b>“which belong to the Lord”</b> serves <b>to include</b> in the prohibition of an impure person consuming sacrificial food <b>the sacrificial portions,</b> which are meant to be sacrificed upon the altar and not eaten by other people. One who eats this meat while he is impure is liable to receive <i>karet</i>.
The Gemara explains the proof from this <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>sacrificial portions, the prohibition of</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> upon the altar <b>applies to it, and</b> with regard to the parts of the sacrificial portions that are forbidden <b>fat, the prohibition</b> against eating forbidden fat, which is punishable by <b><i>karet</i>, applies to it. And</b> nevertheless <b>the prohibition of</b> eating sacrificial food in a state of <b>impurity comes and applies</b> in addition to that prohibition. This indicates that with regard to sacrificial meat specifically, a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition already exists.
The Gemara adds: <b>Know that it is so, as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintains</b> in general that <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>but this statement</b> applies only with regard to a relatively <b>severe prohibition</b> taking effect <b>where</b> a relatively <b>lenient prohibition</b> already exists. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a lenient prohibition taking effect where</b> there is already an existing <b>prohibition, and that</b> original <b>prohibition is</b> more <b>severe</b> than the second one, <b>no,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not hold that the second prohibition takes effect. <b>And</b> yet <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> meat, <b>we have heard that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that <b>even a lenient prohibition takes effect where a severe prohibition</b> already exists.
The Gemara cites the source for this claim: <b>As the prohibition of misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is</b> a relatively <b>lenient</b> prohibition, since according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi it is punishable by <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>and the prohibition</b> against eating <b>sacrificial</b> meat <b>is a severe prohibition,</b> since it is punishable by <b><i>karet</i>,and</b> yet the <b>prohibition</b> punishable by <b>death comes and takes effect where</b> there is already an existing <b>prohibition</b> punishable by <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is stated with regard to peace offerings, which are offerings of lesser sanctity: “And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasing aroma; <b>all the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16). This verse serves <b>to include the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.
The Gemara comments: <b>And misuse</b> of consecrated property, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>is a prohibition</b> punishable by <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>and</b> yet <b>it takes effect where</b> there is already an existing <b>prohibition</b> of forbidden <b>fat, which is a prohibition</b> punishable by <b><i>karet</i>. Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> food, <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> that a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition already exists. As stated above, it is for this reason that Rabbi Shimon states in the mishna that one is liable to bring two sin offerings for eating forbidden fat that is <i>notar</i>.
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The prohibition against eating <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>] does not</b> apply <b>to</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> onto the altar, <b>and</b> similarly, the prohibition against eating <b><i>notar</i> does not</b> apply <b>to</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> onto the altar? This indicates that even with regard to sacrificial meat, a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i> with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as some say</b> that Rabbi Shimon maintains that <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> meat <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, as indicated in the mishna. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even with regard to sacrificial</b> meat, Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>a prohibition does not take effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>even with regard to sacrificial</b> meat <b>a prohibition does not take effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse: <b>“All the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16), from which it was derived above that the sacrificial parts of offerings of lesser sanctity are included in the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property?
The Gemara answers that <b>he interprets it</b> as referring <b>to</b> the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>as he holds</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals become <b>sanctified when they</b> begin to <b>exist,</b> i.e., when they are born. Since the prohibition of forbidden fat also takes effect at that time, <b>both of them,</b> i.e., the prohibitions of forbidden fat and misuse of consecrated property, <b>come</b> into effect <b>simultaneously.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who brings a provisional guilt offering</b> due to uncertainty as to whether he sinned, <b>and it became known to him that he did not sin, if</b> he made that discovery <b>before</b> the ram <b>was slaughtered, it shall emerge and graze with the flock</b> as a non-sacred animal, since its consecration was in error. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Its status is not that of a non-sacred animal; rather it is that of a guilt offering that was disqualified for sacrifice. Therefore, <b>it shall graze until it becomes blemished; and</b> then <b>it shall be sold, and</b> the <b>money</b> received <b>for it shall be allocated for</b> the purchase of communal <b>gift</b> offerings by the Temple treasury. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It shall be sacrificed</b> as a provisional guilt offering, <b>as if it does not come</b> to atone <b>for this sin</b> that he initially thought, <b>it comes</b> to atone <b>for another sin</b> of which he is unaware.
<b>If it became known to him</b> that he did not sin <b>after</b> the ram <b>was slaughtered</b> and its blood collected in a container, <b>the blood shall be poured</b> into the canal that flows through the Temple courtyard, <b>and the flesh shall go out to the place of burning,</b> like any disqualified offering. If <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> before he discovered that he did not sin, <b>and the meat is intact,</b> the meat <b>may be eaten</b> by the priests like any other sin offering, as from the moment that its blood was sprinkled the meat is permitted to the priests. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if the blood</b> was still <b>in the cup</b> when he discovered that he did not sin, the blood <b>shall be sprinkled and the meat may be eaten.</b>
In the case of <b>a definite guilt offering,</b> it is <b>not so,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> is different than with regard to a provisional guilt offering. If he made the discovery that he did not sin <b>before</b> the ram <b>was slaughtered, it shall go out and graze among the flock,</b> as it is not consecrated. If it became known to him that he did not sin <b>after</b> the ram <b>was slaughtered, it shall be buried</b> like a non-sacred animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard, and its blood is poured. If he discovered that he did not sin <b>after the blood was sprinkled, the flesh shall go out to the place of burning,</b> like any disqualified offering.
In the case of <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned</b> (see Exodus 21:28–32), e.g., for killing a person, it is <b>not so,</b> i.e., it also does not have the same halakhic status as a provisional guilt offering. If it is discovered that the testimony with regard to the ox was false <b>before it was stoned, it shall go out and graze among the flock</b> as it never had the status of an ox sentenced to be stoned. If this was discovered <b>after</b> the ox <b>was stoned,</b> its halakhic status is as though it had not been sentenced, and therefore <b>deriving benefit</b> from its carcass <b>is permitted.</b>
In the case of <b>a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> when a corpse is found between two cities and the identity of the murderer is unknown (see Deuteronomy 21:1–9), it is <b>not so</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> is different than with regard to a provisional guilt offering. If the identity of the murderer is discovered <b>before</b> the heifer’s <b>neck was broken, it shall go out and graze among the flock,</b> as it is not consecrated. But if the identity of the murderer was discovered <b>after</b> the heifer’s <b>neck was broken, it shall be buried in its place,</b> like any other heifer whose neck is broken. The reason is <b>that from the outset</b> the heifer whose neck is broken <b>comes</b> to atone for a situation of <b>uncertainty.</b> Once its neck was broken before the identity of the murderer was revealed, its mitzva was fulfilled, as <b>it atoned for its uncertainty and</b> that uncertainty <b>is gone.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches with regard to one who brings a provisional guilt offering and it became known to him before the ram was slaughtered that he did not sin that Rabbi Meir says the animal is non-sacred and the Rabbis say its status is that of a guilt offering that was disqualified. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> do Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Meir holds:</b> He initially consecrated the animal with the intention to sacrifice it. <b>Since</b> later it became clear to him <b>that he does not require</b> the animal, the sanctity is nullified and it is as though he did <b>not consecrate it. And the Rabbis hold: Since</b> initially <b>his heart struck him [<i>nokfo</i>]</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he might have committed, he wholeheartedly <b>resolved to consecrate</b> the animal, and that sanctity is not nullified.
A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis disagree whether it became known to him that he sinned, or whether it became known to him that he did not sin.</b> The Gemara elaborates: Their dispute is stated by the <i>baraita</i> in a case <b>where it became known to him that he sinned,</b> in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> As Rabbi Meir maintains <b>that even though he</b> now <b>knows that he sinned</b> and therefore he must bring a sin offering and is no longer obligated to sacrifice the provisional guilt offering, nevertheless, <b>since at the time that he designated</b> the animal as a provisional guilt offering <b>he did not know</b> for certain that he sinned, that animal <b>shall go out and graze among the flock,</b> as it is unconsecrated.
<b>And</b> similarly, their dispute is stated in a case <b>where it became known to him that he did not sin,</b> in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> As the Rabbis maintain <b>that even though he</b> now knows <b>that he did not sin, since at the time that he designated</b> the animal as a provisional guilt offering <b>he did not know, his heart struck</b> him with pangs of conscience. <b>Therefore,</b> he wholeheartedly <b>resolved to consecrate</b> the animal.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: Rabbi Meir concedes to the Rabbis</b>

Daf 24a

in a case <b>where one designates two</b> provisional <b>guilt offerings</b> from the outset <b>as a guarantee,</b> so that if one is lost he may achieve atonement with the other, <b>and he achieved atonement with one of them.</b> He concedes <b>that</b> the <b>second</b> animal retains its sanctity and <b>shall graze until it becomes blemished and</b> that then <b>it shall be sold and</b> the <b>money</b> received <b>for it shall be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.
<b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Meir agrees in such a case? <b>Rabbi Meir disagrees with the Rabbis</b> in a case where one brings a provisional guilt offering and later discovers with certainty that he did not sin, <b>only because</b> Rabbi Meir holds <b>that</b> the one consecrating the animal <b>did not</b> initially <b>reveal that his heart was striking him</b> with pangs of conscience. <b>But here,</b> in a case where he set aside two animals as provisional guilt offerings, <b>since he was required to designate</b> only <b>one</b> animal, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he designated two?</b> Evidently, the reason is <b>that he thought: If one</b> of the animals <b>is lost, I will achieve atonement with the other one. And as he revealed</b> by this scrupulous behavior <b>that his heart was striking him</b> with pangs of conscience, <b>since that was so, he wholeheartedly resolved to consecrate</b> the animal.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir in</b> a case of <b>a provisional guilt offering where</b> two witnesses testified that someone may have committed a sin, e.g., that he ate a piece of fat with regard to which there was uncertainty if it was permitted or forbidden fat, and later those witnesses <b>were rendered conspiring witnesses, that</b> the animal <b>shall go out and graze among the flock</b> as a non-sacred animal.
<b>What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>the Rabbis disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the person <b>designated</b> the animal as a provisional guilt offering <b>of his own volition, and</b> therefore <b>we say</b> that <b>his heart was striking him</b> with pangs of conscience and he wholeheartedly resolved to consecrate the animal. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where he designated</b> the animal as a provisional guilt offering <b>due to</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses, he was not relying on the witnesses.</b> Rather, <b>he thought: Perhaps other</b> witnesses <b>will come and render these</b> witnesses <b>conspiring witnesses.</b>
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> from the mishna: The case of <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned is not similar</b> to the case of a provisional guilt offering, as even the Rabbis agree that <b>if</b> it is discovered that the testimony with regard to the ox was false <b>before it was stoned, it shall go out and graze among the flock.</b> Rava explains his objection: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that</b> initially <b>two</b> people <b>came</b> and <b>said</b> that the ox <b>killed</b> someone and the animal was therefore sentenced to be stoned, <b>and two</b> people later <b>say</b> that the ox <b>did not kill, what did you see that you listen to the latter</b> pair? <b>You</b> could just as well <b>listen to the former</b> pair.
<b>Rather, isn’t</b> the mishna referring <b>to conspiring witnesses,</b> i.e., the second pair of witnesses testified that the first pair were not in the vicinity at the time of the incident and therefore the testimony of the second pair of witnesses is accepted? <b>And</b> if so, <b>in the corresponding</b> situation in the mishna <b>with regard to a provisional guilt offering,</b> it is likewise <b>referring to conspiring witnesses,</b> i.e., one designated an animal as a provisional guilt offering due to the testimony of witnesses, and they were subsequently proven to be conspiring witnesses. <b>And</b> yet the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir in that case and rule that this provisional guilt offering is not rendered non-sacred.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: This proof is inconclusive. <b>Perhaps</b> one can say that in the case of <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned,</b> which goes out and grazes among the flock, <b>what are the circumstances?</b> It is not referring to conspiring witnesses, but rather to a case <b>where</b> the supposedly <b>killed</b> individual <b>comes</b> to the court <b>on his feet,</b> thereby conclusively disproving the testimony.
<b>And in the corresponding</b> situation in the mishna <b>of a provisional guilt offering,</b> it is referring to a case where one designated the animal as a provisional guilt offering of his own volition, and, <b>for example,</b> it later became <b>known</b> that the uncertain <b>piece</b> of fat that he ate was permitted fat. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where he designated</b> an animal <b>as a provisional guilt offering due to the testimony of witnesses,</b> he did <b>not</b> wholeheartedly resolve to consecrate the animal, and therefore it shall go out and graze among the flock.
The Gemara notes that Rav Yehuda and Rava, who discuss the case of conspiring witness above, disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan: If one designated an animal as <b>a provisional guilt offering</b> due to the testimony of witnesses and then those <b>witnesses were rendered conspiring witnesses, Rabbi Elazar says: This</b> case <b>is similar to a meal offering of jealousy,</b> sacrificed as part of the trial undergone by a <i>sota</i>, i.e., a suspected adulteress (see Numbers 5:25–26). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the <b>witnesses</b> who testified about <b>her were</b> later <b>found</b> to be <b>conspiring, her meal offering is transferred to non-sacred</b> status. Likewise, a provisional guilt offering whose witnesses were proven to be conspiring witnesses becomes non-sacred.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> That provisional guilt offering <b>shall graze until it becomes blemished; and</b> then <b>it shall be sold, and</b> the <b>money</b> received <b>for it shall be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, let us compare</b> that case <b>to a meal offering of jealousy,</b> as claimed by Rabbi Elazar. The Gemara explains that Rabbi Yoḥanan would claim that the cases are <b>not similar: A meal offering of jealousy does not come for atonement,</b> but <b>rather to clarify</b> the <b>sin</b> of the <i>sota</i>. Since it has been clarified that she did not sin, the meal offering becomes non-sacred. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a provisional guilt offering, which comes for atonement,</b> one must explain as follows: <b>Since his heart strikes him</b> with pangs of conscience, he wholeheartedly <b>resolves to consecrate</b> the animal, and therefore it remains sacred.
§ <b>Rabbi Keruspedai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>an ox that is stoned whose witnesses were rendered conspiring,anyone who takes possession</b> of the ox <b>acquires it,</b> as the owner of the ox relinquished his possession upon hearing that the animal is sentenced to die.
<b>Rava said: The explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan stands to reason</b> in a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>said to him</b> that <b>his ox was the object of bestiality;</b> since he assumes that the witnesses are telling the truth, he relinquishes his ownership of the animal. <b>But</b> if the witnesses <b>said</b> that the owner himself <b>engaged in bestiality with his ox, he knows about himself that he did not engage in bestiality with</b> the ox, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he will not relinquish his ownership</b> of the ox. <b>But</b> rather, <b>he will make an effort and bring</b> other <b>witnesses</b> to prove that those witnesses are conspiring.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different between</b> this case and <b>that which Rava bar Ittai says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> In a case of <b>an idolatrous city,</b> where witnesses testified that the majority of inhabitants committed idolatry, and the <i>halakha</i> is that all of the city’s property must be burned, if <b>its witnesses were rendered conspiring witnesses, anyone who takes possession</b> of the city’s property <b>acquires it?</b> In this case, the residents of the city know about themselves that they did not commit idolatry.
The Gemara responds: With regard to <b>an idolatrous city, which</b> involves <b>many</b> people, <b>each</b> person <b>says to himself:</b> Although <b>I did not sin, others sinned,</b> and consequently the city will be entirely burned; <b>and he</b> therefore <b>relinquished ownership of his property. But here,</b> with regard to the ox sentenced to be stoned, <b>where the matter is dependent</b> solely <b>upon</b> the owner <b>himself, he knows about himself that he did not engage in bestiality with</b> the ox, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he does not relinquish his ownership</b> of the ox. <b>But</b> rather, <b>he will make an effort and bring</b> other <b>witnesses</b> to prove that these are conspiring witnesses. Therefore, if they are in fact found to be conspiring witnesses, the ox remains in his possession.
§ The Gemara cites another example of a case where anyone who takes possession acquires an item. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> In the case of <b>one who gives a gift to another and that</b> person receiving the gift <b>says: I do not want [<i>ee efshi</i>] it, anyone who takes possession of</b> the item <b>acquires it,</b> as ownership of the item has been relinquished.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And what is different between</b> this case and <b>that</b> statement <b>which Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> With regard to <b>one who receives a gift who, after the gift entered his possession, said: Let this gift become void,</b> or said: This gift <b>is rendered void,</b> or said: <b>I do not want it, his statement is effective.</b> But if he said: <b>It is void,</b> or: <b>It is not a gift,</b> it is as though <b>he said nothing.</b>

Daf 24b

<b>What, is it not</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>His statement is effective,</b> this means <b>that</b> the gift <b>returns to its</b> previous <b>owner?</b> This ruling contradicts the opinion of Reish Lakish, who holds that in such a case anyone who takes possession of the item acquires it. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the phrase: <b>His statement is effective,</b> means that the previous owner <b>also does not acquire</b> the item; <b>and</b> as the item is not in the possession of either the giver or receiver of the gift, <b>anyone who takes possession of it acquires it.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to another</b> person with whom he shares property: <b>I have no legal</b> dealings or involvement <b>with this field,</b> or: <b>I have no business with it, or: My hand is removed from it,</b> he <b>has not said anything</b> of consequence, i.e., he does not relinquish his ownership of the property. <b>But</b> the phrase: <b>My hand is removed from it, is like</b> the phrase: <b>I do not want it, and</b> yet it <b>is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that he <b>has not said anything.</b> This ruling apparently contradicts the opinion of Reish Lakish, who holds that in such a case anyone who takes possession of the item acquires it.
The Gemara responds: That case in the <i>baraita</i> <b>there is different, as</b> when <b>he says that he is removing himself,</b> he is referring to removal <b>from legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement. He is not removing himself from the field itself.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a person on his deathbed <b>who wrote</b> a document granting <b>his property</b> as a gift <b>to another, and there were slaves among</b> his property, <b>and the other</b> person <b>said: I do not want them,</b> his objection is disregarded. Consequently, <b>if</b> their <b>second master,</b> the recipient, <b>was a priest,</b> his slaves <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as they are now slaves of a priest. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Once</b> the other person <b>said: I do not want them,</b> the previous owner’s <b>heirs have already acquired them.</b>
<b>Granted</b> there is no difficulty <b>according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> as he <b>holds</b> that <b>when a person gives a gift,</b> it is <b>with the intention that</b> the other person will <b>accept</b> the gift <b>from him.</b> Therefore, <b>when</b> the other individual <b>does not accept it from him,</b> the gift <b>returns to its</b> previous <b>owner.</b>
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, if</b> Reish Lakish is correct <b>that when one says: I do not want it, anyone who takes possession of</b> the item <b>acquires it,</b> as the item becomes ownerless, then <b>here, where</b> the <b>second</b> master <b>said: I do not want them,</b> the slaves <b>are non-priests, and</b> this would mean that <b>non-priests are partaking of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: The first <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that with regard to <b>one who renounces ownership of his slave,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated but</b> nevertheless <b>requires a bill of manumission from his master. And he</b> further <b>holds</b> that a slave <b>detained</b> in his master’s possession only due <b>to</b> not having received <b>a bill of manumission may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> if he is the slave of a priest.
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of one who brings a provisional guilt offering and it became known to him that he did not sin, if he made that discovery before the ram was slaughtered, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It shall be sacrificed</b> as a provisional guilt offering, as if it does not come to atone for that sin that he thought, it comes to atone for another sin. The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, why do I</b> need another <b>sin? Doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> that <b>a provisional guilt offering may come as a gift</b> offering? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (25a) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person may volunteer</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering every day.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> that is taught in the mishna here <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of those who spoke to</b> Bava ben Buta in the mishna below, <b>as we learned</b> in the continuation of that mishna (25a): Rabbi Eliezer said that Bava ben Buta would bring a provisional guilt offering every day, and he wanted to bring one even immediately after Yom Kippur. <b>But they said to him: Wait until you enter into a situation</b> of potential <b>uncertainty,</b> so that the provisional guilt offering is brought for some sort of uncertain sin, and do not sacrifice it purely as a gift offering.
§ With regard to one who brought a provisional guilt offering and <b>after</b> the ram <b>was slaughtered it became known</b> to him that he did not sin, the mishna <b>teaches: The flesh shall go out to the place of burning. Evidently,</b> according to the opinion of the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>non-sacred animals that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> such as this provisional guilt offering that was mistakenly consecrated, are <b>to</b> be <b>burned.</b>
<b>But</b> one may <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a ruling later in the mishna: In the case of <b>a definite guilt offering,</b> that is <b>not so; if</b> he made that discovery <b>before</b> the ram <b>was slaughtered, it shall go out and graze among the flock.</b> If it became known to him <b>after</b> the ram <b>was slaughtered</b> that he did not sin, <b>it shall be buried.</b> This indicates that non-sacred animals slaughtered in the Temple courtyard are buried. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This mishna <b>is disjointed,</b> i.e., it cites the opinions of two different Sages. <b>He who taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>did not teach that</b> <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rabba said: Are you raising a contradiction</b> from the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a definite guilt offering with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a provisional guilt offering?</b> In the case of <b>a definite guilt offering,</b> he consecrated it under the assumption that he was obligated to sacrifice it. <b>Since</b> it later became clear to him <b>that he does not need</b> to sacrifice the animal, it is considered as though <b>he did not consecrate it,</b> and the animal is non-sacred. But with regard to <b>a provisional guilt offering, since</b> initially <b>his heart struck him</b> with pangs of conscience over a sin that he might have committed, <b>he</b> wholeheartedly <b>resolves to consecrate</b> the animal. Therefore, the animal remains consecrated, and its status is that of a guilt offering disqualified for sacrifice.
<b>Rather, if</b> the mishna poses <b>a difficulty,</b> then the apparent contradiction between this <i>halakha</i> of <b>a definite guilt offering</b> and another <i>halakha</i> <b>of a definite guilt offering is difficult. As it is taught</b> in the mishna: If after the ram was slaughtered it became known to him that he did not sin, <b>it shall be buried.</b> Now <b>say the latter clause</b> of that section of the mishna: If after the blood was sprinkled he discovered that he did not sin, <b>the flesh shall go out to the place of burning.</b> Accordingly, this mishna <b>is certainly disjointed,</b> and <b>he who taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>did not teach that</b> <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rav Ashi said: The first clause, which teaches with regard to a provisional guilt offering: The flesh shall go out to the place of burning,</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> Its flesh is not treated like that of a non-sacred animal that was slaughtered in the courtyard, which must be buried. It is burned <b>because it has the appearance of a disqualified offering,</b> which must be burned. This reason applies equally in the case of a definite guilt offering where it became known to him that he did not sin only after the blood was sprinkled, which is why it too must be burned. But if he discovered that he was not obligated to bring the definite guilt offering after the ram was slaughtered but before its blood was sprinkled, it shall be buried, as this does not appear like a disqualified offering, since it is no longer a definite guilt offering and its blood was not sprinkled.
The mishna teaches: With regard to one who brought a provisional guilt offering, if <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> and then he discovered that he did not sin and the meat is intact, <b>the meat may be eaten</b> by the priests. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is the meat eaten? After all, <b>he</b> now <b>has</b> certain <b>knowledge</b> of his sin, and a provisional guilt offering is brought only by one who is uncertain about his sin. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 5:18), <b>and this</b> person <b>did not have knowledge</b> of his sin <b>at the time of forgiveness,</b> i.e., when he achieved atonement, which is the moment of the sprinkling of the blood.
§ The mishna further teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if <b>the blood</b> of the provisional guilt offering was still <b>in the cup</b> but had not yet been sprinkled when he discovered that he did not sin, the blood shall be sprinkled and the meat may be eaten. The Gemara asks: <b>According to Rabbi Yosei, why</b> is the blood <b>sprinkled? This</b> person <b>had knowledge</b> of his sin <b>at the moment of forgiveness. Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> The halakhic status of <b>any</b> blood <b>that</b> is received in a vessel and <b>is ready to be sprinkled is like</b> that of blood that <b>has</b> already <b>been sprinkled.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Say that Rabbi Shimon said</b> this principle only <b>with regard to an item that is ready to be sprinkled</b> with certainty, <b>but</b> not with regard to the blood of <b>this</b> provisional guilt offering, with regard to which it will be discovered before the sprinkling that he did not sin. In this case, from the outset <b>it</b> was <b>not ready to be sprinkled. They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds:</b> The <b>service vessel consecrates disqualified</b> offerings <b>to be sacrificed</b> on the altar <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a definite guilt offering,</b> that is <b>not so,</b> and likewise in the case of a heifer whose neck is broken that is not so. If the identity of the murderer is discovered before the heifer’s neck was broken, it shall go out and graze among the flock as a non-sacred animal. But if the identity of the murderer was discovered after the heifer’s neck was broken, it shall be buried in its place. It <b>was stated</b> that there is a related dispute between <i>amora’im</i>: <b>From when</b> is it <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from <b>a heifer whose neck is broken? Rav Hamnuna says:</b> The prohibition takes effect <b>from</b> when the animal is still <b>alive. Rava says:</b> The prohibition goes into effect <b>after</b> the <b>breaking of the neck</b> of the animal.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted, according to Rava</b> the prohibition takes effect <b>from the moment that an action,</b> i.e., breaking of the neck, <b>was performed on</b> the heifer. <b>But according to Rav Hamnuna, from when</b> exactly does the prohibition take effect?

Daf 25a

<b>Rabbi Yannai says: I heard</b> an answer with regard to the <b>boundary,</b> i.e., the stage, beyond which <b>it</b> is prohibited, <b>but I have forgotten</b> what it is; <b>and</b> the members of the <b>group</b> of Sages <b>were inclined to say</b> that <b>its descent to</b> the <b>rough,</b> dried-up <b>stream,</b> where its neck is broken, is the action that <b>renders it prohibited.</b>
<b>Rav Hamnuna said: From where do I say</b> that the prohibition takes effect when the animal is alive? I say it from that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 81b): With regard to one <b>who slaughters the</b> red <b>heifer of purification, or an ox that</b> was sentenced to be <b>stoned, or a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> all of which are animals from which deriving benefit is prohibited, <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> one who slaughters them from receiving lashes for violating the prohibition of the slaughter of a mother and its offspring, if the mother was slaughtered on that same day; <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>liable.</b>
Rav Hamnuna explains his proof: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>that I say</b> the prohibition takes effect <b>from</b> the time when the animal is <b>alive, Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis disagree with regard to this</b> matter, as <b>Rabbi Shimon holds: Slaughter that does not</b> render the animal <b>fit</b> for consumption <b>is not considered slaughter.</b> The slaughter of the heifer does not render it fit for consumption, as it was already prohibited to derive benefit from the animal while it is alive. Therefore, he does not violate the prohibition against slaughtering a mother and its offspring.
Rav Hamnuna continues: <b>And the Rabbis say: Slaughter that does not</b> render the animal <b>fit</b> for consumption <b>is considered slaughter,</b> and therefore he is liable for the slaughter of a mother and its offspring. <b>But if you say</b> that the prohibition does not take effect until <b>after the breaking of the neck</b> of the heifer, <b>why does Rabbi Shimon exempt</b> him; <b>it is a slaughter that</b> renders the animal <b>fit</b> for consumption?
<b>And if you would say</b> the reason is that <b>Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that one who performs the breaking of the neck of the <b>heifer by slaughter</b> has performed the mitzva in <b>a fit</b> manner, and consequently that slaughter rendered the heifer prohibited with regard to deriving benefit from it and it is therefore unfit for consumption, that suggestion cannot be correct. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 23b): That which is <b>fit in</b> a red <b>heifer</b> is <b>unfit in a heifer</b> whose neck is broken; that which is <b>fit in a heifer</b> whose neck is broken is <b>unfit in</b> a red <b>heifer.</b> How so? With regard to the red <b>heifer,</b> it is <b>fit with slaughter;</b> it is <b>unfit with breaking the neck.</b> With regard to the <b>heifer</b> whose neck is to be broken, it is <b>fit with breaking the neck;</b> it is <b>unfit with slaughter.</b>
Rava, who holds that the prohibition takes effect only from when the heifer’s neck is broken, <b>was silent,</b> as he had no immediate answer. <b>After</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>left</b> the study hall, Rava <b>said: What is the reason I did not say to him that Rabbi Shimon</b> disagrees with the ruling of that mishna and <b>holds</b> that a heifer whose neck is to be broken is <b>fit</b> even if it is killed <b>by slaughtering?</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> if Rava had given that answer, <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response to that claim: The mishna would <b>not have left out</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> who teaches us</b> that <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is to be broken is <b>fit</b> if it is killed <b>by slaughtering.</b> In other words, there should be some source for this opinion, and in the absence of a source, there is no basis <b>for saying</b> that this <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that the prohibition takes effect when the animal’s neck is broken? I say it <b>from that</b> which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> that is <b>not so;</b> if the identity of the murderer is discovered <b>before</b> the heifer’s <b>neck was broken, it shall go out and graze among the flock,</b> as it is not consecrated, like all other animals. <b>And if you say</b> that the prohibition takes effect <b>from</b> the time when the animal is <b>alive, why</b> does <b>it go out and graze among the flock? Wasn’t</b> the animal <b>prohibited</b> already <b>from</b> when it was <b>alive?</b>
The Gemara rejects this proof: One should <b>teach</b> the mishna as follows: If the identity of the murderer is discovered <b>before</b> the heifer <b>was fit for having</b> its <b>neck broken,</b> i.e., before it descended to a rough, dried-up stream, it shall go out and graze among the flock, but after that time it is prohibited to derive benefit from the animal. Rava raises a further difficulty: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: But if the identity of the murderer was discovered <b>after</b> the heifer’s <b>neck was broken, it shall be buried in its place.</b> This indicates that the prohibition takes effect only after the heifer’s neck is broken. The Gemara rejects this proof in a similar manner: <b>Teach</b> that the mishna says: If the identity of the murderer was discovered <b>after</b> the heifer <b>was fit for having</b> its <b>neck broken</b> it shall be buried.
Rava continues to ask: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: The reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>that from the outset,</b> the heifer whose neck is broken <b>comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty.</b> If its neck was broken before the identity of the murderer was revealed, its mitzva was fulfilled, as <b>it atoned for its uncertainty and</b> that uncertainty <b>is gone. And if</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the animal is <b>alive,</b> the heifer <b>has still not atoned</b> for <b>its uncertainty.</b> Rather, it is clear from the last clause of the mishna that the prohibition takes effect when the heifer’s neck is broken.
The Gemara explains: Although it is evident that the mishna rules that the prohibition takes effect when the heifer’s neck is broken, this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Hamnuna: It <b>is stated</b> in the Torah that there are offerings that <b>enable</b> one to partake of sacrificial foods, e.g., the guilt offering of a leper, <b>and</b> there are offerings that <b>atone,</b> e.g., a sin offering or guilt offering, all of which are brought <b>inside</b> the Temple. <b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>stated</b> in the Torah that there are offerings that <b>enable</b> one to partake of sacrificial foods, e.g., the birds of a leper’s purification ritual, <b>and</b> offerings that <b>atone,</b> e.g., the heifer whose neck is broken, that are brought <b>outside</b> the Temple.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, the offerings brought outside the Temple are compared to those offered inside: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the offerings that <b>enable or atone which are stated</b> in the Torah that are sacrificed <b>inside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>made</b> the offering that <b>enables like</b> the offering that <b>atones,</b> as even the former has portions of it that are burned on the altar, <b>so too,</b> with regard to offerings that <b>enable or atone which are stated</b> in the Torah that are sacrificed <b>outside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>made</b> the offering that <b>enables,</b> e.g., the birds of a leper, <b>like</b> the offering that <b>atones,</b> e.g., the heifer whose neck is broken, in that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from either while they are still alive. According to this <i>baraita</i>, the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited while it is still alive.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person may volunteer</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering every day and at any time that he chooses,</b> even if there is no uncertainty as to whether he sinned, and <b>this</b> type of offering <b>was called the guilt offering of the pious,</b> as they brought it due to their constant concern that they might have sinned. <b>They said about Bava ben Buta that he would volunteer</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering every day except for one day after Yom Kippur,</b> when he would not bring the offering.
Bava ben Buta <b>said:</b> I take an oath by <b>this abode</b> of the Divine Presence that <b>if they would have allowed me, I would have brought</b> a guilt offering even on that day. <b>But they</b> would <b>say to me: Wait until you enter into</b> a situation of potential <b>uncertainty. And the Rabbis say: One brings a provisional guilt offering only</b> in a case where there is uncertainty as to whether he performed a sin for <b>whose intentional</b> performance one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> performance one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering.</b>
Those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>sin offerings and definite guilt offerings for whom Yom Kippur has passed are liable to bring</b> them <b>after Yom Kippur.</b>By contrast, those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>provisional guilt offerings are exempt</b> from bringing them after Yom Kippur. With regard to <b>one who encountered uncertainty</b> as to <b>whether</b> he performed <b>a sin on Yom Kippur, even if</b> it was <b>at nightfall</b> at the end of the day, he is <b>exempt, as the entire day atones</b> for uncertain sins.
<b>A woman upon whom</b> it is incumbent to bring <b>a bird sin offering</b> due to <b>uncertainty,</b> e.g., uncertainty with regard to whether or not her miscarriage obligated her to bring the sin offering of a woman who gave birth, <b>for whom Yom Kippur has passed, is liable to bring</b> it <b>after Yom Kippur.</b> This is <b>because</b> the offering does not come as atonement for a sin; rather, <b>it renders</b> her <b>eligible to partake</b> of the meat <b>of offerings.</b> With regard to this <b>bird sin offering that is brought due to uncertainty, if it became known</b> to her that she was exempt from bringing the offering <b>after</b> the nape of the neck of the bird <b>was pinched,</b> the bird <b>must be buried.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason that Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds that one may volunteer to bring a provisional guilt offering every day and at any time that he chooses? <b>If it enters your mind</b> that a provisional guilt offering <b>is obligatory,</b> then <b>why does he bring a sin offering when it becomes known to him</b> that he sinned? In that case, he has already fulfilled his obligation by sacrificing a provisional guilt offering. <b>Rather, conclude from this</b> inference that a provisional guilt offering <b>is a gift</b> offering.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> would respond: <b>It is a burnt offering and a peace offering that come as a vow and gift</b> offering, <b>but a sin offering and a guilt offering,</b> including a provisional guilt offering, <b>are obligatory. And</b> as for <b>a provisional guilt offering, this is the reason that he brings</b> it <b>before</b> his sin <b>is known to him:</b> It is not to achieve atonement, but <b>to protect him</b> from suffering until his sin is known to him, <b>as the Torah spared the bodies of the Jewish people</b> by commanding them to bring this offering.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> According to the opinion of the Rabbis, one can suggest that <b>perhaps a provisional guilt offering is like a burnt offering and a peace offering: Just as a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> sometimes <b>come as obligatory</b> offerings, e.g., the Festival peace offering and the burnt offering of appearance brought on the pilgrimage Festivals, <b>and they</b> sometimes <b>come as gift</b> offerings, likewise, <b>a provisional guilt offering also</b> sometimes <b>comes as an obligatory</b> offering and sometimes <b>comes as a gift</b> offering <b>as well.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa, son of Rava: <b>A burnt offering and a peace offering are primarily written,</b> i.e., discussed, in the context <b>of a gift</b> offering, and they are brought as obligatory offerings only in specific cases mentioned explicitly in the Torah. By contrast, <b>a provisional guilt offering is primarily written</b> in the context <b>of an obligatory</b> offering, similar to a sin offering and a guilt offering.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches before Rava:</b>

Daf 25b

<b>A provisional guilt offering comes for</b> the uncertain consumption of a non-kosher <b>animal carcass.</b> Rava <b>said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>one brings a provisional guilt offering only for</b> uncertain performance of <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> performance one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> performance one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering?</b> But here the consumption of an animal carcass is a violation of a prohibition that does not entail <i>karet</i> or a sin offering. <b>And if</b> you are referring to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> he maintains that a provisional guilt offering <b>comes also as a gift</b> offering, without any uncertain sin.
Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not learn</b> from Rabba? <b>Many times I taught this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>before the Master. And who is</b> the Master? It is <b>Rabba. And he said to me:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer;</b> nevertheless, it is not in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer’s own opinion that a provisional guilt offering is brought as a gift offering, but rather it is in accordance with the opinion <b>of those who spoke to</b> Bava ben Buta. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>But they say to him: Wait until you enter into a situation</b> of potential <b>uncertainty.</b> According to this opinion, one brings a provisional guilt offering for any manner of uncertain sin.
<b>Rava said: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>those who spoke to</b> Bava ben Buta and said that one may bring a provisional guilt offering for any uncertain sin, not only those stated by the Rabbis? With regard to a provisional guilt offering, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if anyone sins, and does any of the mitzvot of the Lord <b>which may not be done,</b> and he did not know, <b>and he is guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). This indicates that one brings a provisional guilt offering for any form of sin.
<b>Rava said: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: One brings a provisional guilt offering only for</b> the uncertain performance of <b>a matter for whose intentional</b> performance one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> performance one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering?</b> They derive this <i>halakha</i> by a verbal analogy between the word <b>“mitzvot”</b> with regard to a provisional guilt offering and the word <b>“mitzvot” from a sin offering of</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> i.e., a standard sin offering, where it is written: “Any of the mitzvot of the Lord” (Leviticus 4:27).
The Gemara explains the verbal analogy: <b>Just as there,</b> it is referring to a sin <b>for whose intentional</b> performance one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> performance one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering, so too here,</b> a provisional guilt offering is brought for <b>a matter for whose intentional</b> performance one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> performance one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Five guilt offerings atone,</b> whereas <b>a provisional guilt offering does not atone</b> with <b>a complete atonement.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Five guilt offerings atone</b> with <b>a complete atonement</b> to the extent that no further atonement is necessary, <b>but a provisional guilt offering does not atone with a complete atonement,</b> since if it later became known to him that he sinned, he must bring a sin offering to achieve atonement.
<b>And</b> this statement of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> i.e., the opinion of those who spoke to Bava ben Buta, <b>as</b> they <b>say: A provisional guilt offering may come for</b> an uncertain eating of a non-kosher <b>animal carcass.</b> In the case of one who brought a provisional guilt offering for a sin such as the uncertain eating of an animal carcass and later found out that he sinned, he does not bring a sin offering and does not require any additional atonement.
<b>Ravina said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching:</b> With regard to <b>five guilt offerings, nothing else achieves the atonement</b> that <b>they achieve, as one brings</b> these offerings <b>when it becomes known to him</b> that he sinned. By contrast, with regard to <b>a provisional guilt offering, another item achieves the atonement</b> that <b>it achieves, as one does not bring</b> this offering <b>when</b> his uncertain sin <b>becomes known</b> to him. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: Those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>sin offerings and definite guilt offerings for whom Yom Kippur has passed are liable to bring</b> them <b>after Yom Kippur,</b> whereas those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>provisional guilt offerings are exempt</b> from bringing them after Yom Kippur.
§ With regard to those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>sin offerings and definite guilt offerings,</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> Those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>sin offerings and definite guilt offerings for whom Yom Kippur has passed are liable to bring</b> them <b>after Yom Kippur.</b> By contrast, those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>provisional guilt offerings are exempt</b> from bringing them after Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived, that Yom Kippur does not atone for those liable to bring sin offerings and definite guilt offerings?
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall make atonement for the holy place, from the impurity of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). This indicates that <b>sins,</b> i.e., violations committed unwittingly, <b>are similar to transgressions,</b> violations committed intentionally: <b>Just as</b> Yom Kippur atones for <b>transgressions, which are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering,</b> as personal sin offerings are brought only for unwitting sins, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>sins,</b> Yom Kippur <b>atones</b> only for sins <b>that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, but</b> Yom Kippur <b>does not atone</b> for <b>sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>But</b> how can one derive this matter from the verse? <b>When that verse is written, it is written with regard to the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur,<b>which does not atone for a known violation of a mitzva,</b> but only for a violation that is unknown. Perhaps only that offering does not atone for sins that are subject to atonement through an offering, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel, <b>which atones for a known violation of a mitzva, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>it atones even for those sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b>
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the matter is derived <b>from here,</b> a verse that deals with the scapegoat: <b>“And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21). This indicates that <b>sins are similar to transgressions: Just as</b> the scapegoat atones for <b>transgressions, which are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, so too</b> with regard to <b>sins,</b> the scapegoat atones only for sins <b>that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, but</b> it <b>does not atone</b> for <b>sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering. And the verse limited</b> the scope of atonement specifically <b>with regard to the scapegoat,</b> in order <b>to say that</b> despite the scapegoat’s greater capacity to achieve atonement, <b>it does not atone for sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b>
<b>Rav Dimi said to</b> Abaye: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that those transgressions</b> mentioned in that verse <b>are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering? Perhaps those</b> transgressions <b>are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, as we learned</b> in a mishna (9a): There are <b>four</b> who <b>bring</b> an offering <b>for an intentional</b> transgression <b>as</b> they do for <b>an unwitting</b> sin: One who engages in intercourse with an espoused maidservant, a nazirite who became ritually impure, one who falsely takes the oath of testimony that he does not know testimony on behalf of another, and one who falsely takes the oath on a deposit that the item belonging to another is not in his possession. The Gemara does not provide Abaye’s answer to this question at this point.
<b>It was also stated</b> with regard to this matter that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he related a statement that <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21). This indicates that <b>sins are similar to transgressions: Just as</b> the scapegoat <b>atones</b> for transgressions, <b>which are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, so too</b> with regard to <b>sins,</b> the scapegoat <b>atones</b> only for sins <b>that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, but</b> it <b>does not atone</b> for <b>sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b>
<b>Abaye said: I also said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> was derived <b>from that verse, and Rav Dimi raised</b> the following <b>difficulty</b> before <b>me: From where</b> is it known <b>that those transgressions</b> mentioned in the verse <b>are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering? Perhaps those</b> transgressions <b>are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, as we learned</b> in a mishna that there are <b>four</b> who <b>bring</b> an offering <b>for an intentional</b> transgression <b>as</b> they do for <b>an unwitting</b> sin. <b>Ravin said to</b> Abaye: <b>The majority of transgressions are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> Abaye <b>said to him: Is</b> the term <b>majority written</b> in that verse?
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that an answer to Rav Dimi’s question can be inferred <b>from the beginning of the verse: “And he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b>“iniquities”</b> is referring to <b>those</b> sins that were performed <b>intentionally. And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Because he despised the word of the Lord, and has broken His commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off, <b>his iniquity shall be upon him”</b> (Numbers 15:31).
Abaye continues: If so, when it states: <b>“And all their transgressions, for all their sins,” why do I</b> need the verse to mention <b>“all</b> their transgressions,” which is also referring to sins that were intentionally performed? It is written <b>to juxtapose</b> sins <b>to transgressions: Just as</b> the scapegoat atones for <b>transgressions,</b> the majority of <b>which are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, so too</b> with regard to <b>sins,</b> it atones only for sins <b>that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, but</b> it <b>does not atone</b> for <b>sins that are subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: Those <b>liable</b> to bring <b>provisional guilt offerings</b> are exempt from bringing them after Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> With regard to Yom Kippur <b>the verse states:</b> “For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; <b>from all your sins</b> you shall be pure <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). This indicates that <b>Yom Kippur atones</b> for <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> i.e., an uncertain sin that renders one liable to bring a provisional guilt offering.
<b>Rav Taḥlifa, father of Rav Huna bar Taḥlifa, said in the name of Rava:</b> With regard to <b>the first</b> clause in the mishna <b>as well:</b> Those liable to bring sin offerings and definite guilt offerings for whom Yom Kippur has passed are liable to bring them after Yom Kippur, <b>one cannot bring</b> a convincing proof

Daf 26a

and find a way <b>to explain</b> that <i>halakha</i>, <b>neither from</b> that statement <b>of Rav Dimi,</b> who derived it from the verse: “And from their transgressions, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16), <b>nor from that</b> statement <b>of Abaye,</b> who derived it from the verse: “For all their transgressions, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:21).
<b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from that</b> which Rabbi Elazar said: With regard to Yom Kippur the verse states: “From all your sins before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:30). This indicates that <b>Yom Kippur atones</b> for <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> i.e., an uncertain sin for which one brings a provisional guilt offering. <b>And from that</b> statement it is derived that <b>it is</b> only for <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware that Yom Kippur atones, but it does not atone</b> for a sin <b>about which</b> the sinner <b>is aware.</b>
<b>And Rav Taḥlifa, father of Rav Huna,</b> further <b>says in the name of Rava: Those liable to</b> receive <b>lashes for whom Yom Kippur has passed</b> are <b>liable</b> to receive those lashes after Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? What is</b> the <b>difference between</b> this case and the case of <b>those liable to</b> bring <b>sin offerings and definite guilt offerings,</b> who must bring them after Yom Kippur?
The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say: There,</b> where the liability to bring sin offerings and definite guilt offerings <b>is financial</b> in nature, Yom Kippur does not exempt one from financial obligations. <b>But here, where</b> the liability to incur lashes applies to one’s <b>body,</b> one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> flogged after Yom Kippur. Therefore, Rav Taḥlifa <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.
The Gemara asks: How can Rava say that Yom Kippur does not exempt one from the liability to incur lashes? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 2b): For other prohibitions that are stated in the Torah, apart from those delineated in that mishna, whether <b>one became aware</b> of them before Yom Kippur <b>or did not become aware</b> of them until after Yom Kippur, whether they are <b>positive</b> mitzvot <b>or prohibitions,</b> Yom Kippur atones for them. This is the <i>halakha</i> despite the fact that one who transgresses a prohibition is liable to incur lashes.
The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of Rava is referring to a transgression about <b>which</b> witnesses <b>warned him,</b> and therefore he is liable to incur lashes, and Yom Kippur does not completely atone for him. <b>That</b> mishna is referring to a transgression about <b>which they did not warn him,</b> and he is not liable to incur lashes, and therefore Yom Kippur provides full atonement.
The Gemara now analyzes the above statement: Those liable to bring provisional guilt offerings are exempt from bringing them after Yom Kippur because Yom Kippur atones for a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware. Before beginning its discussion, which consists of a series of queries starting with the phrase: <b>If that is so,</b> the Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the topics it will address: <b>A woman who gave birth; a leper; a nazirite; a <i>sota</i>; in a heifer.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If that is so, that Yom Kippur atones for a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware, <b>a woman who gave birth who</b> is <b>uncertain</b> whether her miscarriage obligated her to bring a sin offering <b>should not bring</b> her sin offering after <b>Yom Kippur has passed, due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur atoned for her. As this is</b> a case of <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> since God alone knows the nature of her miscarriage. <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> With regard to Yom Kippur the verse states: <b>“For all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), indicating that Yom Kippur atones for all their sins <b>but not for all their impurity.</b> A woman who gives birth does not bring a sin offering for atonement, but rather in order to purify her and thereby enable her to consume sacrificial meat.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, who says: A woman who gave birth is a sinner, what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: Even according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>when a woman who gave birth brings an offering,</b> she brings it in order <b>to permit</b> her to <b>eat sacrificial</b> food, which is the final stage in her process of purification; <b>but she does not bring</b> the offering <b>for atonement.</b> Therefore, she must bring her offering after Yom Kippur, as Yom Kippur effects atonement but not purification.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>we learn</b> in the mishna (25a) <b>as well: A woman upon whom</b> it is incumbent to bring <b>a bird sin offering</b> due to <b>uncertainty,</b> e.g., uncertainty as to <b>whether</b> her miscarriage obligated her to bring the sin offering of a woman who gave birth, <b>for whom Yom Kippur has passed, is liable to bring</b> it <b>after Yom Kippur.</b> This is <b>because</b> the offering does not come as atonement for a sin. Rather, <b>it renders</b> her <b>eligible to partake</b> of the meat <b>of offerings.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>an uncertain leper</b> who is obligated to bring an offering for purification <b>for</b> whom <b>Yom Kippur has passed should not bring</b> his offering, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur has passed for him, as this is</b> a case of <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> since God knows if he is impure. <b>Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that the verse states: <b>“For all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), <b>but not for all their impurity,</b> and this offering is also brought for purification.
The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Leprous <b>marks come due to seven matters,</b> i.e., there are seven sins that are the possible causes of leprosy. The Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for these seven sins: <b><i>Gimmel</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>tzadi</i>.</b> This stands for <i>gilui arayot</i>, forbidden sexual intercourse; <i>gasut haruaḥ</i>, arrogance; <i>gezel</i>, robbery; <i>shefikhut dammim</i>, bloodshed; <i>shevuat shav</i>, an oath taken in vain; <i>lashon hara</i>, slander; and <i>tzarut ha’ayin</i>, stinginess (see <i>Arakhin</i> 16a). Since leprosy develops because of some sin, this means that the leper’s offerings are also brought because of sin. The Gemara explains: Even so, <b>when a leper brings</b> an offering, <b>he does not bring</b> the offering <b>for atonement. Rather, it is</b> brought in order <b>to permit</b> him to <b>eat sacrificial</b> food. Therefore, he must bring his offering after Yom Kippur.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that Yom Kippur atones for a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware, then in a case of <b>an uncertain nazirite,</b> i.e., when it is uncertain if the nazirite became impure through contact with the dead, which would obligate him to bring an offering for purification, <b>for whom Yom Kippur has passed,</b> he should <b>not bring an offering, due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur atoned</b> for him, <b>as this</b> too <b>is a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware.</b> Once again, <b>Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that the verse states that Yom Kippur atones <b>“for all their sins,” but not for all their impurity.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben HaKappar, who says: A nazirite is a sinner,</b> as he has caused himself to suffer by abstaining from wine, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers similarly: Even so, <b>when a nazirite brings an offering, he does not bring</b> the offering <b>for atonement.</b> Rather, he brings <b>it</b> in order <b>to permit</b> him to <b>eat sacrificial</b> food. Consequently, he must bring his offering after Yom Kippur.
The Gemara continues to object: <b>If that is so, an uncertain <i>sota</i>,</b> i.e., a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful who then secludes herself with another man, <b>for whom Yom Kippur has passed,</b> should <b>not bring</b> an offering, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur has atoned for her, as this is a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware. Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that the verse states: <b>“For all their sins,” but not for all their impurity,</b> and the actions of a <i>sota</i> are referred to as rendering her impure (see Numbers 5:13).
<b>Abaye said</b> a different answer: This is not a case of a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware, because the <b>paramour,</b> i.e., the man suspected of having had intercourse with her, <b>knows about</b> her sin. <b>Rava said</b> that the case of a <i>sota</i> is not difficult: <b>When a <i>sota</i> brings</b> an offering, <b>she brings</b> it in order <b>to clarify</b> the existence of <b>iniquity,</b> but not for atonement.
The Gemara raises another difficulty in the same format as above: <b>If that is so,</b> in the case of <b>a heifer whose neck is broken, with regard to which Yom Kippur has passed,</b> the heifer should not be brought, as this is a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware, since the identity of the murderer is unknown. <b>Abaye said:</b> The <b>murderer</b> himself <b>knows</b> that he is the guilty party. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein,</b> but by the blood of him who shed it” (Numbers 35:33).This indicates that atonement for murder can be achieved only by means of the heifer whose neck is broken or capital punishment for the murderer, not by Yom Kippur.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> another answer: <b>The verse states</b> that the priests at the ceremony of the heifer whose neck is broken should recite the following sentence: <b>“Forgive,</b> Lord, <b>Your people Israel,</b> whom You have redeemed” (Deuteronomy 21:8). The verse indicates that <b>this atonement,</b> which is achieved through the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>is</b> also <b>fit to atone</b> retroactively <b>for those who left Egypt,</b> i.e., every case of unknown murder that occurred since the Jews left Egypt. It can be inferred from here that Yom Kippur of previous years have not atoned for those past murders.
§ The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Now that you said</b> that <b>Yom Kippur atones for a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>when</b> his sin <b>becomes known to him after Yom Kippur as well, he should not bring a sin offering. Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>you cannot say</b> this, <b>as</b> a term of <b>knowing is written</b> in <b>a verse</b> three times (see Leviticus 4:14, 23, 28): <b>With regard to</b> an individual’s <b>sin offering and with regard to</b> the sin offering of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>, and with regard to a communal</b> sin offering. Since it was not necessary to repeat an expression of knowing in all three instances, this teaches that anyone who knows about his sin must bring a sin offering, even if he became aware after Yom Kippur.
The Gemara rejects this derivation: All three instances of a term of knowing <b>are necessary</b> to teach that each sin offering is brought only for a known sin and not for an uncertain sin, and therefore no instance of the term is superfluous. The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, if the verse</b> had <b>stated</b> a term of knowing <b>with regard to</b> the sin offering of <b>an individual, I would say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>all</b> sin offerings, i.e., of a <i>Nasi</i> and the community, <b>cannot be derived from</b> the sin offering of <b>an individual, as</b> this suggestion <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the sin offering of <b>an individual?</b> It is unique in <b>that all of his</b> sin <b>offerings are female,</b> either a ewe or a female goat, whereas a <i>Nasi</i> brings a male goat, and the sin offering of the community is a bull.
The Gemara continues: And if you would say: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>write</b> a term of knowing <b>with regard to</b> the sin offering of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>, and let these,</b> the sin offerings of an individual and the community, <b>be derived from</b> that of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>,</b> this derivation can likewise be rejected.
The Gemara elaborates: The sin offering of <b>an individual cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>, as</b> this suggestion <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the sin offering of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>?</b> It is unique and more lenient than the sin offering of an individual <b>in that</b> a <i>Nasi</i>, i.e., a king, <b>is not included in</b> the obligation of a sin offering for <b>hearing a voice,</b> i.e., taking a false oath that one did not witness an event (see Leviticus 5:1), as a king may not testify. Can <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to an individual, who is included in</b> the obligation of a sin offering for <b>hearing a voice?</b>
<b>And</b> furthermore, the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a communal</b> sin offering <b>cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>, as</b> this suggestion <b>can</b> likewise <b>be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the sin offering of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>?</b> It is unique <b>in that</b> there is <b>in his</b> types of <b>offering</b> a case of <b>a female</b> offering, for an unintentional sin of idol worship, whereas a communal sin offering is always male.
The Gemara continues: And if you would say: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>write</b> a term of knowing <b>with regard to</b> the sin offering of the <b>community, and let</b> the sin offerings of <b>an individual and a <i>Nasi</i> be derived from it,</b> this derivation <b>can</b> likewise <b>be refuted,</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the sin offering of the <b>community?</b> It is unique and more lenient <b>in that there is</b> a sin offering <b>only for an unwitting</b> communal sin due to a mistaken ruling of the Sanhedrin <b>accompanied by unwitting action</b> of the community following their ruling, which is not the case with regard to the sin offerings of an individual and a <i>Nasi</i>.
The Gemara suggests: Granted that two instances of a term of <b>knowing cannot be derived from one</b> instance of a term of <b>knowing.</b> Nevertheless, <b>let one</b> instance of a term of <b>knowing be derived from</b> the other <b>two,</b> as follows: <b>Let</b> the Torah <b>not write</b> a term of <b>knowing with regard to</b> the sin offering of <b>an individual, and let it be derived from</b> the sin offering of <b>a <i>Nasi</i> and</b> that of the <b>community.</b>
The Gemara explains that this suggestion <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the sin offerings of <b>a <i>Nasi</i> and</b> the <b>community,</b> in which both share a leniency? They are unique <b>in that they are not included in</b> the obligation of a sin offering for <b>hearing a voice.</b> Can <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to an individual, who is included in</b> the obligation of a sin offering for <b>hearing a voice?</b>
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let the verse not write</b> a term of <b>knowing with regard to</b> the sin offering of the <b>community, and let it be derived from</b> the instances of a term of <b>knowing</b> that are written with regard to the sin offerings <b>of an individual and a <i>Nasi</i>.</b> The Gemara again explains that this suggestion <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the sin offerings of <b>an individual and a <i>Nasi</i>?</b> They are unique <b>in that</b> there <b>is</b> a case <b>of a female offering</b> brought by them. Can <b>you say</b> the same with regard to the sin offering of the <b>community,</b> where there <b>is no</b> case <b>of a female offering</b> brought by a community?
The Gemara continues to suggest: <b>Let</b> the Torah <b>not write</b> a term of knowing <b>with regard to</b> the sin offering of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>, and let it be derived from</b> the instances of a term of <b>knowing</b> that are written with regard to the sin offerings <b>of an individual and</b> the <b>community. What</b> can you say to <b>refute</b> this suggestion? <b>If</b> you refute this <b>due to the fact that</b> a communal sin offering is more lenient, as <b>it is not included in</b> the obligation of a sin offering for <b>hearing a voice,</b> the sin offering of <b>an individual, which is included in</b> the obligation of a sin offering for <b>hearing a voice, proves</b> that this is not the decisive consideration.
<b>And if</b> you refute this suggestion <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> an individual sin offering is more lenient because <b>all his</b> sin <b>offerings are female,</b> the sin offering of the <b>community, where</b> there <b>is no</b> case <b>of a female offering, proves</b> that this is not the key factor. Since for both of these categories of sin offering <b>there is no obligation</b> to bring a sin offering <b>until there is knowledge</b> of the sin, <b>why do I</b> need a term of <b>knowing that is written with regard to</b> the sin offering of <b>a <i>Nasi</i>?</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>If</b> this term of knowing <b>is not</b> necessary for the <b>matter of</b> the sin offering of a <i>Nasi</i> <b>itself, as it is</b> already <b>derived from</b> the cases of <b>an individual and</b> the <b>community, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> a case <b>where</b> his sin <b>becomes known to him</b> only <b>after Yom Kippur,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> in such an instance <b>he brings a sin offering.</b>
<b>Abaye said: If</b> the Torah <b>had not stated</b> a term of <b>knowing with regard to a <i>Nasi</i>, it</b> could <b>not</b> have been <b>derived from</b> the cases of <b>an individual and</b> the <b>community, because</b> this suggestion <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the sin offerings of <b>an individual and</b> the <b>community?</b> They are unique <b>in that</b> both are set offerings that <b>are not apt to change.</b> Can <b>you say</b>

Daf 26b

the same <b>with regard to a <i>Nasi</i>, whose</b> offering <b>is apt to change</b> if he leaves his position, e.g., when he becomes impure as a leper (see <i>Horayot</i> 10a), as in such a case he brings the sin offering of an individual?
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that Yom Kippur does not atone for one who is liable to bring a sin offering can be derived <b>from here: Since</b> there is a verbal analogy between the word <b>“mitzvot”</b> mentioned with regard to the sin offerings of an individual and the word <b>“mitzvot”</b> mentioned with regard to a <i>Nasi</i> and with regard to the community, the <i>halakhot</i> of these three cases <b>are derived from one another.</b>
And <b>since</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of these cases <b>are derived from one another, why do I</b> need a term of <b>knowing to be written three</b> separate times, <b>with regard to an individual, and with regard to a <i>Nasi</i>, and with regard to</b> the <b>community? If</b> this term of knowing <b>is not</b> necessary for the <b>matters of</b> these sin offerings <b>themselves,</b> to teach that one brings a sin offering only for a known sin, <b>as</b> this <b>is</b> already <b>derived</b> from the verbal analogy of <b>“mitzvot”</b> and <b>“mitzvot,” apply it</b> to the <b>matter</b> of a case <b>where</b> his sin <b>becomes known to him</b> only <b>after Yom Kippur.</b> The <i>halakha</i> in that case would therefore be <b>that he brings a sin offering.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>say</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>when</b> his sin <b>becomes known to him after Yom Kippur that he brings a sin offering, because Yom Kippur did not come</b> to atone <b>for that</b> specific <b>sin. But</b> with regard to <b>a provisional guilt offering, which comes</b> to atone <b>for that</b> specific <b>sin, say indeed that he has achieved atonement.</b> Therefore, <b>if</b> his sin <b>becomes known to him after he brought a provisional guilt offering</b> he should <b>not bring a sin offering.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> in explanation that <b>the verse states:</b> “If his sin that he has sinned <b>be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), indicating that one is obligated to bring a sin offering <b>in any case</b> where his sin becomes known to him. The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you say</b> that <b>when</b> one’s sin <b>becomes known to him he brings a sin offering, why does a provisional guilt offering come? Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The reason is <b>that if</b> one <b>dies</b> before his sin becomes known to him, he <b>dies without iniquity. Rava objects to this</b> claim: If he <b>dies, death</b> itself <b>absolves</b> him, and therefore there is no need for a provisional guilt offering. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The reason that a provisional guilt offering is brought is in order <b>to protect him from suffering</b> until he brings his sin offering.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a bird sin offering that is brought due to uncertainty,</b> e.g., it is uncertain if she gave birth to a non-viable newborn, which results in an obligation to bring an offering, or if it was an amorphous mass, which does not, if it became known to her after the nape of the neck of the bird was pinched, the bird must be buried. It is assumed at this point that the phrase: It became known to her, is referring to a case where it became known to her that she certainly gave birth in a manner for which she is obligated to bring the sin offering of a woman after childbirth. In this context, <b>Rav says: And</b> the bird <b>atoned</b> for her after its blood was sprinkled and squeezed out on the wall of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the bird atones, then it should be eaten by the priests, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a bird sacrificed as a sin offering. <b>Why,</b> then, does the mishna state that <b>it must be buried?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> a bird brought due to uncertainty is unfit to be eaten, the priest diverted his attention from the bird, and <b>it</b> was left <b>unguarded.</b> Therefore, there is a concern that the meat became impure. The Gemara asks: <b>When</b> was <b>it</b> left <b>unguarded? If</b> this means it was unguarded <b>at the outset,</b> before the pinching of the nape, the bird <b>was</b> still <b>alive,</b> and a living animal is not susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>If</b> this means <b>later,</b> after the pinching of the nape, the priest <b>guards it</b> at that stage.
<b>Rather, the mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where it became known to her that she did not give birth</b> to a non-viable newborn and therefore she did not need to bring an offering.<b>And by right</b> it should have been <b>permitted to derive benefit</b> from the bird, as it is non-sacred. <b>And</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the reason for the mishna’s statement that <b>it must be buried?</b> This obligation applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> to prevent people from mistakenly thinking that it is permitted to derive benefit from a bird brought as a sin offering due to uncertainty.
<b>And that</b> statement <b>of Rav,</b> that she receives atonement, <b>was stated with regard to</b> the ruling of a previous mishna (22b): In the case of <b>a woman who brought a bird sin offering in</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether her miscarriage obligated her to bring a sin offering, in which case the sin offering may not be eaten by priests, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>If before</b> the nape of the neck of the bird <b>was pinched it became known to her that she certainly gave birth</b> to a non-viable newborn, <b>she should render</b> the offering <b>a definite</b> sin offering, <b>as from the</b> same <b>type</b> of animal <b>that she brings</b> a sin offering <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to her that she gave birth, <b>she</b> likewise <b>brings</b> a sin offering <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>known</b> to her.
<b>If after</b> the nape of the bird <b>was pinched it became known to her that she</b> certainly <b>gave birth,</b> in such a case <b>Rav says:</b> The priest <b>sprinkles its blood and squeezes out its blood</b> on the wall of the altar, <b>and she has achieved atonement</b> and fulfilled her obligation; and the bird is <b>permitted in consumption</b> by the priests. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In such a case, even if the blood was sprinkled and squeezed out on the wall of the altar, the bird is <b>prohibited in consumption,</b> due to a rabbinic <b>decree, lest</b> people <b>say: A bird</b> that is <b>brought</b> as <b>a sin offering due to uncertainty is consumed.</b>
<b>Levi teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>a bird sin offering that is brought due to uncertainty, if after</b> the nape of the neck of the bird <b>was pinched it became known that she certainly gave birth,</b> the priest <b>sprinkles its blood and squeezes out its blood, and she has achieved atonement;</b> and the bird is <b>permitted in consumption.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>a bird sin offering that is brought due to uncertainty, if before</b> the nape of the bird <b>was pinched it became known to her that she did not give birth,</b> the bird is <b>transferred to non-sacred</b> status <b>or is sold to another</b> woman who is obligated to bring a bird sin offering. <b>If before</b> the nape of the bird <b>was pinched it became known to her that she certainly gave birth,she should render</b> the offering <b>a definite</b> sin offering, <b>as from the type</b> of animal <b>that she brings</b> a sin offering <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to her that she gave birth, <b>she brings</b> a sin offering <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>known</b> to her.
<b>If after</b> the nape of the bird <b>was pinched it became known that she gave birth,</b> the priest sprinkles its blood and squeezes out its blood, and she has received atonement; but consumption of the bird is prohibited. And if the blood was already squeezed out, then it <b>is even prohibited to derive benefit</b> from the bird, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of any bird brought as a sin offering due to uncertainty. The reason is <b>that</b> this sin offering <b>was initially brought due to uncertainty;</b> and <b>it atoned for its uncertainty, and</b> that uncertainty <b>is gone.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who designates two <i>sela</i>,</b> which is the minimal value of a guilt offering,<b>to</b> purchase a ram for <b>a guilt offering,and he purchased two rams for a guilt offering with</b> the two <i>sela</i>, <b>if one of them is</b> now <b>worth two <i>sela</i>, he shall sacrifice</b> it <b>for his guilt offering. And the second</b> ram that he purchased with the money he designated does not become non-sacred. Rather, it <b>shall graze until it becomes blemished; and</b> then <b>it shall be sold, and</b> the <b>money</b> received <b>for it shall be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.
If <b>he purchased two rams for non-sacred</b> use <b>with</b> those two <i>sela</i> designated for a guilt offering, he has misused consecrated property. He is therefore liable to bring a guilt offering and to compensate the Temple treasury for those two <i>sela</i> and add one-fifth to the sum for a total of ten dinars, as there are four dinars in a <i>sela</i>. If <b>one</b> of the rams <b>is</b> now <b>worth two <i>sela</i>, and</b> the other <b>one is</b> now <b>worth ten dinars,</b> i.e., two and a half <i>sela</i>, <b>the</b> one <b>that is worth two <i>sela</i> shall be sacrificed as his guilt offering</b> for misuse of the two <i>sela</i>, <b>and the second one</b> shall be sacrificed <b>for his</b> initial <b>misuse,</b> as it is worth two <i>sela</i> plus one-fifth.
In a case where he purchased two rams with those two <i>sela</i> designated for a guilt offering, <b>one for a guilt offering and one for non-sacred</b> use, <b>if</b> the ram <b>for</b> the <b>guilt offering is</b> now <b>worth two <i>sela</i>, it shall be sacrificed for his</b> initial <b>guilt offering. And</b> with regard to <b>the second</b> ram that he purchased for non-sacred use, if it is now worth two <i>sela</i>, it shall be sacrificed as a guilt offering for <b>his</b> present <b>misuse, and he brings with it</b> the sum of <b>one <i>sela</i> and one-fifth</b> to the Temple treasury as payment for his misuse.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the term: <b>His misuse,</b> referring to, with regard to the <i>halakha</i> <b>that is taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna: If he purchased two rams for non-sacred use with those two <i>sela</i> designated for a guilt offering, if one of the rams is now worth two <i>sela</i> and the other one is worth ten dinars, the one that is worth two <i>sela</i> shall be sacrificed as his guilt offering <b>and the second one</b> shall be sacrificed <b>for his misuse?</b>
<b>If we say</b> that the term: His misuse, is referring to the <b>ram</b> that one is obligated to bring as <b>a guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property, is this <b>to say that</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> for misuse of consecrated property <b>is brought together with the ram</b> that he brings as a guilt offering for that sin? If so, then this would explain why if that ram offering is valued as more than two <i>sela</i>, the additional value fulfills the obligation of giving an additional one-fifth. <b>But isn’t it written: “And he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss with consecrated property, and he shall add to it one-fifth”</b> (Leviticus 5:16)? The verse <b>apparently</b> indicates that <b>he brings</b> the additional one-fifth <b>together with</b> his repayment for <b>that which he stole</b> from consecrated property.
<b>And furthermore, it is taught in the latter clause</b> of the mishna: In a case where he purchased two rams with those two <i>sela</i> designated for a guilt offering, <b>one for a guilt offering and one for non-sacred</b> use, <b>if</b> the ram <b>for</b> the <b>guilt offering is</b> now <b>worth two <i>sela</i>, it shall be sacrificed for his guilt offering. And</b> with regard to <b>the second</b> ram that he purchased for non-sacred use, if it is now worth two <i>sela</i>, it shall be sacrificed <b>for his misuse, and he brings with it</b> payment of <b>one <i>sela</i> and one-fifth</b> to the Temple treasury as payment for his misuse. <b>Evidently, he brings</b> the <b>one-fifth together with</b> his repayment for <b>that which he stole</b> from consecrated property.
<b>Rather,</b> when the mishna states: The ram worth ten dinars shall be sacrificed <b>for his misuse,</b> it means as repayment for <b>that which he derived benefit from consecrated</b> property. <b>And those are</b> the <b>two <i>sela</i> that he</b> initially <b>designated for a guilt offering and with which he bought two rams as non-sacred</b> animals. The Gemara explains: The reason for this is <b>that</b> the ram <b>worth two <i>sela</i> he sacrifices for his ram of the guilt offering</b> for his trespass, <b>and</b> the ram <b>worth ten dinars he gives for that which he derived benefit from consecrated</b> property, as he used two <i>sela</i> of consecrated property, <b>which are</b> for <b>that which he stole,</b> equal to eight dinars <b>plus</b> an additional <b>one-fifth,</b> the extra two dinars. <b>And</b> if so, to <b>what is</b> the term: <b>His misuse,</b> referring? It is not referring to the ram brought as a guilt offering for his misuse of consecrated property, but rather to the repayment for <b>that which he stole</b> from consecrated property.
The Gemara asks: With reference <b>to what</b> case <b>did you interpret</b> the term: <b>His misuse,</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna? It was interpreted as referring to the repayment for <b>that which he stole</b> from consecrated property. If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: In a case where he purchased two rams with those two <i>sela</i> designated for a guilt offering, <b>one for a guilt offering and one for non-sacred</b> use, <b>if</b> the ram <b>for</b> the <b>guilt offering is</b> now <b>worth two <i>sela</i>, it shall be sacrificed for his</b> initial <b>guilt offering. And</b> with regard to <b>the second</b> ram that he purchased for non-sacred use, if it is now worth two <i>sela</i>, it shall be sacrificed <b>for</b> his <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>and he brings with it</b> payment of <b>one <i>sela</i> and one-fifth</b> to the Temple treasury as payment for his misuse.
Since the mishna teaches that he gives one <i>sela</i> and one-fifth as repayment for that which he stole, <b>evidently</b> the term: <b>His misuse,</b> is referring to the <b>ram</b> that he brings as <b>a guilt offering.</b> The Gemara questions this inconsistency: <b>The first clause</b> uses the term: <b>His misuse, in reference to</b> the repayment for <b>that which he stole,</b>

Daf 27a

whereas <b>the latter clause</b> uses the term: <b>His misuse, in reference to the ram</b> he brings as <b>a guilt offering.</b>
The Gemara answers: In <b>the first clause, where</b> he purchased two non-sacred rams with two dinars of consecrated money, the value of the <b>bigger ram is equal to the principal plus its one-fifth</b> that he is obligated to repay for that which he stole. Therefore, the mishna uses the term: <b>His misuse, in reference to</b> repayment for <b>that which he stole.</b> In <b>the latter clause, where</b> he purchased one non-sacred ram with one dinar of consecrated money, the value of the <b>bigger ram is not equal to the principal plus one-fifth.</b> Consequently, the mishna uses the term: <b>His misuse, in reference to</b> the <b>ram</b> he brings as <b>a guilt offering, and he brings</b> together <b>with it</b> payment of <b>one <i>sela</i> and its one-fifth.</b>
§ <b>Rav Menashya bar Gadda raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> one who misused consecrated property several times until the <b>accumulation of one-fifths</b> that he owes totals two <i>sela</i>: May he bring a guilt offering with that money and thereby <b>achieve atonement?</b>
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma. <b>Do we say: If you say</b> that <b>a person can achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property, e.g., if one initially purchased a ram worth one <i>sela</i> and then its market value increased to two <i>sela</i> while the animal was in his possession, this is <b>because he exerted</b> himself <b>with regard to</b> the animal by caring for it while it was in his possession. <b>But here, where he did not exert</b> himself, but the value accumulated on its own, <b>he cannot achieve atonement.</b>
<b>Or perhaps</b> we say the opposite: <b>If you say</b> that <b>a person cannot achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property, this is <b>because he did not designate</b> the ram as an offering when it was worth two <i>sela</i>, and its value appreciated on its own. <b>But here,</b> with regard to <b>the accumulation of one-fifths, where he designated</b> the total value as consecrated property, <b>it is</b> possible <b>to say</b> that <b>he can receive atonement</b> by bringing a guilt offering with that money. The Gemara notes <b>that</b> this <b>dilemma</b> itself <b>was raised</b> before the Sages: Can one <b>achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property that occurred while the animal was in his possession, <b>or not?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: With regard to <b>one who designates two <i>sela</i></b> to purchase a ram <b>for a guilt offering and he purchased two rams for a guilt offering with</b> the two <i>sela</i>, if <b>one of them was</b> now <b>worth two <i>sela</i>, he shall sacrifice</b> it <b>for his guilt offering. And the second</b> ram that he purchased with the money that he designated does not become non-sacred. Rather, it <b>shall graze until it becomes blemished; and</b> then <b>it shall be sold, and</b> the <b>money</b> received <b>for it shall be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>What, is it not</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he bought the ram for four</b> dinars, which is equal to one <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> its value <b>appreciated</b> while in his possession <b>until</b> it was <b>worth eight</b> dinars, or two <i>sela</i>, and the mishna rules he may bring this ram as a guilt offering? <b>And</b> if so, <b>conclude from this</b> mishna that <b>a person can achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No; what are we dealing with here?</b> It is with a ram that was worth two <i>sela</i> at the time of purchase, but the <b>shepherd</b> who sold it <b>reduced</b> the price <b>for him.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:9): With regard to one who <b>purchased a ram for one <i>sela</i> and he fattened</b> the ram <b>and</b> thereby <b>established</b> its value <b>at two</b> <i>sela</i>, it is <b>valid</b> for sacrifice as a guilt offering. <b>Conclude from this</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>a person can achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No;</b> the case of <b>one who fattened</b> an animal <b>is different, as he lost eight</b> dinars, which is two <i>sela</i>, in expenses for the animal, including the price he paid. But he cannot achieve atonement if the animal’s value appreciated on its own while in his possession.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of the same <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>purchased a ram for one <i>sela</i> and</b> now <b>it has</b> appreciated <b>to</b> the value of <b>two</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>it is valid</b> for sacrifice as a guilt offering. The Gemara explains: <b>Here too,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where one fattened</b> the ram.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, this is</b> the same case as in <b>the first clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i> and is therefore unnecessary. The Gemara answers: <b>The first clause</b> is dealing with one <b>who purchased</b> a ram <b>for four</b> dinars <b>and he increased</b> its value <b>by</b> spending <b>another four</b> dinars to fatten the animal, which means <b>that he lost eight</b> dinars, which equal two <i>sela</i>, in total expenses on the ram. <b>The latter clause</b> is discussing a case <b>of</b> one <b>who purchased a ram for four</b> dinars <b>and he increased</b> its value <b>by</b> spending <b>another three</b> dinars to fatten it, <b>and</b> then the ram appreciated one more dinar on its own, and is now <b>worth eight</b> dinars.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: And in addition <b>he shall pay</b> one <b><i>sela</i></b> to the Temple treasury. Why is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Didn’t he lose seven</b> dinars in total expenses on the ram, four dinars for its purchase and three for fattening it, and therefore the ram added only one dinar of value on its own? The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement: <b>He shall pay?</b> The <i>baraita</i> is teaching that he must <b>complete</b> the payment <b>of</b> the <b><i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., by giving one additional dinar.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if one maintains that a person cannot achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property, <b>what is</b> the significance <b>of</b> the fact <b>that he gives</b> one dinar that is the <b>completion of</b> the payment of the <b><i>sela</i>? We require</b> him to bring <b>a ram that</b> cost him <b>two <i>sela</i>, and there is no</b> such animal here. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>a person can achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so, he</b> should <b>not give</b> the one dinar that is the <b>completion of</b> the payment of one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> as the ram is now worth two <i>sela</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>This is the reason that he must give</b> the one dinar that is <b>the completion of</b> the payment of one <b><i>sela</i>:</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree, lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>a ram</b> worth <b>less than two <i>sela</i> atones</b> as a guilt offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> the question of whether a person can achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated property? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a ram that was <b>worth</b> one <b><i>sela</i> at the time</b> that <b>it was designated</b> as a guilt offering, and then its value appreciated until it was <b>worth two <i>sela</i> at the time of atonement,</b> one who sacrificed it has <b>not fulfilled his obligation</b> with that ram. This demonstrates that one cannot achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated property.
<b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who was apparently unaware of the previously cited <i>baraita</i>, <b>raised</b> the same <b>dilemma: Can a person achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property that occurred while the animal was in his possession, <b>or not? Rabbi Yoḥanan said,</b> in puzzlement: <b>How many years</b> has <b>this</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>grown among us</b> and learned Torah from me, <b>and</b> yet <b>he did not hear this <i>halakha</i> from me.</b>
The Gemara asks: Should one conclude <b>by inference</b> from this statement <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to this matter? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and he said that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to this</b> ruling, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 79b): In the case of the <b>offspring</b> of an animal designated as <b>a thanks offering or</b> an animal that is <b>its substitute, and likewise</b> if <b>one designated</b> an animal as <b>his thanks offering and it was lost and he designated another in its stead,</b> and the first animal was then found, in all three cases, the second animal, i.e., the offspring, the substitute, or the replacement, is sacrificed, but it <b>does not require</b> the bringing of <b>loaves</b> with it.
<b>And</b> with regard to the offspring of a thanks offering, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina sent</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to the Sages in Babylonia containing the following statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> That mishna <b>taught that the offspring does not require loaves only</b> in a case where they were sacrificed <b>after</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement</b> by sacrificing the mother and sprinkling its blood, since he has thereby fulfilled his obligation, <b>as</b> the <b>offspring does not require</b> the bringing of <b>loaves.</b>
<b>But</b> if one sacrificed the offspring <b>before</b> he achieved <b>atonement</b> through sacrifice of the mother, then the offspring <b>requires</b> the bringing of <b>loaves,</b> as it is the fulfillment of his obligation to bring a thanks offering. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that a person <b>can achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property, as this offspring of a consecrated animal is considered its enhancement.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma:</b> If consecrated <b>living animals</b> were rendered unfit to be sacrificed, are they permanently <b>disqualified or not? Rabbi Yoḥanan said,</b> in puzzlement: <b>How many years</b> has <b>this</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>grown among us</b> and learned Torah from me, <b>and</b> yet <b>he did not hear this <i>halakha</i> from me.</b>
The Gemara asks: Should one conclude <b>by inference</b> from this statement <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to this matter? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>an animal</b> that belongs <b>to two partners,</b> if one of them <b>consecrated</b> the <b>half of it</b> that belonged to him, <b>and then acquired its</b> other <b>half</b> from his partner <b>and consecrated it,</b>it is <b>consecrated but it may not be sacrificed. And it renders</b> a non-sacred animal for which it is exchanged consecrated as <b>a substitute, and its substitution is like it,</b> i.e., it too is consecrated but it may not be sacrificed.
One can <b>conclude from this</b> ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>. <b>Conclude from it</b> that <b>consecrated living animals can be</b> permanently <b>disqualified.</b> When he consecrated only half of the animal it was not fit for sacrifice, and this meant that the animal was permanently disqualified even after it became fully consecrated. <b>And conclude from it</b> that <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in an animal’s <b>value disqualifies</b> another animal, i.e., the substitute. The sanctity is considered inherent in its value because only half of the animal was initially consecrated. <b>And conclude from it</b> that <b>there is disqualification with regard to monetary</b> value, i.e., even an animal that is consecrated only for its monetary value can be disqualified from sacrifice.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma:</b> If the price of <b>lambs depreciated in the world</b> and one cannot find a ram valued at two <i>sela</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>we require</b> an offering that fulfills the condition: <b>“Your choice vows”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:11), <b>and that</b> requirement <b>is</b> fulfilled, as he is bringing the best animal available? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> a guilt offering to be purchased in accordance with the verse: <b>“Silver by shekels”</b> (Leviticus 5:15), i.e., two <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> that requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: How many years have we grown in the study hall and we have not heard this <i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> has this <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> been heard? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah not provide a fixed</b> value for offerings brought by <b>those lacking atonement,</b> who must bring an offering of purification for them to be permitted to eat consecrated meat, e.g., a <i>zav</i> and a leper? It is because the price of <b>lambs might depreciate</b> below the Torah’s fixed value <b>and they would have no remedy to eat sacrificial</b> food. This statement indicates that one may not bring a ram that is worth less than two <i>sela</i> for a guilt offering, as the Torah fixed its value. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: How many years <b>have we not taught this <i>halakha</i></b> in the study hall.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Zeira bar Adda review his studies before</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>every thirty days,</b> which indicates that the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan were repeatedly studied? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan said that <b>this <i>halakha</i> was not asked from us in the study hall.</b>
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah not provide a fixed</b> value for offerings brought by <b>those lacking atonement?</b> It is because the price of <b>lambs might depreciate</b> below the Torah’s fixed value <b>and they would have no remedy to eat sacrificial</b> food.
<b>Abaye objects to this</b> statement: <b>If that is so, let a fixed</b> value <b>be provided for a sin offering</b> brought for eating prohibited <b>fat,</b> i.e., a regular sin offering, <b>as it is brought for atonement and it is not</b> brought <b>to permit consumption of sacrificial</b> food. Similarly, <b>Rava objects to this</b> statement: <b>If that is so, let there be a fixed</b> value in the Torah <b>for a guilt offering</b> brought by an impure <b>nazirite, as it comes for naught,</b> i.e., it does not come to permit consumption of sacrificial food, which is achieved by his purification rite of the sprinkling from the ashes of the red heifer upon him on the third and seventh days. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Nothing comes for naught other than the guilt offering of a nazirite alone.</b> The Gemara notes that this matter is indeed <b>difficult.</b>

Daf 27b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who designates a sin offering</b> for <b>his</b> performance of an unwitting sin <b>and dies, his son shall not bring it in his stead,</b> neither on behalf of his father nor for his own unwitting sin, even if it was the same transgression. Likewise, <b>one may not bring</b> a sin offering by reassigning it <b>from</b> the <b>sin</b> for which it is designated to atone and sacrificing it <b>for</b> atonement of another <b>sin. Even if he designated</b> a sin offering as atonement <b>for</b> forbidden <b>fat that he</b> unwittingly <b>ate yesterday, he may not bring it</b> as atonement <b>for</b> forbidden <b>fat that he</b> unwittingly <b>ate today, as it is stated:</b> “And he shall bring <b>his</b> sin <b>offering,</b> an unblemished female goat, <b>for his sin</b> that he has sinned” (Leviticus 4:28), indicating that he does not satisfy his obligation <b>until his offering is</b> brought <b>for the sake of</b> the <b>sin</b> for which he designated it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> i.e., that a son may not bring his father’s sin offering, derived? The Gemara answers that it is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to a sin offering: “And he shall bring for <b>his offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:23). This indicates that <b>one fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering,</b> if his father was obligated to bring a sin offering and died after he designated an animal for this purpose.
One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering by</b> means of <b>an animal that his father designated,</b> only in a case where the son’s transgression is not equal in severity to his father’s sin, e.g., <b>from a lenient</b> transgression committed by the father <b>for a severe</b> sin of the son, <b>or from a severe</b> transgression of the father <b>for a lenient one</b> of the son. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>he</b> does <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with</b> the <b>offering that his father designated, from a lenient</b> sin <b>for a lenient</b> sin of the son, <b>or from a severe</b> transgression committed by the father <b>for a severe</b> one of the son. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> a second time: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), to emphasize that <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering,</b> even for similar transgressions.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with his father’s offering by</b> means of <b>an animal</b> that the father <b>designated, even from a lenient</b> sin <b>for a lenient</b> one, <b>or from a severe</b> transgression <b>for a severe</b> one, as stated above, <b>as</b> a person <b>cannot shave,</b> i.e., bring the offerings sacrificed, at the end of <b>his term of naziriteship with an animal that his father designated.</b> If the father died, the son cannot bring an animal that the father designated as an offering for the conclusion of his naziriteship.
<b>But</b> one might think that a son can <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with money that his father designated</b> for his offering, <b>even from a lenient</b> sin <b>for a severe</b> one, <b>or from a severe</b> transgression <b>for a lenient</b> one, <b>as a person can shave</b> i.e., bring the offerings sacrificed, at the end of <b>his term of naziriteship with the money his father designated</b> for naziriteship <b>when</b> the money <b>is unallocated but not when it is allocated</b> for a specific nazirite offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> again: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), indicating that <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with his</b> own <b>offering, but he does not fulfill</b> his obligation even <b>with</b> money that was designated for <b>his father’s offering.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> further states: One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>even with</b> the <b>money that</b> his father <b>designated, even</b> when father and son committed transgressions of the same severity, i.e., <b>from a lenient</b> sin <b>for a lenient</b> one <b>or from a severe</b> transgression <b>for a severe</b> one; <b>but</b> one may <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with</b> the <b>offering that he designated for himself, even from a severe</b> transgression <b>for a lenient</b> one, <b>or from a lenient</b> one <b>for a severe</b> one. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His offering for his sin”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), indicating that he does not fulfill his obligation <b>until</b> his offering <b>is</b> sacrificed <b>for the sake of</b> the specific <b>sin</b> for which it was designated.
Furthermore, one <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering</b> for <b>himself with an animal that he designated for himself, even</b> with an animal designated <b>for a lenient</b> sin that is then used <b>for</b> a different <b>lenient</b> sin <b>or from a severe</b> one <b>for</b> a different <b>severe</b> one. This is <b>because if he designated an animal</b> as a sin offering <b>for</b> unintentionally eating forbidden <b>fat and he brought</b> that sin offering <b>for</b> unintentionally consuming <b>blood,</b> or if he designated a sin offering <b>for</b> consuming <b>blood and brought</b> it <b>for</b> the transgression of consuming forbidden <b>fat,</b> it is invalid, <b>as</b> in this case <b>he</b> is <b>not</b> considered to have <b>misused</b> consecrated property <b>and</b> this animal <b>does not atone</b> for him. This statement will be explained below.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> it might have been thought that one <b>fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with money that he designated for himself,</b> with money designated <b>for a lenient</b> sin <b>for</b> a different <b>lenient</b> sin, <b>or</b> with money designated <b>for a severe</b> sin <b>for</b> another <b>severe</b> sin, <b>or from a severe</b> one <b>for a lenient</b> one, <b>or from a lenient one for a severe</b> one.
The reason is <b>that if he designated money for himself for</b> purchasing a sin offering for unintentionally eating forbidden <b>fat and he</b> instead <b>brought</b> a sin offering with that money <b>for</b> consuming <b>blood; or</b> if he designated money for purchasing a sin offering <b>for</b> the transgression of consuming <b>blood and brought</b> the sin offering <b>for</b> the transgression of consuming forbidden <b>fat,</b> in that case he <b>has misused</b> Temple property, <b>and</b> the money <b>atones</b> for him. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His offering for his sin,”</b> which indicates that he does not fulfill his obligation <b>until his offering,</b> and even the money designated for an offering, <b>is</b> designated <b>for the sake of his</b> particular <b>sin.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>He</b> is <b>not</b> considered to have <b>misused</b> consecrated property <b>and</b> this animal <b>does not atone</b> for him? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Shimi interpreted</b> this <b>before Rav Pappa: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Since</b> one <b>cannot misuse</b> this animal, i.e., an animal consecrated for sacrifice upon the altar cannot be desacralized, <b>so too, one cannot achieve atonement</b> for another sin with that animal. <b>Since it is so,</b> it is clear that one is <b>unable to convert</b> the animal for use as an offering for a different sin.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>money, since if one</b> unwittingly <b>converted</b> the money for a different use <b>he has misused</b> consecrated property, the money is consequently desacralized, <b>and</b> he is liable to <b>bring an offering</b> for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, therefore one might <b>say</b> that <b>from the outset too,</b> he may use the money to <b>bring</b> an offering for a different sin. Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that one may not do so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may bring a female goat from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>a female lamb,</b> and <b>a female lamb from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>a female goat. And</b> likewise, one may bring <b>doves and pigeons from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>a female lamb and a female goat; and one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>doves and pigeons.</b>
<b>How so? If</b> one unwittingly performed a sin for which he is liable to bring a sliding-scale sin offering, which varies based on economic status (see Leviticus 5:1–13; see also 9a), and he <b>designated</b> money <b>to</b> purchase <b>a female lamb or for a female goat</b> and then <b>became poorer, he may bring a bird,</b> and the remaining money is non-sacred. If <b>he became</b> yet <b>poorer, he may bring one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour. Likewise, if <b>he designated</b> money <b>to</b> purchase <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour and <b>became wealthier, he shall bring a bird.</b> If <b>he became</b> yet <b>wealthier, he shall bring a female lamb or a female goat.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> that are mentioned in the mishna derived? The Gemara answers that they are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the sliding-scale offering: It is written with regard to one who brings a lamb for his obligation: “And the priest shall make atonement for him <b>from his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:6); and it is written with regard to one who brings a bird: “And the priest shall make atonement for him <b>from his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:10); and it is written with regard to one who brings one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour: <b>“Over his sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:13). <b>What</b> is the meaning of these phrases that <b>the verse states?</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>you say that one may bring a female goat from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>a female lamb, and a female lamb from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>a female goat? And</b> likewise, from where is it derived that one may bring <b>doves and pigeons from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>a female lamb and a female goat, and one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering of <b>doves and pigeons?</b>
<b>How so? If</b> a person <b>designated</b> money <b>to</b> purchase <b>a female lamb or to</b> purchase <b>a female goat and</b> then <b>became poorer, he shall bring a bird,</b> and the remaining money is non-sacred. If <b>he became</b> yet <b>poorer, he shall bring one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour. Likewise, if <b>he designated</b> money to purchase <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>and became wealthier, he shall bring a bird.</b> If <b>he became</b> yet <b>wealthier, he shall bring a female lamb or a female goat.</b>
If <b>one designated a female lamb or goat</b> as an offering <b>and it developed a blemish,</b> he must redeem the animal and bring another offering with the money. If he became poorer, <b>he may bring a bird with its money.</b> But if <b>one designated a bird</b> as an offering <b>and it developed a blemish, he may not bring one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>with its money, as there is no</b> possibility of <b>redemption for birds.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> provides the source for this entire <i>halakha</i>: <b>Therefore,</b> with regard to an offering of a female goat or lamb and a bird offering <b>it is stated: “From his sin,”</b> which indicates that one fulfills his obligation with even part of the money that was designated for his offering. By contrast, with regard to an offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour it is written: <b>“Over his sin,”</b> indicating that if one becomes wealthier he must add to the value of his offering.
<b>And it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write: “From his sin,” with regard to a female lamb or a female goat, and it was necessary to write</b> the same phrase <b>with regard to a bird.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>As, if the verse had written</b> this phrase only <b>with regard to a consecrated female lamb or a female goat, I would say</b> that if one <b>designated</b> money to purchase <b>a female lamb,</b> then <b>when he became poorer he may redeem that money on a bird</b> and <b>bring a bird</b> offering, <b>as a female lamb and a bird are both types of blood</b> offerings.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour, <b>which is not a type of blood</b> offering but a meal offering, <b>if the verse had not written: “From his sin,” with regard to a bird, I would say</b> that <b>if one designates money for his nest,</b> i.e., pair of birds, <b>and</b> then <b>becomes poorer, he may not bring one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour with that money, <b>as it is not a type of blood</b> offering. <b>Rather, he brings one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>from his house,</b> i.e., with other money, <b>and that money that he designated</b> for his bird pair <b>is allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. <b>Therefore, the verse repeats</b> and <b>writes: “From his sin,” with regard to a bird, to say that one may also bring one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>from</b> money <b>consecrated</b> for a sin offering <b>of birds.</b>
<b>And</b> with regard to the phrase: “Over his sin,” which is written in connection to the one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour, <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: When one designates</b> money <b>for</b> an offering of <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour, <b>and before he brought</b> the money to the Temple to purchase the offering <b>he grew wealthier, he must add</b> money <b>to</b> those coins <b>and bring a bird.</b> If <b>he grew</b> even <b>wealthier, he must add</b> money <b>to them and bring a female lamb or a female goat.</b>
<b>And what is the reason</b> that the phrase: <b>“Over his sin,”</b> is <b>written</b> specifically <b>with regard to the one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour? The reason is <b>that if</b> the verse <b>had stated: Over his sin, with regard to a bird, I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>when one designates money for his nest and</b> then <b>becomes wealthier that one must add</b> money <b>and bring a female lamb or a female goat, as they are both types of blood</b> offerings.
<b>But</b> in a case where <b>one designated money to</b> purchase <b>one-tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>and became wealthier,</b> perhaps he may not add to the money <b>that he designated</b> earlier. And <b>if he did not become much wealthier he</b> now <b>brings a bird, and if he became much wealthier he</b> now <b>brings a female lamb or a female goat,</b> without using the money he had designated for the one-tenth of the ephah of flour. <b>And that money which he</b> initially <b>designated</b> for one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour <b>is allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. It is <b>for this</b> reason that <b>the verse states: “From his sin,” with regard to that sin offering</b> which one brings when <b>rich and</b> when <b>poor,</b> i.e., a lamb and a bird, <b>and: “Over his sin,” with regard to</b> that which he brings when he is <b>exceedingly poor,</b> i.e., one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour, <b>so</b> that one should <b>interpret</b> the verses <b>as we said,</b> that in either case he adds to the money he had designated to bring the more expensive offering.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: A wealthy person who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he enters the Temple while ritually impure, is obligated to bring a female lamb or goat as his offering in accordance with his wealth. If <b>he designated a nest,</b> i.e., a pair of birds,

Daf 28a

instead <b>of a female lamb, and he</b> then <b>became poorer,</b> a bird pair is now the appropriate offering for him. Nevertheless, <b>since</b> his offering <b>was disqualified</b> at the outset because at that time he was obligated to bring a female lamb, <b>it is</b> permanently <b>disqualified.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> One can <b>conclude from this</b> ruling <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>. <b>Conclude from it</b> that <b>consecrated living animals can be</b> permanently <b>disqualified</b> even if the animal is unblemished, as is the case with regard to this pair of birds. <b>And</b> conclude from it that when there is <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in an animal’s <b>value,</b> where the consecrated item will not be sacrificed as an offering, it can be <b>disqualified.</b> When he was wealthy and designated the bird pair as his offering, the two birds were consecrated only with sanctity that inheres in their value because they were unfit for sacrifice, and yet the birds were permanently disqualified.
<b>And</b> finally, conclude from this that <b>a disqualification at the outset,</b> when the animal is initially consecrated, <b>is</b> considered a permanent <b>disqualification.</b> Not only is an animal that was initially fit to be sacrificed and was later disqualified permanently disqualified, but even in a case such as this, where the birds were unfit for sacrifice from the beginning, the disqualification is permanent.
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Temura</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who designates a female</b> animal <b>for his Paschal offering before Passover,</b> since the Paschal offering must be a male it is left to <b>graze until it becomes blemished,</b> at which point <b>it is sold and one brings a Paschal offering with the money</b> received from its sale. Similarly, if this animal <b>gave birth to a male</b> animal, the offspring is left to <b>graze until it becomes blemished,</b> at which point <b>it is sold and one brings a Paschal offering with the money</b> received from its sale.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is not necessary to sell the offspring in such a case, as the offspring <b>itself is sacrificed</b> as <b>a Paschal offering. Conclude from this</b> statement of Rabbi Shimon that <b>consecrated living animals are not</b> permanently <b>disqualified,</b> as the mother was unfit to be a Paschal offering and yet the offspring, which is an extension of the mother’s sanctity, is fit for sacrifice.
<b>The school of Rabbi Oshaya say: When we say</b> that consecrated living animals can be permanently disqualified, this applies <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that the offspring is not sacrificed. Nevertheless, it is correct <b>that Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that consecrated <b>living animals are not</b> permanently <b>disqualified.</b>
<b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon likewise maintains <b>that</b> the <b>drawing</b> of the lots for the two goats on Yom Kippur to decide which goat is designated as a sacrifice and which is designated as the scapegoat, <b>is not indispensable. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one of</b> the goats <b>died</b> following their designation, one <b>brings another</b> goat instead of it, and it is designated <b>without drawing</b> lots. The surviving goat is still used for the purpose for which it was designated by the lot; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>Evidently, Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> Consecrated <b>living animals are not</b> permanently <b>disqualified.</b> Although the surviving goat was disqualified when the other goat died, it is once again fit when a new goat is designated as its partner. <b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon also holds that the <b>drawing</b> of the lots <b>is not indispensable,</b> as the new goat was designated without drawing lots.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds, <b>are designated,</b>one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering, <b>only</b> in the following manner: <b>Either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or,</b> if the owner did not designate the birds at that stage, by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice.</b>
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written</b> with regard to the offering of a woman after childbirth: <b>“And she shall purchase two doves</b> or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:8). And with regard to the offering of a leper it is written: <b>“And the priest shall sacrifice</b> the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering” (Leviticus 15:30). Together, these verses indicate that one bird is designated as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering <b>either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Sifra</i> that discusses the drawing of lots for the two goats of Yom Kippur. The verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall sacrifice it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). This teaches that the drawing of <b>the lot renders it a sin offering, but</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> of the goat <b>does not render it a sin offering, and</b> likewise the act of the <b>priest,</b> placing the lot on the goat, <b>does not render it a sin offering.</b>
A verse is required to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have come to the opposite conclusion: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>And if in a case where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot does not sanctify</b> an animal with a specific designation, e.g., a woman after childbirth, who cannot determine by lot the status of the two birds she must bring, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, nevertheless, in such a case a verbal designation of <b>the name does sanctify</b> with a specific designation; <b>is it not logical</b> in <b>a case where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot sanctifies</b> an animal with a specific designation, i.e., the two goats of Yom Kippur, <b>that</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> should <b>sanctify</b> it with a specific designation?
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Therefore <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to one of the two goats of Yom Kippur: <b>“He shall sacrifice it for a sin offering,”</b> to teach that the drawing of <b>the lot renders it a sin offering, but</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> of the goat <b>does not render it a sin offering.</b>
The Gemara explains the objection: The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that verbally designating the <b>name</b> of an offering <b>is similar to</b> drawing <b>a lot.</b> If so, one can reason as follows: <b>Just as</b> the drawing of <b>a lot</b> is <b>not</b> performed <b>at</b> the time of <b>purchase nor at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice, so too</b> verbal designation of <b>the name also</b> does <b>not</b> have to be performed <b>at</b> the time of <b>purchase nor at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice.</b> This contradicts the opinion of Rav Ḥisda.
<b>Rav said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: And if in a place where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot,</b> either by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice, does not sanctify</b> an animal with a specific designation, and nevertheless a verbal designation of <b>the name, either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice, does sanctify</b> it with a specific designation; <b>here,</b> with regard to the two goats, <b>where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot</b> that does <b>not</b> take place <b>at</b> the time of <b>purchase nor at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice sanctifies</b> the animal with a specific designation, <b>is it not logical that</b> verbally designating <b>the name, either at</b> the time of <b>purchase or at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice,</b> should <b>sanctify</b> it with a specific designation?
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall sacrifice it for a sin offering,”</b> to teach that drawing <b>the lot renders it a sin offering, but</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> of the goat <b>does not render it a sin offering.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a poor person who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he entered the Temple while ritually impure, <b>who designated money for his nest,</b> as he is required to bring one bird as a sin offering and another bird as a burnt offering, <b>and he</b> then <b>became wealthier,</b> he is now obligated to bring a female lamb or goat as a sin offering.
If he was unaware that he is no longer obligated to bring a pair of birds, and he <b>says: This</b> money <b>is for my sin offering and this</b> money <b>is for my burnt offering,</b> which is an error, as he is not obligated to bring a burnt offering, <b>he adds</b> more money <b>and brings his obligation</b> of a lamb or goat for his sin offering <b>from</b> the <b>money</b> designated <b>for his sin offering. But he may not add</b> more money <b>and bring his obligation</b> of a sin offering <b>from</b> the <b>money</b> designated <b>for his burnt offering,</b> as one may not use money that is designated for a burnt offering for the purchase of a sin offering.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>But here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case where he said: This money is for my sin offering and that money is for my burnt offering, which means that he designated the money at a stage <b>that was not</b> the time of <b>purchase nor</b> the time of <b>sacrifice; and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the designation is established and therefore <b>he brings his obligation</b> of a sin offering <b>from</b> the <b>money</b> designated for <b>a sin offering but not from</b> the <b>money</b> designated for <b>a burnt offering.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet said: And can you understand</b> that <b>this <i>baraita</i> is properly</b> explained, i.e., the <i>baraita</i> as it stands is difficult, <b>as it teaches: He became wealthier</b> and said: This money is for my sin offering and this money is for my burnt offering. <b>But</b> this is difficult, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: A wealthy person who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he entered the Temple while ritually impure,<b>who brought</b> the <b>offering</b> of <b>a poor person</b> to atone for his transgression has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation. Since he cannot fulfill his obligation with that offering, how can his designation permanently establish the status of the money?
<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> You must say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he already said:</b> This money is for my sin offering and this money is for my burnt offering, <b>at the time</b> when <b>he was poor. So too,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he already said</b> it even earlier, <b>at the time</b> when <b>he designated</b> the money, and therefore there is no difficulty for Rav Ḥisda.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Ḥagga,</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says</b> that a wealthy person who brings the offering of a poor person has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, there is no inherent difficulty in the <i>baraita</i> that necessitates Rav Sheshet’s interpretation, and therefore that <i>baraita</i> apparently contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. The Gemara answers that one should <b>teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>And after</b> he became wealthier, <b>he purchased</b> animals <b>and said</b> at the time of purchase: This is designated as my sin offering and this as my burnt offering.
With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Ḥagga in the case of a wealthy person who brings the offering of a poor person, the Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A poor leper who brought the offering of a wealthy person</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. By contrast, <b>a wealthy</b> leper <b>who brought the offering of a poor person</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion <b>that Rabbi Ḥagga</b> says that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says.</b>
The Gemara explains that Rabbi Ḥagga could have <b>said to you:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different with regard to</b> a wealthy <b>leper, as the Merciful One excluded</b> the possibility of a wealthy person bringing the offering of a poor person in the verse: <b>“This</b> shall be the law of the leper” (Leviticus 14:2). The emphasis of “this” teaches that a leper fulfills his obligation only with the appropriate offering.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a verse, then <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a poor leper who brings the offering of a wealthy person as well,</b> he should <b>not fulfill</b> his obligation. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: This is <b>not so,</b> as <b>the verse returned</b> to state: “This shall be <b>the law</b> of the leper,” which includes a leper who brings an inappropriate offering. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“the law</b> of the leper” serves <b>to include a poor leper who brought the offering of a wealthy person,</b> that he <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a wealthy</b> leper <b>who brought the offering of a poor person, he</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This</b> shall be the law.”
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> why not <b>derive</b> a principle <b>from that</b> verse that with regard to any sliding-scale offering, a wealthy person who brings a poor person’s offering has not fulfilled his obligation? The Gemara answers: With regard to a leper <b>the verse states: “And if he is poor and cannot afford”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The emphasis of “he” teaches that <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a leper that a wealthy person who brought a poor person’s offering</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he entered the Temple while ritually impure, <b>a wealthy person who brought a poor person’s offering</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned, as in the verse: “You shall take it from the lambs or from the goats” (Exodus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b>
Similarly, <b>doves precede pigeons</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah, as in the verse: “And he shall bring his guilt offering…two doves, or two pigeons” (Leviticus 5:7). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> doves <b>are more select than</b> pigeons. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 12:6), with the usual order reversed, which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b>
Likewise, mention of <b>the father precedes</b> that of <b>the mother</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah, as in the verse: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the honor of the father takes precedence over the honor of the mother.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Every man shall fear his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), with the order reversed, which <b>teaches that both of them are equal. But the Sages said:</b> Honor of <b>the father takes precedence over</b> honor of <b>the mother everywhere, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both the son <b>and his mother are obligated in the honor of his father.</b>
<b>And likewise with regard to Torah study, if the son was privileged</b> to acquire most of his Torah knowledge from studying <b>before the teacher,</b> honor of <b>the teacher takes precedence over</b> honor of <b>the father, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both the son <b>and his father are obligated in the honor of his teacher,</b> as everyone is obligated in the honor of Torah scholars.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s discussion of lambs and goats, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Temple <b>courtyard cried four cries. The first cry</b> was: <b>Remove Ḥofni and Pineḥas the sons of Eli</b> the priest <b>from here, as they have rendered the Sanctuary</b> in Shiloh <b>impure</b> (see I Samuel 4:13–22).
<b>The second cry</b> was: <b>Open</b> the <b>gates, and let Yoḥanan ben Nedavai, the student of Pinkai, enter and fill his belly with</b> meat of <b>offerings</b> consecrated to <b>Heaven,</b> as he is worthy to eat offerings. <b>They said about ben Nedavai that he would eat four <i>se’a</i> of doves</b>

Daf 28b

<b>for dessert. They said:</b> Throughout <b>all the days</b> of Yoḥanan ben Nedavai <b>there was never</b> sacrificial meat <b>left over in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> as he would ensure that it was eaten.
<b>The third cry</b> was: <b>Lift your heads, O gates, and let Elishama ben Pikai, the student of Pineḥas,</b> son of Elazar, son of Aaron the priest, <b>enter and serve as High Priest,</b> as he is worthy.
<b>The fourth cry</b> was: <b>Open</b> the <b>gates and expel Yissakhar from the village of Barkai, as he honors himself and desecrates</b> items <b>consecrated</b> to <b>Heaven. What would he do</b> to deserve such a reputation? He would <b>wrap silk [<i>shira’ei</i>] over his hands and perform the</b> Temple <b>service,</b> as he was unwilling to dirty his hands.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> ultimately <b>happened to</b> Yissakhar from the village of Barkai? <b>Yannai the king, and the queen were sitting</b> and discussing food. <b>The king said</b> that <b>goat</b> meat <b>is better</b> food than lamb meat, <b>and the queen said lamb</b> meat is the <b>better</b> food. <b>They said: Let us ask Yissakhar from the village of Barkai, as he is the High Priest and is very familiar with</b> various <b>dishes.</b>
<b>They asked him,</b> and <b>he said to them: If goat</b> meat <b>were better,</b> it would be <b>sacrificed as the daily offering.</b> The fact that the daily offering is lamb proves that its meat is preferable to that of goat. <b>As he spoke, he signaled</b> contemptuously <b>with his hand. The king said to</b> his attendants: <b>Since he signaled</b> contemptuously <b>with his hand, sever his right hand.</b> Yissakhar <b>gave a bribe, and</b> the official <b>severed his left hand</b> instead. <b>The king heard</b> that Yissakhar had deceived him, <b>and said: Let</b> the official <b>sever his right hand as well. Rav Yosef said: Blessed is the Merciful One, who took retribution [<i>lematrapsei</i>] on Yissakhar of the village of Barkai.</b> His punishment fit his crime; since he would not dirty his hands with sacrificial blood, both his hands were severed.
<b>Rav Ashi said,</b> with regard to this incident: Yissakhar of the village of Barkai <b>did not study that which we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned. One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if</b> he bring <b>a lamb</b> as his offering for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b>
<b>Ravina said:</b> Yissakhar did <b>not even read the Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to the peace offering: <b>“If</b> he sacrifices <b>a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 3:7), and it further states: <b>“If a goat</b> is his offering” (Leviticus 3:12). These verses indicate that one is permitted to bring whichever animal he wishes, and there is no preference.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children [<i>banayikh</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: Do not read: Your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but rather: Your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>], referring to the scholars who build the world through their Torah study and performance of mitzvot.
