Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When one brings a meal offering to the Temple, the priest removes a handful from it, places the handful into a service vessel, conveys it to the altar, and burns it. At that point, the remainder is permitted to the priests for consumption and the owner has fulfilled his obligation. In this context, the mishna teaches: <b>All the meal offerings</b> from <b>which a handful was removed not for their sake</b> but for the sake of another meal offering <b>are fit</b> for sacrifice. <b>But</b> these offerings <b>did not satisfy the obligation of the owner,</b> who must therefore bring another offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all meal offerings <b>except for the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy,</b> which is brought as part of the rite of a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]. In those cases, if the priest removed the handful not for its own sake, the offering is disqualified.
With regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful not for their sake,</b> or where <b>he placed</b> a handful from them <b>in a vessel, or conveyed</b> the handful to the altar, <b>or burned</b> the handful on the altar, <b>not for their sake, or for their sake and not for their sake, or not for their sake and for their sake,</b> they <b>are disqualified.</b>
The mishna elaborates: <b>How</b> are these rites performed <b>for their sake and not for their sake?</b> It is in a case where one removed the handful with two intentions: <b>For the sake of the meal offering of a sinner and for the sake of a voluntary meal offering.</b> How are these rites performed <b>not for their sake and for their sake?</b> It is in a case where one removed the handful with two intentions: <b>For the sake of a voluntary meal offering and for the sake of the meal offering of a sinner.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: All the meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake but for the sake of another meal offering are fit for sacrifice, but these offerings did not satisfy the obligation of the owner. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach: But</b> these offerings did not <b>[<i>ella</i></b> <i>shelo</i>] satisfy the obligation of the owner? <b>Let it teach</b> simply: <b>And they did not [<i>velo</i>] satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> What does the word <i>ella</i> add?
The Gemara responds: By adding this word, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the only deficiency of these offerings is that <b>they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner; but the meal offering itself</b> is <b>valid and</b> it is still <b>prohibited to deviate</b> from the protocol of its sacrificial process. For example, if a handful was removed from a meal offering not for its own sake, it is prohibited to also burn it not for its own sake. This <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a burnt offering that one slaughtered not for its own sake,</b> it is still <b>prohibited to sprinkle its blood</b> on the altar <b>not for its own sake.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument</b> to support this statement; <b>and if you wish, cite a verse</b> as proof. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Just <b>because one deviated</b> from protocol <b>in its</b> sacrifice once, by removing the handful, could it be that <b>he should continue to deviate</b> from protocol <b>in all</b> the rest of the sacrificial rites? One deviation does not justify additional deviations.
<b>And if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed as a gift offering to the Lord your God,</b> that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Gemara analyzes the verse: Is it <b>a gift</b> offering? <b>It is a vow</b> offering. Why does the verse first <b>call it a vow</b> offering <b>and</b> subsequently <b>call it a gift</b> offering? <b>Rather,</b> the verse teaches that <b>if you acted in accordance with how you vowed,</b> i.e., if you sacrificed the offering for its own sake, your obligation to fulfill your <b>vow will be</b> fulfilled; <b>but if</b> you did <b>not</b> act in accordance with your vow, it does not fulfill the obligation incurred by the vow, and <b>will be</b> considered <b>a gift</b> offering.

Daf 2b

The Gemara concludes the proof from the verse: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>is it permitted to deviate</b> from <b>its</b> protocol <i>ab initio</i>? Clearly one may not do so. Accordingly, if one of the sacrificial rites of a meal offering was performed for the sake of a different meal offering, it is still prohibited to perform any of its other sacrificial rites improperly.
§ The mishna teaches that all the meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit for sacrifice but they do not fulfill the obligation of the owner. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All the meal offerings</b> from <b>which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit</b> for sacrifice <b>and they</b> even <b>satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Conversely, consecrated animals that were sacrificed not for their sake do not fulfill the obligation of the owner, <b>as</b> in this regard <b>meal offerings are not similar to slaughtered offerings.</b> The difference is <b>that</b> when <b>one removes a handful</b> from <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of a deep-pan</b> meal offering, <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is in fact <b>for the sake of a pan</b> meal offering, as the two offerings differ in appearance. Similarly, with regard to <b>a dry</b> meal offering, e.g., the meal offering of a sinner, which contains no oil, whose handful is removed <b>for the sake of</b> a meal offering that is <b>mixed</b> with oil, <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is <b>for the sake of a dry</b> meal offering, and one’s improper intent is therefore disregarded.
<b>But with regard to slaughtered offerings it is not so, as</b> there is <b>one</b> manner of <b>slaughter for all</b> offerings, <b>and one</b> manner of <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>for all</b> offerings, <b>and one</b> manner of <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>for all</b> offerings. Since the differentiation between slaughtered offerings is established only through intention, one who sacrifices an animal offering not for its own sake does not fulfill the obligation of the owner. Rabbi Shimon apparently disagrees with the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna on two counts: First, he claims that if the handful of a meal offering was removed not for its own sake it satisfies the obligation of the owner, whereas the mishna teaches that the obligation is not fulfilled. Second, Rabbi Shimon does not differentiate between the meal offering of a sinner or the meal offering of jealousy, and the other types of meal offerings.
The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well,</b> i.e., the mishna can be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>according to Rav Ashi, who says</b> (3b), in a resolution of two apparently contradictory statements of Rabbi Shimon: <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering is fit and fulfills the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> one states that he is <b>removing a handful</b> from <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of a deep pan,</b> i.e., he mentions only the vessel, not the type of meal offering. Conversely, <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering does not satisfy the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> one states that he is <b>removing a handful</b> from <b>a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering.</b>
Accordingly, it can be explained that <b>the mishna is</b> referring to a case where one removes a handful from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> another <b>meal offering,</b> which is why it does not satisfy the obligation of the owner. <b>But according to</b> the statements of <b>Rabba and Rava,</b> who resolved that contradiction in a different manner, <b>what can be said?</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>And if you would say</b> that the contradiction addressed by Rav Ashi is resolved <b>as Rabba answers,</b> this is problematic. Rabba resolved the contradiction as follows: <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of sanctity,</b> i.e., it was sacrificed for the sake of another type of meal offering, whereas <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that it does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of owner,</b> e.g., the meal offering of Reuven was sacrificed for the sake of Shimon.
The Gemara explains that the reason this is problematic is that if one accepts Rabba’s resolution, how can the mishna be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? <b>The mishna is</b> clearly discussing the case of <b>a change of sanctity, as it teaches: How</b> are these rites performed <b>for their sake and</b> then <b>not for their sake,</b> whereby the offering does not satisfy the owner’s obligation? It is in a case where one initially removed the handful <b>for the sake of the meal offering of a sinner and</b> then <b>for the sake of a voluntary meal offering.</b> This is a change involving a different type of meal offering.
<b>And alternatively,</b> if you would say that the contradiction addressed by Rav Ashi is resolved <b>as Rava answers,</b> this is equally problematic. Rava resolved the contradiction as follows: <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where one removes a handful</b> from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> another <b>meal offering,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that it does not satisfy the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where one removes a handful</b> from <b>a meal offering for the sake of a slaughtered offering.</b>
The Gemara explains that if one accepts Rava’s resolution, the mishna cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: <b>The mishna is</b> discussing a case where one removes a handful from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> another <b>meal offering, as it teaches:</b> How are these rites performed <b>not for their sake and for their sake?</b> It is a case where one removed the handful <b>for the sake of a voluntary meal offering</b> and then <b>for the sake of the meal offering of a sinner.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, according to</b> the resolutions offered by <b>Rabba and Rava, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
§ The Gemara cites the <i>baraita</i> that is the basis for the apparent contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Shimon, which was mentioned in the previous discussion: <b>And</b> a Sage <b>raises a contradiction</b> from one statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the verse written concerning the meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), indicates that <b>there are some</b> meal offerings whose <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a sin offering, and there are some</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a guilt offering.</b>
Rabbi Shimon elaborates: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner is like</b> that of <b>a sin offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed a handful</b> from <b>it not for its own sake,</b> it is <b>disqualified,</b> just <b>like a sin offering</b> that was slaughtered not for its own sake. Conversely, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a voluntary meal offering is like</b> that of <b>a guilt offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed a handful</b> from <b>it not for its own sake,</b> it is <b>valid,</b> like a guilt offering that was slaughtered not for its own sake.
Rabbi Shimon adds: <b>And</b> a voluntary meal offering is <b>like a guilt offering</b> in another aspect as well: <b>Just as a guilt offering</b> is <b>valid but it does not effect acceptance,</b> i.e., it does not satisfy the owner’s obligation, <b>so too, a voluntary meal offering</b> is <b>valid but it does not effect acceptance.</b> Rabbi Shimon here apparently contradicts his ruling that all meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake satisfy the obligation of the owner.
<b>Rabba said</b> in resolution of this contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of sanctity,</b> i.e., it was sacrificed for the sake of another type of meal offering, whereas <b>there,</b> where he says that it does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of owner,</b> e.g., the meal offering of Reuven was sacrificed for the sake of Shimon.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>Now</b> consider, the fact <b>that the Merciful One disqualifies</b> a meal offering due to improper <b>intent is</b> derived from the Torah’s <b>comparison</b> of meal offerings to sin offerings and guilt offerings. If so, <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if there was <b>a change of sanctity,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if there was <b>a change of owner?</b> In the case of a guilt offering either of these changes prevents it from satisfying the obligation of the owner.
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: The claim that <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> one’s intent, <b>which Rabbi Shimon states</b> in explanation of why offerings are disqualified through improper intent, <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning, as Rabbi Shimon interprets the reason</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse</b> and draws halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation.
Rabba continues: This is significant, as Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>the Merciful One disqualifies</b> improper <b>intent that is not recognizably</b> false, i.e., when the intent is not in clear contradiction to the sacrificial rites performed. The intent to sacrifice an offering for the sake of another owner does not include a change in the sacrificial rites and it therefore disqualifies the offering. <b>The Merciful One does not disqualify</b> improper <b>intent that is recognizably</b> false and contradicts the sacrificial rites performed, e.g., if one removes a handful from a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, as the different substance itself indicates that it is a pan meal offering.
The Gemara lists several questions with regard to Rabba’s statement, for which it provides <b>a mnemonic: Burnt offering, burnt offering, pinched and squeezed, bird sin offering, offerings of the most sacred order, offerings of lesser sanctity.</b>
The Gemara first asks: But <b>if that is so,</b> that only intent that is not recognizably false disqualifies an offering, then in the case of <b>a bird burnt offering where one pinched</b> the nape of <b>its</b> neck <b>above</b> the red line that divides the upper and lower halves of the altar <b>for the sake of a bird sin offering,</b> it <b>should effect acceptance</b> according to Rabbi Shimon. The reason is <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on it prove that it is a bird burnt offering. Because if it is</b> in fact <b>a bird sin offering, he would have performed</b> the pinching <b>below</b> the red line while standing beside the altar. Nevertheless, Rabbi Shimon agrees with the ruling of the mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 64b) that this bird offering does not satisfy its owner’s obligation.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is that to say</b> that a case of <b>a bird sin offering</b> that is pinched <b>above</b> the red line <b>is not</b> possible? <b>Didn’t the Master say:</b> The <b>pinching</b> of a bird sin offering that is performed <b>in any place on the altar</b> is <b>valid</b> after the fact? Accordingly, there is no discernible difference between the pinching of a bird burnt offering and the pinching of a bird sin offering, so the owner’s obligation is not fulfilled.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: If recognizably false intent does not disqualify an offering, then <b>a bird burnt offering where</b> a priest <b>squeezed its blood above</b> the red line <b>for the sake of a bird sin offering should effect acceptance,</b> as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on it prove that it is a bird burnt offering. Because if it is</b> in fact <b>a bird sin offering, he would have performed</b> the required act of holding the body of the bird and <b>sprinkling</b> its blood <b>below</b> the red line, instead of squeezing out its blood above that line.

Daf 3a

The Gemara responds: This is not considered recognizably false intent, as people might <b>say: Perhaps</b> it is actually a sin offering and he has already sprinkled its blood below the red line. And as for the fact that he squeezed its blood above the red line, they will say: <b>It is the squeezing that follows sprinkling,</b> which may be performed above the red line in the case of a sin offering. <b>As the Master said:</b> If one <b>squeezed the blood of</b> a bird sin offering <b>in any place on the altar,</b> the offering is <b>valid.</b> Since people might erroneously think that this bird is actually a sin offering, this intent is not considered recognizably false, so the offering is disqualified.
The Gemara asks another question: According to Rabba’s resolution, <b>a bird sin offering whose blood</b> a priest <b>sprinkled below</b> the red line <b>for the sake of a bird burnt offering should effect acceptance, as the actions</b> performed <b>on it prove that it is a bird sin offering. Because if it is</b> in fact <b>a bird burnt offering, he would have performed it above</b> the red line, <b>and he would have performed</b> the act of <b>squeezing</b> instead of sprinkling.
The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed,</b> according to Rabbi Shimon such a bird offering effects acceptance and fulfills the obligation of the owner. In fact, bird offerings were not discussed by Rabbi Shimon at all. <b>Rather, he said: Because meal offerings are not similar to slaughtered offerings,</b> which means that they are not similar <b>to slaughtered</b> animal <b>offerings, but</b> he did not say that they are <b>not</b> similar <b>to bird</b> offerings.
The Gemara asks: But if so, then <b>offerings of the most sacred order that one slaughtered in the northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard, which is a requirement that applies only to offerings of the most sacred order, <b>for the sake of offerings of lesser sanctity, should effect acceptance</b> for their owners, as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on them prove that they are offerings of the most sacred order. Because if</b> they are in fact <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, he would have performed their</b> slaughter <b>in the southern</b> part of the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara answers: The slaughter of an offering in the northern part of the Temple courtyard is not indicative of the type of offering one intends it to be, as one can <b>say that the Merciful One states</b> that offerings of lesser sanctity may be slaughtered <b>even in the southern</b> part of the courtyard. <b>Did</b> He <b>say</b> that these offerings must be slaughtered specifically <b>in the southern</b> part <b>and not in the northern</b> part? This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 55a), that <b>the slaughter of</b> offerings of lesser sanctity may be performed <b>in any place within the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>
The Gemara asks: If so, then <b>offerings of lesser sanctity that one slaughtered in the southern</b> part of the Temple courtyard <b>for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order should effect acceptance</b> for their owners, as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on them prove that they are offerings of lesser sanctity. Because if</b> they are in fact <b>offerings of the most sacred order, he would have performed their</b> slaughter <b>in the northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara responds: The fact that an offering was slaughtered in the southern part of the Temple courtyard is not a clear indication that it was intended as an offering of lesser sanctity, as people might <b>say: They are</b> in fact <b>offerings of the most sacred order, but</b> the priest <b>transgressed</b> the mitzva to slaughter them in the northern part of the courtyard <b>and slaughtered them in the southern</b> part.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if people might suspect an individual of performing the rite of an offering in an improper manner, then if a priest removes a handful from <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of a deep-pan</b> meal offering <b>as well,</b> one who sees <b>that this</b> priest <b>removes a handful for</b> the sake of <b>a deep-pan</b> meal offering might <b>say: This</b> owner <b>took a vow</b> to bring a meal offering <b>in a deep pan, and</b> as for the fact <b>that he brings it in a pan, it is</b> actually the meal offering <b>of a deep pan and</b> the owner <b>transgressed</b> the mitzva to bring it in a deep pan, <b>and brought it in a pan.</b> Why, then, does Rabbi Shimon maintain that such a meal offering satisfies the obligation of its owner?
The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> where the priest removed the handful from a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, <b>even if</b> the owner <b>took a vow</b> to bring a meal offering <b>in a deep pan, when he brings it in a pan it is</b> considered a valid <b>pan</b> meal offering, and therefore the priest’s intention is recognizably false.
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (102b): <b>One who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan,</b> or if he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a pan,</b> the meal offering <b>that he brought, he brought,</b> i.e., it is valid and the priest performs the rites of the meal offering that he actually brought, <b>but he did not fulfill</b> the obligation resulting from <b>his vow,</b> and he must bring another meal offering to fulfill that obligation.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even so, the priest’s improper intent remains indiscernible, as people might think: <b>Perhaps</b> the owner <b>said: This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must <b>bring in a pan, and</b> in spite of this <b>he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan.</b> Such a meal offering is disqualified and is not considered a valid pan meal offering, <b>as we learned</b> in that same mishna: One who took a vow, saying: <b>This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must <b>bring in a pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan,</b> or if he vowed: This tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must bring <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a pan, it is disqualified,</b> as he did not fulfill his vow. If so, how can Rabbi Shimon say that such a meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, when the intent is not recognizably false?
The Gemara responds: <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., according to the opinion of the mishna just cited, there is <b>indeed</b> a difficulty. But <b>according to Rabbi Shimon</b> there is no difficulty, <b>since</b> with regard to a case where one took a vow, saying: It is incumbent upon me to bring a pan meal offering, and then he brought it in a deep pan, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He has fulfilled even</b> the obligation resulting from <b>his vow. Evidently, the designation of the vessel</b> for a meal offering <b>is nothing</b> according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in this regard whether <b>he said: This</b> is for a particular type of meal offering, <b>and there is no difference</b> whether <b>he said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a particular meal offering. In both instances the unique actions of each particular meal offering prove its identity, and therefore the owner fulfills his obligation regardless of the priest’s improper intent.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that in a case where the manner of its preparation proves the identity of an offering the owner fulfills his obligation, then <b>a burnt offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering should effect acceptance.</b> His actions prove that it is a burnt offering, <b>as this,</b> a burnt offering, is always <b>male, and that,</b> a sin offering, is <b>female.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since there is</b> one sin offering, <b>the goat of</b> the <b><i>Nasi</i>, which is male, it is unknown</b> whether this animal was a burnt offering or the sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>, and its gender is not conclusive proof.
The Gemara continues to ask: But in a case where one <b>said:</b> I am hereby slaughtering this animal <b>for the sake of a sin offering of an individual,</b> which is always female, <b>what can be said?</b> Since a male animal cannot be mistaken for such a sin offering, why doesn’t this burnt offering satisfy the obligation of the owner? <b>And furthermore, a sin offering of an individual that one slaughtered for the sake of a burnt offering should effect acceptance, as</b> such <b>a sin offering</b> is always <b>female, and a burnt offering</b> is always <b>male.</b> The Gemara responds: It is difficult to discern whether a lamb is male or female, as its genitals are <b>covered by</b> its <b>tail.</b> Accordingly, its gender is not considered proof of the type of offering being sacrificed.
The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where one brought a female lamb</b> as his sin offering, as its tail makes it difficult to discern its sex. But in a case where he <b>brought a female goat, what can be said?</b> Its gender is easily recognized, as goats do not have tails that cover their genitals. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> discerning <b>between males and females is not on people’s minds,</b> i.e., they do not take notice of the offering’s gender and therefore this aspect of an animal is not considered discernible.
The Gemara continues to challenge the opinion of Rabba: <b>A Paschal offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a guilt offering should effect acceptance, as this,</b> the Paschal offering, is <b>in its</b> first <b>year, and that,</b> a guilt offering, is <b>in its second</b> year. The Gemara answers: <b>Since there are</b> two guilt offerings that are brought from lambs in their first year, i.e., <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> (see Numbers 6:12) <b>and the guilt offering of a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:10), <b>it is not definitively</b> clear <b>to</b> an onlooker what type of offering this lamb is.
The Gemara asks: But if one <b>said:</b> I am hereby slaughtering this lamb <b>for the sake of a guilt offering for robbery, or</b> if he said: I am slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>what can be said?</b> These guilt offerings must each be brought from an animal in its second year, and therefore they cannot be mistaken for a Paschal offering, which is in its first year. <b>And furthermore, a guilt offering for robbery or a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>that one slaughtered for the sake of a Paschal offering should effect acceptance, as a Paschal offering is</b> always <b>in its</b> first <b>year, and these are in their second year.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the difference in appearance <b>between</b> an animal that is <b>in its</b> first <b>year and</b> one that is <b>in its second year is not on people’s minds,</b> i.e., this is not a clearly recognizable difference, <b>as there</b> can <b>be</b> an animal <b>in its</b> first <b>year that appears as</b> though it is <b>in its second</b> year, <b>and there</b> can <b>be</b> an animal <b>in its second</b> year <b>that appears as</b> though it is <b>in its</b> first <b>year.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>A goat</b> sin offering <b>that one slaughtered for the sake of a guilt offering should effect acceptance.</b> It is clearly not a guilt offering, <b>as this,</b> a guilt offering, is a ram, with white <b>wool, and that,</b> a goat, has black <b>hair.</b> The Gemara responds: People will <b>say</b> that this goat <b>is</b> actually <b>a black ram,</b> and they may indeed mistake it for a guilt offering.
The Gemara challenges: <b>A calf or a bull that one slaughtered for the sake of</b> either <b>a Paschal offering or a guilt offering should effect acceptance.</b> It is clear that such animals cannot be either offering, <b>as a calf or bull</b> offering <b>is not</b> sacrificed either <b>as a Paschal offering or</b> as <b>a guilt offering.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so,</b> as according to Rabbi Shimon such offerings effect acceptance for their owners.

Daf 3b

<b>And what</b> does Rabbi Shimon mean when he says that meal offerings are not similar to <b>slaughtered offerings?</b> He means that they are not similar to <b>most slaughtered offerings.</b> There are, however, certain slaughtered offerings whose preparation, which is unique to that particular offering, is proof that it is that offering. In those instances, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the offerings fulfill the obligations of their respective owners despite the improper intent.
§ The Gemara cites another resolution of the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> that report conflicting opinions of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that a meal offering that was sacrificed not for its own sake fulfills the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where one removes a handful</b> from <b>a meal offering for the sake of a meal offering. There,</b> where he says that it does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where one removes a handful</b> from <b>a meal offering for the sake of a slaughtered offering.</b>
Rava elaborates: If one removes a handful from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> a different <b>meal offering</b> he fulfills his obligation, as the verse states: <b>“And this is the law of the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). This indicates that there is <b>one law for all the meal offerings,</b> i.e., they are all considered variations of the same offering, and are different only with regard to how they should be sacrificed <i>ab initio</i>. Conversely, if one sacrificed <b>a meal offering for the sake of a slaughtered offering,</b> since the phrase: <b>And this is the law of the meal offering and a slaughtered offering, is not written</b> anywhere, there is no reason to conclude that one fulfills his obligation under such circumstances.
The Gemara questions how Rava can say that the verse “And this is the law of the meal offering” serves as the basis for the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: <b>But doesn’t the <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon, <b>say</b> that his reasoning is <b>that</b> for any particular meal offering, <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> what <b>it</b> is? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying: Even though</b> sacrificing a meal offering for the sake of a different meal offering is a case <b>where it is not recognizable</b> that the <b>intention</b> fits the offering, i.e., the intent does not match the rites being performed, <b>and</b> the offering <b>should</b> therefore <b>be disqualified,</b> the verse states: <b>“And this is the law of the meal offering,”</b> which teaches that there is <b>one law for all the meal offerings.</b>
<b>And what</b> does Rabbi Shimon mean when he says: <b>But with regard to slaughtered offerings it is not so?</b> This clause indicates that the similarity between the rites of various slaughtered offerings is a reason why they should not be valid, whereas according to the above reasoning the opposite is so.
The Gemara explains this part of Rabbi Shimon’s statement: <b>Even though</b> there is <b>one</b> manner of <b>slaughter for all</b> animal offerings, and therefore one might think that the owner has fulfilled his obligation despite the improper intent, the phrase: <b>And this is the law of the meal offering and a slaughtered offering, is not written.</b> In other words, it is not stated: This is the law of a slaughtered offering, in the manner that a verse states: “This is the law of the meal offering.” Therefore, the owner of a slaughtered offering does not fulfill his obligation if there is improper intent, notwithstanding the similarity between the acts of slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the phrase “And this is the law of the meal offering” teaches that a meal offering is not disqualified despite the improper intent for a different meal offering, then analogously, <b>a sin offering</b> brought to atone for eating forbidden <b>fat that one slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering</b> to atone for drinking <b>blood,</b> or <b>for the sake of a sin offering</b> to atone for <b>idol worship,</b> or <b>for the sake of a sin offering of a nazirite,</b> or <b>for the sake of a sin offering of a leper should be valid and effect acceptance. As the Merciful One states: “And this is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), from which it should be derived that there is <b>one law for all sin offerings.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> such a sin offering is <b>indeed</b> valid and effects acceptance for its owner. The Gemara notes: <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> Rava <b>says: A sin offering</b> brought to atone for eating forbidden <b>fat that one slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering</b> to atone for drinking <b>blood</b> or <b>for the sake of a sin offering</b> to atone for <b>idol worship</b> is <b>valid.</b> But if he slaughtered it <b>for the sake of a sin offering of a nazirite</b> or for the sake of a sin offering of <b>a leper</b> it is <b>disqualified, as</b> with regard to <b>these</b> offerings, <b>there are burnt offerings</b> brought together <b>with them.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches</b> that Rava holds that the <i>halakha</i> in <b>all of these</b> cases is <b>disqualification</b> of the sin offering. The reason is that the verse states: <b>“And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33). The word “it” indicates that it must be sacrificed <b>for the sake of that</b> particular <b>sin offering,</b> and it may not be slaughtered for the sake of a different one.
§ The Gemara cites a third resolution of the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> that report conflicting opinions of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering is fit and fulfills the obligation of the owner, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> one states that he is <b>removing a handful</b> from <b>a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep pan,</b> i.e., he mentions only the vessel and not the offering. <b>There, where</b> it does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, <b>he</b> states that he is <b>removing a handful</b> from <b>a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering.</b>
Rav Ashi elaborates: When one bringing a pan meal offering states that he is removing a handful from <b>a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep pan, he has intent</b> only <b>with regard to</b> the type of <b>vessel, and intention with regard to</b> the type of <b>vessel does not disqualify</b> offerings, as he is not sacrificing the vessel, and therefore the owner’s obligation is fulfilled. By contrast, when he states that he is removing a handful from <b>a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, he has intent with regard to</b> the type of <b>meal offering, which</b> improper <b>intention does disqualify.</b> Consequently, the owner’s obligation is not fulfilled.
The Gemara questions how Rav Ashi can maintain that this is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon: <b>But doesn’t the <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon, <b>say</b> that his reasoning is <b>that</b> for any particular meal offering, <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> what <b>it</b> is? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying: Even though</b> when he removes a handful from a pan meal offering explicitly for the sake of a deep pan, it is a case where the falseness of the <b>intention is recognizable</b> and the offering <b>should</b> therefore <b>be disqualified,</b> it is nevertheless valid and fulfills the owner’s obligation, as intentions with regard to the vessel are irrelevant.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> does Rabbi Shimon mean when he says: <b>But with regard to slaughtered offerings it is not so?</b> He means that <b>even though</b> there is <b>one</b> manner of <b>slaughter for all</b> offerings, and <b>one</b> manner of <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>for all</b> offerings, and <b>one</b> manner of <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>for all</b> offerings, i.e., if one performs any of these rites for the sake of a different offering it is not recognizable that his intent is false, and therefore it might have been thought that the owner does fulfill his obligation, nevertheless he <b>has</b> improper <b>intent with regard to</b> an aspect of <b>slaughtering,</b> such as slaughtering a burnt offering for the sake of a peace offering, <b>which</b> improper <b>intention does disqualify.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If this is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon, then with regard to a case where one removes a handful from <b>a dry</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of</b> a meal offering <b>mixed</b> with oil, <b>why did Rabbi Shimon say</b> that it fulfills the owner’s obligation? Since his intent concerns the meal offering itself, it should disqualify the offering. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> When Rabbi Shimon says that such a meal offering fulfills the owner’s obligation he is referring to a case where one removes a handful <b>merely for the sake of mixing,</b> not for the sake of a meal offering mixed with oil.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then when one slaughters a burnt offering <b>for the sake of a peace offering as well,</b> one can say that his intent is <b>merely for the sake of peace [<i>shelamim</i>]</b> between himself and God. Why then does Rabbi Shimon say that this burnt offering does not fulfill the obligation of the owner?
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the <b>offering itself is called <i>shelamim</i>, as it is written: “Who sacrifices the blood of the peace offering [<i>shelamim</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), and it is also written: <b>“Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14). <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>is a meal offering itself called mixed?</b> It <b>is written: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), indicating that there is a meal offering that <b>is called: Mixed with oil,</b> but <b>it is not simply called: Mixed.</b> One’s intent to sacrifice a dry meal offering for the sake of mixing is therefore not a reference to the offering itself.
§ Three resolutions have been suggested for the apparent contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Shimon in two <i>baraitot</i> concerning whether or not a meal offering whose handful was removed not for its own sake fulfills the obligation of its owner. Rabba’s answer was that there is a difference between intent for another meal offering, in which case the owner fulfills his obligation, as the intent is recognizably improper, and intent for someone else, which is not recognizably improper. The Gemara comments: <b>All</b> the other Sages, i.e., Rava and Rav Ashi, <b>do not say as Rabba</b> did in resolving the contradiction, as they do not accept his reasoning, claiming <b>that on the contrary, the Merciful One disqualifies recognizably</b> false <b>intent.</b>
The Gemara continues: Rava resolved the contradiction by saying that a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of another meal offering effects acceptance for the owner, as the verse states: “And this is the law of the meal offering” (Leviticus 6:7), indicating that there is one law for all meal offerings, whereas a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of an animal offering does not effect acceptance. Rabba and Rav Ashi <b>do not say as Rava</b> did in resolving the contradiction, as the verse that states: <b>“And this is the law</b> of the meal offering,” <b>does not indicate to them</b> that there should be one law for all meal offerings.
The Gemara continues: Rav Ashi resolved the contradiction by saying that when one removes the handful from a meal offering for the sake of a vessel the meal offering effects acceptance for the owner, as intent concerning the vessel itself is inconsequential, whereas when one removes the handful for the sake of another meal offering, the meal offering does not fulfill the owner’s obligation. Rabba and Rava <b>did not say as Rav Ashi</b> did in resolving the contradiction <b>because of the difficulty</b> posed <b>by Rav Aḥa, son of Rava,</b> from a case where one removes the handful of a dry meal offering for the sake of a mixed one. Rabbi Shimon holds that such a meal offering fulfills the owner’s obligation even though his intent concerns the meal offering itself, not the vessel.
The Gemara notes: <b>The matter that is obvious to Rabba in one way,</b> i.e., that with regard to meal offerings recognizably false intention is disregarded, but when the false intention is not recognizable the offering does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, <b>and</b> that is obvious <b>to Rava in the other way,</b> i.e., that in cases of recognizably false intention the offering should not fulfill the owner’s obligation, <b>is a dilemma for Rav Hoshaya. As Rav Hoshaya raises a dilemma, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Hoshaya raises</b> this <b>dilemma before Rav Asi:</b> In the case of one who sacrifices <b>a meal offering for the sake of a slaughtered offering,</b>

Daf 4a

<b>what</b> should <b>I</b> understand that <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> with regard to such a case? Is <b>the reason of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of another meal offering is valid and effects acceptance, <b>that intent that is recognizably</b> false <b>does not disqualify</b> an offering? <b>And</b> if so, <b>this</b> meal offering from which a handful is removed for the sake of an animal offering <b>is</b> also a case of <b>intent that is recognizably</b> false, and therefore the meal offering should not be disqualified.
<b>Or perhaps the reason of Rabbi Shimon is that it is written: “And this is the law of the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:7), which indicates that there is one law for all meal offerings. If so, then a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of an animal offering should be disqualified, since it <b>is not written:</b> And this is the law of the meal offering <b>and a slaughtered offering.</b> Rav Asi <b>said to</b> Rav Hoshaya: <b>Have we ascertained the depth of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon</b> in this matter? In other words, Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning is not known.
The Gemara explains why Rav Asi did not resolve this dilemma. Rav Asi <b>did not resolve</b> the dilemma of Rav Hoshaya in accordance <b>with</b> the resolution stated by <b>Rabba,</b> that there is a distinction between one who removes the handful of a meal offering for the sake of another meal offering and one who removes it for the sake of another owner, <b>because of the difficulty</b> posed by <b>Abaye</b> (2b), that the <i>halakha</i> of both these cases is derived from the same comparison in the Torah between meal offerings and animal offerings.
Likewise, Rav Asi <b>did not resolve</b> the dilemma <b>in accordance with</b> the resolution stated by <b>Rava,</b> that the verse “And this is the law of the meal offering” teaches that a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of another meal offering is valid, whereas a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of an animal offering is disqualified. This is <b>because of the difficulty</b> arising from the verse: <b>“And this is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), i.e., despite this verse, the <i>halakha</i> is that a sin offering that was slaughtered for the sake of another sin offering is not valid.
Finally, Rav Asi <b>did not resolve</b> the dilemma <b>in accordance with</b> the resolution stated by <b>Rav Ashi,</b> that there is a distinction between one who removes the handful of a meal offering prepared in one vessel for the sake of a different vessel, and one who removes it for the sake of a meal offering prepared in a different vessel, <b>because of the difficulty</b> posed by <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava.</b> This difficulty concerns a case where one removes the handful of a dry meal offering for the sake of one mixed with oil; Rabbi Shimon holds that such a meal offering is valid despite the fact that the person’s intent referred to the meal offering itself, not the vessel.
§ The mishna teaches that all meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake but for the sake of another meal offering are fit for sacrifice, <b>except for the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the meal offering of a sinner</b> is disqualified when a handful is removed from it not for its own sake, as <b>the Merciful One calls it a sin offering,</b> in the verse: <b>“He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering.</b> And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful” (Leviticus 5:11–12). This verse indicates that just as a sin offering is disqualified when sacrificed not for its own sake, so too, the meal offering of a sinner is disqualified when a handful is removed from it not for its own sake. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the meal offering of jealousy, from where do we</b> derive that this is the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara answers that this <i>halakha</i> may be derived from a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as a <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to money that was designated for <b>a meal offering of jealousy, its surplus,</b> i.e., the money remaining after the purchase of the meal offering, is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You are saying well,</b> as <b>it is written with regard to</b> a meal offering of jealousy: <b>“Bringing iniquity to remembrance”</b> (Numbers 5:15), <b>and it is written with regard to a sin offering: “And He has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17). A verbal analogy is drawn between the two uses of the term “iniquity” in these verses. This teaches that <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>a sin offering, its surplus</b> is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering of jealousy, its surplus</b> is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings. <b>And</b> a meal offering of jealousy is also <b>like a sin offering</b> in another aspect: <b>Just as a sin offering is disqualified</b> when sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, so too, a meal offering of jealousy is disqualified</b> when a handful is removed from it <b>not for its own sake.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering of jealousy is derived from a verbal analogy to a sin offering based on the word “iniquity,” then <b>a guilt offering should</b> also <b>be disqualified</b> if it was sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, as</b> a similar verbal analogy may be <b>derived from</b> the verse that states: “The <b>iniquity [<i>avon</i>]</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> and the verse that states: “And shall bear his <b>iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), in connection with a guilt offering.
The Gemara responds: <b>One derives</b> a verbal analogy based on the word <b>“iniquity” from</b> a verse that likewise uses the term <b>“iniquity,” but one does not derive</b> a verbal analogy based on the term <b>“his iniquity [<i>avono</i>]” from</b> a verse that uses the term <b>“iniquity.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> the following verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse concerning the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. All the more so should a less pronounced difference of one letter between <i>avon</i> and <i>avono</i> not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy.
<b>And furthermore, let one derive</b> a verbal analogy through the term <b>“his iniquity”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering, and the term <b>“his iniquity” from</b> the verse concerning the sin offering brought for the <b>iniquity for hearing the voice,</b> i.e., the sin offering of one who takes a false oath that he does not have any information relevant to a matter when another requests that he testify about it, <b>as it is written: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1).
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>when the verbal analogy was derived, it was derived</b> only with regard <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>surplus</b> from the money designated for a meal offering of jealousy is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings, and not with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a meal offering of jealousy from which a handful was removed not for its own sake is disqualified.
<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a principle that <b>there is no partial verbal analogy,</b> that principle does not apply in this instance. As <b>the Merciful One revealed with regard to a sin offering</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of other offerings may not be derived from this case, as the verse states: <b>“And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33). This verse indicates that <b>it,</b> i.e., a sin offering, when slaughtered <b>for its own sake</b> is <b>valid,</b> and when slaughtered <b>not for its own sake</b> is <b>disqualified. But all</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>whether</b> sacrificed <b>for their sake or not for their sake, are valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the Merciful One revealed that one cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> of other offerings that were sacrificed not for their sake from a sin offering, then <b>from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>that the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy are disqualified</b> when a handful is removed from them <b>not for their sake?</b>
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a sin offering, what is the reason</b> that it is disqualified when sacrificed not for its own sake? It is <b>because it is written with regard to</b> this offering: <b>“It,”</b> in a verse discussing the sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). This indicates that a sin offering is valid only when it is sacrificed for its own sake. <b>So too, it is written with regard to them,</b> i.e., the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy: <b>“It.”</b> In the case of the meal offering of a sinner the verse states: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), and with regard to the meal offering of jealousy it is written: “It is a meal offering of jealousy” (Numbers 5:15).
The Gemara challenges: But if so, concerning <b>a guilt offering as well, it is written about</b> this offering: <b>“It,”</b> as the verse states: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5). Accordingly, a guilt offering should likewise be disqualified if it is slaughtered not for its own sake. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> term <b>“it” is written with regard to</b> the stage <b>after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions [<i>eimurin</i>]</b> of a guilt offering, which are intended for burning upon the altar.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One derives from the word “it” that if the offering was slaughtered not for its own sake it is disqualified only in the case of a sin offering. <b>But</b> concerning <b>a guilt offering, it is stated about</b> this offering: <b>“It</b> is a guilt offering,” <b>only</b> with regard to the stage <b>after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions.</b> The <i>baraita</i> adds: One cannot derive that if these portions were burned not for the sake of a guilt offering then the offering is disqualified, since the guilt offering <b>itself</b> is <b>valid</b> if <b>its sacrificial portions were not burned</b> upon the altar at all.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the word <b>“it”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering? The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>for that which Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>a guilt offering</b> whose owner died or whose transgression was otherwise atoned for, and <b>that was</b> therefore <b>consigned</b> by the court <b>to grazing</b> until it develops a blemish so that it can be sold and the proceeds used to purchase a burnt offering, if, before it developed a blemish, someone <b>slaughtered it without specification</b> of its purpose, it is <b>fit</b> if it was sacrificed <b>as a burnt offering.</b>
The Gemara infers: If <b>it was consigned</b> to grazing, <b>yes,</b> it is fit if it was sacrificed as a burnt offering if slaughtered. By inference, if <b>it was not consigned</b> to grazing, it is <b>not</b> fit. What is the reason for this? <b>The verse states: “It</b> is a guilt offering,” indicating that <b>it shall</b> remain <b>as it is,</b> i.e., as a guilt offering, unless it is consigned by the court to another purpose.
§ The mishna teaches that all the meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit for sacrifice but they do not fulfill the owner’s obligation. Concerning this, <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering,</b> i.e., the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan (see Leviticus 23:9–14), if the priest <b>removed a handful</b> from it <b>not for its own sake</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> It is disqualified <b>since</b> an <i>omer</i> meal offering <b>came</b> for a specific purpose, namely, <b>to permit</b> the consumption of the new crop, <b>and</b> this meal offering <b>did not permit</b> the consumption of the new crop because its rites were performed not for its own sake. <b>And so you say with regard to the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> who became ritually impure, whose proper sacrifice enables the nazirite to restart his naziriteship afresh in purity,

Daf 4b

<b>and</b> so you say with regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper,</b> whose proper sacrifice enables the leper to enter the Israelite camp and to partake of offerings of sanctity, <b>that</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> these offerings <b>not for their sake, they are disqualified.</b> They are disqualified <b>since</b> their sacrifice <b>came to render</b> the nazirite and leper <b>fit, and</b> these guilt offerings <b>did not render</b> them <b>fit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>all the meal offerings</b> from <b>which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit</b> for sacrifice <b>but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, except for the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy. And if it is so</b> that an <i>omer</i> meal offering from which a handful was removed not for its own sake is disqualified, then <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also teach: Except for the <i>omer</i> meal offering.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i>, it teaches it only with regard to meal offerings that <b>come</b> on behalf of <b>an individual.</b> The mishna <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to those meal offerings that <b>come</b> on behalf of the <b>community.</b> Additionally, <b>when</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i>, it is only with regard to a meal offering that <b>comes on account of itself,</b> i.e., as an independent offering. The mishna <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering that <b>comes on account of,</b> i.e., together with, <b>a slaughtered offering,</b> e.g., the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which is brought along with two sheep.
The Gemara adds: Furthermore, <b>when</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i>, it is only with regard to <b>those</b> meal offerings <b>whose time is not set,</b> i.e., they may be sacrificed on any date. The mishna <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>this</b> <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>whose time</b> for offering <b>is set</b> on the sixteenth of Nisan.
§ The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rav. <b>The Master said: And so you say with regard to the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> who became ritually impure, <b>and</b> so you say with regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper, that</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> these offerings <b>not for their sake, they are disqualified.</b> They are disqualified <b>since</b> their proper sacrifice <b>came to render</b> the nazirite and leper <b>fit, and they did not render</b> them <b>fit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 2a): <b>All slaughtered offerings that one slaughtered not for their sake are fit, but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all offerings <b>except for the Paschal offering and the sin offering,</b> which are disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake. <b>And if it is so</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of Rav, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also teach: Except for the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper, since they came to render</b> one <b>fit and they did not render</b> one <b>fit.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Since there</b> are other guilt offerings, i.e., <b>the guilt offering for robbery,</b> which one brings for taking a false oath denying an accusation of robbery, <b>and the guilt offering</b> brought <b>for misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>that come for atonement,</b> which do not render one fit and are fit for sacrifice if they were slaughtered not for their sake, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna could <b>not</b> state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to guilt offerings in <b>an absolute</b> manner, and therefore he refrains from mentioning guilt offerings at all.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper?</b> Why are they disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake <b>since they came to render fit and they did not render fit? These,</b> i.e., the guilt offerings for robbery and for misuse of consecrated property, should <b>likewise</b> be disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake, since they <b>came for atonement and they did not atone.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> in response: <b>We find that the Torah differentiates between</b> those guilt offerings that <b>atone and</b> those that <b>render fit,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent with regard to those that render fit. Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: With regard to those guilt offerings that <b>atone, there are among them</b> offerings <b>that come after death,</b> i.e., they are sacrificed after the death of their owners, whereas with regard to those that <b>render fit, there are none among them that come after death. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin offering</b> for her ritual purification <b>and died, the heirs shall bring her burnt offering,</b>which comes to atone. If she set aside <b>her burnt offering and died, the heirs shall not bring her sin offering,</b> as it comes to render her fit to partake of offerings.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, objects to this:</b> With regard to offerings that <b>render fit as well, are there not among them</b> offerings <b>that come after death? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 11a): In the case of <b>one who separates funds for</b> the offerings of <b>his naziriteship,</b> i.e., his sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, a person <b>may not derive benefit</b> from them <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one benefited from them after the fact, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, i.e., he is not required to bring a guilt offering and is not obligated to repay the principal and an additional fifth. This is <b>because</b> the coins <b>are all fit for bringing peace offerings,</b>and there is no misuse of consecrated property with regard to funds fit for a peace offering.
The mishna continues: If the nazirite <b>died and he had undesignated funds</b> that he set aside to pay for his nazirite offerings without specifying how much money should be allocated toward each offering, <b>they will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. If he left behind <b>allocated</b> funds, then with regard to <b>the money for a sin offering,</b> one must <b>take</b> it and cast it <b>into the Dead Sea; one may not benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one benefited from it after the fact, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. With regard to <b>the money for a burnt offering, one brings with it a burnt offering, and</b> one is liable for <b>misusing them.</b>
The mishna concludes: With <b>the money for a peace offering, one brings a peace offering with it, and</b> these offerings <b>are eaten for one day,</b> like the peace offering brought by a nazirite, <b>and do not require</b> the <b>loaves</b> that are normally bought with the peace offering of a nazirite. Rabbi Yehuda explains his question: <b>But</b> the <b>burnt offering and peace offering of a nazirite are</b> offerings <b>that render</b> the nazirite <b>fit</b> to drink wine, <b>and</b> yet <b>they come after death.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in response that <b>this is what Rabbi Yirmeya is saying: We do not find</b> an instance of <b>a fixed</b> manner of <b>rendering fit that comes after death,</b> i.e., there is no instance where the only offering that will render one fit to act in a manner previously prohibited to him may be sacrificed after death. <b>And</b> the offerings <b>of a nazirite</b> are examples of a means of <b>rendering fit that is not fixed,</b>

Daf 5a

<b>as the Master said</b> about the nazirite (<i>Nazir</i> 45a): And if he <b>shaved after</b> the sacrifice of any <b>one of the three of them,</b> i.e., after sacrificing his sin offering, burnt offering, or peace offering, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation after the fact, i.e., he has successfully completed his term of naziriteship. Accordingly, there is no specific offering that renders him fit.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper that was slaughtered not for its own sake, or</b> if <b>none of its blood was placed on</b> the leper’s right <b>thumb and big toe, this</b> guilt offering <b>is offered up upon the altar and it requires libations,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of the guilt offering of a leper. <b>But</b> the leper <b>must</b> nevertheless bring <b>another guilt offering to render him fit</b> to partake of offerings. This <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the statement <b>of Rav,</b> who said that the guilt offering of a leper that was slaughtered not for its own sake is entirely disqualified because it did not render the leper fit.
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion concerning the <i>omer</i> meal offering. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says,</b> with regard to <b>an <i>omer</i> meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> a priest <b>removed a handful not for its own sake,</b> that it is <b>valid</b> and the handful is burned on the altar. <b>But its remainder may not be consumed</b> by the priests <b>until</b> a priest <b>brings another <i>omer</i> meal offering</b> on the same day <b>and</b> thereby <b>permits</b> the first offering for consumption, as the prohibition against consuming the new crop remains in effect.
The Gemara asks: But if <b>its remainder may not</b> be <b>consumed</b> by the priests <b>until</b> they <b>bring another <i>omer</i> meal offering, how can</b> the handful removed from this <i>omer</i> meal offering <b>be sacrificed</b> upon the altar? Before the <i>omer</i> meal offering is sacrificed, the new crop is forbidden for consumption, and the verse states: <b>“From the well-watered pastures of Israel;</b> for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings” (Ezekiel 45:15), from which it is derived that one may sacrifice only <b>from</b> that <b>which is permitted to the Jewish people.</b>
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> in response: <b>Reish Lakish holds</b> that an offering is <b>not</b> considered one <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived if it is to be brought <b>on that day.</b> Accordingly, since the new crop will be permitted for consumption on the same day that this handful was removed from the <i>omer</i> meal offering, it is already considered fit to be sacrificed upon the altar.
<b>Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, raises an objection</b> to Rav Adda bar Ahava’s explanation from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to birds that</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to meal offerings,</b> and <b>there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to meal offerings that</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to birds.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>There is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to birds</b> that does not apply to meal offerings, <b>as birds</b> may be <b>brought as a gift</b> offering on behalf <b>of two</b> people, i.e., two people may take a vow to bring a single bird offering jointly. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>meal offerings</b> it <b>is written:</b> “And when <b>one</b> brings a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), indicating that only individuals may vow to bring a meal offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> another <i>halakha</i> that applies to birds but not meal offerings involves one who <b>has not yet</b> brought his <b>atonement</b> offering, i.e., <b>a man who experienced a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>], or woman who experienced a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>], or a woman after childbirth, or a leper,</b> all of whom must bring an offering to complete their atonement process. They bring a bird offering, not a meal offering.
<b>And</b> furthermore, with regard to birds, <b>their general prohibition was permitted when</b> they are <b>consecrated,</b> i.e., killing a non-sacred bird by pinching the nape of its neck renders it a carcass, whose consumption is prohibited, and yet pinching the nape of a bird offering enables it to be sacrificed upon the altar and permits it for consumption, <b>which is not so with regard to meal offerings,</b> i.e., there is no prohibition that applies to the non-consecrated ingredients of a meal offering that does not apply to actual meal offerings as well.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to meal offerings</b> that does not apply to birds. <b>As meal offerings require</b> placement in a service <b>vessel, and</b> they require <b>waving and bringing,</b> i.e., they must be brought to the corner of the altar prior to removal of the handful. <b>And</b> lastly, <b>there are</b> meal offerings <b>of the community just as</b> there are meal offerings <b>of individuals,</b> e.g., the <i>omer</i> meal offering is a communal meal offering, <b>which is not so with regard to birds.</b> Bird offerings do not require the use of service vessels, they do not require waving or bringing, and there are no communal bird offerings.
Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, explains his objection: <b>And if it is so</b> that a handful that was removed from an <i>omer</i> meal offering not for its own sake is fit for burning upon the altar, then <b>with regard to meal offerings as well, you find that their general prohibition was permitted when</b> they are <b>consecrated. And what is this</b> meal offering that was permitted? It is <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering</b> from which a handful was removed not for its own sake, as although the new crop remains prohibited to the Jewish people until another <i>omer</i> meal offering is brought, the handful of this meal offering may be sacrificed upon the altar.
The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> an offering is <b>not</b> considered one <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived if it is to be brought <b>on that day,</b> the sacrificing of that handful <b>is not a prohibition</b> that was permitted. Instead, it was initially fit for sacrifice upon the altar, as though another <i>omer</i> meal offering had already been brought to permit it.
<b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the ritual purification of a leper: If the priest <b>performed the placement of oil</b> on the leper’s right thumb and big toe <b>before the placement of blood</b> from the leper’s guilt offering on the leper’s right thumb and big toe, i.e., his actions were in the opposite order from those prescribed in the Torah (see Leviticus 14:14–17), <b>he fills</b> the vessel that holds a <i>log</i> of <b>oil and he</b> then <b>puts oil</b> on the leper’s right thumb and big toe <b>again after the placement of blood.</b> If the priest <b>performed the placement of</b> oil on the leper’s right <b>thumb and big toe before the placement of seven</b> sprinklings of oil before the Lord, <b>he fills</b> the vessel that holds a <i>log</i> of <b>oil and he again puts</b> oil on the leper’s right <b>thumb and big toe after the placement of seven</b> sprinklings.
Rav Sheshet explains his objection: <b>And if you say</b> that an offering is <b>not</b> considered as one <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived if it is to be brought <b>on that day,</b> then <b>why should</b> the priest <b>place</b> the oil on the leper’s right thumb and big toe <b>again? What he performed, he</b> already <b>performed,</b> i.e., since the oil was going to be placed on the leper’s right thumb and big toe on that day, the placement should be valid even when done out of order.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in response: <b>The <i>halakhot</i> of a leper are different, as</b> it <b>is written concerning them</b> an expression of <b>being, as the verse states: “This shall be the law of the leper”</b> (Leviticus 14:2). The term <b>“shall be”</b> indicates that <b>it shall be as it is,</b> i.e., the purification process of a leper must be performed in accordance with the precise order prescribed in the Torah.
<b>Rav Pappa raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If the priest <b>performed</b> the slaughter of a leper’s <b>sin offering before</b> the slaughter of <b>his guilt offering,</b> i.e., the priest’s actions were in the opposite order from those prescribed in the Torah (see Leviticus 14:13–19), <b>there</b> should <b>not be another</b> priest <b>stirring the blood of</b> the leper’s sin offering to prevent it from congealing in order that his guilt offering may be slaughtered and its blood sprinkled before the blood of his sin offering. <b>Rather,</b> the sin offering is left until <b>its form decays,</b> i.e., until the next morning, at which point it is definitively disqualified due to remaining in the Temple overnight <b>and</b> can be <b>taken out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning.</b> The objection is as follows: If an offering that is to be brought on that day is not considered one whose time has not yet arrived, why must this sin offering be left to decay? It should be considered as though it was slaughtered after the guilt offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why does Rav Pappa raise</b> this <b>objection? But isn’t it Rav Pappa</b> himself <b>who said: The <i>halakhot</i> of a leper are different, as</b> it <b>is written concerning them</b> an expression of <b>being,</b> which indicates that the order of slaughter of a leper’s offerings must be preserved? <b>Rather, this is what is difficult to Rav Pappa</b> from the <i>baraita</i>: You can <b>say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the order is indispensable to the purification process of a leper, applies only to a sacrificial <b>rite,</b> whereas the act of <b>slaughter is not</b> considered <b>a rite. And if</b> an offering is <b>not</b> considered one <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived if it is to be brought <b>on that day,</b> then <b>another</b> priest <b>should be stirring the blood of</b> the leper’s sin offering to prevent it from congealing, <b>and</b> a priest <b>should sacrifice</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> and present its blood in the meantime, <b>and afterward he should sacrifice</b> the <b>sin offering.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said: This is the reason of Reish Lakish,</b> who said <b>that</b> the handful of an <i>omer</i> meal offering that was removed not for its own sake is valid and may be burned upon the altar: It is that <b>he holds</b> that <b>the illumination of</b> the <b>eastern</b> horizon on the morning of the sixteenth of Nisan <b>permits</b> the new crop to the Jewish people even before the <i>omer</i> meal offering is sacrificed, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say: Even when the Temple is standing,</b>

Daf 5b

<b>the illumination of</b> the <b>eastern</b> horizon <b>permits</b> the new crop.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Reish Lakish was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference,</b> i.e., it is evident from a different statement of Reish Lakish that this is his opinion. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (68b): <b>One may not bring a meal offering, the first fruits, or the meal offering</b> brought with the libations accompanying <b>an animal</b> offering, from the new crop, <b>prior to</b> the sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i>.</b> The Gemara interrupts its citation of the mishna to add that the reason is <b>that we require</b> that an offering be <b>“from the well-watered pastures of Israel,”</b> i.e., it must be brought from that which is permitted to the Jewish people, and the new crop has not yet been permitted to them. The mishna concludes: <b>And if he brought</b> these offerings from the new crop they are <b>unfit.</b>
The mishna continues: After the <i>omer</i> but <b>prior to the two loaves one may not bring</b> those offerings from the new crop. The Gemara explains that this is <b>because</b> the two loaves <b>are called first fruits,</b> and therefore they should precede all other offerings from the new crop. The mishna adds: <b>But if he brought</b> those offerings from the new crop, they are <b>fit.</b>
<b>And Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a meal offering that was brought from the new crop before the <i>omer</i> meal offering is disqualified <b>only</b> if it was brought <b>on the fourteenth or on the fifteenth</b> of Nisan. <b>But</b> if it was <b>on the sixteenth,</b> then even <b>if he brought</b> it prior to the <i>omer</i> meal offering, it is <b>valid.</b> He continues: <b>And</b> this statement poses <b>a difficulty for me:</b> Why should meal offerings be valid when sacrificed on the sixteenth if they were sacrificed before the <i>omer</i> meal offering? <b>Let them be</b> considered <b>like</b> offerings <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Reish Lakish <b>holds</b> that <b>the illumination of the eastern</b> horizon <b>permits</b> the new crop.
§ The Gemara previously cited the opinion of Rav that an <i>omer</i> meal offering from which a handful was removed not for its own sake is disqualified. The Gemara also cited the opinion of Reish Lakish that this meal offering is valid but another <i>omer</i> meal offering is necessary to permit the new crop for consumption. <b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>an <i>omer</i> meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful not for its own sake,</b> it is <b>valid and its remainder is consumed, and it does not require another <i>omer</i> meal offering to permit it</b> for consumption. The reason is <b>that</b> improper <b>intent is effective [<i>mo’elet</i>]</b> to disqualify an offering <b>only</b> when it is expressed <b>by one who is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service, and with regard to an item that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service, and in a place that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service.</b>
Rava elaborates: The condition that improper intent disqualifies only when expressed <b>by one who is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the intent of <b>a blemished priest,</b> who is disqualified from performing the Temple service. The condition that it disqualifies only when expressed <b>with regard to an item that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which</b> is generally <b>unfit</b> for the Temple service, <b>as it is a novelty,</b> in that it is brought from barley whereas most meal offerings are brought from wheat. <b>And</b> finally, the condition that it disqualifies only when expressed <b>in a place that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> sacrificial rites that were performed with improper intent while <b>the altar was damaged.</b> At such a time improper intent does not disqualify an offering, and therefore if the altar is repaired on the same day, the offering may be sacrificed upon the altar.
§ The Gemara discusses the prohibition against sacrificing an item that is prohibited to the Jewish people. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from a passage in the Torah that discusses burnt offerings: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), that certain animals are prohibited for sacrifice upon the altar (see <i>Temura</i> 28a). <b>When it states later,</b> in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering <b>of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), this is difficult, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, as it was already written earlier. <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> from being brought as an offering.
The <i>baraita</i> questions the need for this derivation: <b>But could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? And if a blemished</b> animal, <b>which is permitted to an ordinary person [<i>lehedyot</i>]</b> for consumption, is nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> as an offering <b>for the Most High</b> (see Leviticus 22:19), then certainly with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, which is forbidden to an ordinary person</b> for consumption (see Exodus 22:30), <b>is it not logical that it is prohibited for the Most High?</b> The <i>baraita</i> responds: <b>Fat [<i>ḥelev</i>] and blood prove</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid, <b>as they are forbidden to an ordinary person and</b> yet <b>they are permitted for the Most High.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about fat and blood?</b> They are notable <b>in that they come from</b> an item that is <b>generally permitted,</b> i.e., the animal from which they come is itself permitted for consumption. Will <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, which is entirely forbidden</b> for eating, <b>and</b> therefore <b>should not be permitted for the Most High?</b>
The <i>baraita</i> responds: The <b>pinching</b> of bird offerings <b>will prove</b> that one cannot derive by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that a <i>tereifa</i> is disqualified. <b>As</b> a bird killed by the pinching of its nape is also <b>entirely forbidden, and</b> yet although it is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person,</b> as it is rendered a carcass, it is nevertheless <b>permitted for the Most High,</b> as bird offerings are killed by the pinching of their napes. The verse is therefore necessary to disqualify a <i>tereifa</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about pinching?</b> It is notable <b>in that its sanctity prohibits it,</b> i.e., only <b>at the time</b> when <b>it</b> becomes <b>sanctified for the altar</b> does <b>it</b> become <b>prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person, which is</b> at the time of <b>its pinching. But before this</b> time it is <b>not</b> yet <b>prohibited to an ordinary person</b> for consumption. This <b>is not the case with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, as its sanctity does not prohibit it</b> for consumption, since it is always prohibited to eat it. Accordingly, by logical inference alone one can arrive at the conclusion that a <i>tereifa</i> should not be permitted for the Most High.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes with a statement that will soon be explained: <b>And if you have responded,</b> i.e., if you succeeded in rejecting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, then <b>when</b> the verse <b>states later: “Of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this phrase, it serves <b>to exclude a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> response is alluded to by the statement: <b>If you have responded?</b> The conclusion of the <i>baraita</i> had indicated that the <i>a fortiori</i> inference must be accepted. The Gemara cites several suggestions, for which it provides the following <b>mnemonic: <i>Rekiaḥ</i>, <i>Mar</i>, <i>Adda</i>, <i>Leshisheih</i>.</b> These terms allude to the names of some of the Sages mentioned in the following discussion: Rav; Rabbi Akiva; Rav Aḥa; Mar, son of Ravina; Rav Adda; and Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi.
<b>Rav said</b> that this is the response: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it may be said</b> that <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived by the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as</b> the <i>omer</i> is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person,</b> since it comes from the new crop, <b>and</b> yet it is <b>permitted</b> as an offering <b>for the Most High.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>renders</b> the <b>new</b> crop <b>permitted</b> for consumption, whereas a <i>tereifa</i> does not render anything permitted.
The Gemara responds: Although the <i>omer</i> meal offering generally renders the new crop permitted, the <i>omer</i> brought <b>during a Sabbatical Year</b> does not render the crop permitted, as it is prohibited to plant during the Sabbatical Year, and consequently there is no new crop for the <i>omer</i> offering to permit. The Gemara counters this suggestion: The <i>omer</i> meal offering brought during <b>a Sabbatical Year also</b> renders something permitted, <b>as it permits produce that grew without being purposely planted [<i>sefiḥin</i>] during the Sabbatical Year.</b> The Gemara responds: Nevertheless, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b><i>sefiḥin</i> are prohibited during the Sabbatical Year,</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering brought during a Sabbatical Year does not render the new crop permitted for consumption, and yet it is permitted for the Most High. A verse is therefore necessary to derive that a <i>tereifa</i> may not be sacrificed.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba said to Rav Ashi: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva as well, let us refute</b> the statement of Rav, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>permits</b> the <b>new</b> crop for consumption <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, where the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year do not apply.
<b>And even according to the one who says</b> that the consumption of produce from the <b>new</b> crop grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> Rav’s statement can be refuted in another manner: What is notable about the <i>omer</i> meal offering? It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>comes to permit a prohibition</b> that applies to a substance <b>that</b> was previously <b>within it,</b> i.e., the burning upon the altar of a handful from the <i>omer</i> meal offering renders the remainder of the meal offering permitted to the priests, whereas a <i>tereifa</i> is entirely forbidden.
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina:</b> This is not a refutation, as, <b>if that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i> as well, you should sacrifice</b> it <b>and you will</b> thereby <b>permit a prohibition</b> that applies to a substance <b>that</b> was previously <b>within it,</b> and its meat will become permitted to the priests for consumption. Therefore, a verse is needed to exclude a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather,</b> one can <b>refute</b> the statement of Rav <b>like this: What</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner, i.e., the Torah requires the <i>omer</i> meal offering to be brought from the new crop in order to permit the new crop for consumption. By contrast, there is no mitzva to sacrifice specifically a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this is the response alluded to at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it can be said</b> that <b>the one who prepares the incense proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning a <i>tereifa</i> may not be derived by the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as</b> this is <b>prohibited to an ordinary person, and</b> is nevertheless <b>permitted for the Most High.</b> The Gemara questions the terminology of Reish Lakish: But <b>the one who prepares</b> the incense <b>is a person.</b> How can it be said that a person is prohibited to an ordinary person?
<b>Rather,</b> Reish Lakish meant that <b>the preparation of the incense proves</b> it, <b>as</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to prepare the incense mixture for use <b>by an ordinary person</b> (see Exodus 30:37), <b>and</b> yet it is <b>permitted</b> to do so <b>for the Most High.</b> The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about preparation of the incense?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner. By contrast, there is no mitzva to sacrifice specifically a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Mar, son of Ravina, said</b> that this is the response of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it can be said</b> that <b>Shabbat proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived by the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as it is prohibited for an ordinary person</b> to perform labor on Shabbat, <b>and</b> yet the labor involved in the Temple service is <b>permitted</b> on Shabbat <b>for the Most High.</b> Without the verse, one might similarly conclude that a <i>tereifa</i> is permitted for the Most High despite the fact that it is prohibited for consumption.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Shabbat?</b> It is notable <b>in that the general prohibition</b> against labor on Shabbat <b>was permitted with regard to an ordinary person in</b> the case of <b>circumcision,</b> as the mitzva of circumcision must be performed in its proper time, even on Shabbat, despite the fact that the act of circumcision is generally prohibited on Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>circumcision is</b> considered <b>a requirement of an ordinary person,</b> whose performance was exempted from the general prohibition against labor on Shabbat for one’s private needs? <b>Circumcision is a mitzva. Rather,</b> the statement of Mar, son of Ravina, can be refuted like this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Shabbat?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner, i.e., the Torah requires that offerings be brought on Shabbat. By contrast, there is no mitzva to sacrifice specifically a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Adda bar Abba said</b> that this is the response mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it can be said</b> that the prohibition against <b>diverse kinds proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived from the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as it is prohibited for an ordinary person</b> to wear garments sewn from a mixture of diverse kinds (Deuteronomy 22:11), <b>and</b> yet such garments are <b>permitted for the Most High,</b> as the belt of the priestly vestments was fashioned from a mixture of diverse kinds.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the prohibition against <b>diverse kinds?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <b>general prohibition</b> against wearing a garment sewn from diverse kinds <b>was permitted in</b> the case of <b>an ordinary person with regard to ritual fringes,</b> as a string of sky-blue wool must be placed on a four-cornered garment even if that garment is made from linen. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>ritual fringes</b> are considered <b>a requirement of an ordinary person,</b> whose performance was exempted from the general prohibition concerning diverse kinds with regard to one’s private needs? Placing ritual fringes on a garment <b>is a mitzva. Rather,</b> the claim of Rav Adda bar Abba can be refuted like this:

Daf 6a

<b>What</b> is notable <b>about diverse kinds?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner, since the belt of the priestly vestments must be sewn from diverse kinds. By contrast, there is no mitzva to sacrifice specifically a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from the verse, <b>because it can be said: Let</b> this claim <b>be derived by</b> analogy from <b>the common element</b> of two sources, as follows: With regard to the question of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about pinching?</b> It is notable <b>in that its sanctity prohibits it,</b> one can respond: <b>Fat and blood prove</b> that this consideration is not enough to reject the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as these are prohibited before they are sanctified and are nevertheless permitted for the Most High.
Similarly, with regard to the question: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about fat and blood?</b> They are notable <b>in that they come from</b> an item that is <b>generally permitted,</b> i.e., the animal from which they come is itself permitted for consumption, one can reply: <b>Pinching proves</b> that this consideration is insufficient for a rejection of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as a bird that was killed by pinching is entirely prohibited for eating, and yet a pinched bird is permitted to the altar.
Rav Sheisha concludes: <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point. <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case; <b>their common element</b> is <b>that they are prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person and are</b> nevertheless <b>permitted for the Most High.</b> Therefore, <b>I will also bring</b> the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> and say: <b>Even though is it prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person, it should be permitted for the Most High.</b> It is therefore necessary to derive from a verse that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice. The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable in <b>that</b> with regard to fat and blood, and pinching, in both cases <b>its mitzva</b> is performed <b>in this</b> manner.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> It is necessary to derive the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>tereifa</i> from a verse <b>because one can say</b> that the <b>refutation of the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> is present <b>from the outset.</b> Rav Ashi elaborates: <b>From where do you</b> wish to <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice? You wish to derive it from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a blemished</b> animal, as a blemished animal is permitted for consumption and prohibited for sacrifice. This is problematic.
Rav Ashi explains: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a blemished</b> animal? It is notable <b>in that with regard to</b> blemishes the Torah <b>rendered those who sacrifice like that which is sacrificed,</b> i.e., a blemished priest may not sacrifice an offering just as a blemished animal is unfit for sacrifice (see Leviticus, chapter 22). This cannot be said with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, as a priest with a wound that will cause him to die within twelve months may perform the Temple service. It is therefore necessary to derive from the verse the fact that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice.
<b>Rav Aḥa Sava said to Rav Ashi:</b> But an animal <b>born by caesarean section proves</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference cannot be rejected based on that consideration, <b>as with regard to it</b> the Torah <b>did not render those who sacrifice like that which is sacrificed,</b> since an animal born by caesarean section is unfit for sacrifice whereas a priest born in such a manner may perform the Temple service. <b>And</b> yet an animal born by caesarean section is <b>permitted</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person and prohibited for the Most High.</b> If so, one cannot reject the <i>a fortiori</i> inference because with regard to blemishes the Torah rendered those who sacrifice like that which is sacrificed. Why then is a verse necessary in order to derive that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit?
Rav Ashi responds: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> an animal <b>born by caesarean section?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> such an animal <b>is not sanctified with firstborn</b> status, whereas a firstborn animal that was born as a <i>tereifa</i> is sanctified. Accordingly, without the verse one might have concluded that a <i>tereifa</i> may be sacrificed.
Rav Aḥa Sava answers: <b>A blemished</b> animal <b>proves</b> that this is not the decisive consideration, as it does become sanctified with the sanctity of a firstborn, and it too is permitted for consumption and prohibited for the Most High. And if you say: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a blemished</b> animal? It is notable <b>in that with regard to it</b> the Torah <b>rendered those who sacrifice like that which is sacrificed,</b> one can respond: An animal <b>born by caesarean section proves</b> that this consideration is not decisive, as a priest born by caesarean section may perform the Temple service.
Rav Aḥa Sava concludes: <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point. <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case; <b>their common element</b> is <b>that they are permitted</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person and prohibited for the Most High. And all the more so a <i>tereifa</i>, which is prohibited to an ordinary person, should be prohibited for the Most High.</b> If so, the derivation from a verse is unnecessary.
Rav Ashi refutes the proof of Rav Aḥa Sava: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable <b>in that their general prohibition was not permitted,</b> since blemished animals and those born by caesarean section are never permitted for sacrifice. <b>Will you say</b> that the same applies <b>to a <i>tereifa</i>, whose general prohibition was permitted,</b> as will be explained? Accordingly, it is necessary to derive from the verse that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> This <b><i>tereifa</i> whose general prohibition was permitted, what is it,</b> i.e., to what case is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to the <b>pinching of a bird burnt offering for the Most High,</b> whereby the bird is initially rendered a <i>tereifa</i> at the start of the pinching process, and nevertheless it is sacrificed upon the altar, then the same may be said of <b>a blemished</b> animal <b>as well.</b> As <b>with regard to birds</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to sacrifice a blemished bird. This is in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that the requirement that an offering must be <b>unblemished and male</b> applies <b>to animal</b> offerings, <b>but there is no</b> requirement that an offering must be <b>unblemished and male in</b> the case of <b>bird</b> offerings.
<b>Rather,</b> this permitting the general prohibition found in the context of a <i>tereifa</i> is referring to the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>pinching of a bird sin offering</b> renders it permitted <b>to the priests</b> for consumption despite the fact that it was not slaughtered by cutting its neck with a knife. This claim can be refuted as well, as the <b>priests receive</b> their portion <b>from the table of the Most High,</b> i.e., they may partake of the sin offering only because it was permitted for sacrifice upon the altar. Accordingly, there is no difference between a <i>tereifa</i> due to pinching and a blemished bird, as both were released from their general prohibition in this regard, since both are permitted for sacrifice upon the altar and both are therefore permitted for consumption by the priests. Consequently, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference remains valid, and the verse is unnecessary.
<b>Rather, refute</b> the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>like this: What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> with regard to both a blemished animal and one born by caesarean section <b>their blemish is noticeable,</b> as a blemished animal is visibly blemished and it is well known when an animal is born by caesarean section. <b>Will you say</b> that they can serve as the source of the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a <i>tereifa</i>, whose blemish is not</b> necessarily <b>noticeable? Due to that</b> reason, <b>the verse:</b> “Of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), <b>was necessary,</b> to teach that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice.
§ After trying to prove why a derivation from a verse is necessary, the Gemara questions the very source provided by the <i>baraita</i> on 5b for the disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., the verse: “Of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3). <b>But</b> is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> is unfit for sacrifice <b>derived from here? It is derived from there,</b> i.e., from the verse: <b>“From the well-watered pastures of Israel”</b> (Ezekiel 45:15), from which it is derived that an offering may be brought only <b>from</b> that <b>which is permitted to the Jewish people.</b>
Alternatively, this <i>halakha</i> can be <b>derived from</b> a verse discussing animal tithe offerings: <b>“Whatever passes under the rod,</b> the tenth shall be holy for the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This teaches that all animals may be sacrificed as the animal tithe, <b>excluding a <i>tereifa</i>, as it does not pass</b> under the rod on account of its weakness, and the Sages derived from this the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for any type of offering.
The Gemara responds: All of these verses <b>are necessary, because if</b> the disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> was derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>“the well-watered pastures of Israel,” I would say</b> that this verse serves <b>to exclude</b> a <i>tereifa</i> only in a case <b>where it did not have a period of fitness,</b> e.g., if it was born a <i>tereifa</i> and was therefore never fit for sacrifice. This is <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>] and diverse kinds</b> planted <b>in a vineyard,</b> whose disqualification is derived from this verse. <b>But</b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i> that <b>had a period of fitness,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>it should be fit.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Whatever passes</b> under the rod,” to teach that all animals that do not pass under the rod are unfit for sacrifice, even if they were once fit.
The Gemara continues: <b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Whatever passes</b> under the rod,” <b>I would say</b> that this verse serves <b>to exclude</b> a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>where it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> and</b> its owner <b>subsequently sanctified it.</b> This is <b>similar to</b> the case of animal <b>tithes,</b> as this verse is teaching that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be subsequently sanctified as a tithe. <b>But</b> if the owner <b>sanctified it and it was subsequently rendered a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> which means <b>that at the time when it was sanctified it was fit,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>it should be fit.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “Of the herd,”</b> to teach that even an animal that became a <i>tereifa</i> after it was already sanctified is unfit for sacrifice. Accordingly, all three verses <b>are necessary.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Both the meal offering of a sinner and all</b> other <b>meal offerings</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the one who <b>removed their handful</b> was <b>a non-priest,</b> or a priest who was <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., whose relative died and was not yet buried, or a priest who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and was waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, or a priest <b>lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments,</b> or a priest <b>who had not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, or a priest <b>who did not wash his hands and feet</b> from the water in the Basin prior to performing the Temple service, or <b>an uncircumcised</b> priest, or <b>a ritually impure</b> priest, or a priest who removed the handful while <b>sitting,</b> or while <b>standing</b> not on the floor of the Temple but <b>upon vessels,</b> or <b>upon an animal,</b> or <b>upon the feet of another</b> person; in all these cases the meal offerings are <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice.
If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is <b>unfit. Ben Beteira says: He must return</b> the handful to the vessel that contains the meal offering <b>and again remove the handful,</b> this time <b>with</b> his <b>right</b> hand.
If a priest <b>removed the handful</b> of flour, <b>and a stone, a grain of salt, or a pinch [<i>koret</i>] of frankincense emerged in his hand,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said: The handful that is outsized or that is lacking</b> is <b>unfit.</b> The existence of one of these foreign items in the handful means that the requisite measure of flour is lacking. <b>And which is the outsized</b> handful? It is one <b>where he removed the handful overflowing [<i>mevoratz</i>]</b> in a manner in which his fingers do not hold the flour. <b>And</b> which is the <b>lacking</b> handful? It is one <b>where he removed the handful with the tips of his fingers.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach: Both the meal offering of a sinner and all</b> other <b>meal offerings? Let it teach: All the meal offerings</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the one who <b>removed their handful</b> was <b>a non-priest or an acute mourner.</b> Why does the mishna single out the case of the meal offering of a sinner?
The Gemara responds: <b>It was necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> in this manner <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: By right the meal offering of a sinner should require oil and frankincense</b> like other meal offerings, <b>so that</b> the <b>sinner will not profit. And for what</b> reason does <b>it not require</b> oil and frankincense? So <b>that his offering will not be of superior quality. And</b> likewise, <b>by right</b> the <b>sin offering of</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> i.e., the offering brought by one who unwittingly ate the forbidden fat of a domesticated animal, <b>should require libations</b>

Daf 6b

<b>so that</b> the <b>sinner will not profit. And for what</b> reason <b>does</b> his offering <b>not require</b> libations? So <b>that his offering will not be of superior quality.</b> Accordingly, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In order <b>that his offering will not be of superior quality, when the handful is removed</b> by one of those <b>unfit</b> for performing the Temple service, the offering <b>should also be valid,</b> as it too is of inferior quality. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a manner that emphasizes that even according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon the meal offering of a sinner is disqualified when the handful is removed by one who is unfit.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>there as well,</b> i.e., with regard to slaughtered offerings, <b>let</b> the mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 15b) <b>teach: Both the sin offering of</b> forbidden <b>fat and all the slaughtered offerings</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the one who <b>collected their blood</b> was <b>a non-priest or</b> a priest who is <b>an acute mourner,</b> are disqualified. <b>And let us say</b> that <b>it was necessary</b> to teach the mishna in this manner <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> to emphasize that although the sin offering is not of superior quality, in that it does not require that libations be brought with it, nevertheless it is disqualified if its blood was collected by one unfit for Temple service. Why then does that mishna teach simply: All the slaughtered offerings with regard to which the one who collected their blood was a non-priest are disqualified?
The Gemara concludes its question: <b>Apparently, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that mishna with the term: <b>All, and he does not teach: Except, all</b> offerings <b>are indicated</b> by the general disqualification, and there is no need to emphasize the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a sin offering, even in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to meal offerings, <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the mishna with the term: <b>All, and he does not teach: Except,</b> this means that <b>all of them are indicated,</b> even the meal offering of a sinner. Why then does the mishna specifically mention the meal offering of a sinner?
The Gemara explains: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach the mishna in this manner as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since I have established that the first clause,</b> i.e., the mishna on 2a, is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> with regard to <b>the last clause as well,</b> i.e., the mishna here, it may be concluded <b>that</b> it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this manner, to emphasize that it is in accordance with his opinion.
§ <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>a non-priest who removed a handful, he should return</b> the handful to the meal offering. The Gemara challenges: <b>But we learned</b> in the mishna that a non-priest <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering by removing a handful from it. The Gemara responds: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it says: <b>Disqualified?</b> It means that the non-priest has <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering <b>until</b> such time as <b>he returns</b> the handful to the meal offering, whereupon a priest fit for the Temple service should again remove a handful from the meal offering and sacrifice it.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then <b>this is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>ben Beteira</b> in the mishna, who says that if a priest removed a handful with his left hand it is returned to the meal offering whereupon the priest removes a handful from the offering with his right hand. What difference is there between the two opinions in the mishna? The Gemara explains: <b>If the handful</b> that was removed by one unfit for Temple service <b>is in its unadulterated form,</b> then <b>the Rabbis do not disagree with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Beteira,</b> and the handful is returned to the meal offering. <b>They disagree when</b> the <b>handful is lacking. The Rabbis hold: One does not bring</b> flour <b>from within his house and refill</b> the vessel containing the handful, whereas <b>ben Beteira holds</b> that <b>one brings</b> flour <b>from within his house and refills it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the mishna is referring to a handful that is lacking, then the statement of the mishna: <b>Ben Beteira says he must return</b> the handful to the vessel with the meal offering <b>and again remove a handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, is imprecise, as the mishna <b>should have</b> taught: <b>Ben Beteira says he must return</b> the handful to the vessel with the meal offering <b>and bring</b> flour <b>from within his house and refill</b> the missing amount, <b>and again remove a handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand.
The Gemara therefore suggests a different answer: <b>When Rav said</b> that the handful is returned to the meal offering, he said this only <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Beteira.</b> The Gemara asks: But isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the opinion of ben Beteira? The Gemara responds: Rav’s statement is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>ben Beteira deems</b> the meal offering <b>fit only</b> when the handful was removed <b>with</b> one’s <b>left</b> hand, <b>but with regard to other disqualifications,</b> he does <b>not</b> deem it fit. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that with regard to all of the disqualifications cited in the mishna, ben Beteira holds that the handful is returned to the meal offering whereupon a new handful is removed from it and sacrificed upon the altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in the case of a handful removed with a priest’s <b>left</b> hand that one might have thought that ben Beteira’s opinion applies only in this case? Perhaps the reason is <b>that we find</b> that the Temple service performed with the priest’s left hand is <b>fit on Yom Kippur,</b> i.e., when the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies holding the vessel containing the incense in his left hand. But with regard to <b>a non-priest as well, we find</b> that the Temple service is <b>fit with regard to slaughter,</b> as an offering may be slaughtered by a non-priest. Why then is it necessary for Rav to teach that the opinion of ben Beteira applies to the case of a non-priest as well?
The Gemara responds: <b>Slaughter is not</b> considered a sacrificial <b>rite,</b> and it is for that reason that a non-priest may slaughter an offering. Accordingly, without the statement of Rav one would not have concluded that ben Beteira holds that a handful removed by a non-priest may be returned, as the Temple service is never fit when performed by a non-priest.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is slaughter really <b>not</b> considered a sacrificial rite? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Rav says: The slaughter of</b> a red <b>heifer by a non-priest</b> is <b>not valid? And Rav said with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: This is because both the term: <b>“Elazar</b> the priest” (Numbers 19:3), <b>and</b> the term: <b>“Statute”</b> (Numbers 19:2), <b>are written in</b> the Torah’s description of the slaughter of the red heifer. The term “statute” indicates that if one deviates from any of the details of the service as delineated in the verses, the service is not valid. The Gemara answers: The <i>halakhot</i> of the red <b>heifer are different, as</b> the heifer <b>is</b> considered <b>sanctified for</b> the purpose of <b>Temple maintenance,</b> not for sacrifice upon the altar. Accordingly, one cannot derive from the case of the red heifer that the slaughter of an offering is considered a sacrificial rite.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is it not all the more so?</b> If items <b>sanctified for</b> the purpose of <b>Temple maintenance require</b> that the performance of rites relevant to them be performed by a member of the <b>priesthood,</b> then with regard to items <b>sanctified for</b> sacrifice upon the <b>altar, shouldn’t they</b> certainly <b>require</b> that their rites be performed by a member of the <b>priesthood? Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said</b> in response: The requirement that the red heifer be slaughtered by a priest is not proof that its slaughter is a sacrificial rite. Rather, that requirement is <b>just as it is in</b> the case of examination of the <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks, which is</b> obviously <b>not</b> considered a sacrificial <b>rite, and</b> yet the Torah <b>requires</b> that these marks be examined by a member of the <b>priesthood.</b>
The Gemara asks: Nevertheless, why was it necessary for Rav to teach that the removal of a handful by a non-priest does not disqualify the meal offering according to ben Beteira? <b>Let us derive</b> it <b>from</b> the fact that there was a period of fitness for rites performed by a non-priest, as before the construction of the Temple it was permitted for non-priests to sacrifice offerings upon a private <b>altar.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of the rites performed in the Temple <b>from</b> those performed on a private <b>altar,</b> one can respond: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to an item, e.g., the limbs of an offering, <b>that emerged</b> from the Temple courtyard and was thereby rendered unfit for sacrifice upon the altar, <b>that if</b> it nevertheless <b>ascended</b> upon the altar <b>it shall not descend?</b> It is derived from the fact <b>that</b> an item that <b>emerged is valid</b> for sacrifice <b>on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> This indicates that one can learn the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings in the Temple from the <i>halakhot</i> of a private altar.
The Gemara rejects this: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that any item that ascends upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. In other words, the verse is the source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely as a support for this ruling.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, the reason</b> it is known that ben Beteira permits the return to the meal offering of a handful removed by a non-priest is <b>that Rav taught us</b> so. Were it <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> that <b>with regard to other disqualifications,</b> i.e., other than a handful removed with the left hand, <b>ben Beteira invalidates</b> the meal offering. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> both <b>say: Ben Beteira would deem fit in</b> the case of <b>all the</b> other <b>disqualifications</b> listed in the mishna?
The Gemara continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; <b>and he shall remove from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2), that this verse indicates that the removal of a handful from a meal offering may be performed <b>from the place where the feet of the non-priest stand,</b> i.e., anywhere within the Temple courtyard.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Beteira says</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>removed a handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>that he must return</b> the handful to the vessel with the meal offering <b>and again remove the handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand? It is derived from that which <b>the verse states: “And he shall remove from there,”</b> indicating that the handful is removed <b>from the place where he already removed</b> it, i.e., the handful is returned to the meal offering and thereupon removed from the same meal offering with the right hand. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains the difficulty from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And since the verse is written</b> in an <b>unspecified</b> manner, i.e., it does not mention which handfuls are returned, <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if the handful was removed with the <b>left</b> hand, <b>and what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if it was removed by means of one of <b>the other disqualifications?</b>
The Gemara therefore suggests an alternative explanation: <b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>Rav teaches us:</b> Ben Beteira holds that if one unfit for Temple service <b>removed a handful</b> it may be returned to the meal offering <b>even</b> if <b>he sanctified</b> the handful by placing it in a service vessel. <b>And</b> the statement of Rav serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of these <i>tanna’im</i>: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Yosei ben Yasiyyan and Rabbi Yehuda the baker said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> of ben Beteira <b>said,</b> i.e., in which case does he rule that the handful may be returned to the meal offering? It is in a case <b>where</b> the unfit individual <b>removed a handful and did not sanctify</b> it by placing it inside a service vessel. <b>But</b> if <b>he sanctified</b> it then <b>he</b> has <b>disqualified</b> it, even according to ben Beteira, and it may not be returned to the meal offering.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav teaches the opposite, that if an unfit person merely <b>removed a handful, yes,</b> ben Beteira permits such a handful to be returned to the meal offering from which it was removed, but if he already <b>sanctified</b> the handful by placing it inside a service vessel, it may <b>not</b> be returned. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this explanation? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei ben Yosei ben Yasiyyan and Rabbi Yehuda the baker, <b>and</b> it is <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i></b> in that <i>baraita</i>, who disagrees with the ruling of Rabbi Yosei ben Yosei ben Yasiyyan and Rabbi Yehuda the baker and maintains that a handful may be returned even after it was sanctified by a service vessel.
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: What do these <i>tanna’im</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>hold? If</b> they hold that <b>the removal of a handful by</b> one <b>unfit</b> for Temple service <b>is</b> considered the performance of a sacrificial <b>rite</b> to the extent that it disqualifies the offering, then the meal offering should be disqualified <b>even though he did not perform</b> the stage of the <b>placement</b> of the handful <b>in a vessel.</b> And <b>if</b> they hold that <b>the removal of a handful by an unfit</b> individual <b>is not</b> considered the performance of a <b>rite,</b> then <b>when he performed</b> the stage of <b>its placement in a vessel, what</b> significance <b>was</b> there to this action? He can still return the handful to the meal offering.
<b>Rav Naḥman</b> reconsidered and <b>then said: Actually,</b> those <i>tanna’im</i> hold that the removal of a handful by one unfit for Temple service <b>is</b> considered the performance of a sacrificial <b>rite, but the rite of</b> the handful <b>is not complete until he performs</b> the stage of <b>its placement in a vessel.</b> Consequently, the meal offering is disqualified only after a person unfit for Temple service places the handful inside a service vessel.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the placement of the handful inside a service vessel completes the rite that begins with the handful’s removal, then <b>even</b> if the handful was removed by an unfit individual who has <b>not</b> yet <b>sanctified</b> it in the service vessel designated for the handful,

Daf 7a

<b>when he returns the handful to its</b> former <b>place</b> in the service vessel that contains the meal offering <b>it should become sanctified,</b> as it is now placed inside a service vessel, <b>and it should</b> therefore <b>become disqualified.</b> It should not matter whether the handful was placed in the vessel designated for it, or back in the same vessel it was taken from.
Concerning this challenge, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is to say</b> that <b>service vessels sanctify</b> items placed in them <b>only</b> when they are placed there <b>with</b> specific <b>intent</b> that they be sanctified by that vessel. Since the priest does not return the handful to the vessel containing the meal offering with such intent, the handful is not disqualified, because the rite was not completed.
The Gemara asks: It may be inferred from this statement that if items are placed into service vessels <b>with intent,</b> the service vessels <b>sanctify</b> them. <b>But</b> didn’t <b>Reish Lakish raise a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>service vessels,</b> i.e., do they <b>sanctify disqualified</b> items to the extent that they may be <b>sacrificed</b> upon the altar <b><i>ab initio</i>? And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him</b> that <b>they do not sanctify</b> the items. The Gemara responds: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: They do not sanctify</b> the disqualified items that are placed inside them <b>to</b> the extent that they may be <b>sacrificed, but they</b> do <b>sanctify</b> them <b>to</b> the extent <b>that</b> they <b>are disqualified.</b>
<b>Rav Amram says:</b> Even if service vessels sanctify items without specific intent, it is possible to return the handful to the meal offering without the vessel sanctifying the handful, <b>such as</b> in a case <b>where he returned it to a heaped bowl [<i>levisa</i>],</b> i.e., he placed the handful upon the heap of flour in such a manner that the handful did not enter the airspace of the vessel containing the meal offering. Consequently, the handful is not sanctified by the vessel.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the meal offering was heaped, <b>how</b> was he initially able to <b>remove a handful</b> from it? The handful must initially be removed from within a vessel. <b>Rather,</b> it is possible to return the handful without sanctifying it in a case <b>where he returned it to a full [<i>tefufa</i>] bowl,</b> i.e., it was full to the brim but not heaped. When the priest initially removes a handful from such a vessel, he removes it from inside the vessel, but when it is returned, it does not enter the airspace of the vessel.
The Gemara asks: <b>But once he removed a handful, he formed a furrow</b> in the surface of the meal offering, and therefore <b>when he returns</b> the handful to its previous place inside the vessel, <b>he is</b> in fact <b>returning it to</b> a spot <b>within the vessel,</b> i.e., the furrow. If so, the handful should be sanctified to the extent that the vessel disqualifies it. The Gemara responds: <b>When he returns it</b> to the vessel containing the meal offering, he does not place it directly in the furrow. Rather, he <b>lays it on the wall of the vessel and moves</b> the vessel, <b>and</b> the handful <b>falls by itself</b> into the furrow. In this manner, <b>it is as though a monkey</b> rather than a person <b>returned</b> the handful to the furrow, and the handful is therefore not sanctified.
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the opinion of ben Beteira. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And let</b> one <b>interpret</b> ben Beteira’s ruling as speaking of a case in which the handful is not sanctified by the vessel containing the meal offering, <b>such as where he returned it to a vessel that is resting upon</b> the <b>ground. Rather,</b> the fact that this was not suggested indicates that service vessels sanctify items placed inside them even while resting on the ground. Is it correct to <b>conclude from</b> here that <b>one may remove a handful</b> of a meal offering <b>from</b> a service <b>vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: You have touched upon a dilemma that was</b> already <b>raised before us, when Rabbi Avimi</b> was <b>learning</b> tractate <b><i>Menaḥot</i></b> in the <b>study hall of Rav Ḥisda.</b>
The Gemara interrupts this statement with a question: <b>And</b> did Rabbi <b>Avimi</b> really <b>learn</b> in the <b>study hall of Rav Ḥisda? But didn’t Rav Ḥisda say: I absorbed many blows [<i>kulfei</i>] from Avimi</b> as a result <b>of that <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., Avimi would mock me when I questioned his statements with regard to the sale of orphans’ property by the courts, which were contradictory to the ruling of a particular <i>baraita</i>. Avimi explained to me that if the court <b>comes to announce</b> such a sale on <b>consecutive</b> days, then it is announced for <b>thirty days,</b> in accordance with that <i>baraita</i>. But if it will be announced only on <b>Monday, Thursday, and Monday,</b> then it is announced over the course of <b>sixty days.</b> If so, Rav Ḥisda was in fact the pupil while Rabbi Avimi was his teacher.
The Gemara answers: <b>Avimi</b> was in fact the teacher, but <b>tractate</b> <i>Menaḥot</i> <b>was uprooted for him,</b> i.e., he forgot it, <b>and</b> Avimi <b>came before</b> his student <b>Rav Ḥisda to</b> help him <b>recall his learning.</b> The Gemara asks: If Rav Ḥisda was in fact Avimi’s student, <b>let</b> Avimi <b>send for him and</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>come to</b> Avimi. The Gemara responds: Avimi <b>thought</b> that <b>this</b> would be <b>more helpful</b> in this <b>matter,</b> i.e., that by exerting the effort to travel to his pupil in order to learn from him, he would better retain his studies.
The Gemara returns to the statement of Rabbi Zeira: <b>Rav Naḥman encountered</b> Avimi upon his return from the study hall of Rav Ḥisda. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: How</b> does one properly <b>remove a handful</b> from a meal offering? Avimi pointed to a vessel that was resting on the ground and <b>said to him: From this vessel</b> one may properly remove a handful. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: But may one remove a handful from a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Avimi <b>said to him:</b> When I said that such a vessel may be used, I meant <b>that</b> one <b>priest</b> would first <b>raise it</b> from the ground and then another priest would remove a handful from it.
Rav Naḥman proceeded to ask Avimi another question: <b>How</b> does one properly <b>sanctify the meal offerings?</b> Avimi pointed to a vessel that was resting on the ground and <b>said to him:</b> The priest <b>places it into this vessel.</b> Rav Naḥman again said to him: <b>But can one sanctify</b> a meal offering <b>in a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Avimi <b>said to him:</b> When I said that such a vessel may be used, I meant <b>that</b> another <b>priest</b> would initially <b>raise it</b> from the ground, and only then would the meal offering be placed inside it.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Avimi: <b>If so,</b> then <b>you require</b> the involvement of <b>three priests,</b> i.e., one to raise the vessel, one to sanctify the meal offering, and one to remove the handful from the meal offering. Avimi <b>said to him: And let it require</b> even <b>thirteen</b> priests, <b>just as</b> the service of the <b>daily</b> burnt <b>offering</b> required the involvement of thirteen priests. The need for several priests presents no difficulty.
Rav Naḥman <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> to the statement of Avimi from a mishna (12a) that discusses the <i>halakha</i> that improper intentions during the service of a meal offering disqualify it. <b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, <b>or who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, or to burn an item whose typical manner is such that one burns it on the altar, e.g., the handful or the frankincense, outside its designated area, the meal offering is unfit but there is no liability for excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].
Rav Naḥman explained his objection: All the rites of a meal offering are taught in the mishna, <b>and yet raising</b> the vessel from the ground <b>is not taught.</b> This indicates that there is no requirement to raise a vessel from the ground in order to use it for the service of a meal offering. Avimi responded: The <b><i>tanna</i> cited the order of</b> sacrificial <b>rites,</b> i.e., those rites concerning which improper intentions disqualify a meal offering, <b>but</b> he did <b>not</b> cite <b>the order of the priests,</b> i.e., he did not cite the total number of priests involved in the service.
On the same topic, the Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the permissibility of <b>removing a handful from a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Is this removal valid? Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> one of the Sages who raised the dilemma: <b>Go out</b> and <b>see what they do within</b> the Sanctuary when they remove the bowls containing the frankincense that were placed upon the Table of the shewbread in order to burn the frankincense upon the altar. The mishna (99b) states: When the priests would replace the shewbread every Shabbat, <b>four priests</b> would <b>enter</b> the Sanctuary, <b>two</b> with the <b>two arrangements</b> of the new shewbread <b>in their hands and two</b> with the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense <b>in their hands. And four</b> priests would <b>precede</b> them and enter the Sanctuary <b>before them, two to remove</b> the <b>two arrangements</b> of the old shewbread <b>and two to remove</b> the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense.

Daf 7b

Rav Sheshet notes: The entire process of the replacement of the shewbread is taught in the mishna, <b>and yet</b> the statement: A priest <b>raises the Table</b> above the ground so that the bowls of frankincense can be properly removed from them, <b>is not taught.</b> One can therefore conclude from the mishna that just as the bowls of frankincense are removed from a vessel that is resting upon the ground, i.e., the Table, so too, one may remove a handful of a meal offering from a vessel that is resting upon the ground.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Didn’t you</b> already <b>say there,</b> with regard to the mishna that discusses improper intentions expressed during the service of a meal offering (12a), that the <i>tanna</i> <b>cited</b> only <b>the order of</b> sacrificial <b>rites? Here too,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>cited</b> only <b>the order of</b> sacrificial <b>rites.</b> Therefore, one cannot prove from here that there is no requirement to raise the Table.
The Gemara asks: <b>Are</b> these <i>mishnayot</i> <b>comparable? There,</b> on 12a, the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not delve into the number of priests</b> involved in the service of a meal offering. <b>Here,</b> on 99b, the <i>tanna</i> <b>does</b> in fact <b>delve into the number of priests</b> involved in the service of the shewbread. Therefore, <b>if it is so,</b> i.e., if the Table must be raised before the bowls of frankincense are removed, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> that another priest <b>raises</b> the Table. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>one may remove a handful</b> of a meal offering <b>from a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> here that this is so.
§ <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that a priest may <b>remove a handful from a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground, as we find</b> such an instance <b>in</b> the case of <b>the removal of</b> the <b>bowls</b> of frankincense from the Table of the shewbread, since the Table is resting upon the ground of the Sanctuary when they are removed. Similarly, <b>one can sanctify a meal offering in a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground, as we find</b> such an instance <b>in</b> the case of <b>the arrangement of</b> the <b>bowls</b> of frankincense upon the Table of the shewbread.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>sanctification of a handful</b> by placing it in a vessel that is resting upon the ground, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the sanctification of <b>a meal offering,</b> in which case one can sanctify a handful in this manner, just as he can do so with a meal offering? <b>Or</b> do <b>we derive it from</b> the collection of the <b>blood</b> of an offering, in which case one cannot do so, just as the blood of an offering may not be collected in a vessel that is resting upon the ground? Rava <b>then resolves</b> the dilemma: <b>We derive it from</b> the collection of the <b>blood.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rava</b> really <b>say this,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sanctification of a handful is derived from the collection of the blood? <b>But it was stated:</b> With regard to a full measure of <b>a handful that</b> a priest <b>divided</b> and placed <b>in two vessels, Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified, and Rava says</b> that it is <b>sanctified. And if it is so</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of the handful is derived from the collection of the blood, then <b>let</b> Rava <b>derive from blood</b> that the handful is not sanctified in this manner, just as the blood is not sanctified when divided into two. The Gemara responds: <b>Rava retracted that</b> statement and ruled that a handful is not sanctified when divided and placed into two vessels.
The Gemara further discusses the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the collection of the blood. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>blood, from where do we</b> derive <b>that it is not sanctified in halves,</b> i.e., when collected in two vessels? It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Taḥlifa ben Shaul teaches</b> with regard to the water of purification: If the priest <b>sanctified</b> the water in two vessels in such a manner that he sanctified <b>less than the amount of sprinkling in this vessel,</b> i.e., there was not enough water into which he could dip a bundle of hyssop and sprinkle the water with it, <b>and</b> he sanctified <b>less than the amount of sprinkling in that vessel,</b> then <b>he has not sanctified</b> the water. Even if he subsequently combines the contents of both vessels into a single vessel, the water is not sanctified.
The Gemara continues: <b>And a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>With regard to</b> the collection of <b>blood</b> of a sin offering for the purpose of sprinkling it upon the altar, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is</b> the ruling with regard to the water of purification <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, in which case the <i>halakha</i> with regard to blood may not be derived from it, as <b>we do not derive</b> other cases <b>from a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai?
The Gemara explains the other side of the dilemma: <b>Or perhaps, there,</b> in the case of the water of purification, <b>what is the reason</b> that it is not sanctified? It is possible that the reason is <b>that it is written</b> in a verse that is referring to the water initially placed in the vessel: <b>“And dip it in the water”</b> (Numbers 19:18). If this verse is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the hyssop may be dipped in the water of purification only when there was initially enough water in the vessel for sprinkling, then <b>here too,</b> in the case of the blood of a sin offering, <b>isn’t it written: “And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger <b>in the blood”</b> (Leviticus 4:6)?
The Gemara continues: <b>And it was stated</b> with regard to this dilemma: <b>Rabbi Zerika says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even in</b> the case of the <b>blood, one has not sanctified</b> it if he collected less than a full measure of blood in a single vessel. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is also taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the bull of <b>the anointed priest.</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6). From the term <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip”</b> it is derived that there must be enough blood inside the vessel in which to dip his finger, <b>and</b> there should <b>not</b> be so little blood that he must resort to <b>wiping</b> his finger along the walls of the vessel.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Additionally, from the term <b>“in the blood”</b> it is derived <b>that there should initially be in</b> the vessel containing <b>the blood a measure</b> fit for <b>dipping</b> his finger. Furthermore, it is derived from the term <b>“of the blood”</b> that he must sprinkle <b>from the blood of the matter,</b> as will be explained.
<b>And it was necessary</b> for the Merciful One <b>to write: “And</b> the priest <b>shall dip,” and it was necessary</b> for the Merciful One <b>to write: “In the blood,”</b> despite the fact that both terms are referring to the amount of blood that must be in the vessel. <b>Because if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip,” I would say</b> that it is enough if the vessel contains enough blood for even one sprinkling, <b>even though</b> the priest <b>did not initially collect a measure</b> fit for all of the <b>sprinklings, that is,</b> enough with which to <b>sprinkle seven times.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “In the blood.”</b>
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“In the blood,” I would say</b> that if there was initially a full measure collected in the vessel then the sprinkling is valid <b>even</b> if now the priest must resort to <b>wiping</b> his finger. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “And</b> the priest <b>shall dip,”</b> indicating that the priest must be able to dip his finger into the blood and not have to wipe it on the walls of the vessel.
The Gemara returns to the last statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that the priest must sprinkle <b>from the blood of the matter.</b> This statement serves <b>to exclude what? Rava said:</b> It serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>remainder</b> of blood <b>on</b> his <b>finger</b> from the previous sprinkling, i.e., the priest must dip his finger into the blood before each sprinkling; he may not sprinkle with the blood that remains on his finger from the previous sprinkling. The Gemara notes: This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, who says</b> that the <b>remainder</b> of blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on</b> the priest’s <b>finger is unfit</b> for sprinkling.
<b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said to Rava: Your students say</b> that <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where a priest <b>was sprinkling</b> from the blood of a sin offering <b>and</b> the blood of the <b>sprinkling sprayed from his hand</b> onto a garment, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>If</b> the blood sprayed onto the garment <b>before he sprinkled,</b> the garment <b>requires laundering,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> when the blood of a sin offering that is fit for sprinkling fell on a garment. But if the blood sprayed onto the garment <b>after he</b> had already <b>sprinkled,</b> it <b>does not require laundering.</b>
Ravin bar Rav Adda asks: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this means if the blood sprayed onto the garment <b>before he completed</b> all of <b>his sprinkling,</b> then the garment requires laundering, <b>and</b> if the blood sprayed onto the garment <b>after he completed his sprinkling,</b> then the garment does not require laundering? If so, one can <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> the <b>remainder</b> of blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on</b> his <b>finger</b> between each sprinkling is <b>fit</b> for sprinkling, as otherwise, it would not result in a requirement to launder a garment upon which it sprayed.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is saying that if the blood sprayed from his hand onto the garment <b>before</b> any particular <b>sprinkling left his hand,</b> the garment <b>requires laundering. But</b> if the blood was sprayed <b>after a sprinkling left his hand,</b> in which case the blood <b>sprayed from that which remained</b> on his finger following that sprinkling, then the garment <b>does not require laundering,</b> as the blood left on his finger was already rendered unfit for sprinkling.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava from a mishna discussing the red heifer (<i>Para</i> 3:9): When the priest has <b>completed sprinkling</b> the blood of the red heifer toward the entrance to the Sanctuary, <b>he wipes his hand</b> from the blood <b>on the body of the heifer.</b> Abaye explains his objection: The mishna states that when the priest <b>completed</b> all the sprinklings, then <b>yes,</b> he wipes his hand. It may be inferred that if he <b>did not complete</b> the sprinklings, he does <b>not</b> wipe his hand, even though blood remains on his finger from each preceding sprinkling. This proves that the blood that remains on his finger is fit for sprinkling.
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: The mishna means that when the priest <b>completed</b> all of the sprinklings, <b>he wipes his hand.</b> If he has <b>not</b> yet <b>completed</b> all of them, then he does not wipe his hand but he must <b>wipe his finger</b> to remove the blood after each sprinkling, as that blood is no longer fit for subsequent sprinklings.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted,</b> after <b>he completed</b> all the sprinklings <b>he wipes his hand on the body of the heifer, as it is written: “And the heifer shall be burned in his sight;</b> her skin, and her flesh, and her blood” (Numbers 19:5), which indicates that the blood of the red heifer must be burned together with its flesh. <b>But</b> if when the priest had <b>not</b> yet <b>completed</b> the sprinklings <b>he wipes his finger,</b> then <b>with what</b> does he <b>wipe? Because if you say</b> that he wipes his finger <b>on the body of the heifer,</b> the mishna <b>should have taught:</b> He <b>wipes his hand and his finger on the body of the heifer.</b> Rather, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>does not teach this,</b> that he wipes his finger on the body of the heifer, one can <b>conclude from</b> this mishna <b>that</b> his finger <b>does not require wiping</b> between sprinklings.
<b>Abaye said:</b> He wipes his finger <b>on the edge of</b> the <b>bowl</b> containing the blood, <b>as it is written: “Atoning bowls [<i>keforei</i>] of gold”</b> (Ezra 1:10), which is referring to the bowls containing the blood. The root <i>kafar</i> can also mean to wipe.
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of the sanctification of blood collected in two vessels: <b>And did Rabbi Elazar</b> really <b>say this,</b> that blood is sanctified only when a full measure is initially collected in a single vessel? <b>But it was stated</b> with regard to the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified in halves,</b> i.e., if half of a tenth of an ephah was placed in one vessel, and a second half in another vessel, neither is sanctified. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Since it is sacrificed in halves,</b> as half of the meal offering is sacrificed in the morning and half in the afternoon, it may be <b>sanctified in halves.</b>

Daf 8a

<b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Elazar holds that blood may not be sanctified in halves, <b>let him derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering <b>from</b> that of <b>blood. And if you would say</b> that in this case <b>Rabbi Elazar does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>matter</b> of a meal offering <b>from</b> that of another <b>matter,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say: A meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful</b> while <b>inside the Sanctuary</b> is <b>valid,</b> despite the fact that the handful should be removed in the Temple courtyard; the reason is <b>that we find</b> a similar case in the Sanctuary, <b>with regard to the removal of</b> the <b>bowls</b> of frankincense from the Table of the shewbread? Just as the bowls permit the shewbread for consumption when removed in the Sanctuary, so too, the handful permits the remainder of the meal offering for consumption. This indicates that Rabbi Elazar does derive the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering from that of another matter.
The Gemara responds: Rabbi Elazar does <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a meal offering from</b> that of another <b>meal offering;</b> the shewbread is considered a meal offering. But <b>he does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a meal offering from</b> that of <b>blood.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>meal offering from</b> that of another <b>meal offering? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>before</b> the priest <b>detached</b> the arrangement of shewbread and the bowls of frankincense from upon the Table, the <b>bread broke</b> into pieces, <b>the bread</b> is <b>unfit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> the priest <b>does not burn the</b> frankincense contained in the <b>bowls on</b> account of <b>it.</b> If the <b>bread broke after</b> the priest <b>detached it, the bread is unfit but</b> the priest <b>burns the</b> frankincense contained in the <b>bowls on</b> account of <b>it.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> When the <i>baraita</i> refers to the detachment of the shewbread, it does <b>not</b> mean that the priest <b>actually detached it. Rather,</b> it means that <b>once</b> the <b>time to detach it has arrived, even though he has not</b> yet <b>detached it</b> and has not removed the bowls, <b>it is considered as though he has detached it.</b> Accordingly, if the shewbread broke after that time, the frankincense is burned.
The Gemara explains its question: <b>And</b> if Rabbi Elazar derives the <i>halakha</i> of one meal offering from another, <b>why</b> does he say that frankincense contained in the bowls are burned in a case where the shewbread broke when the time to detach the bread had arrived? <b>It should be like</b> the case of <b>a meal offering that became lacking</b> in its measure <b>before the removal of the handful.</b> Such a handful is not removed and is not sacrificed upon the altar. Likewise, the frankincense was still on the Table when the shewbread broke and should therefore be disqualified.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as there is a difference between these meal offerings. In the case of <b>a meal offering</b> that became lacking before the removal of a handful, <b>its handful was not clearly designated.</b> Consequently, if the meal offering became lacking before a handful was removed, one may no longer remove a handful from it. <b>But</b> in the case of the shewbread and the bowls of frankincense, <b>its handful,</b> i.e., the frankincense, <b>was clearly designated</b> at the time when the frankincense was placed in the bowls, since the frankincense is in a separate container from the bread. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>once</b> the <b>time to detach</b> the bread <b>has arrived, it is considered as though he has detached it.</b>
The Gemara asks: But <b>if that is so,</b> then even if the time to detach the shewbread arrived, why is the frankincense burned? <b>It should be like</b> a case where the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>became lacking between</b> the <b>removal of the handful and</b> the <b>burning</b> upon the altar; the <i>halakha</i> in this case is <b>that</b> one <b>does not burn the handful on</b> account of such a meal offering. The Gemara responds: <b>Isn’t it a dispute</b> among the <i>amora’im</i> (9a) whether or not the handful is burned in such a case? One can say that <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that if the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering became <b>lacking between</b> the <b>removal of the handful and</b> the <b>burning,</b> the priest <b>burns the handful on</b> account of such a meal offering.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> With regard to the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of</b> the <b>High Priest, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified in halves, and Rabbi Elazar says: Since it is sacrificed in halves,</b> as half of the meal offering is sacrificed in the morning and half in the afternoon, it may likewise be <b>sanctified in halves. Rav Aḥa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan? The verse states: “A meal offering</b> perpetually, <b>half of it</b> in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). This means: First <b>bring</b> a whole <b>meal offering, and</b> only <b>afterward divide it</b> into halves.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. The mishna teaches (50b): The <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of</b> the <b>High Priest did not come in halves. Rather,</b> the High Priest <b>brings a full tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and</b> then <b>divides it</b> into two. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this mishna: <b>If it were stated: A meal offering, half</b> in the morning, and half in the evening, <b>I would say: He brings half of a tenth from his home</b> in the <b>morning and sacrifices</b> it, and another <b>half of a tenth from his home</b> in the <b>evening and sacrifices</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Half of it in the morning,”</b> indicating that <b>he brings a half from a whole,</b> and he does not bring a half by itself.
The Gemara responds: Rabbi Elazar maintains that the verse requires that a whole meal offering be brought in the morning only <b>for a mitzva,</b> i.e., <i>ab initio</i>. Nevertheless, if half of a tenth was brought in the morning it is valid after the fact. <b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil said to Rav Ashi: But</b> the term <b>“statute” is written with regard to</b> the griddle-cake offering, as the verse states: “A statute forever” (Leviticus 6:15), and there is a principle that whenever the Torah calls a mitzva a statute, the details of its performance are indispensable. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: It was necessary</b> for the Torah to define this mitzva as a statute <b>only with regard to</b> the requirement that the High Priest <b>bring a full</b> tenth <b>from his home.</b> With regard to its sanctification in a service vessel, it can be sanctified in halves.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>say this? But it was stated:</b> If one <b>set aside half a tenth</b> of an ephah for any meal offering, <b>and his intention</b> was <b>to add</b> to the half in order to reach a full tenth, <b>Rav says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified,</b> as he did not bring a full tenth, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>sanctified. And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that the griddle-cake offering cannot be sanctified in halves, <b>let him derive from</b> the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering that no meal offering may be sanctified in halves.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>matter</b> with regard to consecrated items <b>from</b> that of another <b>matter,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Peace offerings that</b> were <b>slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is written: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: It is logical <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area, i.e., the courtyard, <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>major</b> area, the Tent of Meeting. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan derives a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Sanctuary from the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara responds: Rabbi Yoḥanan does in fact derive the <i>halakha</i> of one matter from another, and therefore he learns the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all meal offerings from the griddle-cake offering, that in general they are not sanctified in halves. But a case where one expresses <b>his intention to add</b> to the half measure <b>is different, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Both of them <b>full</b> of fine flour” (Numbers 7:13). <b>“Full”</b> is a reference <b>only</b> to <b>full</b> measurements; <b>that is to say,</b> the flour <b>is not sanctified until there is a full tenth</b> inside the vessel. <b>And Rabbi Yosei said: When</b> is it the <i>halakha</i> that the flour is sanctified only if a full tenth is inside the vessel? It is <b>at a time when his intention</b> was <b>not</b> initially <b>to add</b> to that which he placed inside the vessel. <b>But at a time when his intention</b> was initially <b>to add, each initial</b> bit of flour is <b>sanctified</b> by the vessel.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav,</b> who holds that standard meal offerings are not sanctified in halves even if one’s initial intention was to add to the half measure, <b>with regard to a griddle-cake</b> offering, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does he hold? If</b> he holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who says that a griddle-cake offering can be sanctified in halves, then <b>let him derive from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>griddle-cake</b> offerings that all meal offerings may be sanctified in halves.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rav does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>matter from</b> that of another <b>matter,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rav say:</b> A standard <b>meal offering,</b> which is brought with oil and frankincense, <b>is sanctified</b> by a service vessel even <b>without</b> its <b>oil</b> and without its frankincense. It is sanctified without its oil, <b>as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the shewbread,</b> which is sacrificed without oil and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel. Similarly, it is sanctified even <b>without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the meal offering</b> accompanying the <b>libations</b> of an offering, which is sacrificed without frankincense and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel.
Finally, a standard meal offering is sanctified by a service vessel even <b>without</b> its <b>oil and without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which includes neither of these. This indicates that Rav does derive the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering from other meal offerings. Rather, <b>perforce,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering, <b>Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that this offering is not sanctified in halves, and it is derived from there that no meal offerings are sanctified in halves.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav says</b> that <b>a meal offering is sanctified without</b> its <b>oil, and its <i>halakha</i> is not</b> the same <b>as</b> when <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour is <b>lacking, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the shewbread,</b> which is sacrificed without oil and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel. Similarly, it is sanctified even <b>without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the meal offering</b> accompanying the <b>libations</b> of an offering, which is sacrificed without frankincense and is nevertheless sanctified. Additionally, a meal offering is sanctified even <b>without</b> its <b>oil and without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which lacks both oil and frankincense and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel.
Rav continues: <b>And oil and frankincense are</b> each <b>sanctified</b> by service vessels, <b>this</b> substance <b>without that</b> one, <b>and that</b> substance <b>without this</b> one. <b>Oil</b> is sanctified on its own, <b>as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the <i>log</i> of oil of a leper,</b> which is sanctified on its own. <b>Frankincense</b> is sanctified on its own, <b>as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the frankincense that comes in the bowls</b> that are brought with the shewbread; there is no oil in that case and yet the frankincense is sanctified in the bowls. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b>

Daf 8b

<b>Neither</b> is <b>this</b> substance <b>sanctified without that, nor is that sanctified without this.</b> Rather, any meal offering that requires oil and frankincense is sanctified by a service vessel only when the flour, oil, and frankincense are all placed in the same vessel at the same time.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, for what</b> purpose was the vessel that measured <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>anointed,</b> making it possible for it to sanctify items placed inside it? This vessel <b>was fashioned only for measuring flour, and</b> according to Rabbi Ḥanina <b>the flour is not sanctified without oil.</b> What then does this vessel sanctify? The Gemara answers: The vessel was anointed <b>for</b> the purpose of sanctifying the <b>meal offering of a sinner,</b> which contains neither oil nor frankincense.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And for what</b> purpose was the vessel that measured one <b><i>log</i></b> of oil <b>anointed?</b> After all, according to Rabbi Ḥanina oil for a meal offering cannot be sanctified by itself. The Gemara explains: It was anointed <b>for</b> the purpose of sanctifying the <b><i>log</i></b> of oil <b>of a leper,</b> which is not brought as part of a meal offering. This oil is sanctified without flour or frankincense.
The Gemara notes: <b>And Shmuel also holds in accordance with this</b> statement <b>of Rav,</b> that a service vessel sanctifies the flour of a meal offering even without its oil, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 88a): <b>The vessels</b> used for <b>liquids sanctify</b> only <b>the liquids, and the</b> vessels that serve as <b>dry measures sanctify</b> only <b>the dry</b> goods. <b>But the vessels</b> used for <b>liquids do not sanctify the dry</b> goods, <b>and the</b> vessels that serve as <b>dry measures do not sanctify the liquids.</b>
<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>They taught</b> that vessels used for liquids do not sanctify dry goods <b>only</b> with regard to vessels used as <b>measures. But bowls</b> that are used for collecting and tossing the <b>blood</b> of offerings <b>sanctify the dry goods</b> as well, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offerings of the princes brought during the inauguration of the Tabernacle: <b>“Both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering”</b> (Numbers 7:13), which indicates that the bowl sanctifies meal offerings, which are dry.
The Gemara continues its proof: And <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina,</b> with regard to this derivation of Shmuel: But the <b>meal offering</b> of the verse <b>is</b> also considered <b>a liquid,</b> as it is mingled with oil. How then can one derive from it the <i>halakha</i> with regard to items that are entirely dry? Ravina <b>said to him:</b> The verse cited by Shmuel <b>is necessary only to</b> teach that <b>the dry</b> part <b>of</b> a meal offering, <b>that is,</b> the <b>frankincense,</b> which invariably does not come into contact with the oil, is sanctified by the bowls as well.
The Gemara concludes its proof with regard to Shmuel’s opinion: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>Shmuel holds</b> that <b>a meal offering is not sanctified</b> by a service vessel <b>until all</b> of its components <b>are</b> together in the vessel, then <b>how can you find</b> a case where the <b>dry</b> parts <b>of</b> a meal offering are by themselves? <b>Is it not</b> correct that when meal offerings are sanctified, <b>all of them are liquids, due to the oil</b> that is mixed with them? <b>Rather, conclude from</b> here that <b>Shmuel holds</b> that <b>this</b> substance may be sanctified <b>without that</b> one.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead in answer to Rav Aḥa of Difti’s question: <b>A meal offering,</b> even when it is mixed with oil, is, <b>relative to blood, considered as a dry</b> item. Accordingly, one may derive from the verse that the bowls sanctify dry items, and just as a bowl sanctifies a meal offering that contains oil, as it is considered dry in comparison to blood, so too, it sanctifies a meal offering that is entirely dry, i.e., that contains no oil, as claimed by Rav.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Elazar says: A meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful</b> while <b>inside the Sanctuary</b> is <b>valid,</b> despite the fact that the handful should be removed in the Temple courtyard; the reason is <b>that we find</b> a similar case in the Sanctuary, <b>with regard to the removal of</b> the <b>bowls</b> of frankincense from the Table of the shewbread. Just as the bowls permit the shewbread for consumption, so too, the handful permits the remainder of the meal offering for consumption.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to this opinion from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; <b>and he shall remove from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2). The verse indicates that the removal of a handful from a meal offering may be performed <b>from the place where the feet of the non-priest</b> may <b>stand,</b> i.e., anywhere within the Temple courtyard.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Beteira,</b> who holds that a handful is not disqualified when removed with the left hand, <b>says</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>removed a handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>that he must return</b> the handful to the vessel that contains the meal offering <b>and</b> again <b>remove the handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand? <b>The verse states: “And he shall remove from there.”</b> This indicates that the handful is removed <b>from the place where he already removed</b> it, i.e., the handful is returned to the meal offering and thereupon removed from the same meal offering, this time with his right hand. It is clear from the statement of the first <i>tanna</i> that the handful of a meal offering may be removed only in the place where the feet of a non-priest may stand, but not in the Sanctuary.
<b>Some say</b> that Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raises the objection and he resolves it</b> as well. And <b>some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: I will explain to you</b> the resolution of this objection: The verse <b>is necessary only to permit the entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> for removing the handful there, not to prohibit the removal of a handful inside the Sanctuary. The reason is <b>that you should not say: Since a burnt offering</b> is <b>an offering of the most sacred order, and a meal offering</b> is likewise <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> then <b>just as a burnt offering requires</b> that its slaughter be performed in the <b>northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard, <b>so too, a meal offering requires</b> that the removal of its handful be in the <b>northern</b> part.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this comparison: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is more sacred, as it is <b>consumed</b> in its entirety upon the altar. The Gemara responds: The same comparison may be drawn <b>from a sin offering,</b> which is also an offering of the most sacred order and is not sacrificed in its entirety upon the altar, and yet it must be slaughtered in the northern part of the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this comparison as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sin offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a sin offering are more stringent, as its sacrifice <b>atones for</b> those sins whose transgression causes one to be <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b> The Gemara responds: The comparison may be drawn <b>from a guilt offering,</b> as it too is an offering of the most sacred order, it is not sacrificed in its entirety upon the altar, it does not atone for such sins, and yet it must be slaughtered in the northern part of the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a guilt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a guilt offering has a loftier status, as it is one of <b>the types of</b> offerings whose atonement is achieved through their <b>blood,</b> i.e., it is an animal offering. The Gemara adds: Once this claim has been accepted, <b>from all of them as well,</b> i.e., from a burnt offering and sin offering, one cannot draw a comparison to a meal offering either, <b>as</b> they are all of <b>the types of</b> offerings whose atonement is achieved through their <b>blood.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>was necessary</b> in order to permit the removal of a handful anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and it states: <b>“And he shall remove</b> from there his handful” (Leviticus 2:2), one could claim: <b>Just as</b> the <b>bringing</b> of the meal offering is <b>in the southwestern corner</b> of the altar, <b>so too,</b> the <b>removal of the handful</b> must <b>also</b> be performed <b>in the southwestern corner.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the removal of the handful may be performed anywhere in the Temple courtyard, but this does not serve to exclude the Sanctuary.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Peace offerings that</b> were <b>slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is stated: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard. <b>And</b> it is logical that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area, i.e., the courtyard, <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one, the Tent of Meeting or the Sanctuary.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if gentiles surrounded the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> and were firing projectiles inside to the point that it became impossible to remain in the courtyard on account of the threat, <b>that the priests enter the Sanctuary and partake of the offerings of the most sacred order and the remainders of</b> the <b>meal offerings</b> while inside the Sanctuary? <b>The verse states:</b>

Daf 9a

“Every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs, which they may render unto Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. <b>In the Sanctuary you shall eat them”</b> (Numbers 18:9–10). This indicates that although the mitzva is to consume offerings of the most sacred order in the courtyard, in certain instances the priests may consume these offerings inside the Sanctuary, the most holy place.
The Gemara explains its objection: <b>But</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>why do I</b> need this <b>verse? Let him say</b> here as well that as the verse states: <b>“In the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), i.e., in the Temple courtyard, it is logical that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one, i.e., if one may consume a peace offering in the Temple courtyard then all the more so may he consume it in the Sanctuary.
The Gemara explains: Consuming an offering is not the same as slaughtering it. The slaughter of an offering is part of the sacrificial <b>service,</b> and it is not considered disrespectful <b>for a person</b> to <b>serve</b> his master <b>in the place of his master,</b> i.e., within the Sanctuary as well as in the courtyard. Therefore, <b>we say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one. By contrast, with regard to the <b>consumption</b> of an offering, <b>since a person may not eat in the place of his master, the</b> only <b>reason</b> that it is permitted to consume an offering inside the Sanctuary is <b>that</b> it is <b>written</b> in <b>the verse:</b> “In a most holy place you shall eat them.” <b>Had</b> this <b>not</b> been <b>written</b> in <b>the verse</b> explicitly, <b>we</b> would <b>not say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If one <b>mixed</b> the oil of a meal offering into <b>it outside the wall of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>disqualified,</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it is <b>valid. Reish Lakish says:</b> It is <b>valid, as it is written: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), <b>and then</b> it is written: <b>“And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall remove”</b> (Leviticus 2:2).
Reish Lakish explains: The Sages derived from here that <b>from the removal of the handful onward</b> the rites performed with the meal offering are solely <b>a mitzva of</b> the <b>priesthood.</b> Accordingly, the verse <b>taught about pouring and mixing that they are valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest. And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>priesthood is not required</b> for the mixing, it may be derived that it <b>is also not required</b> that its performance be <b>inside</b> the walls of the Temple courtyard.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This meal offering is <b>disqualified, since</b> a meal offering’s <b>performance is in</b> a service <b>vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>granted that</b> the <b>priesthood is not required,</b> yet <b>in any event</b> its performance <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>is required.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If a meal offering was <b>mixed</b> by a <b>non-priest</b> it is <b>valid.</b> But if it was mixed <b>outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b>
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to a <b>meal offering that became lacking</b> in its full measure <b>before the removal of the handful, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the owner <b>shall bring</b> additional flour <b>from within his home and shall fill</b> the missing part of the measure of the meal offering. <b>Reish Lakish says: He shall not bring</b> flour <b>from within his home and fill it.</b> Instead, he must bring a new meal offering.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he brings</b> flour <b>from within his home and he fills it,</b> as the <b>removal of the handful establishes it</b> as a meal offering to the extent that it may become disqualified. Before the removal, one may always add flour to the meal offering. <b>Reish Lakish says: He shall not bring</b> flour <b>from within his home and fill it,</b> as <b>the sanctity of</b> the service <b>vessel establishes it</b> as a meal offering. Therefore, once the meal offering was placed in a service vessel and sanctified, it is disqualified if it becomes lacking.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> Reish Lakish, from a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:10) discussing the <i>log</i> of oil brought by a leper: In a case where <b>the <i>log</i> lacked</b> a full measure, <b>if</b> it became lacking <b>before</b> the priest <b>poured</b> from it into his palm in order to place it on the right thumb and big toe of the leper, <b>he shall fill it.</b> Clearly the service vessel containing the <i>log</i> does not sanctify the oil to the extent that it can become disqualified. The Gemara notes: Indeed, this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of Reish Lakish.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>that became lacking between</b> the <b>removal of the handful and</b> its <b>burning</b> upon the altar, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that one <b>burns the handful on</b> account of such a remainder, and that the remainder is then permitted for consumption. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that one does <b>not burn the handful on</b> account of the remainder. The Gemara notes: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, everyone agrees</b> that the handful is burned on account of the remainder. In other words, both <i>amora’im</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, concur that this is the <i>halakha</i> according to the <i>tanna</i> Rabbi Eliezer. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is concerning the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>
The Gemara cites the dispute in question. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (26a): If, after the handful was removed, <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>became ritually impure,</b> or if <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>was burned,</b> or if <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>was lost, according to the principle of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that with regard to an animal offering the blood is fit for sprinkling even if there is no meat that can be eaten, the meal offering is <b>fit,</b> and the priest burns the handful. <b>But according to the principle of Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who says that with regard to an animal offering the blood is fit for sprinkling only if there is meat that can be eaten, it is <b>unfit</b> and the priest does not burn the handful, as the handful serves to render the remainder permitted.
<b>The one who disqualifies</b> the remainder of a meal offering that became lacking between the removal of the handful and its burning upon the altar, i.e., Reish Lakish, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the plain meaning of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. And the one who deems</b> that remainder <b>fit,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, maintains that when <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that the remainder is unfit, he says so <b>only there,</b> in a case <b>where nothing remained</b> from the meal offering other than the remainder. Since the handful is intended to render permitted for consumption the remainder of the meal offering, if there is no remainder at all then the handful is not burned. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where there remained</b> a portion of the remainder, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that <b>even Rabbi Yehoshua concedes to</b> Rabbi Eliezer that the handful is fit to be burned.
The Gemara cites a proof for Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is clear that this is Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>any of the offerings that</b> are mentioned <b>in the Torah from which there remains</b> either <b>an olive-bulk of meat or an olive-bulk of fat,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the priest <b>sprinkles the blood</b> of that offering and thereby permits either the remaining meat for consumption or the remaining fat for sacrifice upon the altar. But if there remains only <b>half an olive-bulk of meat</b> and <b>half an olive-bulk of fat, he does not sprinkle the blood,</b> as the consumption or burning of anything less than an olive-bulk is not significant enough to warrant the sprinkling of the blood. The volumes of the meat and the fat do not combine to form a whole olive-bulk.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And in</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering, even</b> if there remains only <b>half an olive-bulk of flesh and half an olive-bulk of fat, he sprinkles the blood, because in</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering it is entirely consumed,</b> i.e., as the flesh and fat are both burned upon the altar, there is in fact an olive-bulk of the offering that is designated for burning upon the altar. <b>And with regard to a meal offering, even though it</b> remains <b>entirely intact, he shall not sprinkle.</b>

Daf 9b

Parenthetically, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mention of <b>a meal offering doing</b> here, in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses slaughtered offerings? There is no sprinkling in the case of a meal offering. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations</b> brought with a slaughtered offering.
Rav Pappa elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> such a meal offering <b>comes with a</b> slaughtered <b>offering, it is considered like</b> the <b>offering itself.</b> Accordingly, if the only part remaining from an offering is the meal offering that is brought with it, perhaps it is considered as though part of the offering itself remains, and therefore the priest may sprinkle the offering’s blood on account of it. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>. In any event, Rabbi Yehoshua states in this <i>baraita</i> that the blood of an offering is sprinkled if a minimum amount remains from it. The same should apply to the remainder of a regular meal offering.
Rabbi Yoḥanan cited this <i>baraita</i> as proof that even according to Rabbi Yehoshua, if a portion of the remainder of a meal offering remains intact then the handful may be burned on account of it. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning <b>the one who disqualifies</b> the handful when the remainder is lacking, i.e., Reish Lakish, how does he explain the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua? The Gemara responds: Reish Lakish would claim that it <b>is different here,</b> in the case of a meal offering, <b>as the verse states: “And the priest shall remove from the meal offering its memorial part, and shall make it smoke upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:9). Since it is clear that the verse is discussing a meal offering, the apparently superfluous mention of <b>“the meal offering”</b> teaches that <b>unless the entire meal offering is</b> intact, the priest <b>shall not burn</b> the handful.
The Gemara continues: <b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan, how does he interpret that verse? Rabbi Yoḥanan claims that the phrase <b>“from the meal offering”</b> is referring to <b>a meal offering that was already whole at the time of the removal of</b> its <b>handful,</b> and the verse teaches that <b>he shall burn</b> its handful <b>even though it is currently not whole.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>before</b> the priest <b>detached</b> the arrangement of shewbread and the bowls of frankincense from upon the Table, the <b>bread broke</b> into pieces, the bread is <b>unfit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> the priest <b>does not burn</b> the frankincense contained in <b>the bowls on</b> account of <b>it. And if</b> the <b>bread broke after</b> the priest <b>detached it, the bread is unfit but</b> the priest <b>burns the</b> frankincense contained in the <b>bowls on</b> account of <b>it. And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does <b>not</b> mean that the priest <b>actually detached</b> the shewbread. <b>Rather,</b> it means that <b>once</b> the <b>time to detach it has arrived</b> the frankincense contained in the bowls may be burned, <b>even though he has not</b> yet <b>detached it.</b> Just as the frankincense contained in the bowls is burned despite the broken shewbread, likewise, the handful of a meal offering should be burned even when the remainder is lacking.
Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who permits the burning of a handful even when the remainder has been entirely destroyed. And I hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: I am stating a complete <i>halakha</i> to you,</b> i.e., a <i>baraita</i> of an unspecified opinion, <b>and you say to me</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> alone?
Rabbi Yoḥanan added: And furthermore, <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of only <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> then <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mention <b>specifically</b> an instance where the bread <b>broke?</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, <b>even</b> if the bread was <b>burned or lost</b> entirely, <b>he deems</b> the frankincense contained in the bowls <b>fit</b> for burning <b>as well.</b> The Gemara notes: Reish Lakish <b>was silent</b> and did not respond to the objections of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara asks: <b>But why was</b> Reish Lakish <b>silent? Let him say to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan that one cannot cite a proof from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the shewbread, a communal offering, because offerings of the <b>community are different, since ritual impurity was permitted for them,</b> i.e., communal offerings may be sacrificed even in a state of ritual impurity. Therefore, it <b>was also permitted</b> to sacrifice them when they <b>are lacking. Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> The fact <b>that</b> Reish Lakish did not respond in <b>this</b> manner <b>is to say</b> that a meal offering that is <b>lacking</b> in measure <b>is considered like a blemished</b> animal, not merely like an impure offering, <b>and there is no</b> instance of <b>a blemished</b> animal being permitted for use as an offering, even <b>in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa</b> was once <b>sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>,</b> and he noted that Reish Lakish was silent and did not respond to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s objections by differentiating between a communal offering and that of an individual, and that Rav Adda bar Ahava derived from Reish Lakish’s silence that a lack in the measure of a meal offering is tantamount to a blemish. <b>Rav Yosef bar Shemaya said to Rav Pappa: Are we not dealing</b> with a disagreement <b>that</b> exists between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> even <b>in</b> the case of <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which is a communal</b> offering? <b>And</b> even so, they <b>disagree.</b> Accordingly, Reish Lakish could not have responded to the objections of Rabbi Yoḥanan by distinguishing between a communal and an individual offering, and therefore one cannot derive from his silence that a meal offering lacking in its measure is like a blemished animal.
The Gemara further discusses the disagreement between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. <b>Rav Malkiyu says</b> that <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught:</b> The verse states: “And he shall remove…<b>of its fine flour”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). This indicates <b>that if</b> the meal offering <b>lacks any amount</b> of its flour, it is <b>disqualified</b> and the priest may not remove a handful from it. Similarly, the term: <b>“Of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), teaches <b>that if</b> the meal offering <b>lacks any amount</b> of its oil, it is <b>disqualified.</b>
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the verse that states: <b>“But that which is left of the meal offering</b> shall be Aaron’s and his sons’” (Leviticus 2:3), teaches that the remainder of the meal offering is given to the priests only if there was initially a whole meal offering, <b>to the exclusion of a meal offering that was lacking, or whose handful was lacking, or from which</b> the priest <b>did not burn any frankincense.</b> In such cases, the meal offering is disqualified and its remainder may not be consumed by the priests.
Rav Malkiyu asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>two verses to</b> disqualify meal offerings that are <b>lacking?</b> Is it <b>not</b> correct to say that <b>one</b> verse is referring <b>to a meal offering that became lacking before the removal of the handful,</b> i.e., that one may not refill it, <b>and one</b> verse is referring <b>to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>that became lacking between the removal of the handful and</b> its <b>burning</b> upon the altar, and it teaches that one may not burn a handful on account of such a remainder?
Rav Malkiyu concludes: <b>And</b> if so, then this is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan in both</b> instances where he disagrees with Reish Lakish, i.e., in the case of a meal offering that became lacking before the removal of the handful, as Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that one may refill it, and in the case of the remainder that became lacking between the removal of the handful and its burning, as he holds that the handful may be burned.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No; one</b> verse is indeed referring <b>to a meal offering that became lacking before the removal of the handful,</b> but it is not teaching that this meal offering is disqualified. Rather, this verse indicates <b>that if he brings</b> flour <b>from his home and fills it</b> so that the meal offering is no longer lacking, then <b>yes,</b> it is fit, <b>but if</b> he does <b>not</b> bring more flour, it is <b>not</b> fit. <b>And one</b> verse is indeed referring <b>to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>that became lacking between the removal of the handful and</b> its <b>burning</b> upon the altar; nevertheless, it does not indicate that the handful may not be burned. Rather, it teaches <b>that even though</b> the priest <b>burns</b> the <b>handful on</b> account of such a remainder, <b>that remainder is prohibited for consumption.</b>
The Gemara continues: This is indeed the appropriate explanation of the verses, <b>as a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: According <b>to the statement of</b> the one <b>who says that</b> in a case where the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>became lacking between the removal of the handful and</b> its <b>burning</b> upon the altar, the priest <b>burns</b> the <b>handful on</b> account of this remainder, concerning the <b>remainder itself, what</b> is its status <b>with regard to consumption,</b> i.e., may the remainder be eaten?
<b>Ze’eiri said</b> that <b>the verse states: “But that which is left</b> of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’,” which teaches that the priests may consume the remainder of a meal offering, <b>but not the remainder of the remainder,</b> i.e., if the remainder became lacking before the handful was burned, the remaining part of the remainder may not be consumed. Alternatively, <b>Rabbi Yannai says</b> that <b>“of the meal offering</b> shall be Aaron’s and his sons’” indicates that the priests may consume only the remainder of <b>a meal offering that was previously</b> whole when the handful was burned, not the remainder of the remainder.
§ The mishna teaches: If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is unfit. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that it is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And the meal offering was presented; and he filled his hand from it”</b> (Leviticus 9:17). Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>This hand, I do not know what it is,</b> i.e., the left hand or the right. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the atonement of a leper: <b>“And the priest shall take of the <i>log</i> of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand”</b> (Leviticus 14:15), it mentions the left hand. One can therefore derive that <b>here,</b> where the verse specifies, the priest must use his <b>left</b> hand, whereas in <b>any place where it is stated</b> in a verse <b>“hand”</b> without specification, it is referring <b>only</b> to the <b>right</b> hand.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how can this conclusion be derived from the verse discussing the atonement of a leper? This verse <b>is necessary for itself,</b> i.e., to teach that the oil must be poured on the priest’s left hand, not his right. The Gemara answers that <b>another</b> mention of the <b>left</b> hand <b>is written</b> in the same passage (see Leviticus 14:16). From this additional mention of the left hand it may be derived that any unspecified reference to a hand is referring to the right hand.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But say</b> that according to the hermeneutical principle that one <b>restriction after</b> another <b>restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify,</b> it should be inferred from the additional specification of the left hand that the oil may be poured onto the priest’s right hand. The Gemara responds: Yet <b>another</b> specification of the <b>left</b> hand <b>is written</b> in that passage (see Leviticus 14:26). Accordingly, the hermeneutical principle that one restriction after another serves only to amplify does not apply. Instead, the verse indicates that <b>here</b> the <b>left</b> hand is required, <b>and there is no other</b> instance where the Torah requires the <b>left</b> hand.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>on the contrary, just as here</b> the <b>left</b> hand is required, <b>so too generally,</b> the <b>left</b> hand is required <b>as well.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Four</b> mentions of the <b>left</b> hand <b>are written</b> in the passage, <b>two with regard to a poor</b> leper (Leviticus 14:26–27), <b>and two with regard to a wealthy</b> one (Leviticus 14:15–16). Accordingly, three of the specifications serve to indicate that the oil may be poured only onto the left hand, while the additional mention serves to restrict the use of the left hand to the case of a leper alone.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> According to your opinion, one interprets homiletically the additional specifications in the passage discussing the purification of a leper. If so, there is another apparently superfluous verse: <b>“Upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot”</b> (Leviticus 14:17), <b>which is written with regard to</b> the placement of the <b>oil</b> upon the right thumb and big toe <b>of a wealthy leper. Why do I</b> need the verse to specify that the oil is placed on the leper’s right thumb and big toe?

Daf 10a

After all, a verse already indicates that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe, <b>as</b> it is <b>written: “Upon the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:17). Since the Torah has already specified that the blood is placed upon the right thumb and big toe (Leviticus 14:14), it is clear that the oil is placed there as well. Similarly, why must the verse specify with regard to a poor leper that the oil is placed on the right thumb and big toe? Isn’t already clear from the verse where the oil must be placed, as it states: “Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering” (Leviticus 14:28)? The Gemara responds: <b>One</b> specification, stated with regard to a wealthy leper, serves <b>to permit</b> the placement of the oil on the <b>sides</b> of the thumb and sides of the big toe in addition to the nail side of the thumb and big toe, <b>and one,</b> stated with regard to a poor leper, serves <b>to disqualify the sides of sides,</b> i.e., their undersides.
The Gemara inquires with regard to the verse: <b>“Upon the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:17), stated with regard to the purification of a wealthy leper, and the verse: <b>“Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:28), stated with regard to the purification of a poor leper. <b>For what</b> purpose <b>do they come,</b> i.e., why are both verses necessary?
The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> verses <b>are necessary, because if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Upon the blood of the guilt offering,” I would say:</b> If the blood <b>is</b> still on the right thumb and big toe of the leper, <b>yes,</b> the priest places the oil upon the blood. But if it <b>was wiped</b> from there, he does <b>not</b> place the oil. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Upon the place</b> of the blood of the guilt offering,” indicating that the oil is placed upon the location of the blood, not necessarily upon the blood itself.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Upon the place</b> of the blood of the guilt offering,” <b>I would say:</b> The oil is placed on his right thumb and big toe <b>specifically</b> when the blood <b>was wiped</b> from there. <b>But</b> if the blood <b>is</b> still there, I will <b>say</b> that the blood <b>is an interposition</b> between the oil and the thumb or toe. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the oil is placed <b>“upon the blood of the guilt offering,”</b> and the blood is not considered an interposition.
<b>Rava said: Since it is written</b> that the priest places the oil <b>“upon the blood of the guilt offering,” and: “Upon the place of</b> the blood of <b>the guilt offering,” and it is</b> also <b>written</b> with regard to a wealthy leper (see Leviticus 14:14) and a poor one (see Leviticus 14:25) that the <b>right</b> hand and foot are required <b>for</b> the placement of <b>the blood,</b> as the verses state: <b>“Upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot,” and</b> this <b>is</b> also <b>written with regard to</b> the <b>oil of a wealthy leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:17) <b>and a poor</b> one (see Leviticus 14:28), one can ask: <b>Why do I</b> need all of these verses?
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The verses that specify that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe do not teach a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a leper, as it is clear that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe, as it states: “Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering.” Rather, these verses are the source of verbal analogies for other <i>halakhot</i>. When the verse states with regard to a wealthy leper: “Of his right hand” (Leviticus 14:17), this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“hand”</b> written here and <b>“hand”</b> written <b>with regard to the removal of a handful,</b> as the verse states about the removal of a handful: “And he filled his hand from it” (Leviticus 9:17). The verbal analogy teaches that the removal of the handful must also be performed with the right hand.
Similarly, when the verse states: “Of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:17), with regard to a wealthy leper, this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“foot”</b> written here and <b>“foot”</b> written <b>with regard to the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i>, a man whose married brother died childless, frees his brother’s widow, the <i>yevama</i>, of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>],</b> as the verse states with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>: “And remove his shoe from upon his foot” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The verbal analogy teaches that the shoe is removed from his right foot.
Additionally, when the verse states: “Upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed” (Leviticus 14:17), with regard to a wealthy leper, this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“ear”</b> written here and <b>“ear”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>piercing</b> of a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl, as the verse states: “And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl” (Exodus 21:6). The verbal analogy teaches that the slave’s right ear is pierced.
The Gemara asks: With regard to the additional mention of the <b>left</b> hand in the verse dealing <b>with the poor</b> leper, <b>for what</b> purpose <b>does</b> it <b>come? Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> It comes <b>to disqualify</b> the <b>right</b> hand <b>of a priest for</b> the purification of <b>a leper.</b> This teaches <b>that you should not say: And if in a place where</b> the <b>left</b> side <b>is not included,</b> as sacrificial rites in general are disqualified when performed with the left hand, the <b>right</b> hand <b>is included,</b> i.e., those rites must be performed with the right hand, then <b>in a place where</b> the <b>left</b> hand <b>is included,</b> in the case of a leper, <b>isn’t it logical that</b> the <b>right</b> hand should also be <b>included?</b> Therefore, the verse repeats that the oil is poured into the priest’s left hand, in order to disqualify the right hand.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning <b>the other</b> verses that specify the <b>left</b> hand of a poor leper (Leviticus 14:26–27) as well as the <b>right hand and foot of a poor</b> leper (Leviticus 14:25–28), <b>for what</b> purpose do they <b>come?</b> The Gemara responds: These verses come <b>for that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Any passage that was stated</b> in the Torah <b>and was</b> then <b>repeated, was repeated only for</b> the sake of <b>a matter that was introduced</b> for the first time <b>in</b> the repeated passage. That is, sometimes the Torah repeats an entire passage just to teach a single new detail. In this case, the verses that discuss the purification of a poor leper were repeated only for the sake of the differences in the offerings between a wealthy leper and a poor one. No additional <i>halakha</i> should be derived from them.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Any place</b> in the Torah <b>in which</b> it <b>is stated</b> that an action is performed with <b>a finger or</b> by the <b>priesthood,</b> i.e., that one uses his finger to perform the action or that a priest performs it, this teaches that it is performed <b>only</b> with the <b>right</b> hand.
The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that this means that <b>we require both a finger and</b> the <b>priesthood</b> to be stated together in the verse in order to mandate use of the right hand, e.g., <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand <b>is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger”</b> (Leviticus 14:16). This cannot be correct, <b>as</b> there is the verse that addresses <b>the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>in which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written, and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (6a): If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is <b>unfit.</b>
Therefore, <b>Rava said:</b> This statement means that if the verse mentions <b>either a finger or</b> the <b>priesthood,</b> only the right hand may be used.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: But this is contradicted by the verse discussing <b>the conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the daily burnt offering <b>to the ramp</b> of the altar, <b>as priesthood is written with regard to it, as it is written: “And the priest shall sacrifice the whole</b> and make it smoke <b>upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>and the Master said</b> that <b>this</b> verse is referring to <b>the conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs to the ramp. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 31b): When the priest conveys the limbs to the ramp, <b>the foot of</b> the <b>right</b> side of the offering is carried <b>in</b> the <b>left</b> hand of the priest, <b>and the place of its skin,</b> i.e., the side of the limb covered in skin, is held facing <b>outward.</b> Clearly, use of the left hand does not disqualify the conveyance of the limbs.
The Gemara responds: <b>When we say</b> that if the verse states <b>either finger or priesthood</b> then the left hand is disqualified, this is only <b>with regard to a matter that precludes atonement,</b> i.e., a rite whose performance is indispensable to the atonement, similar to the sprinkling of the oil on the leper (see Leviticus 14:16). The conveyance of the limbs, by contrast, is not indispensable to atonement.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there the <b>collection</b> of the blood in a service vessel, <b>which is a matter indispensable to atonement, and about which priesthood is written? As it is written: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), and <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the collection of the blood. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 15b): If <b>one collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the blood is <b>disqualified</b> for offering, <b>and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit,</b> despite the fact that priesthood is mentioned in the verse.
The Gemara responds: <b>You are saying</b> that there is a difficulty <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? Rabbi Shimon requires</b> that <b>both</b> matters appear in the verse, i.e., both finger and priesthood.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon</b> really <b>require both? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In <b>any place</b> in the Torah in <b>which</b> the word <b>hand is stated,</b> the verse <b>is</b> referring <b>only</b> to the <b>right</b> hand, and whenever a verse mentions the word <b>finger,</b> it <b>is</b> referring <b>only</b> to a finger of the <b>right</b> hand? The Gemara responds: According to Rabbi Shimon, if the verse mentions only the word <b>finger,</b> it <b>does not require</b> a mention of the <b>priesthood</b> as well for the limitation to apply. But if the verse mentions only the <b>priesthood,</b> it <b>requires</b> mention of the term <b>finger</b> for the limitation to apply.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to Rabbi Shimon, if the mention of the priesthood alone does not suffice to disqualify the right hand, then <b>why do I</b> need the superfluous reference to <b>a priest</b> with regard to the collection of the blood? After all, the verse already states that the collection must be performed by the sons of Aaron. The Gemara responds: The additional mention of the priesthood indicates that a priest must perform the collection of the blood <b>in his priestly state,</b> i.e., while wearing the priestly vestments.

Daf 10b

The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>concerning which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written</b> in the verse, <b>and we learned:</b> If <b>one sprinkled</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand it is <b>disqualified; and Rabbi Shimon does not disagree</b> with this ruling, indicating that Rabbi Shimon holds that a mention of the priesthood does not require a mention of the word finger? <b>Abaye says: He disagrees</b> with this ruling <b>in a <i>baraita</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand it is <b>disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b> Additionally, if <b>one sprinkled</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand it is <b>disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But that which Rava says</b> with regard to the superfluous terms in the passage discussing a leper: One derives a verbal analogy between the word <b>“hand”</b> written in that passage and the word <b>“hand”</b> written <b>with regard to the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, to indicate that the latter must also be performed with the right hand, <b>why do I</b> need this verbal analogy? One can <b>derive</b> that the handful must be removed with the right hand <b>from</b> the verse’s mention of the <b>priesthood,</b> as it is stated: “And the priest shall remove his handful” (Leviticus 5:12).
The Gemara responds: Both derivations are necessary, <b>one for</b> the removal of the <b>handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>and one for the sanctification of</b> the <b>handful,</b> i.e., placing it into a second service vessel. Both must be performed with the right hand.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, who does not require sanctification of</b> the <b>handful, or according to the one who says that Rabbi Shimon also requires the sanctification of</b> the <b>handful but</b> that <b>he deems</b> the sanctification <b>fit</b> when performed <b>with</b> the <b>left</b> hand (see 26a), <b>why do I</b> need the verbal analogy <b>of Rava</b> between <b>“hand”</b> and <b>“hand”?</b>
<b>If</b> one suggests that it is necessary <b>to</b> indicate that the <b>removal of the handful itself</b> must be performed with the right hand, this cannot be, since this is <b>derived from</b> the verse cited by <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya. As Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> does not require that the handful be sanctified in a service vessel? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering: <b>“It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10).
Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, elaborates: The verse compares the meal offering to a sin offering and a guilt offering. Therefore, if the priest <b>comes to perform</b> the burning of the handful <b>with</b> his <b>hand, he performs it with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>like</b> in the case of <b>a sin offering,</b> whose blood is sprinkled with the hand. And if he <b>comes to perform it with a vessel,</b> i.e., if he first sanctifies the handful in a service vessel, then <b>he</b> may <b>perform it with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>like</b> in the case of <b>a guilt offering,</b> whose blood is sprinkled from a vessel. Since the removal of the handful is performed with the hand, the verse indicates that it must be performed with the right hand, and the verbal analogy is unnecessary.
The Gemara responds: The verbal analogy <b>is necessary only for the handful of the meal offering of a sinner,</b> to teach that it must be removed with the right hand. It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Shimon says</b> that this offering does not require oil and frankincense <b>so that</b> a sinner’s <b>offering will not be of superior quality,</b> perhaps <b>when</b> the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, which is a manner of inferior quality, <b>it should be fit as well.</b> The verbal analogy therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the handful must always be removed with the right hand, even in the case of the meal offering of a sinner.
§ The mishna teaches: If a priest <b>removed the handful</b> of flour, <b>and a stone or a grain of salt emerged in his hand,</b>

Daf 11a

<b>or a pinch of frankincense</b> emerged in his hand, the meal offering is <b>unfit,</b> as the handful lacks a full measure on account of these items. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> examples? Any one of them would convey the fact that the handful must contain a full measure.
The Gemara explains: All of the cases are <b>necessary. Because if</b> the mishna had <b>taught</b> only the example of <b>a stone,</b> it might have been thought that only a stone diminishes the measure of the handful, <b>because it is not fit for sacrifice. But</b> with regard to <b>salt, which is fit for sacrifice,</b> as the priest places salt on the handful before burning it upon the altar, one might <b>say</b> that the handful <b>should be fit,</b> as the salt should not subtract from the handful’s measure.
<b>And if</b> the mishna had <b>taught</b> only the example of <b>salt,</b> it might have been thought that the salt diminishes the handful’s measure <b>as it was not initially fixed</b> together <b>with</b> the entire <b>meal offering.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> the priest <b>salts the handful alone. But</b> with regard to the <b>frankincense, which was initially fixed</b> together <b>with</b> the entire <b>meal offering,</b> i.e., it is placed upon the meal offering before the priest removes a handful from it, one might <b>say</b> that the handful <b>should be fit</b> and the frankincense should not diminish from the handful’s measure. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that in any of these instances the meal offering is unfit.
§ The mishna teaches that if a stone, or a grain of salt, or a pinch of frankincense emerged in the priest’s hand together with the handful, the meal offering is unfit <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said: The handful that is lacking or that is outsized</b> is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> explain that the offering is not valid <b>specifically because</b> it is <b>lacking or outsized? But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive</b> that such a handful is not valid <b>due to</b> the fact that there is <b>an interposition</b> between the priest’s hand and the handful. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> Since there are certain instances where these items do not interpose between one’s hand and the handful, e.g., when they are located <b>on the side</b> of the handful, the mishna teaches that they disqualify the handful due to the fact that they reduce its measure.
§ <b>Abaye said to Rava: How do</b> the priests properly <b>remove the handful</b> from a meal offering? Rava <b>said to him:</b> They remove it <b>as people</b> normally <b>remove handfuls,</b> by folding all of their fingers over the palm of the hand. Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rava from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the mitzva function of each of the fingers: <b>This</b> small finger is for measuring <b>a span</b> (see Exodus 28:16), i.e., the distance between the thumb and the little finger. <b>This</b> fourth finger is used for <b>removal of a handful</b> from the meal offering, i.e., the measurement of a handful begins from this finger, as the priest removes a handful by folding the middle three fingers over his palm.
Furthermore, <b>this</b> middle finger is used for measuring <b>a cubit,</b> the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. <b>This</b> forefinger, next to the thumb, is the <b>finger</b> used to sprinkle the blood of offerings on the altar. And finally, <b>this thumb</b> is the one on which the blood and oil is placed during the purification ritual of a leper (see Leviticus 14:17). Evidently, the little finger is not used in the removal of a handful.
The Gemara responds: The little finger is used <b>only for</b> the purposes of <b>leveling</b> the handful, <b>that is to say,</b> the priest first <b>removes a handful</b> with <b>a full hand,</b> i.e., all of his fingers, <b>so that it should not be lacking</b> in measure, <b>and then he wipes</b> away the protruding flour <b>with</b> his <b>little finger from the bottom,</b> and with his thumb from the top.
The Gemara asks: <b>How</b> is the removal of the handful <b>performed? Rav Zutra bar Toviyya says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When the priest places his hand in the meal offering, <b>he bends his</b> middle <b>three fingers until</b> the tips of his fingers <b>reach over the palm of his hand, and</b> he then <b>removes the handful.</b>
The Gemara notes <b>that</b> this <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. From the verse that states: “And he shall remove from there <b>his handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), one <b>might</b> have thought that the handful should be <b>overflowing.</b> Therefore, another <b>verse states:</b> “And he shall take up from it <b>with his handful [<i>bekumtzo</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). The prefix that means “with” can also mean: In, indicating that the proper measure of a handful is that which is contained within one’s fingers alone.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> the measurement of a handful is determined by the term <b>“with his handful,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the priest removes a handful <b>with his fingertips,</b> i.e., that a handful consists of that which the priest removes by folding his fingers onto themselves. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His handful,”</b> indicating that the handful must be full and not merely that which is contained within his fingers. <b>How so? He scoops</b> by closing <b>his three fingers over the palm of his hand, and</b> in this way <b>takes a handful</b> from the flour of the meal offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>and</b> that <b>of a deep-pan</b> meal offering, when the flour was fried before being scooped and was therefore hard, the priest <b>wipes</b> away <b>with his thumb</b> any flour that was overflowing <b>above</b> his handful, <b>and with his little finger</b> he wipes away the flour that was pushing out <b>below. And this</b> precise taking of the handful of a meal offering <b>is</b> the most <b>difficult</b> sacrificial <b>rite in the Temple,</b> as the priest must wipe away any protruding elements without removing any flour from the handful itself.
The Gemara asks: <b>This one</b> is the hardest sacrificial rite, <b>and no other? But isn’t there pinching</b> the nape of the neck of a bird offering, which is also considered extremely difficult to perform, <b>and isn’t there</b> the <b>scooping</b> of the handful of incense by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, another rite that is extremely difficult to perform? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>this</b> taking of the handful of a meal offering <b>is one of</b> the most <b>difficult</b> sacrificial <b>rites in the Temple.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that the term <b>“his handful”</b> means that the removal of the handful from a meal offering should be performed <i>ab initio</i> <b>in the manner that people</b> usually <b>remove a handful,</b> with their fingertips angled to the side. <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if the priest <b>removed a handful with his fingertips,</b> i.e., if he placed his hand horizontally over the meal offering and filled his palm with flour by closing his fingers to his palm? Does this disqualify the taking of the handful or not?
Similarly, if the priest took a handful <b>from the sides,</b> by passing the back of his hand back and forth over the flour in the vessel so that the flour collected in his palm by way of the side of his palm, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Furthermore, if he took the handful with the back of his hand placed <b>downward</b> in the vessel, and with his fingers he collected the flour <b>upward</b> into his palm, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Are the handfuls removed in this manner fit for sacrifice? The Gemara states: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b>unresolved.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that when the Torah states: <b>“His handful”</b> (Leviticus 16:12), in the context of the scooping of handfuls of incense by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, it means <b>in the manner that people</b> usually <b>scoop a handful,</b> by placing the backs of their hands into the vessel and bringing their hands together. <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the High Priest <b>scooped a handful with his fingertips? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if he took a handful <b>from the sides? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he scooped a handful with this</b> hand <b>and with that</b> hand separately <b>and</b> then <b>brought them together?</b> The Gemara states: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Pappa raises</b> yet another <b>dilemma:</b> If the priest took the handful from the vessel containing the meal offering and <b>stuck the handful onto the side of</b> the second <b>vessel</b> in order to sanctify it, i.e., the handful was not placed directly into the vessel, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we require</b> that the handful be <b>inside</b> the <b>vessel, and</b> that <b>is</b> the case here? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> that the handful be <b>placed</b> properly <b>inside</b> the vessel, <b>and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case in this instance. No answer is found, and the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi raises</b> a similar <b>dilemma:</b> If the priest <b>overturned the vessel and stuck</b> the <b>handful to the underside of the vessel,</b> in a case where there was an indentation on the underside, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we require</b> that the handful be <b>placed inside</b> the vessel, <b>and that</b> requirement <b>is</b> fulfilled here, as the handful is within the indentation? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> that it be placed <b>properly</b> in the vessel, <b>and that is not</b> the case here. The Gemara states: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the removal of a handful? <b>He extends his fingers onto the palm of his hand.</b> If <b>one increased its oil, decreased its oil,</b> or <b>decreased its frankincense,</b> beyond the appropriate measures, the meal offering is <b>unfit.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What are the circumstances</b> of a case where the meal offering is disqualified due to the fact that one <b>increased its oil? Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The circumstances are a case <b>where he separated two <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for</b> the meal offering instead of one <i>log</i>, and mixed them into a tenth of an ephah of flour. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>interpret</b> the mishna as referring to a case <b>where he mixed non-sacred oil or the oil of another</b> meal offering <b>into</b> the meal offering.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>non-sacred oil and the oil of another</b> meal offering <b>do not disqualify</b> a meal offering, <b>Rav Zutra bar Toviyya objects to this</b> claim: <b>If that is so,</b> then with regard to the <b>meal offering of a sinner,</b> of which it is stated (59b) <b>that oil disqualifies it, how can you find</b> the circumstances where it is in fact disqualified?
Rav Zutra bar Toviyya elaborates: <b>If</b> you suggest that he mixed <b>its own</b> oil into the flour, such a case does not exist, as the meal offering of a sinner <b>does not have</b> any oil. <b>If</b> he mixed <b>non-sacred</b> oil <b>or</b> that <b>of another</b> meal offering into the flour, the meal offering should not be disqualified, as <b>you said</b> that such oil <b>does not disqualify</b> a meal offering. <b>And if you would say that he designated oil for</b> his meal offering and mixed it into the flour despite the Torah prohibition against mixing oil into it, I say that <b>since</b> the meal offering of a sinner <b>does not have oil at all,</b> any oil that he separates and mixes into it <b>is</b> considered <b>non-sacred,</b> and you have already said that non-sacred oil does not disqualify a meal offering.
The Gemara responds: In fact, non-sacred oil and the oil of another meal offering do disqualify a meal offering, <b>and Rabbi Eliezer is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to say <b>that non-sacred</b> oil <b>and</b> the oil <b>of another</b> meal offering <b>disqualify</b> a meal offering. <b>But</b> in a case where one <b>separated two <i>log</i> for</b> his meal offering, <b>since this</b> first <i>log</i> <b>is fit for</b> the meal offering, <b>and that</b> second <i>log</i> <b>is</b> also <b>fit for it,</b> one might <b>say</b> that even when he mixes both <i>log</i> into the meal offering, <b>it should not disqualify</b> the meal offering. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer <b>teaches us</b> that the meal offering is disqualified in this case as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Eliezer</b> derive <b>this</b> conclusion? <b>Rava said:</b> The terminology of <b>the mishna posed a difficulty for him,</b> as one can ask: <b>Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> that the meal offering is disqualified if <b>he increased its oil,</b> which indicates that he increased it with oil belonging to the offering itself? <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> simply: <b>He increased the oil. Rather, this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: That even though he</b> initially <b>separated two <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for</b> the meal offering, its own oil disqualifies the offering when there is too much.
§ The mishna teaches that if one <b>decreased its frankincense</b> beyond its appropriate measure, the meal offering is unfit. Concerning this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>decreased</b> its frankincense to the point that the amount <b>stood at</b> only <b>one pinch,</b> it is <b>disqualified,</b> but if the decreased amount stood <b>at two pinches,</b> it is <b>fit;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the decreased amount stood <b>at one pinch,</b> it is <b>fit; less than that,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b>

Daf 11b

The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A handful</b> of flour <b>or frankincense that</b> was <b>decreased</b> by <b>any amount</b> from its full measure is <b>disqualified?</b> The Gemara answers that one should <b>teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>A pinch of frankincense that</b> was <b>decreased</b> by <b>any amount</b> is <b>disqualified. And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>here,</b> the first cited statement of Rabbi Shimon, is referring to the case <b>of frankincense that comes with a meal offering,</b> and this frankincense is disqualified only when there is less than a pinch, whereas <b>there,</b> the second statement of Rabbi Shimon, is referring to the case <b>of frankincense that comes by itself.</b> Such frankincense is disqualified if it comprises any less than its full measure.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There are <b>three disputes</b> of <i>tanna’im</i> <b>with regard to the matter. Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the priest must remove <b>a handful at the beginning, and ultimately</b> the entire <b>handful</b> must be burned upon the altar. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the priest must remove <b>a handful at the beginning, and ultimately</b> at least <b>two pinches</b> from it must be burned upon the altar. <b>And Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the priest must remove <b>a handful at the beginning and ultimately</b> at least <b>one pinch</b> from it must be burned upon the altar.
<b>And</b> all <b>three of them interpret a single verse</b> differently. The verse states: “And he shall take up from there his handful, of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of the oil of it, <b>and [<i>ve’et</i>] all the frankincense that is upon the meal offering,</b> and shall make it smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:8). <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that one may not make the offering smoke upon the altar <b>unless there</b> remains <b>the</b> entire measure of <b>frankincense that was initially fixed together with the meal offering. And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that when the verse states: <b>“All [<i>kol</i>],”</b> it is referring to any part of the frankincense, <b>even a single pinch,</b> as <i>kol</i> can mean any amount (see II Kings 2:4). And when the verse states: <b>“<i>Et</i>,”</b> this serves <b>to includ-e another pinch.</b> Accordingly, at least two pinches must remain to be burned upon the altar. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> interprets the word “all” in the same manner as does Rabbi Yehuda, but he <b>does not interpret</b> and derive a <i>halakha</i> from the term <b>“<i>et</i>,”</b> and he therefore holds that only one pinch must remain to be burned.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef</b> further <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between these <i>tanna’im</i> is <b>with regard to frankincense that comes with a meal offering. But with regard to frankincense that comes by itself, everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, <b>agrees</b> that the priest must bring <b>a handful at the beginning, and ultimately</b> the entire <b>handful</b> must be burned upon the altar. <b>For this</b> reason it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“That is upon the meal offering,”</b> as this indicates <b>that together with a meal offering, yes,</b> one may burn the frankincense even if there remains only a pinch or two, but with regard to frankincense that comes <b>by itself,</b> one may <b>not</b> burn it if it is in that state.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between these <i>tanna’im</i> is <b>with regard to frankincense that comes with a meal offering. But with regard to frankincense that comes in bowls</b> together with the shewbread, <b>everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, <b>agrees</b> that there must be <b>two handfuls in the beginning,</b> one handful for each bowl, <b>and ultimately</b> there must also be <b>two handfuls.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the case, as with regard to this <i>halakha</i> the verse does not state the term: All, from which one might derive that it is referring to any part of the frankincense? The Gemara explains: This ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since</b> the frankincense in the bowls <b>comes together with bread,</b> i.e., the shewbread, it should be <b>considered as:</b> “Frankincense <b>that is upon the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), and therefore Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon claim that one may sacrifice it even if less than two handfuls remain. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
The Gemara notes: <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa disagree with regard to</b> the case of frankincense that comes by itself. <b>One says</b> that the <b>dispute</b> between the <i>tanna’im</i> with regard to whether or not a handful of frankincense that became lacking may be sacrificed upon the altar applies only <b>with regard to frankincense that comes with a meal offering, but with regard to frankincense that comes by itself, everyone agrees</b> that the priest must remove <b>a handful at the beginning and ultimately</b> the entire <b>handful</b> must be burned upon the altar. <b>And one says: Just as</b> there is <b>a dispute in this</b> case, <b>so too,</b> there is <b>a dispute in that</b> case.
§ The mishna teaches that if the priest <b>decreased its frankincense</b> beyond its appropriate measure, the meal offering is unfit. The Gemara infers from this statement that if <b>he increased</b> its frankincense, it is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if he <b>increased</b> its frankincense the meal offering is <b>disqualified? Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> rules that the meal offering is disqualified in a case <b>where he separated two handfuls</b> of frankincense <b>for</b> the meal offering and placed both of them onto the meal offering.
<b>And Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> In a case where <b>one separated two handfuls</b> of frankincense <b>for</b> the meal offering <b>and</b> subsequently <b>lost one of them,</b> if it was lost <b>before the removal of the handful</b> of the meal offering, the additional frankincense <b>was not fixed</b> with the meal offering, and therefore it does not disqualify the meal offering. But if this occurred <b>after the removal of the handful</b> of the meal offering, since both handfuls <b>were</b> already <b>fixed</b> with the meal offering, it is disqualified, as he increased its frankincense by a large amount.
<b>And Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> In a case where <b>one separated four handfuls</b> of frankincense <b>for</b> placement in the <b>two bowls</b> that accompany the shewbread, <b>and two of them</b> were subsequently <b>lost,</b> the <i>halakha</i> depends on when they were lost. If they were lost <b>before the removal of</b> the <b>bowls</b> from the Table of the shewbread, then the additional frankincense <b>was not</b> yet <b>fixed</b> with the shewbread, and the frankincense remains fit for sacrifice. But if they were lost <b>after the removal of</b> the <b>bowls,</b> then all four handfuls <b>were</b> already <b>fixed</b> with the shewbread, and therefore the frankincense is disqualified.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this? This</b> statement of Rami bar Ḥama is identical to <b>that</b> previous statement, as the burning of the frankincense permits the shewbread for consumption just as the frankincense permits the meal offering for consumption. Consequently, the removal of the bowls of frankincense is comparable to the removal of the handful from a meal offering.
The Gemara explains: The last statement of Rami bar Ḥama is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since</b> the <b>handful of</b> frankincense of the shewbread <b>is</b> already considered <b>designated</b> for burning, as it is placed in a separate bowl and burned in its entirety, then <b>once the time arrives for removing</b> the bowls from upon the Table of the shewbread, <b>it is considered as though</b> the bowls were already <b>removed,</b> and the shewbread should therefore be disqualified on account of the additional frankincense. Therefore, Rami bar Ḥama <b>teaches us</b> that the additional handfuls disqualify the shewbread only if they were inside the bowls at the time of their actual removal from the Table.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake</b> of <b>its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>to burn its handful outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or</b> to burn <b>an olive-bulk</b> of <b>its handful outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>or to burn its frankincense outside</b> the Temple courtyard, in all these cases the offering is <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i></b> for one who partakes of <b>it.</b> If one had the intent <b>to partake</b> of <b>its remainder on the next day or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its remainder on the next day, to burn its handful on the next day or</b> to burn <b>an olive-bulk of its handful on the next day, or to burn</b> its <b>frankincense on the next day,</b>

Daf 12a

the offering is <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of the remainder of that meal offering.
<b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, or <b>who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, e.g., the remainder, <b>or to burn an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>burns</b> it on the altar, e.g., the handful or the frankincense, <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b> If his intent was to do so <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on account of it, provided that the permitting</b> factor, i.e., the handful, <b>was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b> If the permitting factor was not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva, although the meal offering is unfit, the prohibition of <i>piggul</i> does not apply to it.
<b>How</b> is <b>the permitting factor</b> considered to have been <b>sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva?</b> If one <b>removed the handful in silence,</b> i.e., with no specific intent, and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the or burn the handful or frankincense <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, and conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar <b>in silence,</b> with no specific intent; <b>or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva,</b> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of it due to <i>piggul</i>.
<b>How</b> is <b>the permitting factor not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva?</b> If one <b>removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful or frankincense <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> or <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful or frankincense <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area; or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, and conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor was not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b>
<b>The meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>that one removed their handful not for their sake</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or that one removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time</b> or <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, <b>not for their sake; or that one removed the handful, and placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, and conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, <b>not for their sake, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor was not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b>
If one performed one of these rites with the intent <b>to partake of an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area and <b>an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>an olive-bulk the next day</b> and <b>an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, or <b>half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area and <b>half an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>half an olive-bulk the next day</b> and <b>half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>this is the principle: If the intent</b> with regard to <b>the time preceded the intent</b> with regard to <b>the area,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on account of it. If the intent</b> with regard to <b>the area preceded the intent</b> with regard to <b>the time,</b> the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> In both <b>this</b> case, where the intent with regard to time was first, <b>and that</b> case, where the intent with regard to area came first, the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to the statement of the one who says</b> that if the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering became <b>lacking between the removal of the handful and the burning</b> of the handful on the altar the priest nevertheless <b>burns the handful on</b> account of such a meal offering, <b>and</b> as <b>we maintain that</b> despite the fact that the handful is burned on account of it <b>that remainder is prohibited for consumption, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>piggul</i>? <b>Should</b> the <b>burning</b> of the handful <b>be effective in establishing</b> such a remainder <b>as <i>piggul</i></b> when the handful was burned with the intent to partake of the remainder the next day?
<b>And</b> similarly, is the burning of the handful effective <b>in removing</b> such a remainder <b>from</b> being subject to <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, just as a complete remainder is removed being subject to this prohibition after the burning of the handful, when it becomes permitted to the priests for consumption?
<b>Rav Huna said: Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of an offering, which renders its meat permitted for consumption and removes it from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, <b>is effective in</b> removing the meat of an offering that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard from being subject to misuse of consecrated property despite the fact that such meat is prohibited for consumption, <b>that statement</b> applies only when the meat was disqualified by means of <b>leaving.</b>
Rav Huna explains: The reason is <b>that</b> the meat remains <b>as is, and</b> the <b>disqualification</b> of the meat by means of leaving is <b>on account of something else,</b> i.e., a factor external to the meat itself. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a lack</b> in the measure of the remainder of a meal offering, <b>which is a disqualification</b> on account <b>of itself,</b> the <b>burning</b> of the handful <b>is not effective in</b> removing the remainder from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, nor to establish it as <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>On the contrary; even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>sprinkling is not effective in</b> removing the meat that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, <b>that statement</b> applies only when the meat was disqualified by means of <b>leaving, as</b> the meat <b>is not inside</b> the Temple courtyard where the sprinkling could be effective for it. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a lack</b> in the measure of the remainder of a meal offering <b>that is inside</b> the Temple courtyard, the <b>burning</b> of the handful <b>is effective</b> in removing the remainder from being subject to misuse of consecrated property as well as in establishing it as <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that even remainders that lack a full measure can be rendered <i>piggul</i>? This can be inferred from that <b>which we learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake</b> of <b>its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard, the meal offering is unfit but there is no liability for <i>karet</i>, and if he removes a handful from the meal offering with the intent to partake of its remainder beyond the designated time or to partake of an olive-bulk of its remainder beyond the designated time the offering is <i>piggul</i> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of the remainder of that meal offering. <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> in his version of the mishna: <b>One who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent to partake of its remainder, <b>and he does not teach: Or an olive-bulk</b> of its remainder.
Rava continues: <b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Ḥiyya diverged from the standard text of the mishna and <b>did not teach: Or an olive-bulk?</b> Is it <b>not</b> because his mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the <b>remainder</b> later <b>became lacking and</b> its measure <b>stood at an olive-bulk? And</b> therefore Rabbi Ḥiyya did not include the clause: Or an olive-bulk, <b>since</b> later in the mishna, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>placement</b> of the handful <b>in a vessel,</b> and <b>with regard to</b> the <b>conveyance</b> of the vessel to the altar, <b>and with regard to</b> the <b>burning</b> of the handful, <b>he</b> could <b>not teach</b> the phrase:

Daf 12b

<b>Or an olive-bulk, in</b> the case of one’s intent with regard to the consumption of the <b>remainder,</b> because the remainder is already the size of an olive-bulk. Therefore, <b>in</b> the case of the <b>removal of the handful as well,</b> i.e., when he teaches: One who removes a handful <b>to partake</b> of <b>its remainder,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>did not teach: Or</b> to consume <b>an olive-bulk</b> of its remainder, despite the fact that he could have done so in that clause. Rava concludes his proof: <b>And</b> yet <b>the latter clause teaches</b> that if one burned the handful with the intent to consume the remainder after its designated time, the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on</b> account of <b>it. Evidently, burning is effective in</b> rendering a lacking remainder as <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>No,</b> one cannot prove from here that the mishna is discussing the case of a remainder that became lacking. The reason for this is: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna of Rabbi Ḥiyya? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 109b): With regard to <b>the handful</b> of flour, <b>and the frankincense, and the incense, and the meal offering of priests</b> (see Leviticus 6:16), <b>and the meal offering of the anointed priest</b> (see Leviticus 6:12–15), <b>and the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations</b> brought with animal offerings (see Numbers 15:1–16), <b>where one sacrificed an olive-bulk from one of them outside</b> the Temple courtyard, he is <b>liable</b> for sacrificing outside the courtyard. <b>And Rabbi Elazar exempts</b> one from liability <b>until he sacrifices</b> them in their <b>entirety</b> rather than just an olive-bulk from them.
Abaye concludes: <b>Since with regard to the burning of the handful he</b> could <b>not teach: Or</b> burn <b>an olive-bulk of its handful outside</b> the Temple, as according to Rabbi Elazar one is not liable for burning anything less than the full handful and therefore intent to burn only an olive-bulk does not render the offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>remainder as well, he did not teach: Or an olive-bulk.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna of Rabbi Ḥiyya is really in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> then <b>this</b> statement: <b>To burn its handful</b> outside the Temple courtyard, <b>should have</b> been phrased: <b>To burn its handful and its frankincense</b> outside the Temple courtyard, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 110a): With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> in a case <b>where one sacrificed</b> only <b>one of them outside</b> the Temple courtyard, he is <b>liable. Rabbi Eliezer exempts</b> from liability one who burns only one of them <b>until he sacrifices both of them</b> together.
The Gemara responds: The mishna of Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>is necessary only for the handful of the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which has no frankincense. Since only the burning of the handful permits the remainder of the sinner’s meal offering for consumption, one’s intent to burn it the next day renders the offering <i>piggul</i>. With regard to this meal offering, one is not liable for burning anything less than the full handful, according to Rabbi Elazar, and therefore it does not teach: Or an olive-bulk.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did the <i>tanna</i> go to all that trouble [<i>ve’ikhpal</i>]</b> just <b>to teach us</b> a <i>halakha</i> that is applicable only in the case of <b>the handful of the meal offering of a sinner?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> he did. <b>And similarly, when Rav Dimi came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> ben Pedat <b>said:</b> When the mishna discusses an instance where one has intent to sacrifice the handful of a meal offering outside, <b>it is</b> referring to the <b>handful of the meal offering of a sinner, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>
<b>Rava then said: That</b> which <b>I said,</b> that the burning of the handful with the intent to consume the remainder the next day is effective in rendering even a remainder that became lacking in measure as <i>piggul</i> and to remove it from being subject to misuse of consecrated property <b>is nothing, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the shewbread: <b>“It is most holy”</b> (Leviticus 24:9). The restrictive term “it” teaches that the shewbread must remain whole, so <b>that if one of</b> the loaves of the shewbread <b>broke</b> and consequently became lacking in measure, then <b>all of its loaves are disqualified,</b> and the burning of the bowls of frankincense do not render them permitted for consumption.
Rava continues: It can be inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that if the loaves remained whole <b>but</b> one of them <b>left</b> the Temple, <b>those that are inside</b> the Temple are still <b>fit.</b> And <b>whom have you heard who says:</b> The <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>is effective in</b> rendering <i>piggul</i> an item that <b>left</b> the Temple? <b>It is Rabbi Akiva. And</b> yet <b>he says</b> in this <i>baraita</i> that if one of the loaves <b>broke,</b> the burning of the frankincense is <b>not</b> effective for them. Similarly, with regard to the remainder of a meal offering that became lacking in measure, even Rabbi Akiva agrees that the burning of the handful is ineffective in rendering it <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: How can you cite a proof from this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Is</b> it <b>taught</b> in this <i>baraita</i>: But if a loaf of shewbread <b>left,</b> those loaves that remain inside are fit? <b>Perhaps</b> all of the loaves are disqualified if even one of them left, and one should infer a different <i>halakha</i> from the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>if</b> one of the loaves <b>became ritually impure, these</b> that remain pure <b>are fit.</b>
Abaye explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for such a distinction? The reason is <b>that the frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>effects acceptance</b> for ritually impure offerings. <b>But</b> in a case where a loaf of shewbread <b>left,</b> the frontplate does <b>not</b> effect acceptance, and therefore all of the loaves are disqualified, as in a case where one loaf breaks. <b>And</b> if so, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>sprinkling is not effective</b> with regard <b>to</b> an item <b>that left</b> the Temple courtyard.
Abaye continues: <b>And by right</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have also taught</b> that if one of the loaves of shewbread <b>left,</b> all the loaves are disqualified. <b>And</b> as for the fact <b>that it teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to a loaf that <b>broke, this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us: That even</b> if the loaf <b>broke,</b> in <b>which</b> case the loaf <b>is</b> still <b>inside</b> the Temple, <b>burning is not effective</b> with regard <b>to it. But according to Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>sprinkling is effective</b> with regard <b>to</b> an item that <b>left</b> the Temple, <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a lacking</b> measure, <b>burning is effective</b> with regard <b>to it.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one’s intent was <b>to partake of half an olive-bulk</b> of the remainder <b>and to burn half an olive-bulk</b> of it not at the appropriate time or not in the appropriate area, the offering is <b>fit, because eating and burning do not join together.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna: <b>The reason that</b> the two halves of an olive-bulk do not join together is because his intent was <b>to partake of</b> half an olive-bulk <b>and to burn</b> half an olive-bulk, which indicates that if his intent was <b>to partake</b> of half an olive-bulk of the remainder <b>and to partake of</b> half an olive-bulk of <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>not consume</b> it, i.e., the handful, then the halves do <b>join together</b> to the amount of an olive-bulk and disqualify the offering.
The Gemara notes an apparent contradiction: <b>But the first clause teaches,</b> in the earlier mishna: If one’s intent was <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, <b>or to burn an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>burns</b> it on the altar, beyond its designated time, the offering is <i>piggul</i>. One can infer from this mishna that if his intent was to partake of <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, <b>yes,</b> such intent disqualifies an offering. But if his intent was to partake of an item <b>whose</b> typical <b>manner is</b> such that one does <b>not partake</b> of it, this intent does <b>not</b> disqualify the offering, and likewise such intent does not join together with another to this end. If so, <b>who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the latter clause?
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>one can</b> have improper <b>intent from the consumption</b> performed by <b>a person to</b> the consumption performed by <b>the altar, and from the consumption</b> performed by the <b>altar to</b> the consumption performed by <b>a person.</b> In other words, if one’s intent was to burn the remainder the next day or to consume the handful the next day, such intent disqualifies an offering even though the remainder is intended for consumption by the priests and the handful is intended for burning upon the altar.
The Gemara cites the relevant ruling of Rabbi Eliezer. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (17a): In the case of <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to consume</b> after its designated time <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner is</b> such that one does <b>not consume</b> it, i.e., the handful, <b>or to burn</b> beyond its designated time <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner is</b> such that one does <b>not burn</b> it on the altar, i.e., the remainder of the meal offering, the meal offering is <b>fit. And Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>unfit,</b> although it is not <i>piggul</i> and consuming it is not punishable by <i>karet</i>.
<b>Abaye said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna here is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> And <b>do not say that</b> one should infer from the mishna that if his intent was <b>to partake</b> of half an olive-bulk of an item whose typical manner is such that one consumes it <b>and to partake of</b> half an olive-bulk of <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner is</b> such that one does <b>not partake</b> of it, the offering is disqualified. <b>Rather, say</b> that if his intent was <b>to partake</b> of half an olive-bulk on the next day <b>and to partake</b> of half an olive-bulk outside the Temple, and each of these halves is from <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, then the halves are joined together and disqualify the offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is</b> this <b>teaching us?</b> The previous mishna already <b>teaches</b> that principle <b>explicitly:</b> If one performed one of these rites with the intent <b>to partake of an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area <b>and an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>an olive-bulk the next day and an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, or <b>half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area <b>and half an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>half an olive-bulk the next day and half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

Daf 13a

According to Abaye, <b>why do I also</b> need <b>this</b> mishna here? <b>If</b> you will suggest that this mishna is necessary, as one can infer from it that if one intended <b>to partake</b> of half an olive-bulk the next day <b>and</b> then intended <b>to partake of</b> another half an olive-bulk the next day, both from <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> they <b>join together</b> in order to render the offering <i>piggul</i>, this suggestion can be rejected: But <b>you</b> already <b>learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case <b>from the first clause of the latter clause</b> of the previous mishna, <b>as it teaches: Half an olive-bulk outside and half an olive-bulk the next day,</b> the offering is <b>unfit.</b> One can infer from this <b>that</b> if his intent was to consume <b>half an olive-bulk the next day and half an olive-bulk the next day,</b> it is <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>
<b>If</b> you suggest that the mishna is necessary for a case where one intended <b>to consume and to burn,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches us the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> that intent to consume does not join together with intent to burn, this too cannot be. The reason is that <b>from the inference of the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>you</b> can already <b>learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case, as it teaches: If one intended to partake of an item whose typical manner is such that one partakes of it, the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i>. This indicates that if his intent was to consume an item whose typical manner is such that one does not consume it, the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara explains how the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> intent to consume and burn do not combine can be inferred from the mishna: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>if</b> when one intended <b>to partake</b> of an item whose typical manner is such that one partakes of it <b>and to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner is</b> such that one does <b>not partake of</b> it, <b>you say</b> that his intentions <b>do not join together,</b> despite the fact that both of his intentions referred to consumption, <b>is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that intentions <b>to consume and to burn</b> do not join together?
The Gemara responds: <b>Yes;</b> although the mishna teaches the <i>halakha</i> of a case where one intended to consume an item typically consumed and to consume an item typically not consumed, <b>it was necessary for</b> the mishna to teach the <i>halakha</i> of a case where one intended <b>to eat and to burn.</b> As it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>there,</b> where one’s intentions referred solely to consumption, the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> that his intentions do not join together, <b>as he intended</b> to act <b>not in accordance with its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> since he intended to consume that which is not meant to be consumed.
The Gemara continues: <b>But here,</b> where his intent was to consume half an olive-bulk and to burn half an olive-bulk, <b>where with regard to this</b> half <b>he intends</b> in <b>accordance with its</b> typical <b>manner, and with regard to this</b> half <b>he intends in accordance with its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>they should join together,</b> despite the fact that each intention concerns only half an olive-bulk. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that such intentions do not join together, and the mishna can be explained even in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a priest <b>who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake of its remainder or to burn its handful</b> on <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei concedes in this</b> instance <b>that it is</b> a case of <b><i>piggul</i> and he is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>it.</b> But if the priest’s intent was <b>to burn its frankincense the next day, Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The meal offering is <b>unfit but</b> partaking of it <b>does not include</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is a case of <b><i>piggul</i> and he is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of the meal offering.
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: In <b>what</b> manner does <b>this differ from</b> an animal <b>offering,</b> where if one slaughtered it with the intent to sacrifice the portions consumed on the altar the next day, it is <i>piggul</i>? Rabbi Yosei <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: There is a difference, <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> case of an animal <b>offering, its blood, and its flesh, and its portions</b> consumed on the altar are all <b>one</b> entity. Consequently, intent with regard to any one of them renders the entire offering <i>piggul</i>. <b>But</b> the <b>frankincense is not</b> part <b>of the meal offering.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the terminology of the mishna: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>tanna</i> <b>to teach</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes in this</b> instance? Let the <i>tanna</i> simply state: If one removes the handful from a meal offering with the intent to partake of its remainder or to burn the handful on the next day, Rabbi Yosei says that the offering is <i>piggul</i> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of the remainder.
The Gemara responds: It was necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that Rabbi Yosei concedes, <b>because he wants to teach the latter clause</b> of the mishna, that if his intent was <b>to burn its frankincense the next day, Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the meal offering is <b>unfit, but</b> partaking of it <b>does not include</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: The reason the <i>tanna</i> links the two cases of the mishna is <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the reason that Rabbi Yosei</b> does not render the meal offering <i>piggul</i> is <b>because he holds</b> that one <b>cannot render</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i> with</b> intent that concerns only <b>half of</b> its <b>permitting factors. And</b> consequently, since the burning of the handful and the frankincense render the remainder of a meal offering permitted for consumption, then <b>even</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, where one intends to burn the handful the next day, Rabbi Yosei should hold that the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>, as the intent does not refer to the frankincense as well.

Daf 13b

Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that in this</b> case Rabbi Yosei <b>concedes</b> that if the handful is removed with the intent to burn only the handful on the next day, the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i>. Accordingly, Rabbi Yosei holds that one renders an offering <i>piggul</i> with intent that concerns only half of its permitting factors, and the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i> in the case of the latter clause for a different reason, as the Gemara will discuss later.
§ The mishna teaches that if one removed the handful from a meal offering with the intent <b>to burn its frankincense</b> on <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the meal offering is <b>unfit but</b> partaking of it <b>does not include</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Concerning this, <b>Reish Lakish says: Rabbi Yosei would say,</b> i.e., this is Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning: <b>A permitting factor does not render</b> another <b>permitting factor <i>piggul</i>.</b> In other words, if, while performing the rites of a permitting factor, one had intent to perform the rites of a different permitting factor outside its designated time, the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i> on account of this intent.
Reish Lakish adds: <b>And you</b> would <b>say the same with regard to</b> the <b>two bowls of frankincense of the shewbread, that a permitting factor does not render</b> another <b>permitting factor <i>piggul</i>,</b> and therefore if the priest burned one of the bowls with the intent to burn the other bowl the next day, the shewbread is not rendered <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of the apparently superfluous statement: <b>And you</b> would <b>say the same</b> with regard to the two bowls of frankincense? Is there reason to assume that Rabbi Yosei would hold that the shewbread is rendered <i>piggul</i> in such a case? The Gemara responds that it is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the reason that Rabbi Yosei</b> holds that there is no <i>piggul</i> <b>in</b> the case of the <b>frankincense</b> is <b>because it is not</b> of the same <b>type as a meal offering. But with regard to</b> the <b>two bowls of frankincense, which are of the same type as each other,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>they do render one another <i>piggul</i>.</b> Therefore, Reish Lakish <b>teaches us</b> that in both instances one permitting factor does not render another permitting factor <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And can you say</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei in</b> the case of the <b>frankincense</b> in the mishna <b>is not due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the frankincense <b>is not</b> of the same <b>type as a meal offering? But isn’t it taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna that the Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: In <b>what</b> manner does the frankincense <b>differ from</b> an animal <b>offering,</b> where if one slaughtered it with the intent to sacrifice the portions consumed on the altar the next day it is <i>piggul</i>; and Rabbi Yosei <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: There is a difference, as in <b>the</b> case of an animal <b>offering, its blood, and its flesh, and its portions</b> consumed on the altar are all <b>one</b> entity, <b>but</b> the <b>frankincense is not</b> part <b>of the meal offering?</b> The mishna indicates that according to Rabbi Yosei the reason the meal offering is not <i>piggul</i> is because the frankincense is not of the same type as the meal offering.
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Yosei mean when he says that the frankincense <b>is not</b> part <b>of the meal offering?</b> He means that <b>it is not</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>preclusion</b> of the <b>meal offering.</b> The Gemara elaborates: This means <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> that <b>just as</b> the <b>handful precludes</b> the <b>remainder,</b> i.e., <b>that as long as</b> the <b>handful is not burned</b> the <b>remainder may not be consumed, so too</b> the handful <b>precludes the frankincense</b> from being burned upon the altar. <b>Rather, if</b> the priest <b>wants, he burns this first, and if he wants, he burns that first,</b> i.e., he may burn the frankincense before or after the burning of the handful. Accordingly, the frankincense is an independent permitting factor. For this reason, intent with regard to the frankincense that occurred during the removal of the handful does not render a meal offering <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who say that the meal offering is rendered <i>piggul</i> in such a case, what is their opinion? The Gemara responds: They hold that <b>when we say</b> that <b>a permitting factor does not render</b> another <b>permitting factor <i>piggul</i>,</b> this is <b>with regard to</b> the case taught in a mishna (16a) concerning one who <b>slaughtered one of the lambs</b> whose sacrifice permits the consumption of the two loaves meal offering brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, with the intent <b>to partake of the other</b> lamb <b>the next day.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>When you said</b> in the mishna that <b>both</b> permitting factors <b>are fit, this statement</b> applies only <b>where they were not fixed in one vessel. But</b> in a situation <b>where they were fixed in one vessel,</b> as is the case with regard to the handful and the frankincense, they are <b>considered like one</b> unit, and therefore they render one another <i>piggul</i>.
§ With regard to the frankincense, <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The <b>collection</b> of the <b>frankincense</b> from a meal offering, when performed <b>by a non-priest,</b> is <b>not valid</b> and disqualifies the meal offering. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> It is <b>because</b> the rite of <b>conveying has touched it,</b> i.e., the collection of the frankincense is considered part of the rite of the conveying of the frankincense to the altar for the purpose of burning. Even if the non-priest simply collected the frankincense and thereafter transferred it to a priest, Rabbi Yannai <b>holds</b> that <b>conveying</b> even <b>without</b> moving one’s <b>leg is called conveying, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the performance of the rite of <b>conveying by a non-priest</b> is <b>not valid.</b>
<b>Rav Mari said: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna on 12a, which discusses those sacrificial rites of a meal offering during which improper intent renders an offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>as well.</b> The mishna teaches: <b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, or <b>who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of an item whose typical manner is such that one partakes of it, or to burn an item whose typical manner is such that one burns it on the altar, outside its designated area, the meal offering is unfit but there is no liability for <i>karet</i>. If his intent was to perform any of these actions beyond their designated time, the offering is <i>piggul</i> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> on account of it, provided that the permitting factor, i.e., the handful, was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.
Rav Mari analyzes the first part of this mishna: <b>Granted,</b> the <b>removal of the handful</b> from a meal offering <b>is</b> the same as, i.e., equivalent to, the <b>slaughter</b> of animal offerings. The <b>conveying</b> of the handful to the altar in order to burn it <b>is also</b> the same as the <b>conveying</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering to the altar in order to sprinkle it. Similarly, the <b>burning</b> of the handful and frankincense of a meal offering <b>is</b> comparable to the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering upon the altar. <b>But</b> as for <b>placing</b> the handful <b>in the</b> service <b>vessel, what</b> rite <b>is he performing</b> that is comparable to a rite of slaughtered offerings?
<b>If we say</b> that the meal offering is <i>piggul</i> <b>because</b> the placing of the handful into a vessel <b>is comparable to</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering into a service vessel, one can ask: <b>Are</b> these rites in fact <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of animal offerings, the blood enters the vessel <b>by itself,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> the priest <b>takes</b> the handful from the meal offering <b>and casts</b> it into the vessel.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>due to</b> the following reason: <b>Since it is not possible</b> to sacrifice the handful <b>without</b> first <b>performing</b> the act of placing it in a vessel, the placement of the handful in a vessel <b>is</b> considered <b>a significant rite,</b> and <b>perforce</b> this factor causes it to be <b>considered like</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the collection of the frankincense, <b>since it is not possible</b> to sacrifice the frankincense <b>without</b> first <b>performing</b> the act of collecting it from the vessel, the collection of the frankincense <b>is a significant rite</b> that <b>perforce</b> causes it to be <b>considered like</b> the rite of <b>conveying.</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is not the reason, and one cannot prove from the mishna that the collection of the frankincense from a meal offering performed by a non-priest is not valid. <b>Actually,</b> the reason why intent during the placement of the handful renders the offering <i>piggul</i> is in fact <b>because it is comparable to</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering. <b>And as for</b> the <b>difficulty you</b> raised, that <b>there</b> the blood enters the vessel <b>by itself,</b> whereas <b>here he takes</b> the handful from the meal offering <b>and casts</b> it into the vessel, this is not a true difficulty.
The Gemara explains: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>both of them,</b> i.e., the collection of the blood and the placing of the handful, involve the <b>sanctity of a vessel,</b> in which a service vessel sanctifies a permitting factor to the altar, either the handful or the blood. <b>What</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if the permitting factor enters the vessel <b>by itself or</b> whether one <b>takes</b> the item <b>and casts</b> it into the vessel?
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the <b>two lambs</b> that accompany the two meal offering loaves sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i> with the intent <b>to partake of one of the</b> two <b>loaves the next day,</b> or if <b>one burned</b> the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense accompanying the shewbread with the intent <b>to partake of one of the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei says: That loaf and that arrangement of which he intended</b> to partake the next day are <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> their consumption, <b>and the second</b> loaf and arrangement are <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> their consumption. <b>And the Rabbis say: This</b> loaf and arrangement <b>and that</b> loaf and arrangement are both <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> their consumption.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says: Rabbi Yosei would say,</b> in accordance with his opinion that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to one loaf or one arrangement does not render the second loaf or arrangement <i>piggul</i>, that if one <b>had intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to the right thigh,</b> i.e., he slaughtered an offering with the intent to partake of the right thigh the next day, then <b>the left thigh has not become <i>piggul</i></b> and one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for its consumption. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument, and if you wish, cite a verse.</b>
Rav Huna elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Disqualifying <b>intent is no stronger than an incident of ritual impurity,</b> and <b>if one limb</b> of an offering <b>became impure, did the entire</b> offering then <b>become impure?</b> Accordingly, one limb can be rendered <i>piggul</i> without the other. <b>And if you wish, cite a verse</b> that addresses <i>piggul</i>: <b>“And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). The verse indicates that one who eats specifically <b>“of it,”</b> i.e., from one part, shall bear his iniquity, <b>and not</b> one who eats <b>from the other</b> part of the offering.
<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to</b> Rav <b>Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>there is never</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for partaking of the two loaves <b>unless one has intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to an olive-bulk of both of them,</b> i.e., one’s intent renders both loaves <i>piggul</i> only if he slaughters the lambs with the intent to consume an amount equal to an olive-bulk from both loaves combined outside their proper time. One can infer from this that if he had intent <b>with regard to both of them, yes,</b> both loaves are <i>piggul</i>. But if his intent was <b>with regard to</b> only <b>one of them, no,</b> the other loaf is not <i>piggul</i>.
Rav Naḥman continues: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> of the mishna, then <b>even</b> if his intent was <b>with regard to</b> only <b>one of them,</b> both loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i>. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Now, <b>granted, if you say</b> that according to Rabbi Yosei the left and right thighs of an offering are considered <b>one body,</b> and consequently <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to one thigh renders the other thigh <i>piggul</i> as well, then <b>due to that</b> reason it is understandable that if the <i>piggul</i> intent was for an amount equal to one total olive-bulk from both of the loaves, then the intent with regard to each loaf is <b>combined</b> with the other.

Daf 14a

<b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Yosei holds that the right and left thighs of an offering <b>are</b> considered <b>two</b> distinct <b>bodies,</b> and therefore <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to one does not render the other <i>piggul</i>, then in the case of the two loaves, <b>would</b> the intentions concerning both loaves <b>combine</b> to render them both <i>piggul</i>?
Rav Huna responds: One cannot infer anything from this <i>baraita</i> with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> one of <b>the lambs</b> brought as peace offerings on <i>Shavuot</i> with the intent <b>to consume half an olive-bulk from this loaf</b>  the next day, <b>and similarly,</b> he slaughtered <b>the other</b> lamb with the intent <b>to consume half an olive-bulk from that</b> second <b>loaf</b> the next day, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say that this</b> offering is <b>valid,</b> as his intentions do not combine.
Rav Huna continues: It may be inferred that <b>the reason</b> why the priest’s intentions do not combine is <b>that</b> his intent was <b>said</b> with regard to <b>a half</b> and <b>a half,</b> i.e., he slaughtered each lamb with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from one loaf the next day. <b>But</b> if he <b>said</b> during the slaughter of each of the lambs that he is slaughtering it with the intent to consume <b>an olive-bulk from both of them,</b> then the halves <b>combine</b> to render the offering <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who says that the two loaves are <i>piggul</i> only if he has intent with regard to an amount equal to an olive-bulk from both of them combined, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion is his statement? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> of the mishna, who hold that <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to one loaf renders both loaves <i>piggul</i>, then <b>even</b> if his intent was <b>with regard to</b> only <b>one of them,</b> both loaves should be <i>piggul</i>. And <b>if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to one loaf does not render the second loaf <i>piggul</i>, then <b>our difficulty returns to its place:</b> If Rabbi Yosei holds that the right and left thighs are considered two distinct bodies, how can intentions with regard to two halves of an olive-bulk combine to render both loaves <i>piggul</i>?
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis. And do not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states: It is not <i>piggul</i> <b>unless one has</b> the <b>intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to both of them [<i>bishteihen</i>],</b> in the feminine form, whereby the <i>baraita</i> would be referring to the loaves. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>With regard to both of them [<i>bishneihen</i>],</b> in the masculine form, i.e., unless he slaughters both lambs with <i>piggul</i> intent, <b>and</b> in such a case, <b>even</b> if his intent was with regard to only <b>one of the</b> loaves, the offering is <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir, who says</b> in the mishna on 16a: <b>One renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> by means of intent during the sacrifice <b>of half a permitting factor,</b> e.g., if one slaughtered one of the lambs with the intent to consume the two loaves the next day, the loaves are <i>piggul</i>. This <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> this is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>what</b> is the meaning of the emphasis in the <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>never</b> liability? <b>Granted,</b> this phrase is understandable <b>if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that the loaves are not <i>piggul</i> unless he has intent <b>with regard to both of the</b> loaves <b>and both of the</b> lambs, i.e., they are <i>piggul</i> only if he slaughters both lambs with the intention to partake of both loaves the next day. In that case the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and it comes to exclude</b> the statements <b>of</b> both <b>Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis,</b> and <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>states:</b> There is <b>never</b> liability, to emphasize that Rabbi Yosei disagrees with both of these opinions.
<b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> only the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> for <b>what</b> reason does the <i>baraita</i> stress: There is <b>never</b> liability? The <i>tanna</i> would not use such a word to exclude merely one opinion. Rather, it must be that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. If so, then the difficulty raised against Rav Huna, who says that <i>piggul</i> intent concerning the right thigh does not render the left one <i>piggul</i>, remains unresolved.
<b>And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ashi say: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of the opinion of Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says in the name of Rabbi Yosei</b> that if, while performing the sacrificial rites for the bulls or goats which are burned as an offering, the priest had an intention that can <b>render</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> with regard to a matter that is performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, <b>he has rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> If his intention was <b>with regard to a matter that is performed inside</b> the Sanctuary or the Holy of Holies, <b>he has not rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>How so?</b> If <b>he was standing outside</b> when slaughtering the animal <b>and said: I hereby slaughter</b> the animal <b>with the intention of sprinkling its blood tomorrow</b> inside the Sanctuary, <b>he has not rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> when one has <b>an intention outside with regard to a matter that is performed inside,</b> he has not rendered the offering <i>piggul</i>. Likewise, if he <b>was standing inside</b> when sprinkling, <b>and said: I hereby sprinkle</b> the blood of the sin offering <b>in order to burn</b> its <b>sacrificial portions</b> on the external altar <b>tomorrow and to pour out</b> its <b>remainder</b> on the base of the altar <b>tomorrow, he has not rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>, as</b> he had <b>an intention inside with regard to a matter that is performed outside.</b>
<b>But</b> if <b>he was standing outside and said: I hereby slaughter</b> the animal <b>with the intention to pour out</b> the <b>remainder</b> of its blood <b>tomorrow, or to burn</b> its <b>sacrificial portions tomorrow, he has rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>, as</b> he had <b>an intention outside with regard to a matter that is performed outside.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the case where one slaughtered the offering with the intent <b>to pour the remaining</b> blood the next day, <b>what could be rendered <i>piggul</i>? If we say</b> the <b>blood could be rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> one can ask: <b>Does blood become <i>piggul</i>? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 42b): <b>These are</b> the <b>items for which one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>: The handful; the frankincense; the incense; the meal offering of priests; the meal offering</b> accompanying the <b>libations</b> brought with an animal offering; <b>the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest; and the blood?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that it is the <b>meat</b> of the offering that <b>could be rendered <i>piggul</i>. Now</b> consider: <b>And if there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>where he did not have intent with regard to the meat itself,</b> as his intention was not to partake of the meat the next day but to pour the remaining blood the next day, and yet <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> that the meat <b>is rendered <i>piggul</i>;</b> then <b>here, where he has intent</b> to partake of the right thigh the next day, which is part <b>of the offering itself,</b> is it <b>not all the more so that</b> if <b>he had intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to the right thigh, he has rendered the left thigh <i>piggul</i></b> as well?
<b>And furthermore, doesn’t Ravina say: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of the statement of Rav Huna from the mishna (13a): In the case of <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake of its remainder or to burn its handful</b> on <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei concedes in this</b> instance <b>that he has rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> and he is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>it.</b>
Ravina continues: When one removes the handful with the intent <b>to burn its handful, what could be rendered <i>piggul</i>? If we say</b> that <b>the handful could be rendered <i>piggul</i>, does the handful become <i>piggul</i>? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 42b): <b>These are</b> the <b>items for which one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>: The handful, etc. Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <b>remainder could be rendered <i>piggul</i>. Now</b> consider: <b>And if there,</b> in the mishna, <b>where he did not have intent with regard to</b> the <b>remainder itself,</b> i.e., to partake of the remainder the next day,

Daf 14b

and yet Rabbi Yosei said that the remainder <b>is rendered <i>piggul</i>;</b> then <b>here, where he has intent</b> to partake of the right thigh the next day, which is part <b>of</b> the <b>offering itself,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that both thighs should become <i>piggul</i>?
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Rabbi Yosei holds that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to one thigh renders the other thigh <i>piggul</i> as well, as they are of one body. Similarly, with regard to two loaves, Rabbi Yosei is of the opinion that if one intends to consume an amount equal to an olive-bulk from both loaves, both loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i>. And as for his statement that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to one loaf does not render the other loaf <i>piggul</i>, <b>this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei: The verse renders</b> the two loaves <b>one body, and the verse</b> also <b>renders them two bodies.</b> The verse renders them <b>one body</b> in the sense <b>that they preclude one another,</b> i.e., neither loaf is valid without the other. The verse also renders them <b>two bodies, as the Merciful One states: This</b> loaf <b>is prepared alone and that is prepared alone,</b> i.e., the kneading and arrangement of each loaf must be performed separately.
Therefore, if the priest <b>mixed them</b> together by intending to consume an olive-bulk from both of them, then <b>they are mixed</b> and they are both <i>piggul</i>, <b>as the verse renders them one body.</b> But if <b>he separated them</b> by having intent with regard to only one loaf, in that case <b>they are separated</b> and only that loaf is <i>piggul</i>, <b>as the verse renders them two bodies.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>had intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to</b> one type of loaf from the <b>loaves of a thanks offering, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the remaining types of loaves, i.e., are they rendered <i>piggul</i> as well? Similarly, if one had intent of <i>piggul</i> <b>with regard to</b> either the loaves or the wafers of <b>baked meal offerings, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the remaining type? <b>Rav Taḥlifa from the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>taught him</b> a <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>And likewise you say with regard to the bread of a thanks offering, and likewise you say with regard to a baked meal offering,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is a matter of dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>at the time of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an offering one <b>had intent to consume half an olive-bulk</b> of its meat the next day, <b>and at the time of</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>he had intent to consume half</b> of another <b>olive-bulk</b> of meat the next day, the offering is <b><i>piggul</i>, as</b> intentions that occur during the <b>slaughter and sprinkling combine</b> to render an offering <i>piggul</i>.
There is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Some say</b> that in the case of intentions that occur specifically during the <b>slaughter and sprinkling, as both of them are permitting factors</b> of the offering, <b>yes,</b> the intentions combine. But intentions that occur during the <b>collection</b> of the blood in a service vessel <b>and</b> the <b>conveying</b> of the blood to the altar do <b>not</b> combine, as neither rite is a permitting factor. <b>And some say</b> that if intentions during <b>those</b> rites <b>that are distant</b> from one another, i.e., the slaughter and sprinkling, combine, <b>all the more so</b> intentions during <b>these</b> rites <b>that are close</b> to one another, i.e., collection and conveying, certainly combine.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> i.e., that intentions during the slaughter and sprinkling combine? <b>But Levi teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Intentions that occur during the <b>four</b> sacrificial <b>rites do not combine to</b> render an offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> and those rites are: <b>Slaughter and sprinkling, collection and conveying. Rava said:</b> It is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement of Levi is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the two loaves and two lambs sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> one of <b>the lambs</b> brought as peace offerings on <i>Shavuot</i> with the intent <b>to consume half an olive-bulk from this loaf</b> the next day, <b>and similarly,</b> he slaughtered <b>the other</b> lamb with the intent <b>to consume half an olive-bulk from that</b> second <b>loaf</b> the next day, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say that this</b> offering is <b>valid.</b> Clearly, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that intentions that occur during the performance of two permitting factors do not combine to render an offering <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: You can <b>say that you have heard that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi holds that intentions do not combine to render an offering <i>piggul</i> when each intention is concerning <b>half a permitting factor and half</b> a measure of <b>consumption,</b> i.e., one lamb and half an olive-bulk. But in a case where one had intentions during the performance of <b>an entire permitting factor,</b> i.e., during the slaughter and sprinkling, <b>and</b> concerning <b>half</b> a measure of <b>consumption, did you hear him</b> say that such intentions do not combine?
<b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: But if Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is of</b> the opinion that intentions during the performance of <b>an entire permitting factor and</b> concerning <b>half</b> a measure of <b>consumption</b> combine to render an offering <i>piggul</i>, why does he rule that when one slaughters each lamb with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from one loaf the next day the offering is entirely valid? <b>Let him decree</b> that intentions during <b>half a permitting factor and</b> concerning <b>half</b> a measure of <b>consumption</b> disqualify an offering, <b>due to</b> the fact that intentions during <b>an entire permitting factor and</b> concerning <b>half</b> a measure of <b>consumption</b> render the offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>as</b> one finds in similar instances that <b>Rabbi Yosei decreed and the Rabbis decreed</b> in this manner.
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yosei decreed</b> in such a case, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (13a): With regard to one who removes a handful from the meal offering with the intent to burn its handful on the next day, everyone agrees that the meal offering is <i>piggul</i>. But if his intent was <b>to burn its frankincense</b> on <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The meal offering is <b>unfit, but</b> partaking of it <b>does not include</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is a case of <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of the meal offering. Since one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>, Rabbi Yosei evidently disqualifies the meal offering as a rabbinic decree due to concern over a case where his intention was to burn the handful the next day.
<b>And the Rabbis decreed as well, as we learned</b> in a mishna (16a): If one had <b>intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the handful but not during</b> the burning of <b>the frankincense,</b> or if he had such intent <b>during</b> the burning of <b>the frankincense but not during</b> the burning of <b>the handful, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, <b>and the Rabbis say: There is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption <b>unless he has intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the entire permitting factor,</b> i.e., both the handful and the frankincense. Since the Rabbis state that there is no liability to receive <i>karet</i>, but they do not rule that the offering is valid, evidently they maintain that the offering is disqualified by rabbinic law, due to concern over a case of <i>piggul</i> intent during the burning of the entire permitting factor.
Abaye <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted there, Rabbi Yosei decreed</b> that the offering is disqualified in a case of intent involving <b>the handful of frankincense due to</b> the concern of intent involving <b>the handful of the meal offering,</b> as the two cases are similar.
Similarly, <b>the Rabbis decreed</b> that the offering is disqualified in a case of intent involving the <b>handful due to</b> a similar case of intent concerning <b>the handful of the meal offering of a sinner.</b> There is no frankincense in the case of a meal offering of a sinner, and consequently the priest’s intent with regard to the handful alone renders the offering <i>piggul</i>, as it is the sole permitting factor. <b>And</b> the Rabbis also decreed in a case of intent with regard to the <b>frankincense due to</b> a similar case of intent concerning the <b>frankincense that comes in</b> the <b>bowls</b> that accompany the shewbread. Here there is no handful, and consequently intent with regard to the frankincense alone renders the shewbread <i>piggul</i>.
In the case of the two <b>lambs</b> that accompany the two loaves brought on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>as well</b> (16a), the Rabbis rule that if one slaughters one of the lambs with the intent to consume both loaves the next day the offering is disqualified, but one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of it. This is a rabbinic decree in a case of intent during the slaughter of one <b>lamb due to the other lamb,</b> as were one to slaughter both lambs with intent of <i>piggul</i>, the loaves would be rendered <i>piggul</i>, since his intent occurred during the slaughter of the entire permitting factor.
Similarly, when one burns a single <b>bowl</b> of frankincense from those that accompany the shewbread with the intent to consume both arrangements of shewbread the next day, the Rabbis disqualify the shewbread by rabbinic decree <b>due to the other bowl,</b> i.e., due to the concern over <i>piggul</i> intent during the burning of both bowls, as this intent involves the burning of the entire permitting factor.
Abaye concludes: <b>But here,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i> where one slaughtered each of the two lambs with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from a different loaf, <b>is there</b> another instance <b>in general</b> where intent during the performance of a rite concerning <b>half a permitting factor and</b> with regard to <b>half</b> a measure <b>of consumption</b> renders an offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>will arise and decree</b> that the lambs in this instance are disqualified?
The Gemara notes: <b>So too, it is reasonable that the reasoning of the Rabbis is due to that</b> explanation, i.e., they disqualified the offerings in the aforementioned cases due to the fact that in similar instances the offering is <i>piggul</i>. This is evident from the fact <b>that</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna (16a): <b>The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir in</b> the case of <b>the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy that if one had intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the handful,</b> the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, <b>as the handful is the</b> sole <b>permitting factor.</b>
The Gemara explains this proof: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach</b> this last statement <b>at all?</b> Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that these meal offerings are <i>piggul</i>, as <b>is there another permitting factor</b> aside from the handful? <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us, that the reason that</b> the Rabbis disqualified a standard meal offering when only the <b>handful</b> was removed with the intent of <i>piggul</i> is <b>because there is</b> the case of <b>the handful of the meal offering of a sinner, which is similar to it</b> and is rendered <i>piggul</i> due to intent involving the handful alone?
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one of the</b> two <b>loaves</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>or one of the</b> two <b>arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>became ritually impure, Rabbi Yehuda says: Both must be taken to the place of burning</b> like any other disqualified offering, <b>as no communal offering is divided.</b> That is, it is either fit in its entirety or unfit in its entirety. <b>And the Rabbis say: The impure one</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>impurity and the pure one shall be eaten.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis applies only to a case where one loaf became ritually impure <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of the lambs, as this is the act that renders the loaves permitted for consumption. Accordingly, they disagree whether the sprinkling is effective in permitting the remaining pure loaf for consumption. <b>But</b> in a case where one loaf was rendered impure <b>after the sprinkling,</b> meaning that both loaves were initially permitted for consumption, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>the impure one</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>impurity and the pure one shall be eaten.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in the case where the loaves become impure <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>with regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rav Pappa said: They disagree with regard to</b> the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest, i.e., whether it <b>effects acceptance</b> only for the impurity of items sacrificed on the altar, or even <b>for</b> the impurity of items that would normally be <b>consumed</b> by the priests.

Daf 15a

<b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> items that are normally <b>consumed</b> by the priests but have become ritually impure. Consequently, the sprinkling of the blood in this case is an entirely valid act that is capable of rendering the remaining pure loaf permitted for consumption. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>the frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> items that are <b>consumed</b> by the priests and have become impure. Accordingly, the sprinkling of the blood is ineffective in rendering the remaining pure loaf permitted for consumption.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa:</b> Can this be the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis? <b>But</b> what about items that normally <b>ascend</b> upon the altar? Even Rabbi Yehuda concedes <b>that the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> impure items <b>that</b> normally <b>ascend</b> the altar, <b>and</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis nevertheless <b>disagree</b> with regard to the remaining item in a case of this kind.
The Gemara provides the source for this claim. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one of the bowls</b> of frankincense accompanying the shewbread, which are meant to be burned upon the altar, <b>became impure, Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the rites of <b>both of them may be performed in impurity,</b> i.e., the priest may even render the second bowl impure and burn both of them together, <b>as no communal offering is divided,</b> and the mitzva to sacrifice communal offerings overrides the prohibition against rendering them impure. <b>And the Rabbis say: The impure one</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>impurity and the pure one</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>purity.</b> Evidently, their dispute does not depend on whether the frontplate effects acceptance.
<b>And furthermore, Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof that the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis does not concern the frontplate, as we learn in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 80a) with regard to the consumption of the Paschal offering in a state of impurity, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if <b>one tribe is ritually impure and all</b> the rest of <b>the tribes are pure,</b> all the tribes <b>may perform</b> the rite of the Paschal offering <b>in</b> a state of <b>impurity, as no communal offerings are divided.</b> Rav Ashi explains: <b>But here, what</b> relevance <b>is there</b> to the question of whether <b>the frontplate effects acceptance?</b> The frontplate effects acceptance for offerings that have become impure; but it does not render it permitted for one who is ritually impure to sacrifice an offering.
<b>And furthermore, doesn’t Ravina say: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that the matter of the frontplate cannot be the subject of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, as the mishna teaches: If <b>one of the</b> two <b>loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>or one of the</b> two <b>arrangements</b> of shewbread <b>became ritually impure, Rabbi Yehuda says: Both must be taken to the place of burning, as no communal offering is divided. And the Rabbis say: The impure one</b> remains <b>in its impurity and the pure one may be eaten.</b>
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>And if it is so,</b> i.e., that the dispute between them concerns the frontplate, then Rabbi Yehuda <b>should have</b> said: They are both burned, <b>because the frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> impure items that are <b>consumed</b> by the priests. <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is a settled tradition in the mouth of Rabbi Yehuda that no communal offering is divided,</b> and if one part of an offering becomes impure, the entire offering is disqualified.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The thanks offering renders the</b> accompanying <b>loaves <i>piggul</i> but the loaves do not render the thanks offering <i>piggul</i>. How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered the thanks offering,</b> which may be consumed only during the day it is slaughtered and the night thereafter, with the intent <b>to partake of it the next day,</b> the offering <b>and the</b> accompanying <b>loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i>.</b> If he slaughtered it with the intent <b>to partake of the loaves the next day, the loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i> and the thanks offering is not <i>piggul</i>.</b>
Likewise, <b>the lambs</b> sacrificed with the two loaves meal offering on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>render the</b> accompanying <b>loaves <i>piggul</i>, but the loaves do not render the lambs <i>piggul</i>. How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered the lambs,</b> which may be consumed only during the day they are slaughtered and the night thereafter, with the intent <b>to partake of them the next day,</b> the lambs <b>and the</b> accompanying <b>loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i>.</b> If he did so with the intent <b>to partake of the loaves the next day, the loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i> and the lambs are not <i>piggul</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that a thanks offering renders its accompanying loaves <i>piggul</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>due to that</b> which <b>Rav Kahana</b> says, this is problematic. <b>As Rav Kahana says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the loaves of a thanks offering are</b> themselves <b>called a thanks offering?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanks offering loaves”</b> (Leviticus 7:12). The juxtaposition of the words “thanks offering” and “loaves” indicates that the loaves are themselves called a thanks offering.
The Gemara explains why the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna cannot be derived from Rav Kahana’s exposition. <b>If so,</b> then <b>the opposite</b> should be the <i>halakha</i> <b>as well,</b> that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to the loaves should likewise render the thanks offering <i>piggul</i>. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as the <b>loaves are called a thanks offering,</b> but <b>a thanks offering is not called loaves.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches: The lambs</b> sacrificed with the two loaves meal offering on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>render the</b> accompanying <b>loaves <i>piggul</i> but the loaves do not render the lambs <i>piggul</i>, where do we find that</b> the two <b>loaves are called lambs? Rather, is it not</b> correct that <b>this is the reason</b> why the thanks offering renders the loaves <i>piggul</i> but not vice versa: The <b>bread</b> is brought <b>on account of [<i>gelal</i>]</b> the <b>thanks offering, but</b> the <b>thanks offering is not</b> brought <b>on account of</b> the <b>bread,</b> i.e., the thanks offering is the primary element of the sacrifice. Similarly, the two loaves of <b>bread are</b> brought <b>on account of</b> the <b>lambs, and</b> the <b>lambs are not</b> brought <b>on account of</b> the <b>bread.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> both of these <i>halakhot</i> <b>are necessary, as, had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> only in the case of <b>a thanks offering,</b> then one might say: <b>It is</b> only <b>there,</b> with regard to a thanks offering, <b>that when one renders the loaves <i>piggul</i> the thanks offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>, because they were not bound to one another by waving,</b> i.e., the mitzva of waving the thanks offering may be fulfilled without the bread. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>lambs,</b> in <b>which</b> the two items <b>were bound to one another by waving,</b> as the two loaves are waved together with the lambs, one might <b>say</b> that <b>when he renders the bread <i>piggul</i>,</b> the <b>lambs should be rendered <i>piggul</i> as well.</b> Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> also with regard to the case of the lambs.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> If <b>one slaughters the thanks offering</b> with the intent <b>to consume an olive-bulk from it and from its loaves the next day, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Elazar elaborates: <b>I do not raise the dilemma with regard to rendering</b> the <b>thanks offering <i>piggul</i>,</b> for the following reason: <b>Now</b> that in a case where his intent was to consume <b>the entire</b> olive-bulk <b>from its loaves</b> alone, the thanks offering <b>is not rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> in accordance with the mishna’s ruling that <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to the loaves does not render the thanks offering <i>piggul</i>, then in a case where his intent is to consume half an olive-bulk <b>from</b> the thanks offering <b>and</b> half an olive-bulk <b>from its loaves,</b> in which case the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i> only if the two intentions of less than a full measure are combined, is it <b>necessary</b> to teach that the thanks offering is not <i>piggul</i>?
Rather, <b>when I raise the dilemma,</b> it is with regard <b>to rendering the loaves <i>piggul</i>,</b> which can be rendered <i>piggul</i> via intent concerning the loaves alone. In this case, <b>does</b> the intention of the priest with regard to the <b>thanks offering combine</b> with his intention concerning the loaves <b>to render the loaves <i>piggul</i>, or not?</b>
Rav <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>Even in this</b> case, <b>the loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i> and the thanks offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> should the loaves be rendered <i>piggul</i>? <b>Let us say</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> the <b>thanks offering, which</b> in this case serves to <b>render</b> the loaves <b><i>piggul</i>, is</b> itself <b>not rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> then the loaves, <b>which come to render</b> the thanks offering <b><i>piggul</i>, but do not render</b> it <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> as the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from the loaves does not combine with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from the thanks offering to render the thanks offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>is it not logical that the</b> loaves themselves <b>should not be rendered <i>piggul</i>?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>in this way? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving one</b>

Daf 15b

<b>who planted</b> seeds in <b>the vineyard of an another</b> when the grapes on the vines were <b>budding, and</b> the <b>incident came before the Sages and they deemed the seeds prohibited</b> due to the prohibition against planting diverse kinds in a vineyard, <b>but they deemed the vines permitted.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>But why</b> did they deem the seeds prohibited? <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>say</b> through an analogous <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the seeds should be permitted: <b>And if that which renders</b> an item <b>prohibited,</b> i.e., the vine, which causes the seeds to be prohibited, <b>is</b> itself <b>not prohibited,</b> then with regard to the seeds, <b>which come to render</b> the vines <b>prohibited but did not render</b> the vines <b>prohibited, is it not logical that they should not be rendered prohibited?</b>
The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, only <b>hemp and arum</b> are <b>prohibited</b> by <b>Torah</b> law to be sown in a vineyard, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:5): If <b>one’s field was sown</b> with <b>hemp and arum, he should not sow above them, as they produce</b> a yield only once every <b>three years. Other seeds are prohibited by rabbinic</b> law. Therefore, with regard to <b>this</b> person <b>who committed a transgression</b> by planting the seeds in the vineyard of another, <b>the Sages penalized him</b> and deemed his seeds prohibited, but as for <b>that</b> person <b>who did not commit a transgression,</b> i.e., the owner of the vineyard, <b>the Sages did not penalize him. But here,</b> in the case of <i>piggul</i>, which is a biblical prohibition, <b>let us say</b> such <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.
<b>And there are those who teach</b> the dilemma of Rabbi Elazar <b>with regard to the lambs</b> brought with the two loaves, and not with regard to a thanks offering. <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> In a case where <b>one slaughters the lambs</b> with the intent <b>to consume an olive-bulk from them and from their loaves</b> the next day, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Rabbi Elazar elaborated: <b>I do not raise the dilemma with regard to rendering</b> the <b>lambs <i>piggul</i></b> for the following reason: <b>Now</b> that in a case where his intent was to consume <b>an entire</b> olive-bulk <b>from the loaves</b> alone, the lambs <b>are not rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> as the mishna teaches that <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to the loaves does not render the lambs <i>piggul</i>, then in a case where his intent is to consume half an olive-bulk <b>from them and</b> half an olive-bulk <b>from their loaves, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that the lambs are not <i>piggul</i>? Rather, <b>when I raised the dilemma,</b> it was <b>with regard to rendering the loaves <i>piggul</i>. Does</b> his intention with regard to the <b>lambs combine</b> with his intention with regard to the loaves <b>to render the loaves <i>piggul</i> or not?</b>
Rav <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>Even in this</b> case, <b>the loaves are rendered <i>piggul</i> and the lambs are not rendered <i>piggul</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> should the loaves be rendered <i>piggul</i>? <b>Let us say</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if that which renders</b> an item <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., the lambs, since it is maintained that intent to consume half an olive-bulk from the lambs assists to render the loaves <i>piggul</i>, <b>is</b> itself <b>not rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> then with regard to the loaves, <b>which come to render</b> the lambs <b><i>piggul</i>, but do not render</b> them <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> as the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from the loaves does not combine with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from the lambs to render them <i>piggul</i>, <b>is it not logical that</b> the loaves themselves <b>should not be rendered <i>piggul</i>?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>of this kind? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there was <b>an incident involving one who planted</b> seeds in <b>the vineyard of his friend</b> when the grapes on the vines were <b>budding,</b> and the incident came before the Sages and they deemed the seeds prohibited due to the prohibition against planting diverse kinds in a vineyard, but they deemed the vines permitted. The Gemara continues: <b>But why</b> did they deem the seeds prohibited? <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>say</b> through an analogous <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the seeds should be permitted: <b>And</b> if <b>that which renders</b> an item <b>prohibited,</b> i.e., the vine, which causes the seeds to be prohibited, <b>is</b> itself <b>not prohibited,</b> then with regard to the seeds, <b>which come to render</b> the vines <b>prohibited but did not render</b> the vines <b>prohibited, is it not logical that</b> they <b>should not be rendered prohibited?</b>
The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, only <b>hemp and arum</b> are <b>prohibited</b> by <b>Torah</b> law to be sown in a vineyard. <b>Other seeds are prohibited by rabbinic</b> law. Therefore, with regard to <b>this</b> person <b>who committed a transgression</b> by planting the seeds in the vineyard of another, <b>the Sages penalized him</b> and deemed his seeds prohibited, but as for <b>this</b> person <b>who did not commit a transgression,</b> i.e., the owner of the vineyard, <b>the Sages did not penalize him. But here,</b> in the case of <i>piggul</i>, which is a biblical prohibition, <b>let us say</b> such <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.
The Gemara notes: <b>The one who teaches</b> that the dilemma of Rabbi Elazar was raised <b>with regard to the thanks offering</b> and the accompanying loaves, <b>all the more so</b> will hold that the dilemma may be raised <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>the lambs</b> brought with the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>But the one who teaches</b> that Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma was raised <b>with regard to the lambs</b> and the two loaves, it is possible that he holds that the dilemma <b>was</b> raised only with regard to the <b>lambs</b> and the two loaves, <b>as they were bound to one another by waving,</b> since the priest waves the lambs and loaves together (see Leviticus 23:20). <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a thanks offering</b> and its loaves, <b>as they were not bound to one another by waving,</b> the dilemma was <b>not</b> raised, since it is obvious in this case that his intentions do not combine.
<b>Rabbi Abba the small</b> taught that Rabbi Elazar <b>raises the dilemma</b> in <b>this</b> manner: <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> If <b>one slaughters</b> one of <b>the lambs</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i> with the two loaves intending <b>to consume an olive-bulk from the other the next day, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? When this individual thinks of <b>the other,</b> does he <b>mean</b> the other <b>lamb, and</b> if so, the lamb <b>is not rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> as one permitting factor does not render another permitting factor <i>piggul</i>? <b>Or perhaps</b> when this individual thinks of the other he <b>means</b> the other part of the offering, i.e., the two <b>loaves, and</b> if so his intention <b>renders it <i>piggul</i>,</b> as taught in the mishna.
Rav <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>You learned</b> in a mishna (16a): If <b>one slaughtered one of the lambs</b> with the intent <b>to partake of it the next day, that</b> lamb is <b><i>piggul</i> and the other</b> is <b>fit.</b> If he slaughtered one lamb with the intent <b>to partake of the other the next day, both</b> lambs <b>are fit,</b> as one permitting factor does not render another permitting factor <i>piggul</i>. Rav concludes: <b>Evidently,</b> in this context the term: <b>The other, means</b> the other <b>lamb.</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where he clarifies and says: The other lamb,</b> but the mishna is not referring to a case where he merely thought: The other.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The</b> animal <b>offering renders the</b> accompanying <b>libations</b> and meal offerings <b><i>piggul</i> from</b> the moment <b>that they were consecrated in the vessel,</b> but not before; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. The libations do not render the</b> animal <b>offering <i>piggul</i>. How so?</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters the offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake of it the next day,</b> the offering <b>and its libations are rendered <i>piggul</i>.</b> But if one slaughters the offering with the intent <b>to sacrifice its libations the next day, the libations are rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> while <b>the offering is not <i>piggul</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>libations of an animal</b> offering, <b>one is liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>, as the blood of the offering permits them to be offered</b> on the altar, and any item that becomes permitted for consumption or for sacrifice through a permitting factor can be rendered <i>piggul</i>, and one who partakes of such an item after its permitting factors were sacrificed is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Meir: But a person may bring his offering today and</b> the accompanying <b>libations from now until</b> even <b>ten days</b> later. Evidently, then, the blood of the offering does render the libations permitted. Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: I, too, spoke only about</b> libations that <b>come</b> to be sacrificed together <b>with the offering</b> and were already sanctified in a service vessel for that purpose. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> But <b>it is possible to switch</b> the libations <b>for</b> use with <b>another offering.</b> Clearly, then, they are not considered an indispensable part of that offering.
<b>Rava said: Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the libations <b>are fixed</b> to this particular offering <b>at</b> the time of its <b>slaughter,</b> and one may not use them with another offering. Accordingly, these libations are rendered <i>piggul</i> on account of intent during the slaughter of the offering, just <b>like the loaves of a thanks offering,</b> which are fixed to a particular thanks offering upon its slaughter and become <i>piggul</i> on account of intent during the slaughter of that particular thanks offering.
In a similar vein, <b>the Sages taught:</b> With regard to the <b><i>log</i> of oil of the leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:10–20), <b>one is liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i></b> if the guilt offering that this oil accompanied became <i>piggul</i>, <b>as</b> the <b>blood</b> of the offering <b>permits it to</b> be placed on <b>the</b> right <b>thumb and big toe</b> of the leper. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Meir: But a person may bring his guilt offering today and</b> the accompanying <b><i>log</i></b> of oil <b>from now until</b> even <b>ten days</b> later. Evidently, the <i>log</i> of oil is not considered part of the guilt offering, and therefore it should not be rendered <i>piggul</i> on account of it.
Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: I, too, spoke only about</b> a <i>log</i> of oil that <b>comes with the guilt</b> offering. The Rabbis said to him: But even in this case, the oil should not be considered part of the offering, as <b>it is possible to switch</b> the oil <b>for</b> use with <b>another guilt offering. Rava said: Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the <i>log</i> of oil <b>is fixed</b> to this particular guilt offering <b>at</b> the time of its <b>slaughter</b> and is therefore rendered <i>piggul</i> on account of it, just <b>like the loaves of a thanks offering,</b> as the slaughter of the thanks offering fixes the accompanying loaves to that particular offering.

Daf 16a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the burning of the handful of a meal offering and the frankincense, both of which render the meal offering permitted for consumption: If the priest had an intention that can <b>render</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the handful but not during</b> the burning of <b>the frankincense,</b> or <b>during</b> the burning of <b>the frankincense but not during</b> the burning of <b>the handful,</b> i.e., he burned one of them with the intention to eat the remainder of the offering beyond its designated time, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one</b> who eats it is <b>liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for its consumption. <b>And the Rabbis say: There is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> in this</b> case <b>unless he renders</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the sacrifice of <b>the entire permitting factor,</b> i.e., the burning of both the handful and the frankincense.
<b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir in</b> the case of <b>a meal offering of a sinner and in</b> the case of <b>a meal offering of jealousy</b> of a <i>sota</i> <b>that if one had intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the handful, that</b> the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for its consumption, <b>as</b> here <b>the handful is the</b> sole <b>permitting factor.</b>
If <b>one slaughtered one of the</b> two <b>lambs</b> sacrificed with the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i> with the intent <b>to partake of</b> the <b>two loaves the next day,</b> or if <b>one burned one of the bowls</b> of frankincense with the intent <b>to partake of two arrangements</b> of shewbread <b>the next day, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for its consumption, <b>and the Rabbis say: There is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> unless he has intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the sacrifice of <b>the entire permitting factor.</b>
If <b>one slaughtered one of the lambs</b> with the intent <b>to partake of it the next day, that</b> lamb is <b><i>piggul</i> and the other is a fit</b> offering. If he slaughtered one lamb with the intent <b>to partake of the other the next day, both</b> lambs <b>are fit</b> offerings, as one permitting factor does not render another permitting factor <i>piggul</i>.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis with regard to a case where one has intent of <i>piggul</i> by either the handful or the frankincense applies only, for instance, <b>when he placed the handful</b> upon the altar <b>in silence,</b> i.e., without specific intent, <b>and</b> thereafter placed <b>the frankincense with intent</b> to partake of the remainder the next day. In such a case, it is evident that his intent relates only to the frankincense.
<b>But</b> if <b>he placed the handful with</b> the <b>intent</b> to partake of the remainder the next day <b>and</b> then placed <b>the frankincense in silence, all agree</b> that the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i>, as anyone who performs</b> the rites in such a manner <b>performs</b> them <b>in accordance with</b> his <b>initial intent. And Shmuel says:</b> Even in such a case, there <b>is still a dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Meir.
<b>Rava sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that intent of <i>piggul</i> concerning only the handful renders the meal offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>said?</b> It is stated in a case where one had such intent <b>during the removal of the handful, or during the placement of</b> the handful in a service <b>vessel, or during the conveying</b> of the vessel to the altar. Since these rites are not performed with the frankincense, during these stages the handful is the only relevant permitting factor.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: But once the priest <b>comes to</b> perform <b>the burning</b> of the handful, then if he <b>placed the handful</b> on the fire of the altar <b>in silence and</b> he placed <b>the frankincense with intent</b> of <i>piggul</i>, or if he placed <b>the handful with intent and the frankincense in silence, Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, <b>and the Rabbis say: There is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> unless he has intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the sacrifice of <b>the entire permitting factor.</b>
Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna explains his objection: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> a case where he <b>placed the handful with intent and the frankincense in silence, and</b> yet the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir and they do not say that one performs the rite of the frankincense with one’s initial intent.
Rava answered: <b>Say</b> that this is what the <i>baraita</i> means: If he placed the handful with intent, <b>and he had already placed the frankincense in silence from the outset,</b> then Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis disagree. The Gemara rejects this statement: <b>There are two</b> possible <b>refutations of</b> this <b>statement. One</b> is <b>that</b> if Rava’s answer is accepted, then <b>this</b> case <b>is</b> identical to <b>the first</b> case of the <i>baraita</i>, which already taught that there is a dispute if the initial permitting factor was sacrificed in silence. <b>And furthermore, isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>After</b> placing the handful he burned the frankincense.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina interpreted</b> this <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rav: This <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of two intentions,</b> i.e., there were two priests, the first one of whom burned the handful with intent of <i>piggul</i>, and the second burned the frankincense in silence. Since the intent of one priest is entirely independent of the other, it cannot be said that the second priest burns the frankincense in accordance with the intent of the first priest.
The Gemara continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i> that addresses <i>piggul</i> during the sprinkling of the blood. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i> even when he intends only while performing the first placement to eat it beyond its designated time, <b>said?</b> It is rendered <i>piggul</i> <b>in</b> the case of <b>blood that is placed on the external altar,</b> where one placement renders the offering permitted.
<b>But</b> with regard to the <b>blood placed</b> inside, in the Holy of Holies, on the Curtain, and <b>on the inner altar, for example,</b> the <b>forty-three</b> presentations of the blood <b>of</b> the bull and goat of <b>Yom Kippur, and the eleven</b> presentations of the blood <b>of</b> the <b>bull for</b> an unwitting sin of the <b>anointed priest, and</b> the <b>eleven</b> presentations of the blood <b>of</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> if the priest had an intention that can <b>render</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>, whether in the first</b> set of presentations, <b>whether in the second</b> set, <b>or whether in the third</b> set, i.e., in any of the requisite sets of presentations, e.g., in the case of the Yom Kippur bull in the Holy of Holies, on the Curtain, and on the inner altar, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for its</b> consumption. <b>And the Rabbis say: There is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> unless he</b> had an intention that can <b>render</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the performance of <b>the entire permitting factor.</b>
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>In any event,</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> If the priest had an intention that can <b>render</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>, whether in the first</b> set of presentations, <b>whether in the second</b> set, <b>or whether in the third</b> set; <b>and</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> in this case as well. Evidently, the Rabbis are not of the opinion that anyone who performs a rite performs it in accordance with his initial intent.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of two intentions,</b> e.g., one High Priest performed the initial presentation and was thereafter disqualified from performing the other presentations, and a second priest replaced him and performed the remaining presentations, there is still a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the verse: “With this shall Aaron come into the sacred place: <b>With</b> a young <b>bull”</b> (Leviticus 16:3), indicates that a High Priest may enter the Sanctuary <b>even with the blood of a bull,</b> i.e., he may continue the presentations with the blood of the offerings slaughtered by another High Priest. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the verse indicates that a High Priest may enter <b>“with</b> a young <b>bull,” but not with the blood of a bull,</b> i.e., a replacement High Priest must slaughter another bull and begin the presentations again, <b>what can be said?</b> If so, it is impossible for these presentations to be performed by two priests.
<b>Rava said:</b> According to Rav, <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the High Priest <b>had intent of <i>piggul</i> during the first</b> set of presentations <b>and was silent during the second</b> set, <b>and</b> again <b>had intent of <i>piggul</i> during the third</b> set. In such a case, <b>we say: If</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that <b>anyone who performs</b> a rite <b>performs</b> it <b>in accordance with his initial intention,</b> then <b>why do I</b> need the High Priest to <b>repeat</b> his intent of <b><i>piggul</i> during the third</b> set? The fact that he repeats his intention during the third set indicates that he did not perform the second set in accordance with his initial intent. Accordingly, the Rabbis hold that the offering is not <i>piggul</i>, as he did not have intent of <i>piggul</i> during the presentation of the entire permitting factor.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Does</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that the High Priest was <b>silent? Rather, Rav Ashi said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he had</b> explicit <b>intent of <i>piggul</i> during the first, second, and third</b> presentations, and was silent during the subsequent presentations. In such a case, <b>we say: If</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that <b>anyone who performs</b> a rite <b>performs</b> it <b>in accordance with his initial intention, why do I</b> need the High Priest to <b>repeat</b> his intent of <b><i>piggul</i> during the second and third</b> presentations?

Daf 16b

The Gemara raises a difficulty against Rav Ashi’s interpretation: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Whether</b> during the first presentation or <b>whether</b> during the second, which indicates that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir even with regard to a case where the priest had intent of <i>piggul</i> during any one of the presentations. The Gemara notes: Indeed, this poses <b>a difficulty.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the discussion of the <i>baraita</i> itself. <b>The Master said</b> above: If the priest had intent of <i>piggul</i>, whether in the first set of presentations, whether in the second set, or whether in the third set, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, despite the fact that he performed the rest of the rite silently. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>one is not liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> unless all the permitting factors</b> of the offering <b>have been sacrificed,</b> i.e., if the whole service is completed, including the presentation of the blood.
The Gemara provides the source for this claim. <b>As the Master said</b> that the verse states with regard to <i>piggul</i>: <b>“It shall</b> not <b>be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), which indicates that <b>the acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering is <b>like the acceptance of a valid</b> offering, of which the verse states: “It shall be accepted” (Leviticus 22:27), and <b>just as</b> there is no <b>acceptance of a valid</b> offering <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed, so too</b> there is no lack of <b>acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering, i.e., it is not rendered <i>piggul</i>, <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed.</b> That is to say, in the absence of one of its permitting factors it does not become <i>piggul</i>.
Accordingly, the Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> case, of the blood of the bull and goat brought on Yom Kippur, <b>since he had intent</b> of <i>piggul</i> <b>with regard to it</b> when he was presenting the blood <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, <b>he has disqualified it.</b> If so, <b>when he sprinkles</b> the blood again later <b>in the Sanctuary,</b> on the Curtain and the inner altar, it is as though <b>he is merely sprinkling water,</b> and not the blood of the offering. Consequently, the permitting factors of the offering have not been sacrificed, and therefore the offering should not be rendered <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Rabba said: You find it</b> possible <b>in</b> a case where there were <b>four bulls and four goats,</b> i.e., in a case where after the High Priest presented the blood inside the Holy of Holies with <i>piggul</i> intent, the remaining blood spilled. Consequently, he was required to bring another bull and goat in order to present their blood on the Curtain separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies. During that presentation he had intent of <i>piggul</i>, after which the remaining blood spilled, requiring him to bring another bull and goat in order to present their blood on the corners of the golden altar. He again had intent of <i>piggul</i> during that presentation, and then the blood spilled, which meant he had to bring yet another bull and goat in order to present their blood upon the golden altar itself.
<b>Rava said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case of only <b>one bull and one goat,</b> and the remaining blood was in fact disqualified. Nevertheless, <b>with regard to rendering</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> the presentations performed with the disqualified blood <b>effect acceptance,</b> as though the entire permitting factor was performed in its proper manner. In other words, even though the High Priest sprinkled the blood inside the Holy of Holies with improper intent, and thereby disqualified the offering, nevertheless, since he completed the service he is considered as having sacrificed all the permitting factors with regard to <i>piggul</i>.
§ The <i>baraita</i> mentioned that there are <b>forty-three</b> presentations of the blood of the bull and the goat sacrificed on Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a different <i>baraita</i>, which states that there are <b>forty-seven</b> presentations of that blood? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that there are forty-three presentations, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the High Priest <b>mixes</b> the blood of the bull and the goat before placing it <b>on the corners</b> of the inner altar, rather than placing the blood of each one separately. <b>And that</b> statement, that there are forty-seven presentations, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the High Priest <b>does not mix</b> the two types of blood before placing them on the corners, but sprinkles four times from the blood of the bull and another four times from the blood of the goat, and only afterward mixes the blood of the two animals for placement on the top of the altar.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in yet another <i>baraita</i> that there are <b>forty-eight</b> presentations? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that there are forty-eight presentations, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the pouring of the <b>remainder</b> of the blood on the base of the external altar <b>is indispensable,</b> and therefore this act is added to the total. <b>That</b> statement, that there are only forty-seven presentations, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the pouring of the <b>remainder</b> of the blood <b>is not indispensable.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If one had intent of <i>piggul</i> during the sacrifice of only part of the permitting factors, e.g., during the burning of the handful but not during the burning of the frankincense, the Rabbis rule that the offering is not <i>piggul</i>. Concerning this, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>had intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the <b>conveying</b> of the handful to the altar but not during the conveying of the frankincense, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>conveying</b> the handful is <b>like</b> that of the <b>removing of the handful.</b> Just as intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to removing only the handful renders the offering <i>piggul</i>, as it is the sole permitting factor with which the rite of removal is performed, the same applies to conveying the handful. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> The <b>conveying</b> of the handful is <b>like</b> its <b>burning.</b> Just as intent of <i>piggul</i> is required during the burning of both the handful and the frankincense for the offering to be rendered <i>piggul</i>, as both of them are burned on the altar, the same <i>halakha</i> applies to conveying.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> one can understand the ruling of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> as the conveying of the handful is only part of the permitting factors, since <b>there is also the conveying of</b> the <b>frankincense. But</b> as <b>for</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> that intent of <i>piggul</i> during the conveying of only the handful renders the offering <i>piggul</i>? After all, he has not had intent of <i>piggul</i> during the conveying of all of the permitting factors.
<b>Rava said: Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that if one performed <b>any</b> sacrificial <b>rite that does not permit</b> the offering, e.g., conveying, even if he performed it with only one of the permitting factors, such as with the handful and not with the frankincense, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a significant rite with regard to rendering</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> on account of it, by itself.</b> It is not comparable to a case of intent of <i>piggul</i> during the sacrifice of only part of the permitting factors, as this rite of conveying does not render the offering permitted.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But</b> what about <b>the slaughter of one of the lambs</b> brought with the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>which</b> is <b>a rite that does not permit</b> the offering, as neither the sacrifice of its portions designated for burning upon the altar nor the consumption of the meat of the offering and the two loaves is permitted by this slaughter, <b>and</b> yet the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir in this case?
<b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>one slaughtered one of the</b> two <b>lambs</b> with the intent <b>to partake of two loaves the next day,</b> or if <b>one burned one of the bowls</b> of frankincense with the intent <b>to partake of two arrangements</b> of shewbread <b>the next day, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, <b>and the Rabbis say: There is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> unless he has intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the sacrifice of <b>the entire permitting factor.</b> Although the slaughter of one of the lambs is a rite that does not render an offering permitted, nevertheless the Rabbis maintain that it is not considered a significant rite with regard to rendering the offering <i>piggul</i> by itself.
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Do you maintain</b> that the two loaves of <b>bread</b> are already <b>sanctified</b> from when they are <b>in the oven,</b> and require only the sprinkling of the blood to render them permitted for consumption? In fact, <b>the slaughter of the lambs sanctifies</b> the loaves, <b>and</b> an act <b>that comes to sanctify is considered like</b> that which <b>comes to permit.</b> Since the slaughter of the two lambs sanctifies the loaves, the slaughter of each lamb is considered half a permitting factor; the slaughter of each lamb independently cannot render the loaves <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the slaughter of the Paschal offering. The first <i>tanna</i> rules that if one slaughtering the Paschal offering intended for it to be consumed by both disqualified individuals, e.g., uncircumcised males, and fit individuals, e.g., circumcised males, the offering is not disqualified. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> In a case where one slaughtered a Paschal offering and severed one of the two organs of ritual slaughter with a disqualifying intention, and severed the other organ with a valid intention, then if one’s intent with regard to <b>circumcised</b> males <b>preceded the</b> intent with regard to the <b>uncircumcised</b> males, the offering is <b>valid.</b> But if the intent with regard to the <b>uncircumcised</b> males <b>preceded</b> the intent with regard to the <b>circumcised</b> males, it is <b>disqualified.</b>
Rav Shimi bar Ashi continues: <b>And we maintain that</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and <i>Aḥerim</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether the sacrifice of <b>half a permitting factor</b> with disqualifying intent disqualifies the entire offering. In this case, although this slaughter does not sanctify anything, the severing of one of the organs is considered half of a permitting factor. Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Shimi bar Ashi: <b>Do you maintain</b> that the <b>blood</b> is already <b>sanctified</b> while <b>inside the neck of</b> the <b>animal?</b> In fact, the <b>knife sanctifies</b> the <b>blood, and that which comes to sanctify is considered like</b> that which <b>comes to permit.</b> Consequently, the slaughter of the animal is a permitting factor, and the severing of one of its organs is half a permitting factor.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to only the handful renders the meal offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>said?</b> It is said in a case where one had such intent <b>during the removal of the handful, or during the placement</b> of the handful in a service <b>vessel, or during the conveying.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the proof: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the <b>conveying</b> of the handful <b>for burning</b> upon the altar, in which case it is teaching that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to the handful during its conveying renders the offering <i>piggul</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the <b>conveying of</b> the handful before its <b>placement</b> into the service <b>vessel</b> that sanctifies it. Since the frankincense is not placed into a vessel, in this case the conveying of the handful alone is considered the performance of the entire rite.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> state: <b>During the placement</b> of the handful in <b>a vessel or during the conveying?</b> This indicates that it is referring to an act of conveying that occurs after the placement. <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>During the conveying or during the placement</b> of the handful in <b>a vessel.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one should emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>teach</b> it in <b>that</b> order, i.e., with the conveying before the placement.
The Gemara raises another objection from the next clause of the same <i>baraita</i>: Once <b>he comes to</b> perform <b>the burning</b> of the handful, there is no liability to receive <i>karet</i> unless he has intent of <i>piggul</i> during the sacrifice of the frankincense as well. The Gemara asks: According to Reish Lakish, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated: Once <b>he comes to</b> perform <b>the conveying</b> and to perform the burning. Reish Lakish maintains that the conveying mentioned previously in the <i>baraita</i> occurs earlier, before its placement into a service vessel, which means that there is another act of conveying. The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult; since</b> this <b>conveying is for the purpose of burning, it is called burning</b> in the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara further challenges: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> also states: If he <b>placed the handful</b> on the altar <b>in silence,</b> and he placed the frankincense with intent of <i>piggul</i>. According to Reish Lakish, <b>it should have</b> also stated: If <b>he carried</b> the handful in silence, and the frankincense with intent of <i>piggul</i>, as according to Reish Lakish it is the act of conveying that he is performing at this stage. The Gemara responds: Indeed, this is <b>a difficulty.</b>
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of <i>piggul</i> intent that occurred during the sacrifice of part of a permitting factor. If one <b>burned</b> an amount the size of <b>a sesame</b> seed of the handful and frankincense with the intent <b>to consume</b> an amount the size of <b>a sesame</b> seed from the remainder the next day, and he repeated the same action with the accompanying intent <b>until</b> he burned <b>the entire</b> measure of the <b>handful</b> and frankincense, the <i>halakha</i> in this case is a matter of dispute between <b>Rav Ḥisda, Rav Hamnuna, and Rav Sheshet. One says</b> that the entire meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i>, and one says</b> that the offering is <b>disqualified</b> but is not <i>piggul</i>, <b>and one says</b> that the offering remains <b>fit.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the one who says</b> that the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i></b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that one renders an offering <i>piggul</i> on account of <i>piggul</i> intent during the sacrifice of even part of its permitting factors. <b>And the one who says</b> that the offering is <b>disqualified</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that such intent disqualifies an offering but does not render it <i>piggul</i>. <b>And</b> finally, <b>the one who says</b> that the offering is <b>fit</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who says (14a) that if one slaughters each of the two lambs brought on <i>Shavuot</i> with the two loaves, each time intending to consume half an olive-bulk from a different loaf the next day, the offering is fit, as the halves do not combine to render the offering <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>From where</b> is this conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Meir states</b> that one renders an offering <i>piggul</i> on account of <i>piggul</i> intent during the sacrifice of part of the permitting factors <b>only there, where he had intent with regard to its</b> entire <b>measure. But here, where he did not have intent with regard to its</b> entire <b>measure,</b> but instead had a series of intentions with regard to a measure equivalent to a sesame seed, it is possible that Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> render the offering <i>piggul</i>.
<b>And</b> furthermore, perhaps <b>the Rabbis state</b> that one does not render an offering <i>piggul</i> unless he has <i>piggul</i> intent during the sacrifice of the entire permitting factor <b>only there, where he did not have intent concerning it during the entire permitting factor,</b> but only during the burning of the handful. <b>But here, where he had intent during the entire permitting factor,</b> i.e., during the burning of both the handful and the frankincense, <b>he has indeed rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> despite the fact that each intention referred only to a small portion of the entire measure.
<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>states</b> that the offering is valid if one had intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to half an olive-bulk from each loaf <b>only there, where he did not subsequently complete</b> his intention with regard to a full measure <b>from the same</b> sacrificial <b>rite,</b> as he had <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to half an olive-bulk during the slaughter of each lamb independently. <b>But here, where he subsequently completed</b> his intention with regard to a full measure <b>from the same rite,</b> perhaps <b>he has indeed disqualified</b> the offering.
<b>Rather, the one who says</b> that an offering is <b><i>piggul</i></b> when one repeatedly burns an amount the size of a sesame seed from the handful and frankincense with the intent to consume an amount the size of a sesame seed from the remainder the next day, would claim that <b>all</b> of the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>agree</b> that it is <i>piggul</i>. Similarly, <b>the one who says</b> that it is <b>disqualified</b> would contend that <b>all agree</b> that it is disqualified, and <b>the one who says</b> that it is <b>fit</b> would maintain that <b>all agree</b> that it is fit.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The one who says</b> that <b>all agree</b> it is <b><i>piggul</i> maintains</b> that <b>the manner of</b> its <b>consumption</b> is <b>in such</b> a manner, i.e., in small portions, <b>and</b> likewise <b>the manner of</b> its <b>burning is</b> also <b>in such</b> a manner. <b>And the one who says</b> that <b>all agree</b> it is <b>disqualified holds</b> that <b>the manner of</b> its <b>consumption</b> is <b>not in such</b> a manner. Accordingly, this type of <i>piggul</i> intent does not render the offering <i>piggul</i>. <b>And the manner of</b> its <b>burning</b> is also <b>not in such</b> a manner, <b>and</b> consequently <b>it is like a meal offering</b> whose handful <b>was not burned</b> properly, and is therefore disqualified. <b>And</b> finally, <b>the one who says</b> that <b>all agree</b> it is <b>fit holds</b> that <b>the manner of</b> its <b>burning</b> is <b>in such</b> a manner, and therefore the burning was performed properly, <b>but the manner of</b> its <b>consumption</b> is <b>not in such</b> a manner, which means that the <i>piggul</i> intent is inconsequential.
§ So <b>say</b>

Daf 17a

<b>the sharp</b> people in the city <b>of Pumbedita: Burning renders burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> e.g., burning the handful with the intent to burn the frankincense the next day renders the meal offering <i>piggul</i>. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>one does not render</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i> with</b> intent occurring during the sacrifice of <b>half of a permitting factor,</b> e.g., when sacrificing the handful alone with intent of <i>piggul</i>. The reason is that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>where he had intent during</b> the sacrifice of the handful to consume <b>the remainder</b> the next day, <b>and</b> the <b>frankincense stands intact,</b> i.e., he had no intent with regard to it. <b>But here, when he had intent with regard to the frankincense</b> while burning the handful, <b>it is considered as though he had intent with regard to the entire permitting factor.</b>
<b>Rava said: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna, <b>as well</b> (12a): <b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, or <b>who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, <b>or to burn an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>burns</b> it on the altar, <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b> If his intent was to do so <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on account of it.</b>
Rava explains: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>burning</b> is <b>similar to these,</b> i.e., the removal of the handful, its placement in a vessel, and the conveying? Accordingly, <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>these, whether</b> one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder the next day <b>or to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, the <i>halakha</i> is that the offering is <i>piggul</i>, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>burning, whether</b> one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder <b>or to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, the offering is <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>No,</b> with regard to <b>these, whether</b> one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder <b>or to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, the offering is in fact <i>piggul</i>. But with regard to <b>burning,</b> if one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder the next day, <b>yes,</b> it is <i>piggul</i>, but if one’s intent was <b>to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, it is <b>not</b> <i>piggul</i>.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Menashya bar Gadda sat before Abaye, and</b> while he was <b>sitting he said in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Burning does not render burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> e.g., burning the handful with the intent to burn the frankincense the next day does not render the offering <i>piggul</i>. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> in the mishna that one <b>renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> through intent <b>during</b> the sacrifice of <b>half</b> of <b>a permitting factor,</b> e.g., when sacrificing the handful but not the frankincense with intent of <i>piggul</i>.
Rav Menashya bar Gadda explains that the reason is that <b>this statement</b> of Rabbi Meir applies only <b>where he had intent during</b> the sacrifice of the handful to consume <b>the remainder</b> the next day, <b>as the handful</b> is <b>their permitting factor. But here, as the handful is not a permitting factor of the frankincense,</b> the offering <b>cannot be rendered <i>piggul</i> through it.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Menashya: <b>Answer me, my Master,</b> did Rav Ḥisda state this <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of Rav?</b> Rav Menashya <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes.</b> The Gemara notes that it <b>was also stated</b> explicitly that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Burning does not render burning <i>piggul</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Ya’akov bar Idi said in the name of Abaye: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav: If <b>one slaughtered one of the lambs</b> with the intent <b>to partake of it the next day, that</b> lamb is <b><i>piggul</i> and the other</b> lamb is <b>fit.</b> If he slaughtered one lamb with the intent <b>to partake of the other the next day, both</b> lambs <b>are fit. What is the reason?</b> Is it <b>not due to the fact that since</b> the first lamb <b>is not a permitting factor of</b> the second lamb, <b>it cannot render</b> the second lamb <b><i>piggul</i>?</b> The same reasoning should apply to the case of the handful and frankincense.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No;</b> there is a difference between these cases. <b>It is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the mishna, that one lamb cannot render the other <i>piggul</i>, <b>as it was not fixed in one vessel</b> with the other lamb, and therefore each animal stands independent of the other. <b>But here, as</b> the handful and frankincense <b>were fixed in one vessel</b> for the purpose of offering them, <b>they are considered like one</b> item and one of them therefore renders the other <i>piggul</i>.
§ <b>Rav Hamnuna said: Rabbi Ḥanina helped me internalize this</b> following <b>matter, and to me it is equivalent to all</b> the rest of <b>my learning,</b> as it contains a significant novelty: If <b>one burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to burn</b> the <b>frankincense</b> the next day, <b>and</b> burned the <b>frankincense</b> with the intent <b>to partake of</b> the <b>remainder the next day,</b> the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is Rabbi Ḥanina <b>teaching us? If</b> he <b>is teaching us</b> that <b>burning renders burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> then <b>let him</b> simply <b>say:</b> If one <b>burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to burn</b> the <b>frankincense,</b> the offering is <i>piggul</i>. <b>If</b> he <b>is teaching us</b> that one <b>renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> through intent <b>during</b> the sacrifice of <b>half of a permitting factor,</b> then <b>let him say:</b> If one <b>burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to partake of</b> the <b>remainder the next day,</b> the offering is <i>piggul</i>. <b>If</b> he <b>is coming</b> to <b>teach us both of</b> these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>let him say:</b> If one <b>burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to burn</b> the <b>frankincense or to partake of</b> the <b>remainder the next day,</b> the offering is <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>holds</b> that <b>burning does not render burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> and therefore if one burned only the handful with the intent to burn the frankincense the next day, the offering is not <i>piggul</i>. <b>And</b> he also holds that one <b>does not render</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> through intent <b>during</b> the sacrifice of <b>half of a permitting factor,</b> and consequently if one burned only the handful with the intent to partake of the remainder the next day, the offering is not <i>piggul</i> either. <b>But</b> it <b>is different here, as intent</b> of <i>piggul</i> has <b>extended over the entire meal offering,</b> as he had intent of <i>piggul</i> during the burning of the handful with regard to the frankincense and during the burning of the frankincense with regard to the remainder.
The Gemara relates that <b>a <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yitzḥak bar Abba:</b> If <b>one burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to partake of</b> the <b>remainder</b> the next day, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But don’t</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> in the mishna with regard to this very case? <b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> as although the Rabbis hold that such intent does not render an offering <i>piggul</i>, they concede that it disqualifies the offering.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if one must emend the <i>baraita</i>, <b>let him say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>It is <i>piggul</i>, and</b> that <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara responds: It is reasonable that the <b><i>tanna</i> taught</b> that <b>everyone agrees,</b> and that he accidentally <b>exchanged</b> the word <b><i>piggul</i> for disqualified.</b> But <b>he would not confuse</b> the phrase: <b>This is</b> the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>with</b> the phrase: <b>Everyone agrees.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to consume</b>, beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>not consume</b> it, i.e., the handful, <b>or to burn,</b> beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>not burn</b> it on the altar, i.e., the remainder of the meal offering, the meal offering is <b>fit. Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>unfit,</b> although it is not <i>piggul</i>, and consuming it is therefore not punishable by excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].
In the case of one who removes a handful from the meal offering with the intent <b>to consume,</b> beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>consume</b> it, <b>or to burn,</b> beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>burn</b> it on the altar, but his intent was to consume or burn improperly <b>less than an olive-bulk,</b> the offering is <b>fit.</b> If his intent was both <b>to consume half an olive-bulk and to burn half an olive-bulk</b> beyond its designated time, the meal offering is nevertheless <b>fit, because eating and burning do not join together.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the intention to consume, beyond its designated time, an item that is not usually consumed renders the meal offering unfit? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to consuming an offering after its designated time: <b>“And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is at all consumed [<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), repeating for emphasis the term for consumption. He derives from the repeated term that <b>the verse is speaking of two</b> types of <b>consumption: One</b> is <b>the consumption</b> of the offering <b>by a person,</b> e.g., by the priests or the owner of the offering, <b>and</b> the other <b>one is the consumption</b> of the sacrificial portions <b>by</b> their being burned on the <b>altar.</b> This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> one’s improper <b>intention with regard to the consumption of a person</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>so too,</b> one’s improper <b>intention with regard to the consumption of</b> the <b>altar</b> renders the offering unfit.
<b>And</b> furthermore, this serves to tell you that <b>just as</b> one’s improper <b>intention</b> that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption by a person</b> will be <b>consumed</b> on the following day <b>by a person</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>and</b> one’s improper <b>intention</b> that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption of</b> the <b>altar</b> will be <b>consumed</b> on the following day <b>by</b> the <b>altar</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>so too,</b> one’s improper <b>intention</b> that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption by a person</b> will be <b>consumed on</b> the <b>altar</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>and</b> one’s improper intention that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption of</b> the <b>altar</b> will be <b>consumed</b> on the following day <b>by a person</b> renders the offering unfit.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this derivation? It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> the <b>burning</b> of the offering <b>using the language of consumption.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer, maintain the following: <b>This</b> fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> the burning of the offering <b>using the language of consumption</b>

Daf 17b

demonstrates <b>that there is no difference if one expresses his intention using the language of: Consumption on</b> the <b>altar, and there is no difference if one expresses his intention using the language of: Burning on</b> the <b>altar.</b> Therefore, if the priest removed the handful from the meal offering while expressing the intention that it should be burned on the altar on the following day, whether this intention was phrased as: Consumed on the altar, or: Burned on the altar, the offering is <i>piggul</i>.
<b>Alternatively,</b> the doubled expression serves to teach that <b>just as</b> one renders the offering <i>piggul</i> only when one’s intention involves the <b>consumption of an olive-bulk,</b> as this is the minimal measure for an act to be considered eating, <b>so too,</b> one renders the offering <i>piggul</i> only when one’s intention involves the <b>burning of an olive-bulk. But actually,</b> the expression for <b>consumption</b> found in the verse <b>indicates</b> consuming it <b>in the usual manner,</b> and therefore an offering is rendered unfit only if one’s improper intention involved consuming an item that is usually consumed, or burning an item that is usually burned.
<b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> respond? He would say that <b>if that were so,</b> that the verse intends to teach only that <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> either: <b>If <i>he’akhol he’akhol</i>, or: If <i>ye’akhel ye’akhel</i>,</b> repeating the same form of the word twice. <b>What</b> is the reason that the verse states <b>“<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>,”</b> employing both repetition and variation? <b>Learn from</b> this formulation <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i>. One, as the Rabbis explain, is that the offering is rendered unfit whether one uses an expression of consumption or an expression of burning, provided that one’s intention is with regard to at least an olive-bulk. The second is that the offering is rendered unfit if one intends to burn on the altar an item that is usually consumed by a person, or to consume an item that is usually burned on the altar.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi: But if the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer is due to that</b> derivation, and he understands that the verse equates the improper intent to consume an item that is usually consumed with the improper intent to consume an item that is usually burned, then <b>let one also be liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for consuming an offering brought with intention to consume, after its designated time, the part of the offering that is burned, or for intention to burn, after its designated time, an item that is usually consumed. Why does Rabbi Eliezer state only that the offering is rendered unfit? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> Rabbi Eliezer does hold that one who consumes such an offering is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, that is difficult: <b>But aren’t you the one who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Rabbi Eliezer concedes that</b> doing so is <b>not punishable by <i>karet</i>?</b>
Rav Asi <b>said to him: It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i> as to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. There is one who says</b> that Rabbi Eliezer deems the offering to be <b>unfit by Torah law</b> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. It was in accordance with this opinion that Rabbi Yoḥanan cited the proof from the verse. <b>And there is one who says</b> that Rabbi Eliezer deems the offering to be <b>unfit by rabbinic law,</b> and it was in accordance with this opinion that Rabbi Yoḥanan said that according to Rabbi Eliezer there is no punishment of <i>karet</i> for this transgression.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who slaughters the offering</b> with the intention <b>to drink</b> some <b>of its blood,</b> which is designated to be presented on the altar, <b>on the next day,</b> or <b>to burn</b> some <b>of its meat,</b> which is meant to be eaten, <b>on the next day,</b> or <b>to eat</b> some <b>of its sacrificial portions,</b> which are designated to be burned on the altar, <b>on the next day,</b> the offering is <b>fit,</b> as his intention is either to eat an item that is usually sacrificed on the altar, or to burn on the altar an item that is usually eaten. <b>But Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the offering <b>unfit.</b> If one slaughters the offering with the intention <b>to leave</b> some <b>of its blood for the next day,</b> but not to present it or consume it, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the offering <b>unfit. Rabbi Elazar said: Even in this</b> case <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the offering <b>unfit, and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>fit.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that the offering is unfit even if he intends only to leave the blood for the next day, but not present it or consume it? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, now</b> consider: <b>And if there, where</b> the priest <b>expresses his intention using the language of consumption, the Rabbis</b> nevertheless <b>deem</b> the offering <b>fit,</b> despite the fact that if he had used this expression with regard to the portion burned on the altar, the offering would be <i>piggul</i>, is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that <b>here,</b> when he intends only to leave the blood until the next day, the offering should be fit?
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that Rabbi Yehuda’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. And</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Even in this</b> case <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the offering <b>unfit, and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>fit.</b> If Rabbi Yehuda’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, then the explanation of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion <b>is</b> identical to that of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and there does not appear to be any disagreement between the two.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> so that the difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yehuda is with regard to liability for <b><i>karet</i>?</b> The difference lies in <b>that Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that if one’s intention is <b>to leave</b> the blood for the next day, then according to Rabbi Eliezer the offering is <b>only</b> rendered <b>unfit,</b> whereas <b>in those</b> cases listed in the mishna, such as where one’s intention is to eat the sacrificial portions on the next day, he would be <b>liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> as well. And Rabbi Elazar comes to say</b> that according to Rabbi Eliezer, both in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> for it.</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> it may be <b>that everyone agrees</b> that according to Rabbi Eliezer in a case where one’s intention is to eat, after its designated time, an item that is usually burned, or to burn an item that is usually eaten, <b>there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And here</b> there are <b>three disputes with regard to the matter. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer <b>disagree</b> only <b>in those</b> cases, with regard to whether the offering is rendered unfit due to the intention to eat an item that is usually burned or to burn an item that is usually eaten. But with regard <b>to leaving</b> of its blood until the next day, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the offering is <b>fit.</b>

Daf 18a

<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer <b>disagree</b> only <b>in those</b> cases, where one’s intention is to drink the blood or burn the meat of the offering. In those cases, the Rabbis deem the offering fit, since the improper intention involves making use of the item in an unusual manner. But if one’s intention is <b>to leave</b> of its blood until the next day, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the offering is <b>unfit. What is the reason</b> for this? It is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> disqualifying the offering when <b>some of its blood</b> is left over until the next day <b>due to</b> the concern that a priest may intend to leave over <b>all of its blood, and</b> if one’s intention is to leave <b>all of its blood</b> until the next day, the offering is rendered <b>unfit by Torah law.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Do you not concede to me that if he left</b> the blood <b>until the next day</b> without presenting it, <b>that</b> the offering is <b>unfit?</b> Therefore, if <b>he intended to leave</b> the blood <b>until the next day,</b> it is <b>also unfit.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Elazar comes to say</b> that <b>even in this</b> case <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the offering <b>unfit and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>fit,</b> as there is no distinction between a case where one intended to drink of the blood on the next day and where one intended to merely leave the blood until the next day.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that if one’s intention is <b>to leave</b> some <b>of the blood until the next day, everyone agrees</b> that the offering is <b>unfit? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When I went to Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua to clarify my knowledge, and some say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: When I went <b>to clarify the knowledge of,</b> i.e., study under, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua, I found Yosef the Babylonian sitting before</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua. <b>And</b> every ruling that Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua taught <b>was especially dear to him, until</b> they began discussing <b>one</b> <i>halakha</i>, when Yosef the Babylonian <b>said to him: My teacher,</b> with regard to <b>one who slaughters the offering</b> with the intention <b>to leave</b> some <b>of its blood for the next day, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>said to him:</b> The offering is <b>fit.</b> Yosef the Babylonian repeated this question that <b>evening,</b> and Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>said to him</b> that the offering is <b>fit.</b> He asked again the following <b>morning,</b> and Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>said to him</b> that the offering is <b>fit.</b> Once again, he asked this question at <b>noon,</b> and Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>said to him</b> that the offering is <b>fit.</b> When he asked the question a further time that late <b>afternoon,</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>said to him:</b> I hold that the offering is <b>fit, but Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>unfit. Yosef the Babylonian’s face lit up [<i>tzahavu panav</i>]</b> with joy.
Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>said to him: Yosef, it seems to me that our,</b> i.e., my, <b><i>halakhot</i> were not accurate until now,</b> when I said that the offering is fit. Yosef the Babylonian <b>said to him: My teacher, yes,</b> I agree that the offering is fit, as you said. <b>But</b> my reluctance to accept your statement was due to the fact <b>that Rabbi Yehuda taught me</b> that the offering is <b>unfit, and I went around to all of</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s <b>disciples, seeking another</b> disciple who had also heard this from him, <b>but I could not find</b> one, and thought that I must have been mistaken. <b>Now that you have taught me</b> that Rabbi Eliezer deems it <b>unfit, you have returned to me that which I had lost.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Upon hearing this, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua’s eyes streamed with tears,</b> and <b>he said: Happy are you, Torah scholars, for whom matters of Torah are exceedingly dear.</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>recited this verse about</b> Yosef the Babylonian: <b>“O how I love Your Torah; it is my meditation all the day”</b> (Psalms 119:97). He continued: <b>Because Rabbi Yehuda</b> is <b>the son of Rabbi Elai, and Rabbi Elai</b> is <b>the student of Rabbi Eliezer, therefore</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>taught you the mishna of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the offering is unfit.
The Gemara explains its objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>taught</b> Yosef the Babylonian that <b>all agree</b> that the offering is <b>unfit, what</b> did Yosef the Babylonian mean when he said to Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua: <b>You have returned to me that which I had lost?</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>had said to him</b> only that whether the offering is rendered unfit is subject to <b>a dispute,</b> and Yosef the Babylonian would have been taught that all agree that it is unfit.
<b>Rather, what</b> is it that Rabbi Yehuda taught Yosef the Babylonian? Did he <b>teach him</b> that the Rabbis deem the offering <b>fit and Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>unfit? If that is so, what</b> did Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua mean when he said <b>that</b> it was only <b>because</b> Rabbi Yehuda was the son of Rabbi Elai, who was the student of Rabbi Eliezer, that Rabbi Yehuda taught this <b>dispute?</b> According to Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua, <b>we too teach</b> this <b>dispute.</b> The fact that Rabbi Yehuda taught both opinions in a dispute does not require justification.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>actually,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>taught</b> Yosef the Babylonian that <b>all agree</b> that the offering is <b>unfit; and what</b> did Yosef the Babylonian mean when he said: <b>You have returned to me that which I had lost?</b> He meant <b>that</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua <b>had in any event returned to him</b> that there is <b>some</b> opinion <b>in the world</b> concerning the <b>unfitness</b> of the offering if one’s intention was to leave over the blood until the next day. His answer reassured Yosef the Babylonian that there is in fact such an opinion.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>did not pour</b> the oil onto the meal offering, or <b>did not mix</b> the oil into the meal offering, <b>or did not break</b> the loaves into pieces, <b>or did not</b> add <b>salt, or did not wave</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering or the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>, or <b>did not bring</b> the meal offering to the altar, <b>or</b> if it happened <b>that</b> the priest <b>broke</b> the meal offerings that require breaking into <b>greater pieces</b> than appropriate, <b>or did not smear</b> oil on the wafers requiring this (see Leviticus 2:4), in all these cases the meal offering is <b>fit.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it states that if one <b>did not pour</b> the oil onto the meal offering, the meal offering is fit? <b>If we say</b> that it means that <b>he did not pour</b> oil <b>at all,</b> that is difficult: Doesn’t the verse <b>write with regard to</b> the pouring of the oil that doing so is <b>indispensable? Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to a case where <b>a priest did not pour</b> the oil onto the meal offering, <b>but a non-priest</b> did pour it. The Gemara notes: <b>If so,</b> that the first clause of the mishna is understood in this manner, then the next <i>halakha</i> in the mishna: If one <b>did not mix</b> the oil into the meal offering, should <b>also</b> be understood as referring to a case where <b>a priest did not mix</b> the oil into the meal offering, <b>but a non-priest</b> did mix it, so it is fit. <b>This</b> would indicate that if one <b>did not mix</b> the oil into the meal offering <b>at all,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit.</b>

Daf 18b

The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (103b): One who volunteers to bring a meal offering of sixty-one tenths of an ephah of flour must bring a meal offering of sixty tenths of an ephah in one vessel and a meal offering of a tenth of an ephah in a second vessel, because <b>sixty</b> tenths of an ephah of flour <b>can be</b> properly <b>mixed</b> with a <i>log</i> of oil but <b>sixty-one</b> tenths <b>cannot be</b> properly <b>mixed</b> with the oil. <b>And we discussed it</b> and asked: Even <b>if</b> sixty-one tenths of an ephah <b>do not mix</b> with one <i>log</i> of oil, <b>what of it? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna here that although there is a mitzva to mix the oil into the meal offering, if <b>one did not mix</b> the oil into it, the meal offering is still <b>fit?</b>
<b>And Rabbi Zeira said</b> the following explanation: For <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing does not invalidate</b> the meal offering. Even though there is a mitzva to mix the oil and the flour <i>ab initio</i>, the meal offering is fit for sacrifice even if the oil and the flour are not mixed. <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>not suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing invalidates</b> the meal offering. This discussion demonstrates that when the mishna here says that the oil was not mixed into the meal offering, it means that it was not mixed at all. Therefore, the mishna’s statement that the meal offering is fit even if the oil was not poured should be understood as referring to a case where the oil was never poured, and not, as the Gemara inferred, as referring to a case where a non-priest poured it.
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> When the mishna states: If one <b>did not pour</b> the oil onto the meal offering, it is referring to a case where <b>a priest did not pour</b> oil onto the meal offering <b>but a non-priest</b> did pour it. When it states: If one <b>did not mix</b> the oil into the meal offering, it means <b>he did not mix</b> the oil <b>at all.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Or</b> if it happened <b>that</b> the priest <b>broke</b> the meal offerings that require breaking into <b>greater pieces [<i>pittim merubbot</i>]</b> than appropriate, the meal offering is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that it has already been stated in the mishna that if one <b>did not break</b> the loaves into pieces <b>at all</b> the meal offering is <b>fit, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that if one broke the meal offering into <b>greater pieces</b> than appropriate the meal offering is fit? The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the expression <b><i>pittin merubbot</i></b> mean? It means <b>that he increased [<i>ribba</i>]</b> the amount of the meal offering’s <b>pieces</b> by breaking the loaves into many pieces that were each smaller than an olive-bulk.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna is <b>actually</b> referring <b>literally</b> to <b>large pieces [<i>pittim merubbot</i>], and</b> it was necessary to teach this explicitly, <b>lest you say</b> that the meal offering <b>is</b> fit <b>there,</b> when the loaves are not broken, <b>since they have the status of loaves, but here, when</b> the loaves are broken into excessively large pieces and <b>no</b> longer <b>have the status of loaves,</b> as they have been broken up, <b>but</b> still <b>do not have the status of pieces,</b> as they are not the correct size, the offering is not fit. Therefore, it is necessary for the mishna to <b>teach us</b> this <i>halakha</i> explicitly.
§ Based on the Gemara’s earlier inference that when the mishna states that the meal offering is valid even if the priest did not pour the oil it is referring to a case where a non-priest did perform this action, the Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any priest who does not admit to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites has no portion in</b> the gifts of <b>the priesthood. As it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, that offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). This teaches that one who <b>admits to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> and accepts responsibility for them <b>has a portion in the priestly</b> gifts, but one <b>who does not admit to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites does not have a portion in the priestly</b> gifts.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a priest does not have a share in the priestly gifts if he does not admit to the validity of <b>these</b> rites of the presenting of the blood or the burning of the fats <b>alone,</b> which are the sacrificial rites of a slaughtered offering, as those rites are enumerated in the verse. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also <b>includes</b> one who does not admit to the validity of the <b>fifteen</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> performed by the priests?
The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: These are the rites of a meal offering, i.e., <b>the pouring</b> of oil, <b>the mixing, the breaking, the salting, the waving, the bringing</b> of the offering to the altar, <b>the removal of the handful, and the burning</b> of the handful on the altar. <b>And</b> it includes other rites as well: <b>The pinching</b> of the nape of the neck of a bird offering, <b>and the receiving</b> of the blood in a vessel, <b>and the sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>and the giving of water to a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>], and the</b> ritual of <b>breaking a heifer’s neck, and the purification of a leper, and lifting of the hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction, <b>whether inside or outside</b> the Temple. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also includes one who does not admit to the validity of these rites?
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The verse states: “Among the sons of Aaron,”</b> teaching that with regard to any sacrificial <b>rite that is entrusted to the sons of Aaron, any priest who does not admit to its</b> validity <b>does not have a portion in the priestly</b> gifts. Since the pouring of the oil is included in the list of sacrificial rites entrusted to the priests, according to Rabbi Shimon the offering should not be fit if this service was performed by a non-priest.
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Shimon is referring to <b>the meal offering of priests,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> in the mishna, the context is <b>a meal offering of an Israelite.</b> In the case of <b>a meal offering of an Israelite, which is</b> one that <b>requires the removal of a handful</b> to be burned on the altar, a verse teaches that <b>from</b> the stage of <b>the removal of the handful onward,</b> the rites performed with the meal offering are solely <b>the mitzva of</b> the members of the <b>priesthood.</b> Therefore, this verse also <b>teaches that</b> the <b>pouring</b> of the oil <b>and</b> the <b>mixing,</b> rites performed before the removal of the handful, <b>are valid</b> even if they are performed <b>by a non-priest.</b> By contrast, <b>the meal offering of priests, which is</b> one that <b>does not require the removal of a handful,</b> as the entire meal offering is burned on the altar, <b>requires</b> that <b>from the outset</b> the rites must be performed by a member of the <b>priesthood;</b> otherwise it is unfit.
<b>Rava said to him: After all,</b> in the case of <b>the meal offering of priests, from where</b> was it <b>included</b> that there is an obligation <b>to pour</b> the oil? It is derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the meal offering of an Israelite,</b> where this <i>halakha</i> is stated explicitly. Therefore, <b>just as there</b> the rite is <b>valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest, so too here,</b> the rite is <b>also valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> the discussion took place as follows: <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when the mishna teaches that a meal offering is fit if the oil was poured by a non-priest, it is referring to meal offerings <b>from which a handful is removed,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that lists the pouring of the oil as one of the rites performed by the priests, it is referring to meal offerings <b>from which a handful is not removed.</b>
<b>Rava said to him: After all,</b> in the case of meal offerings <b>from which a handful is not removed, from where was it included</b> that there is also an obligation <b>to pour</b> the oil? It is derived <b>from</b> meal offerings <b>from which a handful is removed,</b> where this <i>halakha</i> is stated explicitly. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to meal offerings from which a handful is not removed <b>is like</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to those <b>from which a handful is removed; just as there,</b> the rite is <b>valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest, so too here,</b> the rite is <b>also valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest. Rather,</b> since Rava deflected Rav Naḥman’s explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the offering is fit even if the oil was poured by a non-priest? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense upon it. And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests; and he shall remove</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:1–2). From here it is derived that <b>from the removal of the handful onward,</b> the rites of the meal offering are solely <b>the mitzva</b> of the members <b>of the priesthood.</b> Therefore, this verse also <b>teaches</b> that the <b>pouring</b> of the oil <b>and</b> the <b>mixing,</b> rites performed before the removal of the handful, <b>are valid</b> even if they are performed <b>by a non-priest.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> say in response? He would say that when it states: <b>“Aaron’s sons,</b>

Daf 19a

<b>the priests,”</b> the <b>verse is interpreted</b> as referring <b>to</b> the matter that <b>precedes it and to</b> the matter that <b>succeeds it.</b> Before mentioning the priests, the verse states the <i>halakha</i> of pouring the oil on the meal offering, and after mentioning the priests, it states the <i>halakha</i> of the removal of the handful. Therefore, a priest is required for each of these rites.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted</b> as referring <b>to</b> the matter that <b>precedes it and to</b> the matter that <b>succeeds it? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it upon the corners of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:34). The term <b>“with his finger”</b> is interpreted as referring to the term <b>“and</b> the priest <b>shall take.”</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>shall be</b> performed <b>only with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, since the term “finger,” when stated in the context of the sacrificial rites, always is referring to the finger of the right hand. The term <b>“with his finger”</b> is also interpreted as referring to the term <b>“and put it.”</b> This <b>teaches that the placing</b> of the blood on the altar <b>shall be</b> performed <b>only with</b> the <b>right</b> hand.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: But is</b> the term <b>hand stated with regard to</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood? <b>Since</b> the term <b>hand is not stated with regard to</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood, only with regard to the placement of the blood, then even if the priest <b>collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the offering is <b>fit.</b>
<b>And Abaye said:</b> Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a verse is interpreted</b> as referring <b>to</b> the matter that <b>precedes it and to</b> the matter that <b>succeeds it.</b> The Rabbis hold that the term “with his finger” is referring to both to the term “and the priest shall take” that precedes it, and the term “and put it” that succeeds it. <b>And Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that a verse <b>is interpreted</b> as referring <b>to</b> the matter that <b>succeeds it, but is not interpreted</b> as referring <b>to</b> the matter that <b>precedes it.</b> In that case, Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that the pouring of oil must be performed by a priest can no longer be ascribed to the opinion that the phrase “Aaron’s sons, the priests” should be interpreted as referring to the description of pouring the oil that precedes it.
<b>Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon:</b> The verse states: “And he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense upon it. <b>And he shall bring it</b> to Aaron’s sons, the priests” (Leviticus 2:1–2). He therefore employs the principle that the conjunction “and,” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i>, adds to the previous matter,</b> demonstrating that the rite of the pouring of the oil is to be performed by Aaron’s sons, the priests.
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter? If that is so,</b> then this would pose a problem with regard to that <b>which is written: “And he shall slaughter the bull</b> before the Lord, <b>and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sacrifice the blood and sprinkle the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5). The Sages infer from here that <b>from</b> the stage of the sacrificing of the blood, which begins with the <b>collection</b> of the blood, <b>and onward, it is the mitzva</b> exclusively of members <b>of</b> the <b>priesthood.</b> By inference, this <b>teaches that</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the offering, which is performed earlier, is <b>valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest. If according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter,</b> if the <b>slaughter</b> of the offering is performed <b>by a non-priest,</b> it <b>should also be unfit.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to the slaughter of an offering, it <b>is different, as</b> earlier <b>the verse states: “And he shall place</b> his hands upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. <b>And he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:4–5), associating the placing of the hands on the head of an offering, which is performed by the owner of the animal, with the slaughter of the offering. Therefore, <b>just as the placing of the hands</b> on the offering is performed <b>by non-priests, so too,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the offering is performed <b>by non-priests.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> there is a juxtaposition of the placing of the hands and the slaughter of the animals, why not also say that <b>just as the placing of the hands</b> on the offering is performed only <b>by the owner</b> of the animal, <b>so too,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the offering may be performed only <b>by the owner</b> of the animal? The Gemara answers: <b>You cannot say that,</b> due to <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> of the sprinkling of the blood: <b>And just as the sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>which is the essential</b> rite that enables the one who brings the offering to achieve <b>atonement, does not require</b> the <b>owner</b> to perform it, as the priests perform this rite on his behalf, with regard to the <b>slaughter</b> of the offering, <b>which is not the essential</b> rite that enables the one who brings the offering to achieve <b>atonement,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear that it does not need to be performed by the owner?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>one cannot derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> and the owner may not sprinkle the blood as he is not a priest, but he may still be obligated to slaughter the animal, as this rite may be performed by a non-priest, <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah <b>in</b> the context of the <b>Yom Kippur</b> service with regard to the High Priest: <b>“And he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). <b>By inference,</b> from the fact that the verse specifies that here the High Priest, who is the owner of the offering, must perform the slaughter, it is clear <b>that usually</b> the <b>slaughter does not require</b> the participation of the <b>owner.</b>
§ Apropos the mishna’s list of rites that are not indispensable for the meal offering, the Gemara explains that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> sacrificial rite <b>where</b> the term <b>law and statute are stated,</b> they are stated <b>only to</b> teach that the absence of the performance of that rite <b>invalidates</b> the offering. The Gemara comments: <b>It enters our mind</b> to say that the <b>two</b> terms are both <b>required</b> for this principle to be in effect, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a red heifer: <b>“This is the statute of the law”</b> (Numbers 19:2).
Before continuing its discussion of this principle, the Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the questions that follow: <b><i>Nun</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>tzadi</i>; <i>yod</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>lamed</i>.</b> They represent: Nazirite; thanks offering [<i>toda</i>]; leper [<i>metzora</i>]; Yom Kippur; offerings [<i>korbanot</i>]; meal offering [<i>minḥa</i>]; shewbread [<i>leḥem hapanim</i>].
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of the offering of <b>a nazirite, about which it is written only “law,”</b> as the verse states: “This is the law of the nazirite who vows, and of his offering to the Lord for his naziriteship, beside that for which his means suffice; according to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his naziriteship” (Numbers 6:21), <b>and</b> yet <b>Rav says</b> that the lack of <b>waving of</b> the offering by <b>a nazirite invalidates</b> the offering? The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, since it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“So he must do,”</b> and therefore <b>it is considered as if</b> the term <b>statute were written with regard to it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of the <b>thanks offering, about which it is written only “law,”</b> as the verse states: “This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:11), <b>and we learn</b> in a mishna (27a) that with regard to the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>thanks offering is different, since it is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to</b> the offering of <b>a nazirite; as it is written</b> in a verse describing the thanks offering: <b>“With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), instead of simply stating: The sacrifice of his thanks offering. <b>And the Master says:</b> The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of <b>the peace offering of</b> the <b>nazirite,</b> to teach that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to both.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of the offering of <b>a leper, about which it is written only “law,”</b> as the verse states: “This shall be the law of the leper” (Leviticus 14:2), <b>and we learn</b> in a mishna (27a) that with regard to the <b>four species that</b> are used <b>in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper,</b> i.e., cedar, hyssop, scarlet wool, and birds, failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, since it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper.”</b> Due to the added emphasis of the term “shall be,” it is <b>considered as if</b> the term <b>statute were written with regard to it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of <b>Yom Kippur, about which it is written only “statute,”</b> as the verse states: “And it shall be a statute for you forever” (Leviticus 16:29), <b>and we learn</b> in a mishna (27a) that with regard to <b>the two goats of Yom Kippur,</b> the absence of <b>each</b> goat <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other? Rather,</b> it must be that Rav meant that wherever <b>either</b> the term <b>law or</b> the term <b>statute</b> is employed, this signifies that the rite is an indispensable requirement.
The Gemara questions this understanding of Rav’s statement: <b>But</b> what of <b>the rest of the offerings, as</b> the term <b>“law” is written with regard to them, and</b> yet failure to perform all of their different rites <b>does not invalidate</b> those offerings? The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37). The Gemara answers: When the term <b>law</b> appears, it is still <b>necessary</b> for the term <b>statute</b> to appear, in order to teach that failure to perform the rites invalidates the offering. <b>But</b> when the term <b>statute</b> appears, it is <b>not necessary</b> for the term <b>law</b> to appear as well. The term statute is sufficient.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But doesn’t</b> Rav <b>say:</b> Wherever the terms <b>law and statute</b> appear? Apparently, both are necessary for his principle to apply. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what Rav <b>is saying: Even</b> in a context <b>where</b> the term <b>law is written, if</b> the term <b>statute is written</b> as well, then <b>yes,</b> failure to perform the rites invalidates the offering; <b>but if</b> the term statute does <b>not</b> accompany the term law, then failure to perform the rites does <b>not</b> invalidate the offering.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> what of the <b>meal offering, as</b> the term <b>“statute” is written with regard to it,</b> as the verse states: “Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a statute forever” (Leviticus 6:11), <b>and</b> yet <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> sacrificial rite of <b>the law of the meal offering that the verse repeats,</b> as the details of the meal offering are discussed in Leviticus, chapter 2, and again in Leviticus, chapter 6, it is repeated <b>only to</b> teach that the failure to perform that rite <b>invalidates</b> the offering? Doesn’t this demonstrate that where the verse <b>repeated</b> the command, then <b>yes,</b> failure to perform the rite invalidates the offering; but if the verse <b>did not repeat</b> it, then failure to perform the rite does <b>not</b> invalidate the offering, whether or not the term statute appears?
The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as when</b> the term <b>statute is written, it is written with regard to the eating</b> of the meal offering rather than with regard to the sacrificial rites.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of <b>the shewbread, where when</b> the term <b>statute is written, it is written with regard to the eating</b> of the shewbread, as the verse states: “And they shall eat it in a holy place, for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, a perpetual statute” (Leviticus 24:9), <b>and we learn</b> in the mishna (27a): With regard to <b>the two arrangements</b> of the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the arrangements <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the arrangements <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>and the bowls</b> of frankincense, failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>anywhere that</b> the term statute <b>is written with regard to eating, it is written with regard to the entire matter,</b> i.e., all the <i>halakhot</i> of the offering, and teaches that failure to perform the rites invalidates the offering.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to the meal offering, it <b>is different,</b> and it is only the rites that are repeated that are indispensable, <b>as the verse states: “Of its groats, and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:16), rather than simply: Of the groats and oil,

Daf 19b

teaching that the <b>groats and oil are indispensable, and nothing else is indispensable,</b> despite the fact that the term statute appears.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> sacrificial <b>rite of the meal offering that the verse in the Torah repeats,</b> it is repeated <b>only to</b> teach that the failure to perform that rite <b>invalidates</b> the offering. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> Only the <b>groats and oil are indispensable, and nothing else is indispensable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Shmuel,</b> is it true that <b>even though</b> a rite of the meal offering is <b>repeated</b> in another <b>verse he does not deem it indispensable?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Shmuel must agree that <b>wherever the verse repeats</b> a rite it is <b>certainly</b> understood to be <b>indispensable; and here,</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the expressions <b>“his handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2) and <b>“with his hand”</b> (Leviticus 6:8). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And he shall remove <b>his handful,”</b> and elsewhere it states: “And he shall take up from it <b>with his hand.”</b> The change in terminology between the two verses teaches <b>that</b> the priest <b>should not</b> use a utensil to <b>measure an amount for the handful</b> of a meal offering, but should use his hand.
<b>Rav holds</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> of using one’s hand and not a utensil is <b>also repeated</b> in another <b>verse, as it is written</b> in the context of Aaron’s service on the eighth day of the consecration of the Tabernacle: <b>“And he presented the meal offering; and he filled his hand from it”</b> (Leviticus 9:17), demonstrating that the handful is removed by hand and not with a utensil. <b>And Shmuel</b> holds that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> for all <b>generations from a temporary</b> situation. Therefore, using one’s hand is not indispensable, as the general requirements of the rites of the meal offering cannot be derived from a verse referring to the meal offering that was sacrificed during the consecration of the Tabernacle.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Shmuel not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> for all <b>generations from a temporary</b> situation? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 88a): Service <b>vessels</b> used for <b>the liquids sanctify</b> only <b>the liquids</b> placed in them, <b>and</b> service vessels used to <b>measure dry</b> substances <b>sanctify</b> only <b>the dry</b> substances that are placed in them. <b>But</b> service <b>vessels</b> used for <b>the liquids do not sanctify the dry</b> substances placed in them, <b>and</b> service vessels used to <b>measure dry</b> substances <b>do not sanctify the liquids</b> placed in them.
<b>And Shmuel says</b> concerning this mishna: <b>They taught</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to service vessels used to <b>measure</b> liquids, e.g., wine or oil. <b>But cups,</b> which are used for collecting the blood of offerings, <b>sanctify</b> dry substances placed in them as well, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the offerings of the princes during the inauguration of the Tabernacle: “One silver cup of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary; <b>both of them full of fine flour</b> mingled with oil for a meal offering” (Numbers 7:13), indicating that the cups were also fashioned for use with flour, a dry substance. In this case, Shmuel does derive the general <i>halakha</i> from a temporary situation, in this case the offerings of the princes.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to the offering of the princes, it <b>is different, as the verse is repeated twelve times,</b> once with regard to each and every prince. Therefore, Shmuel derives a <i>halakha</i> for all generations from it. Nevertheless, generally speaking, the <i>halakha</i> for all generations cannot be derived from a temporary situation.
The Gemara returns to discussing Rav’s statement that a rite is deemed indispensable if it is repeated in the verses. <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: But</b> what of <b>bringing</b> the meal offering to the corner of the altar, <b>which</b> is <b>repeated</b> in <b>the verse,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall bring it to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8); <b>and</b> it is <b>not indispensable,</b> as stated in the mishna (18a)? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Where is it repeated? As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord,</b> in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7).
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is not a repetition of the mitzva for the priest to bring the meal offering to the corner of the altar; rather, it <b>comes</b> only <b>to establish the place for</b> the meal offering and describe where it should be brought. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And this is the law of the meal offering. The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord, in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). From the phrase: <b>“Before the Lord,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the meal offering must be brought <b>on the western</b> side of the altar, which faces the Sanctuary and is therefore “before the Lord.” Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In front of the altar,”</b> which is its southern side, where the priests ascend the ramp.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> the verse had merely stated: <b>In front of the altar,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the meal offering is brought only <b>on the southern</b> side of the altar, as just mentioned. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Before the Lord,”</b> which indicates the western side. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The <i>baraita</i> answers: The priest <b>brings it</b> near <b>on the southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the edge of the corner</b> of the altar, <b>and</b> that will <b>suffice for him.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the verse presents the priest with the option that <b>he may bring it on the western side of</b> the <b>corner or on the southern side of</b> the <b>corner. You say</b> the following principle: <b>Any</b> time <b>you find two verses, one</b> of which <b>fulfills itself and fulfills the other, and one</b> of which <b>fulfills itself and negates the other, we set aside</b> the verse <b>that fulfills itself and negates the other, and we seize</b> the verse <b>that fulfills itself and fulfills the other.</b>
He explains: <b>As, when you say</b> to bring the meal offering <b>“before the Lord,”</b> which indicates that it shall be brought <b>on the western</b> side, <b>you have nullified</b> the other part of the verse, which states to bring it <b>“in front of the altar,”</b> which is <b>on the southern</b> side. <b>But when you say</b> to bring the meal offering <b>“in front of the altar”</b> and offer it <b>on the southern</b> side, <b>you have</b> also <b>fulfilled</b> the other part of the verse, which states to bring it <b>“before the Lord.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if one brought the meal offering on the southern side, <b>where have you fulfilled:</b> “Before the Lord”? <b>Rav Ashi said: This <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>the entire altar stood in the northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard. The southern side of the altar was aligned with the midpoint of the Temple courtyard, opposite the Holy of Holies, directly before the Lord. In any event, it can be seen in this <i>baraita</i> that the purpose of the verse: “The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar” is to establish the precise location where the meal offering is brought, and it does not serve as a repetition.
The Gemara cites another objection to Rav’s statement that a rite of the meal offering is deemed indispensable if it is repeated in the verses. <b>Rav Huna objects to this: But</b> what of the placement of the <b>salt</b> on the handful of the meal offering before it is burned, <b>which</b> is <b>not repeated</b> in <b>the verse, and</b> yet it is still <b>indispensable in its</b> sacrifice? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“It is an everlasting covenant of salt”</b> (Numbers 18:19), teaching <b>that there will be</b>

Daf 20a

<b>a covenant stated with regard to salt,</b> ensuring that the offerings should always be salted; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: It is stated here: “It is an everlasting covenant of salt”</b> (Numbers 18:19), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the reward given to Pinehas: <b>“The covenant of an everlasting priesthood”</b> (Numbers 25:13). This teaches that <b>just as it is impossible for the offerings</b> to be sacrificed <b>without</b> the involvement of the <b>priesthood, so too, it is impossible for the offerings</b> to be sacrificed <b>without salt.</b> The <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that the rite of salting is an indispensable requirement, despite the fact that the rite is not repeated in the verses.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Rav,</b> who holds that the only sacrificial rites that are indispensable are the ones repeated in the verses, <b>holds in accordance with the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>who says:</b> If one <b>did not</b> add <b>salt,</b> the meal offering is still <b>fit.</b> According to this <i>tanna</i>, adding salt is not indispensable. <b>Abaye said to him: If that is so</b> and you understand the mishna to be referring to a case where no salt is added at all, then you should <b>also</b> understand the mishna’s statement: If one <b>did not pour</b> the oil, as referring to a case where he <b>did not pour</b> oil <b>at all.</b> This cannot be, as the rite of pouring oil is repeated in the verses and is clearly indispensable. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to a case where <b>a priest did not pour</b> oil onto the meal offering, <b>but a non-priest</b> did pour the oil. <b>Here too,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna means only that <b>a priest did not</b> add <b>salt, but a non-priest</b> did add salt. If no salt is added, even this <i>tanna</i> holds that the meal offering is unfit.
Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>But could it enter your mind that a non-priest would approach</b> the <b>altar</b> to salt the handful of the meal offering? A non-priest may not enter the area near the altar. Since it is not conceivable that this would take place, it must be that when ruling that the meal offering is fit, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna is referring to a case where the salt was never added.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Rav holds that <b>since</b> with regard to the application of salt, the term <b>“covenant” is written about it, it is considered as though it were repeated in</b> another <b>verse,</b> as the term “covenant” teaches that it is an indispensable rite.
With regard to the question that was raised to challenge the statement of Rav, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it correct that the application of salt <b>is not repeated in the verse? But isn’t it written: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt”</b> (Leviticus 2:13)? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse does not function as a repetition, since it is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>stated</b> only: And every <b>offering</b> you shall season <b>with salt, I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to even the <b>wood and</b> the <b>blood, which are</b> also <b>termed: An offering.</b>
To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b> “And every <b>meal offering</b> of yours,” to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>meal offering is unique</b> in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it,</b> as the wood is required for the burning of the handful of the meal offering, <b>so too any</b> item that is unique in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it</b> requires the application of salt. By contrast, the wood and the blood do not require salting, as the wood itself requires no wood, and the blood is presented on the altar and does not require wood.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> that logic is employed, one could say: <b>Just as</b> the handful of the <b>meal offering</b> that is burned <b>is unique</b> in <b>that it permits</b> the remainder of the meal offering to be eaten by the priests, and it requires salting, <b>so too, any</b> item that is unique in <b>that it permits</b> other items requires the application of salt. Accordingly, <b>I will include blood</b> in the obligation to be salted, <b>as</b> its presentation <b>permits</b> the offering to be sacrificed and eaten. To counter this, the continuation of <b>the verse states:</b> “Neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking <b>from your meal offering,”</b> demonstrating that it cannot be lacking from the meal offering, <b>but not from your blood.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the entire meal offering requires salting,</b> including the remainder of the offering that is eaten by the priests. To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b> “And every meal <b>offering [<i>korban</i>]</b> of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13), teaching that the handful, which is burned as <b>an offering [<i>korban</i>]</b> on the altar, <b>requires salting, but the entire meal offering [<i>minḥa</i>] does not require salting.</b>
<b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>the handful of a meal offering</b> requires salting. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the frankincense,</b> which is also burned on the altar, in the requirement to be salted? <b>I include the frankincense due to</b> the fact <b>that it comes along with</b> the handful <b>in one vessel</b> and is therefore included in the expression “offering.”
<b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> in the requirement to be salted <b>the frankincense that comes by itself</b> as a separate offering? One may accept the obligation to bring an offering of frankincense to be burned on the altar. From where is it derived that this frankincense requires salting? Moreover, from where is it derived to include in the requirement to be salted the <b>frankincense that comes in bowls</b> together with the shewbread, <b>and the incense?</b>
Moreover, from where is it derived in the requirement of salting in the case of the meal offerings from which a handful is not removed, i.e., <b>the meal offering of priests, and the meal offering of the anointed priest</b> that is brought every day by the High Priest, <b>and the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations</b> brought with burnt offerings and peace offerings? From where is it derived in the requirement of salting with regard to <b>the sacrificial portions of the sin offering</b> consumed on the altar, <b>and the sacrificial portions of the guilt offering, and the sacrificial portions of the offerings of the most sacred order, and the sacrificial portions of the offerings of lesser sanctity, and the limbs of the burnt offering, and the bird burnt offering? From where</b> is it derived that all these require salting?
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall sacrifice salt with all your offerings”</b> (Leviticus 2:13), demonstrating that everything burned on the altar requires salting. From this <i>baraita</i>, it is apparent that the mitzva to apply salt is necessary in order to teach about the circumstances where salt is added, and therefore it cannot be used as an instance where the mitzva is repeated in order to teach that the rite is indispensable.
§ The Gemara discusses the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>The Master said: I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>the handful of a meal offering</b> requires salting. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the frankincense,</b> which is also burned on the altar, in the requirement to be salted? <b>I include the frankincense, due to</b> the fact <b>that it comes along with</b> the handful <b>in one vessel</b> and therefore is included in the expression “offering.” The Gemara asks: Why is this verse needed? <b>But didn’t you state</b> earlier that <b>just as a meal offering is unique</b> in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it,</b> as the wood is required for the burning of the handful of the meal offering, so too, anything that is unique in that other items come as a requirement requires the application of salt? Therefore, it is already known that the frankincense and all the other items require salting, since wood is required for their burning.
The Gemara answers: When the <i>tanna</i> says: I have derived only that the handful of the meal offering requires salting, <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying:</b> One might understand the verse “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13) differently and <b>say</b> the following exposition: The term <b>“offering”</b> that appears here is <b>a generalization,</b> while <b>“meal offering”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> According to the hermeneutical principles, in the case of <b>a generalization and a detail, there is nothing in the generalization other than what is in the detail.</b> Therefore, in the case of <b>a meal offering, yes,</b> it requires salting, but <b>anything else</b> does <b>not</b> require salting. From where, then, is the <i>halakha</i> of salting in all other cases derived?
Therefore, the verse <b>then states:</b> “You shall sacrifice salt <b>with all your offerings”</b> (Leviticus 2:13), and <b>it then generalized</b> again, so that the verse includes <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> in which case according to the hermeneutical principles <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the specified detail,</b> i.e., the meal offering, is unique in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it, so too, anything</b> that is unique in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it</b> requires the application of salt. That is why the latter part of the verse is needed.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>What are</b> the <b>other</b> items <b>that come as a requirement for</b> the meal offering? This is referring to the <b>wood,</b> as the wood is required for the burning of the handful of the meal offering. <b>So too,</b> the expression: <b>Anything</b> that is unique in that other items come as a requirement for it, is referring to anything that requires <b>wood</b> so that it may be burned on the altar.
The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that the <b>other</b> items <b>that come as a requirement for</b> the meal offering <b>is</b> referring to the <b>frankincense,</b> which accompanies the meal offering, <b>and</b> therefore by means of the hermeneutical principle applying to a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, <b>include blood, which is</b> accompanied by <b>libations?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>libations</b> are not considered to accompany the sprinkling of the blood; rather, <b>they accompany the sacrificial portions</b> that are burned on the altar. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is because the burning of the sacrificial parts and the pouring of the libations are the <b>eating and drinking</b> of the altar. The Gemara counters: <b>On the contrary,</b> the libations are considered to accompany the blood, since the <b>atonement</b> that is effected by the presentation of the blood is followed by the <b>joy</b> that is displayed in the libation of wine.
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that since the <b>frankincense comes</b> together <b>with</b> the meal offering <b>in one vessel,</b> while the blood is not brought together with the libations in one vessel, the blood is not comparable to the meal offering. <b>But</b> when it is explained that the expression: The other items that come as a requirement for the meal offering, is referring to the <b>wood,</b> this means that <b>just as</b> the <b>meal offering is rendered fit by</b> means of the wood, <b>so too, all offerings are rendered fit by</b> means of the wood.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say: Just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail,</b> i.e., the handful of the meal offering, is clearly <b>defined as</b> an item <b>for which other</b> items <b>come as a requirement, and</b> in addition it <b>renders</b> other items <b>permitted, so too, anything</b> that is unique in <b>that other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it and renders</b> other items <b>permitted</b> requires the application of salt. <b>And what is</b> included due to this derivation? <b>Frankincense that comes in</b> the <b>bowls</b> that are placed upon the shewbread, <b>as it renders</b> the bread <b>permitted</b> to be eaten. <b>But</b> every <b>other item</b> should <b>not</b> be included.
The Gemara answers: It is apparent that all other items require only the factor of having other items come as a requirement for them to be considered similar to the meal offering. This is clear <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> in the case of blood, which is similar to the meal offering only in that it renders the offering permitted, it <b>was necessary</b> to teach that salt is not placed on blood, by means of the phrase: “Neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking <b>from your meal offering,”</b> from which it is derived: <b>But not from your blood.</b> Had it been necessary for all items to have both aspects in common with the meal offering, there would be no need for a derivation to exclude blood. <b>By inference, these</b> other items <b>derived</b> from a meal offering are similar to it <b>in one respect.</b>
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above: The verse states: “Neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking <b>from your meal offering,”</b> demonstrating that salt cannot be lacking from the meal offering, <b>but not from your blood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> since the verse does not allude to blood explicitly, why not <b>say</b> that the verse teaches that salt cannot be lacking <b>from your meal offering, but not from your limbs</b> of the burnt offering that are sacrificed on the altar?
The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that the <b>limbs</b> of a burnt offering <b>should be included</b> in the requirement to have salt applied, <b>since</b> they share many characteristics with a meal offering that blood does not. The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the characteristics that they share: <b><i>Alef</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>nun</i>; <i>tet</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>alef</i>.</b> These are a reference to others [<i>aḥerim</i>], fire [<i>ishim</i>], external [<i>baḥutz</i>], <i>notar</i>; ritual impurity [<i>tuma</i>], and misuse of consecrated property [<i>me’ila</i>].
In the case of the limbs of a burnt offering, <b>other</b> items <b>come as a requirement for it, as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering. The burnt offering requires wood in order to be burned on the altar, which is not the case with regard to the blood. The limbs of the burnt offering are burned in the <b>fire</b> of the altar, <b>as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering, whereas the blood is presented on the corners of the altar. The burnt offering is sacrificed <b>on the external</b> altar, <b>as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering, as opposed to the blood, which is presented inside the Sanctuary in the cases of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur. It is prohibited to partake of its <b>leftover [<i>notar</i>]</b> parts, <b>as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering, which is not relevant to blood.
It is prohibited to partake of a burnt offering while in a state of <b>ritual impurity, as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering, which is not relevant to blood. It is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering, which is not so with regard to the blood.

Daf 20b

The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>On the contrary, blood should be included</b> in the requirement to have salt applied, <b>since</b> it <b>renders</b> the offering <b>permitted</b> to be sacrificed and eaten, <b>as</b> is so with regard to the handful, which renders the remainder of the meal offering permitted to be eaten. In addition, blood <b>becomes invalid at sunset</b> and can no longer be sprinkled on the altar, <b>as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the handful of a meal offering, whereas the limbs of the burnt offering may be sacrificed at any point during the night. The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> characteristics shared by the meal offering and the limbs of the burnt offering are <b>more</b> than those shared by the blood and the meal offering.
§ The Gemara continues discussing the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above: Had the verse stated only: And every offering you shall season with salt, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to <b>even</b> the <b>wood and</b> the <b>blood, which are</b> also <b>termed: An offering.</b> Therefore, the verse states “and every meal offering of yours” (Leviticus 2:13), to teach that just as the meal offering is unique in that other items come as a requirement for it, so too, anything that is unique in that other items come as a requirement for it requires the application of salt. Therefore, the wood and the blood do not require salting, as in their case no other item is needed. The Gemara asks: <b>Whom did you hear who says</b> that the <b>wood is termed an offering?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. But <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, doesn’t the wood in fact <b>require salting?</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when one brings <b>a meal offering [<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1). The superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one can voluntarily give wood</b> as an offering for the altar. <b>And how much</b> wood must one bring if he does not specify an amount? <b>Two logs. And</b> the support for the fact that wood can be brought as a voluntary offering is from a verse, <b>as</b> the verse <b>states: “And we cast lots for the wood offering”</b> (Nehemiah 10:35). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This voluntary donation of <b>wood is</b> an offering like <b>a meal offering, and</b> therefore it <b>requires salt and requires bringing</b> to the corner of the altar, like a meal offering.
<b>And Rava says: According to the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>wood</b> donated in this manner <b>requires</b> the <b>removal of a handful,</b> just as in the case of a meal offering, a portion of the wood must be removed and sacrificed separately. <b>And Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, since it is an offering for the altar, the <b>wood</b> that is brought as an offering <b>needs</b> to be placed on other <b>wood</b> to burn, like any other offering that is burned on wood on the altar. Apparently, this means that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the wood is termed an offering, also holds that it requires the application of salt, in contrast to the ruling in the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>Remove wood from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>here,</b> as it is not excluded by the term “and every meal offering of yours.” The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then, the phrase in <b>the verse</b> “and every meal offering of yours” is <b>to exclude what? If</b> it serves <b>to exclude blood,</b> this is <b>derived from</b> the continuation of the verse, which states: <b>“From your meal offering,”</b> as explained in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>.

Daf 21a

The Gemara responds: <b>Wood</b> is <b>removed</b> from the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and insert</b> in its place wine <b>libations,</b> teaching that they do not require the addition of salt. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>But the wine</b> libations <b>and the blood, and the wood and the incense, do not require salt.</b>
The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> you say it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> concerning <b>wood</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> rules that wood does not require salt, whereas Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that wood does require salt. <b>If</b> you say it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> concerning <b>incense</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as they taught in the <i>baraita</i> on 20a that any item for which another item is necessary requires salt, and this includes the incense, which is burned with wood.
The Gemara suggests: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>,</b> who explains the verse that was interpreted in the <i>baraita</i> in a different manner. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> The verse states: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13). <b>Just as the specified detail,</b> i.e., the meal offering, is <b>an item that is susceptible to ritual impurity, and is brought on the fire</b> of the altar, <b>and is</b> sacrificed <b>on the external altar, so too, any item that is susceptible to ritual impurity, and is brought on the fire</b> of the altar, <b>and is</b> sacrificed <b>on the external altar</b> requires salting.
Therefore, <b>wood is excluded, as</b> it is <b>not susceptible to ritual impurity. Wine and blood are excluded, as they are not brought on the fire</b> of the altar but rather are sprinkled on the corner of the altar. The <b>incense</b> is <b>excluded, as it is</b> sacrificed <b>not on the external altar</b> but rather on the inner altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how can it be that according to all opinions, <b>the reason that</b> blood does not require salting is that <b>the verse excluded blood,</b> indicating <b>that</b> if <b>not</b> for <b>that, I would say</b> that <b>blood requires salt? Once one salts</b> the blood, <b>it exits the category of blood, as Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> With regard to <b>blood that one cooked, one does not transgress</b> the prohibition against consuming blood <b>by</b> drinking <b>it,</b> since it no longer has the status of blood that is fit to be presented on the altar. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri</b> says: With regard to <b>blood that one salted, one does not transgress</b> a prohibition <b>by</b> drinking <b>it,</b> since salted blood has the status of cooked blood.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda himself says:</b> With regard to the <b>limbs</b> of a burnt offering <b>that</b> one first <b>roasted and</b> afterward <b>brought them up</b> to the altar, <b>they do not constitute</b> fulfillment of the requirement of the verse that an offering be <b>“an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Exodus 29:25).
The Gemara answers: It is still necessary to derive that blood does not require salt, <b>lest you say</b> that the priest should <b>sprinkle any amount</b> of salt, even a minute quantity, <b>on</b> the blood, <b>merely for</b> the fulfillment of the <b>mitzva,</b> as such an amount would not render the blood as cooked. To counter this, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that blood requires no application of salt.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> With regard to <b>blood that one cooked, one does not transgress</b> a prohibition <b>by</b> drinking <b>it. Rava was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>. Abaye raised an objection to</b> him from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Karetot</i> 2:19): If <b>one curdled blood and consumed it, or</b> in a case <b>where one melted</b> forbidden <b>fat and swallowed it,</b> even though he changed its form, he is <b>liable.</b> This demonstrates that even after its form is changed, the blood’s status remains unchanged.
Rava responded: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> Ze’eiri’s statement relates to a case <b>where he curdled</b> the blood <b>by</b> means of <b>the fire,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>he curdled</b> the blood <b>by</b> means of <b>the sun.</b> Blood curdled <b>by</b> means of <b>a fire cannot return</b> to its former state, so one is not liable, whereas blood curdled <b>by</b> means of <b>the sun can return</b> to its former state, so one is liable.
Abaye objected: But <b>even</b> when blood is curdled <b>by</b> means of <b>the sun, let us say</b> that <b>since it was disqualified</b> from being presented on the altar, <b>it was disqualified,</b> i.e., excluded, from the prohibition against consuming blood; <b>as Rabbi Mani inquired of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>blood that was congealed and one ate it, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan responded: He is not liable; <b>since it was disqualified</b> from being presented on the altar, <b>it shall be disqualified</b> from the prohibition against consuming blood. Rava <b>was silent</b> and had no answer.
Abaye <b>said to him: Perhaps here</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>certainly</b> referring <b>to</b> the blood of <b>the external sin offerings,</b> which is sprinkled on the external altar in the Temple courtyard, whereas <b>there</b> Ze’eiri is referring <b>to</b> the blood of <b>the inner sin offerings,</b> which is sprinkled inside the Sanctuary.
Rava <b>said</b> to him: <b>You have reminded me of a matter, as Rabbi Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>blood that became congealed,</b> if it is blood <b>of the</b> external <b>sin offerings and one ate it,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take</b> of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, <b>and place it</b> upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25), and congealed blood <b>is suitable for taking and placing,</b> as one can take the congealed blood and place it upon the altar. By contrast, if it is blood <b>of the inner sin offerings and one ate it,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger in the blood, <b>and sprinkle</b> of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>and this</b> congealed blood <b>is not suitable for dipping and sprinkling.</b>
<b>And Rava himself says: Even</b> if there was blood <b>of the inner sin offerings and one ate it,</b> he is <b>liable, since</b> blood <b>corresponding to</b> this blood is <b>suitable</b> to be placed on the altar <b>in</b> the case of <b>the external sin offerings. Rav Pappa says: Therefore,</b> according to the same reasoning, in the case of <b>the blood of a donkey that became congealed and one ate it,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> despite the fact that a donkey’s blood is not fit to be brought as an offering, <b>since</b> blood <b>corresponding to</b> this blood <b>is suitable</b> to be placed on the altar <b>in</b> the case of <b>the external sin offerings.</b>
In the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of blood, <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says: Blood, whether moist or dry, interposes</b> during ritual immersion. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Mikvaot</i> 6:9): With regard to <b>blood, ink, honey, or milk</b> on a person’s skin, when <b>they are dry, they interpose</b> during immersion; but when <b>they are moist, they do not interpose.</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement of Rav Giddel is referring to a case <b>where</b> the blood <b>adheres</b> to the skin, as it has begun to congeal and therefore interposes. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the blood <b>did not adhere</b> and therefore does not interpose.
§ The Gemara returns to its interpretation of the verse: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13), and asks: <b>For what</b> purpose does the expression <b>“you shall season” come?</b> The Gemara answers: It is written <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Had the verse stated only: And every meal offering of yours shall be <b>with salt,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the <i>halakha</i> is <b><i>tevonehu</i>,</b> a term that will be explained in the Gemara. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall season.”</b> Conversely, <b>had</b> the verse stated only: <b>“You shall season,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this obligation can be fulfilled <b>by</b> means of adding <b>salt water.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “with salt.”</b>
The continuation of the verse: <b>“And you shall not omit [<i>tashbit</i>] salt</b> from your meal offering,” teaches that <b>one should bring salt that never rests [<i>shovetet</i>],</b> i.e., it is found continuously. <b>And what</b> type of salt <b>is this? This</b> is referring to <b>salt of Sodom. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one did not find salt of Sodom that he should bring salt of <i>istrokanit</i>,</b> which is quarried from rock? <b>The verse states</b> immediately afterward: “With all your offerings <b>you shall sacrifice</b> salt” (Leviticus 2:13), in order to emphasize that <b>you should sacrifice any</b> type of salt; <b>you should sacrifice</b> salt <b>from any place,</b> even from a location outside of Eretz Yisrael; <b>you should sacrifice</b> salt <b>even on Shabbat;</b> and <b>you should sacrifice</b> salt <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>tevonehu</i>? Rabba bar Ulla said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one should mix into it [<i>yitabonenu</i>]</b> large quantities of salt, <b>just as</b> one mixes <b>straw [<i>teven</i>] into clay. Abaye said to him: If so,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have said: <i>Yitabonenu</i>,</b> and not <i>tevonehu</i>. <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is saying that one <b>might</b> have thought <b>one should form</b> the addition of salt <b>just as</b> one builds <b>a building [<i>binyan</i>],</b> by adding layer upon layer. <b>Rava said to him: If so,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have said: He should build it [<i>yivnenu</i>]</b> and not <i>tevonehu</i>. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> states: One <b>might</b> have thought <b><i>tevonehu</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b><i>tevonehu</i>? Rav Ashi said:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one should infuse</b> the entire offering with the <b>taste</b> of salt, <b>just as understanding [<i>bina</i>]</b> infuses a person with wisdom. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “You shall season.” How does he act? He brings the limb</b> that is to be sacrificed on the altar <b>and applies salt, and then turns it over and again applies salt, and brings it up</b> to the altar.
<b>Abaye says: And</b> one acts <b>similarly</b> before placing meat <b>into a pot.</b> If one wishes to cook meat and needs to salt it in order to extract its blood, it is sufficient to apply salt to both sides and let it sit until the blood drains. Then, after it is washed, the meat is ready to be cooked and eaten.

Daf 21b

<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:4): With regard to <b>salt that is on the limb</b> of an offering, one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, but in the case of salt <b>that is on the ramp or that is on top of the altar,</b> one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And Rav Mattana said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that the salt found upon a sacrificial limb is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property? The verse states: <b>“And you shall sacrifice them before the Lord, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the Lord”</b> (Ezekiel 43:24). In this verse, the limbs, together with the salt, are termed a burnt offering, and therefore the salt on the limb is also subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property.
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that salt is not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:7): The court instituted an ordinance <b>about the salt and about the wood</b> in the Temple to the effect <b>that the priests may derive benefit from them. Shmuel says: They taught only</b> that the priests may derive benefit from the salt <b>for</b> use on <b>their offerings, but not for eating</b> it.
The Gemara comments: <b>It enters our mind</b> to say: <b>What</b> did Shmuel mean by the expression: <b>For</b> use on <b>their offerings?</b> He meant that the priests were permitted <b>to salt their</b> personal <b>offerings.</b> And when Shmuel states that <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>eating</b> it is not permitted for the priests to derive benefit from the salt, he is referring to adding salt when <b>eating</b> the meat <b>of sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., the portions of the sin offering and guilt offering that are given to the priests. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Now,</b> if <b>we give</b> the priests salt in order <b>to salt the hides of sacrificial</b> animals that are given to the priests to keep, so that they can process them, is it reasonable to rule that <b>we do not give them</b> salt in order <b>to</b> add it when they <b>eat</b> the meat of <b>sacrificial</b> animals?
The Gemara explains its challenge: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:2): <b>You are found</b> to be <b>saying</b> that <b>the salt is placed in three locations</b> in the Temple: <b>In the Chamber of the Salt, and on the ramp, and on top of</b> the <b>altar.</b> It is placed <b>in the Chamber of the Salt, since</b> the priests <b>salted there the hides of sacrificial</b> animals that are given to them. It is placed <b>on the ramp, since</b> the priests <b>salted there the</b> sacrificial <b>limbs.</b> It is placed <b>on top of</b> the <b>altar, since</b> the priests <b>salted there the handful</b> of the meal offering, <b>the frankincense, the incense, the meal offering of priests, the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest, the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations, and the bird burnt offering.</b> Evidently, it was permitted for the priests to add salt to their portions of sacrificial meat.
The Gemara suggests a different explanation of Shmuel’s statement: <b>Rather, what</b> did Shmuel mean by the expression: <b>For</b> use on <b>their offerings?</b> He meant that it is permitted for the priests <b>to</b> add salt when they <b>eat</b> the meat of <b>their offerings,</b> e.g., the portions of the guilt offerings and sin offerings that are given to the priests, as well as when they eat the remainder of the meal offering. <b>And what</b> is meant when Shmuel states that <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>eating</b> it is not permitted for the priests to derive benefit from the salt? He is referring to using the salt for the purpose of <b>eating non-sacred</b> food.
The Gemara objects: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the salt is not to be eaten with <b>non-sacred</b> food? <b>What</b> would non-sacred food be <b>doing there</b> in the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers: <b>Even though the Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the verse stated with regard to the meal offering: “And that which is left of it Aaron and his sons <b>shall eat”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), teaching <b>that</b> the priests <b>shall eat non-sacred</b> food <b>and <i>teruma</i> along with</b> the remainder of the meal offering <b>so that</b> the remainder of the meal offering <b>will be eaten in</b> a manner that the priest will be <b>satiated</b> when he finishes eating it, demonstrating that non-sacred food may be brought to the Temple courtyard, <b>even so we do not give them consecrated salt.</b>
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: So too, it is reasonable</b> to explain that Shmuel’s explanation of the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i> is that the ordinance of the court permitted the priests to eat the salt with sacrificial foods. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> to say: <b>What</b> did Shmuel mean by the expression: <b>For</b> use on <b>their offerings?</b> He meant that the priests were permitted <b>to salt</b> their personal offerings; then one must extrapolate from the mishna that <b>the reason</b> this is permitted is <b>that the court stipulated</b> that it should be, <b>but had the court not stipulated</b> this, it would <b>not</b> be permitted. That cannot be, as <b>now</b> that <b>we give</b> salt <b>to Israelites</b> to salt their offerings, will <b>we not give</b> salt <b>to priests</b> for the same purpose?
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that we provide salt for the offerings of Israelites: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering, must bring salt from his home,</b> i.e., his own salt, to salt the handful that is burned on the altar, <b>just as he brings frankincense from his home</b> for his meal offering. <b>And</b> this would seem to be <b>a logical inference:</b> It <b>is stated</b> in the Torah that one shall <b>bring a meal offering, and</b> it is stated that one shall <b>bring salt,</b> as it is written: “And every meal offering of yours you shall season with salt” (Leviticus 2:13); <b>and</b> it <b>is stated</b> that one shall <b>bring a meal offering, and</b> it is stated that one shall <b>bring frankincense.</b> Therefore, <b>just as</b> one brings <b>frankincense from his home,</b> as it is written: “And put frankincense on it. And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests” (Leviticus 2:1–2), <b>so too,</b> one must bring <b>salt from his home.</b>
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way:</b> It <b>is stated</b> in the Torah that one shall <b>bring a meal offering and</b> that one shall <b>bring salt, and</b> it <b>is stated</b> that one shall <b>bring a meal offering and</b> that one shall <b>bring wood,</b> as the meal offering cannot be burned on the altar without the wood. Therefore, <b>just as</b> the <b>wood</b> comes <b>from communal</b> supplies, <b>so too,</b> the <b>salt</b> shall come <b>from communal</b> supplies.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Let us see to which</b> salt <b>is</b> more <b>similar,</b> i.e., which comparison seems more reasonable: <b>We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of salt, which is <b>a matter that applies to all offerings, from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of wood, which is also <b>a matter that applies to all offerings. And</b> do <b>not</b> let the <i>halakha</i> of <b>frankincense prove</b> otherwise, <b>as it does not apply to all offerings,</b> only to the meal offerings.
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way: We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of salt, which is <b>a matter that accompanies</b> the meal offering <b>in one vessel, from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of frankincense, which is also <b>a matter that accompanies</b> the meal offering <b>in one vessel. And</b> do <b>not</b> let the <i>halakha</i> of <b>wood prove</b> otherwise, <b>as it does not accompany</b> the meal offering <b>in one vessel.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The verse states: “It is an everlasting covenant of salt”</b> (Numbers 18:19), <b>and there,</b> with regard to the shewbread, <b>it states: “It is from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant”</b> (Leviticus 24:8); Therefore, <b>just as</b> the phrase written <b>there:</b> “From the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant,” means that it is brought <b>from communal</b> supplies, as the shewbread is a communal offering, <b>so too here,</b> the verse that speaks of the everlasting covenant of salt means that the salt is brought <b>from communal</b> supplies. Evidently, salt is provided for offerings of Israelites, and should likewise be provided for the offerings of priests. Accordingly, there would have been no need for the court to permit the priests to salt their offerings, and it must be that the ordinance of the court permitted the priests to use salt when eating sacrificial foods.
<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: This</b> is what <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, says:</b> The initial understanding of Shmuel’s interpretation of the mishna is correct, i.e., that the ordinance of the court permitted the priests to salt their offerings; and the ruling of the mishna <b>is necessary only according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bukhri,</b> who holds that priests are not obligated to contribute a yearly half-shekel to purchase the communal supplies.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:4): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>ben Bukhri testified in Yavne: Any priest who contributes his shekel is not</b> considered <b>a sinner,</b> despite the fact that he is not obligated to do so. Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, any priest who does not contribute his shekel</b> is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated in this mitzva like all other Jews. <b>But the priests</b> who do not contribute the shekel <b>interpret this</b> following <b>verse to their own</b> advantage in order to excuse themselves from the mitzva.
The verse states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). Those priests claim as follows: <b>Since</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat, brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the shewbread</b> placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, which are all meal offerings, are <b>ours,</b> then if we contribute shekels we will have partial ownership of these communal offerings, as they are purchased with the shekels. <b>How,</b> then, <b>can they be eaten?</b> They would then be regarded as priests’ meal offerings, which must be wholly burned.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bukhri,</b> why is a priest who contributes a half-shekel not considered a sinner? <b>Since he is not obligated to bring</b> it <b><i>ab initio</i>, when he brings</b> the half-shekel <b>he is also a sinner, since he is</b> causing the <b>bringing</b> of <b>a non-sacred</b> item <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> He is not contributing the half-shekel as part of the communal offering, as he is exempt from this obligation. Therefore, his donation is the donation of an individual, and a communal offering cannot be brought on behalf of an individual. His donation should disqualify all offerings brought from the communal funds. The Gemara answers: The priest <b>brings and transfers</b> the half-shekel <b>to the community,</b> so it is considered part of the communal funds.
The Gemara states the relevance of the opinion of ben Bukhri to the statement of Shmuel: According to the opinion of ben Bukhri it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that

Daf 22a

<b>when the Merciful One granted</b> the Jewish people the right to use the salt when eating their offerings, he granted this <b>to Israelites, who have</b> an obligation to donate their half-shekels to the <b>chamber,</b> as this fund supplies the salt that is applied to the offerings. With regard <b>to the priests, who do not have</b> an obligation to donate their half-shekels to the <b>chamber, the Merciful One did not grant them</b> the right to make use of the salt. To counter this, the mishna in tractate <i>Shekalim</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the court granted to the priests the right to use the salt when eating their offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>wood,</b> concerning <b>which</b> it is <b>obvious to the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> it is brought <b>from communal</b> supplies, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering, must bring wood from his home</b> on which the burnt offering will be sacrificed, <b>just as he brings libations from his home</b> along with a burnt offering (see Numbers, chapter 15). Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the burnt offering: <b>“On the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:12); the Torah juxtaposes the wood to the altar, teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>altar</b> was built <b>from communal</b> funds, <b>so too,</b> the <b>wood and fire</b> are brought <b>from communal</b> supplies. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua says: Just as</b> the <b>altar was not used by an ordinary</b> person, as it was built for the purpose of serving as an altar for God, <b>so too,</b> the <b>wood and fire</b> should <b>not have been used</b> previously <b>by an ordinary</b> person, so one does not bring the wood from his home. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the two opinions? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> the two <b>is whether</b> there is a requirement that the wood be <b>new,</b> i.e., that it had never been used. According to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon, the wood is fit provided that it comes from communal supplies, even if it is not new wood, whereas according to Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua it must be new wood.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it in fact the <i>halakha</i> that <b>old,</b> i.e., previously used, wood is <b>not</b> fit to be burned on the altar? <b>But isn’t it written: “And Araunah said to David: Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him; behold the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments [<i>morigim</i>] and the equipment of the oxen for the wood”</b> (II Samuel 24:22)? Despite the fact that the threshing instruments and equipment of the oxen have been used previously, apparently they are fit to be used when offering a burnt offering. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> the verse is speaking <b>of new</b> instruments and equipment that had not been previously used.
Tangentially, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>morigim</i></b> mentioned in this verse? <b>Ulla said:</b> It is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed.</b> This was not a known expression in Babylonia, so the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed? Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is referring to <b>a serrated [<i>dekurkesa</i>] board that the threshers use for threshing,</b> which is dragged over the grain by an animal in order to separate the kernels from the stalks. <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which the meaning of <i>morigim</i> is derived? It is the verse that states: <b>“Behold, I have made you a new threshing sledge [<i>morag</i>] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains”</b> (Isaiah 41:15).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a handful</b> of one meal offering, which is to be burned on the altar, <b>was intermingled with a handful of another</b> meal offering, or <b>with the meal offering of priests,</b> or <b>with the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, or <b>with the meal offering of libations</b> accompanying burnt offerings and peace offerings, all of which are burned in their entirety on the altar, it is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice, and the mixture is burned on the altar.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If the handful was intermingled <b>with the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> or <b>with the meal offering of libations,</b> the mixture is <b>unfit because</b> with regard to <b>this,</b> the handful from the standard meal offering, <b>its mixture is thick,</b> one <i>log</i> of oil mixed with a tenth of an ephah of flour, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>that,</b> the meal offering of the anointed priest and the meal offering of libations, <b>its mixture is loose,</b> three <i>log</i> of oil mixed with a tenth of an ephah of flour. <b>And</b> the mixtures, which are not identical, <b>absorb from each other,</b> increasing the amount of oil in the handful and decreasing the amount of oil in the meal offering of the anointed priest or the meal offering of libations, thereby invalidating both.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 77b): In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering fit for sacrifice <b>that was mixed with water, if</b> the mixture <b>has the appearance of blood,</b> it is <b>fit</b> for presenting on the altar, even though the majority of the mixture is water. If the blood <b>was mixed with</b> red <b>wine, one views</b> the wine <b>as though it were water.</b> If that amount of water would leave the mixture with the appearance of blood, it is fit for presentation. Likewise, if the blood <b>was mixed with the blood of</b> a non-sacred <b>domesticated animal or the blood of</b> a non-sacred <b>undomesticated animal, one considers</b> the blood <b>as though it were water. Rabbi Yehuda says: Blood does not nullify blood.</b> Therefore, the priest presents the blood of the mixture on the altar regardless of the ratio of sacred to non-sacred blood.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And both</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse.</b> With regard to the sacrificial rites performed by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, the Torah teaches that after sprinkling of the blood of the bull and of the goat separately between the staves of the Ark and on the Curtain, the blood of the two animals is mixed together and presented on the golden altar inside the Sanctuary. The verse states: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat</b> and put it on the corners of the altar” (Leviticus 16:18). <b>It is a known matter that the blood of the bull is more than the blood of a goat.</b> Why then is the blood of the goat not nullified? Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>The Rabbis,</b> i.e, the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>hold:</b>

Daf 22b

<b>From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> with regard to a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, e.g., the blood of the bull and the goat, the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another. And Rabbi Yehuda holds: From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> any <b>substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is not nullified.</b>
The Gemara examines Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation of the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda. With regard to the first part of his explanation, that <b>the Rabbis hold: From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> with regard to a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another,</b> the Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> the blood of the goat is not nullified when mixed with the blood of the bull <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> by using an example of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance, and not taught us</b> a case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, the verse would be interpreted <b>as you said.</b> But <b>now that</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> through a case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, it is understood that the reason it is not nullified is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it is part of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, not because the substances are of the same type.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> it is not nullified <b>until</b> both criteria <b>are</b> met, and unless the mixture is both <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance and</b> a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, one nullifies the other. The Gemara concedes: This is <b>difficult.</b>
With regard to the second part of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> any <b>substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is not nullified,</b> the Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> the blood of the goat is not nullified when mixed with the blood of the bull <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar.
The Gemara answers: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> by using an example of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar where the <b>substance</b> is in contact <b>with a different</b> type of <b>substance,</b> the verse would be interpreted <b>as you say.</b> But <b>now that</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance,</b> it is understood that the reason it is not nullified is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> it is not nullified <b>until</b> both criteria <b>are</b> met, and unless the mixture is both <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance and</b> a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, one nullifies the other. The Gemara concedes: This is <b>difficult.</b>
The Gemara raises another objection to the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna here that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If the handful was intermingled <b>with the meal offering of priests, with the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest, or with the meal offering of libations,</b> the mixture is <b>unfit because</b> with regard to <b>this,</b> the handful from the standard meal offering, <b>its mixture is thick, and</b> with regard to <b>that,</b> the meal offering of the anointed priest and the meal offering of libations, <b>its mixture is loose. And</b> the mixtures, which are not identical, <b>absorb from each other,</b> invalidating both. The Gemara asks: <b>But when</b> the mixtures <b>absorb from each other, what of it?</b> This <b>is</b> a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance,</b> and therefore neither oil nullifies the other and both should be sacrificed on the altar.

Daf 23a

<b>Rava said: Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that in the case of <b>any</b> mixture <b>that consists of a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance as well as another</b> type of <b>substance,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is to <b>disregard</b> the <b>same substance,</b> considering it <b>as though it were not</b> there, <b>and</b> in the event that the <b>different</b> type of <b>substance is more than</b> the first substance, the different substance <b>nullifies</b> the first substance. In the case of the mishna here, the handful of the meal offering is mixed with other types of meal offerings that comprise greater quantities of oil. The oil of the handful is disregarded, and the flour of the handful, which is present in greater quantities than the oil of the other meal offering that is absorbed in it, nullifies this oil of the other meal offering. That oil is now considered to be one with the oil of the handful, and therefore the oil of the handful is increased, and the handful is unfit.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the <i>halakha</i> <b>where one added oil to the handful</b> that is removed from <b>the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which does not include oil. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>unfit, and Reish Lakish says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the meal offering <b>itself</b> is to <b>wipe it,</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>in the remainder of the <i>log</i></b> of oil that remains in the vessels that were used previously for other meal offerings, <b>and</b> the priest then <b>brings it up</b> and burns it on the altar. This is done so that the meal offering will not be completely dry.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the meal offering of a sinner: <b>“He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense on it”</b> (Leviticus 5:11)? How, then, can any oil be added? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse teaches <b>that one should not designate oil for it as</b> one designates oil for the <b>other</b> meal offerings, but the meal offering of a sinner is not rendered unfit by the addition of a small amount of oil.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:4): In the case of <b>a dry</b> meal offering <b>that was intermingled with</b> a meal offering that was <b>mixed</b> with oil, the priest <b>shall sacrifice</b> it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The priest <b>shall not sacrifice</b> it. <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring to <b>a handful of the meal offering of a sinner that was intermingled with a handful of a voluntary meal offering,</b> demonstrating that the oil invalidates the handful of a meal offering of a sinner?
Reish Lakish responded: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the meal offering</b> that accompanies the libations brought with the offerings <b>of bulls or rams,</b> for which two <i>log</i> of oil is mixed with a tenth of an ephah of flour, that became intermingled <b>with the meal offering</b> that accompanies the libations brought with the offering <b>of sheep,</b> for which three <i>log</i> of oil is mixed with a tenth of an ephah of flour, as the former is considered dry relative to the latter.
Rabbi Yoḥanan objected: <b>But</b> another <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches this explicitly</b> as a separate <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>the meal offering</b> that accompanies the offerings <b>of bulls or rams</b> that became intermingled <b>with the meal offering</b> that accompanies the offering <b>of sheep, and a dry</b> meal offering <b>that was intermingled with</b> a meal offering that was <b>mixed</b> with oil, the meal offering <b>shall be sacrificed. Rabbi Yehuda says: It shall not be sacrificed.</b> Therefore, the latter case must be referring to other meal offerings. Reish Lakish responded: The latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, teaching that the reason one may not offer a meal offering that accompanies bulls and rams that was intermingled with the meal offering that accompanies sheep is because one may not offer a dry offering that was intermingled with one that is mixed with oil.
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> In the case of <b>a handful whose oil</b> the priest <b>squeezed onto the wood</b> and only afterward he placed the handful on the wood to be burned, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are substances that are <b>contiguous to</b> items that <b>ascend</b> upon the altar <b>considered</b> to be <b>as</b> part of the items that <b>ascend</b> upon the altar, in which case the oil that was absorbed into the wood and is contiguous to the handful of the meal offering is considered part of the handful? <b>Or</b> are they <b>not considered</b> to be <b>as</b> part of the items that <b>ascend</b> upon the altar, and the oil is not viewed as part of the handful, and therefore the handful is missing oil? <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Is this not</b> the same disagreement <b>as</b> the dispute between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish?</b>
<b>As it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who offers up,</b> outside the Temple courtyard, <b>a limb that contains less than an olive-bulk</b> of meat, <b>but</b> the offering’s <b>bone completes</b> the measure of the offering <b>to an olive-bulk, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable,</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that one is <b>liable</b> because he holds that substances that are <b>contiguous to</b> items that <b>ascend</b> upon the altar are <b>considered</b> to be <b>as</b> part of the items that <b>ascend</b> upon the altar. Therefore, the measure of the bone is added to the measure of the meat, resulting in a total measure of an olive-bulk, which is the measure that determines liability. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that one is <b>exempt</b> because he holds that substances that are <b>contiguous to</b> items that <b>ascend</b> upon the altar <b>are not considered</b> to be <b>as</b> part of the items that <b>ascend</b> upon the altar. Since less than an olive-bulk of meat was sacrificed, he is not liable.
Rav Ashi responded: Rava’s <b>dilemma can be raised according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, and</b> Rava’s <b>dilemma can be raised according to Reish Lakish.</b> The circumstances in their dispute are not the same as in Rava’s dilemma, so their opinions in that case may not be applicable to this one. Rav Ashi elaborates: The <b>dilemma can be raised according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> even though he holds that the bone is considered to be part of the meat to complete the measure of an olive-bulk. Perhaps <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> his opinion <b>only there, in</b> the case of <b>a bone, because</b> the bone <b>is</b> the same <b>type as</b> the <b>meat,</b> i.e., it is from the same animal, and is therefore considered to be part of the sacrificial meat. <b>But</b> in <b>this</b> case of oil, <b>which is not</b> the same <b>type as</b> the <b>handful,</b> it is <b>not</b> considered to be a part of the handful even if it is contiguous to it.
<b>Or perhaps, even according to Reish Lakish, he says</b> his ruling <b>only in</b> the case of the <b>bone,</b> teaching that it does not add to the quantity of the meat. The reason is <b>that</b> the bone <b>is able to be separated</b> from the meat, <b>and if it separated,</b> there is <b>no mitzva to return it</b> to the fire. Therefore, he views it as distinct from the meat. <b>But</b> in this case of <b>oil, which is not able to be separated</b> from the handful of the meal offering, as it must be burned together with the handful, he will <b>not</b> hold that the oil is viewed as separate from the handful. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the case of the bone and the case of the oil, and Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish would have the same opinions, respectively, in both cases. The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>two meal offerings from which a handful was not removed and</b> that <b>were intermingled with each other, if</b> the priest <b>can remove a handful from this</b> meal offering <b>by itself and from that</b> meal offering <b>by itself, they are fit</b> meal offerings, <b>but if not, they are unfit,</b> as the handful of each meal offering must be taken from its original source.
In the case of <b>a handful that was intermingled with a meal offering from which a handful was not removed,</b> the priest <b>should not burn</b> the mixture on the altar. <b>And if he burned</b> it, <b>this</b> meal offering <b>from which the handful was taken satisfies the obligation of the owner and that</b> meal offering <b>from which the handful was not taken does not satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b>
If, after it was removed, <b>its handful was intermingled with its remainder or with the remainder of another</b> meal offering, the priest <b>should not burn</b> the mixture on the altar, <b>but if he burned</b> it, <b>it satisfies the obligation of the owner.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The meat of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass</b> is <b>nullified in</b> a larger quantity of meat of <b>a slaughtered</b> animal. Although meat from a carcass generally imparts impurity, if one touches the mixture of the two meats he does not become ritually impure, as the carcass meat is considered a different type of substance from the slaughtered animal and is therefore nullified. This is not considered a mixture that comprises a substance in contact with the same type of substance, <b>because</b> meat from <b>a slaughtered</b> animal <b>cannot attain the status of a carcass,</b> and it is therefore viewed as a different type of substance.
By contrast, if meat of a slaughtered animal became intermingled with a larger quantity of meat of animal carcass, the meat of the <b>slaughtered</b> animal <b>is not nullified in</b> the larger quantity of meat of the <b>carcass, as it is possible for a carcass to attain the status of a slaughtered</b> animal with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, as it can lose its ability to transmit ritual impurity. This is <b>because when</b> a carcass <b>rots</b> to the extent that it is no longer edible, <b>it loses its impure</b> status. The <i>halakha</i> that the carcass meat has the ability to attain the ritually pure status of meat of a slaughtered animal renders the two meats as the same type of substance, and the mixture retains its status of intermingled carcass meat and meat of a slaughtered animal.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> the opposite: <b>Any</b> small quantity of an item <b>that can possibly become like</b> the item that is present in larger quantities is <b>not nullified</b> when the two are intermingled, <b>but any</b> small quantity of an item <b>that cannot possibly become like</b> the item that is present in larger quantities is <b>nullified</b> in the larger quantity. Accordingly, a small quantity of meat of a slaughtered animal is nullified in a larger quantity of unslaughtered animal carcass meat, since the meat of a slaughtered animal cannot become like the animal carcass meat; but a small quantity of animal carcass meat is not nullified in a larger quantity of meat of a slaughtered animal, since it can lose its impure status and become akin to the meat of a slaughtered animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion do Rabbi Ḥanina and Rav Ḥisda state their opinions? <b>If</b> their opinions are <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> this is difficult: <b>Didn’t</b> the Rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>it is</b> in the case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar <b>that</b> the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another, but</b> otherwise, <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> is <b>nullified?</b> Therefore, in any case where meat of a slaughtered animal becomes intermingled with unslaughtered animal carcass meat, the smaller quantity is nullified in the larger quantity.
<b>If</b> their opinions are <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that the blood of an offering is not nullified in the blood of a non-sacred animal because the two are the same type of substance, this is difficult: <b>But</b>

Daf 23b

<b>Rabbi Yehuda follows the appearance</b> of the item in determining whether the two items are the same type of substance. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>this</b> meat of a slaughtered animal <b>and that</b> meat of an unslaughtered carcass are viewed as <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance,</b> since their appearances are identical, and neither one nullifies the other.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be explained that the opinions of Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Ḥanina are <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya. As Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> The meat of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass and</b> the meat of <b>a slaughtered</b> animal <b>are nullified one in the other.</b> Rav Ḥisda understands this statement to mean that the meat of an animal carcass is nullified in a larger quantity of meat of a slaughtered animal, whereas Rabbi Ḥanina understands the statement to be referring to meat of a slaughtered animal that is nullified in a larger quantity of meat of an unslaughtered animal carcass.
The Gemara asks: But then <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion did <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> himself state his opinion? <b>If</b> his opinion is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> that is difficult: <b>Didn’t</b> the Rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>it is</b> in the case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar <b>that</b> the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another, but</b> in general, <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> is <b>nullified? And if</b> his statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that is difficult: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda any substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> is <b>not nullified.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya holds that <b>when Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> is <b>not nullified, this statement</b> applies only <b>where it is possible for one to become like</b> the other. <b>But where it is not possible for one to become like</b> the other, it is <b>nullified,</b> since the two are not considered the same substance.
<b>And</b> Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Ḥanina <b>disagree with regard to this, as Rav Ḥisda holds</b> that <b>we follow the</b> potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance, i.e., the larger quantity, and if it can attain the status of the smaller quantity, the two are considered identical substances and the smaller quantity is not nullified in the larger quantity. Therefore, if meat of a slaughtered animal became mingled with a larger quantity of meat of an animal carcass, the meat of the slaughtered animal is not nullified, as it is possible for a carcass to attain the status of a slaughtered animal with regard to ritual impurity, as when a carcass rots it loses its impure status.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina holds</b> that <b>we follow</b> the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance, i.e., the smaller quantity, and only if it can attain the status of the larger quantity, e.g., in the case of meat of an animal carcass that was intermingled with a larger quantity of meat of a slaughtered animal, the two are considered identical substances and the smaller quantity is not nullified in the larger quantity.
The Gemara offers support for the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>two meal offerings from which a handful was not removed and</b> which <b>were intermingled with each other, if</b> the priest <b>can remove a handful from this</b> meal offering <b>by itself and from that</b> meal offering <b>by itself, they are fit</b> meal offerings, <b>but if not, they are unfit,</b> as the handful of each meal offering must be taken from its original source. <b>And here, once he removes a handful from one, the rest</b> of it <b>becomes</b> the <b>remainder,</b> which is designated for the priests, <b>and</b> this <b>remainder does not nullify</b> the other <b>meal offering from which a handful has not yet been removed.</b>
In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is difficult: <b>Didn’t</b> the Rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>it is</b> in the case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar <b>that</b> the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another, but</b> in general, <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> is <b>nullified?</b> Therefore, the remainder of the first meal offering should nullify the second meal offering, as both consist of the same substances, flour and oil. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that the meal offering is not nullified in the remainder, as any substance in contact with the same type of substance is not nullified.
Now, <b>granted, according to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, who is <b>the one who says</b> that <b>we follow</b> the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance, in the mishna’s case the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance can <b>become like</b> the potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance, <b>as when</b> the priest <b>removes the handful from the other</b> meal offering, the intermingled offering <b>will become a remainder</b> that is designated for the priests, just <b>like that</b> of the first meal offering. Therefore, the intermingled second meal offering is not nullified in the remainder of the first meal offering.
<b>But according to</b> Rav Ḥisda, who is <b>the one who says</b> that <b>we follow</b> the potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance, <b>can</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the first meal offering <b>become a meal offering from which a handful has not yet been removed?</b> Therefore, <b>shall we say</b> that <b>according to Rav Ḥisda</b> the mishna here <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion?
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira says</b> that the verse teaches that nullification does not take place when remainders are intermingled with handfuls. He explains: The term <b>burning is stated with regard to</b> the <b>handful</b> removed from the meal offering (see Leviticus 2:2), as it is a mitzva to burn the handful, <b>and</b> the term <b>burning is stated with regard to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering (see Leviticus 2:11), as it is taught that it is prohibited to burn the remainder.
This verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as</b> in the case of the <b>burning that is stated with regard to</b> the <b>handful,</b> if two handfuls are mixed together <b>one handful does not nullify the other</b> and all agree that the two are burned on the altar, <b>so too,</b> in the case of the <b>burning that is stated with regard to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering, if the remainder of one offering is intermingled with another meal offering, the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering <b>does not nullify</b> the <b>handful</b> or the remainder of the second meal offering.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna here: In the case of <b>the handful that was intermingled with a meal offering from which a handful was not removed,</b> the priest <b>should not burn</b> the mixture on the altar, <b>and if he burned</b> it, <b>this</b> meal offering <b>from which the handful was taken satisfied the obligation of the owner and that</b> meal offering <b>from which the handful was not taken did not satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> This is a case of a mixture of identical substances, <b>and the meal offering from which a handful has not yet been removed does not nullify</b> the <b>handful,</b> since after the fact if the mixture is burned on the altar the meal offering from which the handful was taken satisfies the obligation of the owner.
The Gemara explains the proof: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is difficult: <b>Didn’t</b> the Rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>it is</b> in the case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar <b>that</b> the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another, but</b> in general, <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> is <b>nullified? Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that any substance in contact with the same type of substance is not nullified.
Now, <b>granted, according to</b> Rav Ḥisda, who is <b>the one who says</b> that <b>we follow</b> the potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance, in the mishna’s case the potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance can <b>become like</b> the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance, <b>since every bit</b> of the meal offering <b>is fit to have the handful taken from it. And</b> therefore, the mixture <b>is</b> considered to be one that consists of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance, and a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> is <b>not nullified.</b>
<b>But according to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, who is <b>the one who says</b> that <b>we follow</b> the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance, <b>can</b> the <b>handful become a meal offering from which a handful has not yet been removed,</b> so that it would not be nullified by the other meal offering whose handful was not removed? Therefore, <b>shall we say that</b> according to Rabbi Ḥanina the mishna here is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> mishna <b>as well</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> who explains that a Torah edict establishes that the remainder does not nullify the handful, and similarly, a meal offering from which a handful has not yet been removed does not nullify the handful.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna here: If, after it was removed, <b>its handful was intermingled with the remainder of another</b> meal offering, the priest <b>should not burn</b> the mixture on the altar, <b>and if he burned</b> it, <b>it satisfied the obligation of the owner.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>But here,</b> the potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance <b>cannot become like</b> the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance, since the remainder of the meal offering cannot become like the handful, and the potentially nullified substance cannot become like the potentially nullifying substance, since the handful cannot become like the remainder of the meal offering; <b>and</b> the mishna teaches that the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering <b>does not nullify</b> the <b>handful.</b>
In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is difficult: Didn’t the Rabbis say that it is in the case of a mixture of items that ascend to the altar that the different components of the mixture do not nullify one another, but in general, a substance in contact with the same type of substance is nullified? Rather, it is obvious that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that any substance in contact with the same type of substance is not nullified. But in contrast to Rabbi Ḥiyya’s statement, Rabbi Yehuda apparently holds that nullification takes place even if the nullifying substance cannot become like the nullified substance, or if the nullified substance cannot become like the nullifying substance.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This mishna is an independent <i>halakha</i>, based on a Torah edict that nullification does not take place when remainders are intermingled with handfuls. He explains: The term <b>burning is stated with regard to</b> the <b>handful</b> removed from the meal offering, <b>and</b> the term <b>burning is stated with regard to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering. This verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as</b> in the case of the <b>burning that is stated with regard to</b> the <b>handful,</b> if two handfuls are mixed together <b>one handful does not nullify the other</b> and all agree that the two are burned on the altar, <b>so too,</b> in the case of the <b>burning that is stated with regard to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering, if the remainder of one offering is intermingled with another meal offering, the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering <b>does not nullify the handful</b> or the remainder of the second meal offering.
The Gemara suggests another proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 2:21): <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> In the case of <i>matza</i> that one <b>seasoned with black cumin, with sesame, or with any type of spice,</b> it is <b>fit</b> to be eaten during the festival of Passover, as <b>it is</b> considered <b><i>matza</i>, but it is called seasoned <i>matza</i>.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>It enters your mind</b> to explain that this is a case <b>where</b> there were <b>more spices than</b> the <b><i>matza</i></b> itself.
Now, <b>granted, according to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, who is <b>the one who says</b> that <b>we follow</b> the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance, in the case here the potentially <b>nullified</b> substance can <b>become like</b> the potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance, <b>as when</b> the <i>matza</i> <b>becomes moldy it becomes like</b> the <b>spices,</b> as it is no longer fit to be used to fulfill the mitzva of eating <i>matza</i>. Therefore, the smaller quantity of <i>matza</i> is not nullified by the larger quantity of spices. <b>But according to</b> Rav Ḥisda, who is <b>the one who says</b> that <b>we follow</b> the potentially <b>nullifying</b> substance, <b>can</b> the <b>spices become</b> like the <b><i>matza</i>?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> there are <b>not more spices</b> than <i>matza</i>, but rather <b>the majority is <i>matza</i> and</b> therefore the <i>matza</i> is <b>not nullified.</b> The Gemara notes: According to this explanation, the language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches: It is</b> considered <b><i>matza</i>, but it is called seasoned <i>matza</i>. Learn from</b> here that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to an entity whose majority is <i>matza</i>, and therefore it is referred to as seasoned <i>matza</i>.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>When Rav Kahana ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya, who were sitting and saying</b> the following: In the case of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of a meal offering <b>that one divided</b>

Daf 24a

<b>and placed in a receptacle</b> such that the flour of the measure was in two places, not in contact with each other, <b>and one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed <b>touched one of</b> the portions of the meal offering, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does he disqualify only the part of the meal offering that he touched, or the other part as well? <b>When we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 20b) that <b>a vessel joins</b> all the food <b>that is in it with regard to sacrificial</b> food, meaning that if some of the contents become impure all the contents become impure as well, does <b>this matter</b> apply only <b>where</b> the contents <b>are touching each other, but where</b> the contents <b>are not touching each other</b> the ritual impurity is <b>not</b> imparted to the other contents? <b>Or perhaps</b> there is <b>no difference.</b>
Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Did we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>a vessel connects</b> the contents within it? <b>We learned</b> that <b>a vessel joins</b> the contents within it, indicating that it does so in <b>any</b> case, whether or not the contents are in contact with one another. The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya then asked Rav Kahana: If one <b>inserted</b> another <b>one</b> half-tenth of an ephah <b>between them,</b> and one who was ritually impure who immersed that day touched it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are the first two half-tenths rendered impure?
Rav Kahana <b>said to them:</b> Only when an item <b>requires a vessel</b> in order for it to be sanctified, e.g., in the case of the two half-tenths of an ephah of a meal offering, does the <b>vessel join it</b> together. In the case of an item that <b>does not require a vessel,</b> such as this half-tenth that was placed between them, the <b>vessel does not join it.</b>
The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya then asked: If <b>one who immersed that day inserted his finger between</b> the two half-tenths of the ephah that were placed in the receptacle, without touching either one, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are the two half-tenths rendered impure? Rav Kahana <b>said to them</b> in response: The <b>only item you have that transmits impurity through its airspace</b> is <b>an earthenware vessel alone.</b>
Rav Kahana <b>himself then asked</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya: If two half-tenths of an ephah of a meal offering are placed in one vessel but are not in contact with each other, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can one <b>remove a handful from this</b> half-tenth of an ephah <b>on</b> behalf of <b>that</b> half-tenth of an ephah? Is the <b>joining</b> of the contents of the vessel effective <b>by Torah law or by rabbinic law?</b> If it is effective by Torah law, then the removal of the handful is valid. If it is effective by rabbinic law, then the removal of the handful was not performed correctly, since it was not taken from the entire tenth of an ephah of the meal offering.
<b>They said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>We did not hear</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>this</b> case explicitly, but <b>we heard</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>similar to this. As we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>two meal offerings from which a handful was not removed and</b> which <b>were intermingled with each other, if</b> the priest <b>can remove a handful from this</b> meal offering <b>by itself and from that</b> meal offering <b>by itself, they are fit</b> meal offerings, <b>but if not, they are unfit,</b> as the handful of each meal offering must be taken from its original source.
They explain: <b>In any event,</b> the mishna teaches that in a case <b>when he can remove a handful</b> from each meal offering, the meal offerings <b>are fit. Why</b> is this considered a valid removal of the handful? <b>But this</b> part of the meal offering <b>that is intermingled</b> with the other meal offering <b>does not touch</b> the part of the meal offering from which the handful is removed. Evidently, the vessel joins the different parts of the meal offering together, and one can remove the handful from any part of its contents, even if they are not touching.
<b>Rava said:</b> This cannot be inferred from the mishna, as <b>perhaps</b> the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the <b>clumps</b> of the meal offering <b>are divided like</b> the teeth of <b>a comb,</b> so that although the handful is removed from a clump of the meal offering that is separate from the clump that is intermingled with the other offering, all parts of the meal offering are still in contact with one another. It may still be that in the case presented by Rav Kahana, where the parts are truly separated from one another, it is possible that one cannot remove the handful from one part on behalf of the other.
The Gemara asks: Since this question was not resolved, <b>what</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall take up from it</b> his handful” (Leviticus 6:8), meaning that he shall take the handful <b>from</b> the meal offering <b>that is connected.</b> This teaches <b>that one shall not bring a tenth</b> of an ephah divided <b>in two vessels and remove the handful</b> from one on behalf of the other. It can therefore be inferred that <b>in</b> the case of <b>one vessel</b> that is <b>similar to two vessels,</b> as the entirety of the meal offering is brought in one vessel although the different parts are not touching, one may <b>remove the handful</b> from one part on behalf of the other part.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Perhaps</b> one could say: <b>What are the circumstances</b> when the <i>baraita</i> states that one may not bring a tenth of an ephah in <b>two vessels?</b> The circumstances are, <b>for example,</b> if one hollowed out the area of a smaller <b><i>kefiza</i></b> measure <b>within</b> the area of a larger <b><i>kav</i></b> measure, so that within the one receptacle there were two cavities divided by a partition that did not reach the top of the receptacle. In this case, <b>even though</b> the two <b>are intermingled on top,</b> above the partition, <b>since the partition of the <i>kefiza</i></b> measure <b>divides</b> them <b>below,</b> they are still separated and not joined together.
Abaye continues: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>one vessel</b> that is <b>similar to two vessels,</b> with regard to which you inferred that one may remove the handful from one part on behalf of the other part? The circumstances are, <b>for example, a hen trough</b> that is filled with water or fodder, <b>and even though a partition divides</b> the top of the trough, the contents are <b>touching</b> below. <b>But here,</b> in the case of two half-tenths of an ephah that are placed in a receptacle <b>that are not touching</b> each other <b>at all, you should raise the dilemma</b> as to whether the handful may be removed from one part on behalf of the other.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> In a scenario where <b>a vessel joins</b> the two half-tenths of an ephah that are inside the vessel but not touching, <b>and</b> there is <b>a connection</b> by means of <b>water</b> between one of the half-tenths of the ephah inside the vessel and another half-tenth of an ephah that is outside the vessel, and one who immersed that day touched the other half-tenth of an ephah that is inside the vessel, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does he also disqualify the half-tenth of an ephah that is outside the vessel?
<b>When we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 20b) that <b>a vessel joins</b> all the food <b>that is in it with regard to sacrificial</b> food, meaning that if some of the contents become impure all the contents become impure as well, does <b>this matter</b> apply only to <b>that</b> which is <b>inside</b> the vessel, <b>but not</b> to <b>that</b> which is <b>outside</b> of it, despite the fact that the outer item is connected to an item inside the vessel? <b>Or perhaps, since</b> the half-tenth of an ephah found outside the vessel <b>is connected</b> to an impure item, it <b>is connected</b> and becomes impure.
Rabbi Yirmeya continues: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>since</b> the half-tenth of an ephah found outside the vessel <b>is connected</b> to an impure item, it <b>is connected</b> and becomes impure, one can raise another dilemma. In a case where there is <b>a connection</b> by means of <b>water</b> between a half-tenth of an ephah outside a vessel and another half-tenth of an ephah that is inside the vessel, <b>and</b> the <b>vessel joins</b> two half-tenths of an ephah that are inside the vessel, <b>and one who immersed that day touched</b> the half-tenth of an ephah <b>that is outside</b> the vessel, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>When we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>a vessel joins</b> all the food that is in it with regard to sacrificial food, meaning that if some of the contents become impure all the contents become impure as well, does <b>this matter</b> apply only in a case <b>where</b> the one who immersed that day <b>touched</b> that <b>which is inside</b> the vessel, thereby transmitting impurity to all of the contents of the vessel, and due to the connection by means of water the impurity is then transmitted to that which is outside the vessel, <b>but</b> it does <b>not</b> apply in a case <b>where</b> the one who immersed that day touched that <b>which is outside</b> of the vessel, and only the half-tenth of an ephah that is connected to the outer item becomes impure? <b>Or perhaps</b> this case <b>is no different,</b> and the vessel joins all of its contents with regard to ritual impurity. The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ It has been demonstrated that a vessel joins the contents that are found in it, even if they are not touching one another, with regard to ritual impurity, such that if some of the contents become impure, all of the contents are rendered impure. <b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of a meal offering <b>that one divided</b> and then placed the two halves in different vessels, <b>and one of them became impure and</b> afterward <b>he placed it in a receptacle</b> along with the second half-tenth of an ephah, <b>and then one who immersed that day touched that one</b> that was already rendered <b>impure, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that the item is already <b>saturated with impurity</b> and cannot be rendered impure a second time, and therefore the second half-tenth of the ephah is not rendered impure even though it is joined in the same receptacle, <b>or not?</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: And do we say</b> that an item that is already <b>saturated with impurity</b> cannot be rendered impure a second time? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 27:9): With regard to <b>a sheet</b> that is impure due to <b>ritual impurity</b>

Daf 24b

imparted by <b>treading,</b> e.g., if a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] lay down on it and transferred to it this severe impurity, <b>and</b> afterward <b>one made a curtain [<i>villon</i>] of it,</b> it is <b>pure</b> with regard to ritual impurity <b>imparted by treading,</b> as it is no longer fit for sitting or lying down. <b>But</b> it is <b>impure</b> due to having been in <b>contact</b> with an item that became ritually impure with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> as it is viewed as having been in contact with itself, and therefore it can impart impurity to food and drink.
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: What</b> source of impurity imparted by <b>treading did this</b> curtain <b>touch? Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that if a <i>zav</i> touched</b> the sheet itself before it was made into a curtain, and did not only lie on it without touching it directly, then although the curtain is pure with regard to ritual impurity imparted by treading, it is nevertheless <b>impure</b> due to <b>contact</b> with <b>a <i>zav</i>.</b> This is because the impurity transmitted by contact with a <i>zav</i> applies in the case of a curtain, which is not the <i>halakha</i> with regard to impurity imparted by treading.
Abaye comments: <b>When a <i>zav</i> touched</b> the sheet, <b>in any event</b> it was rendered <b>impure, even</b> if he touched it <b>after</b> he lay on the sheet, thereby rendering it impure with impurity imparted by treading. In this manner, it was rendered impure with the <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading, and afterward</b> it was again rendered impure due to <b>contact</b> with <b>a <i>zav</i>.</b> According to the statement of Rava, <b>why</b> would this be the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Let us say</b> that the item is already <b>saturated with impurity</b> and cannot be rendered impure a second time.
Rava <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>And from where</b> do you know <b>that this</b> statement of Rabbi Yosei: <b>That if a <i>zav</i> touched</b> the sheet it is nevertheless impure due to contact with a <i>zav</i>, is referring <b>to</b> a case where a <i>zav</i> touched the sheet <b>after</b> it was rendered impure with the ritual impurity imparted by <b>treading? Perhaps</b> he was referring to a case where a <i>zav</i> touched the sheet, rendering it impure due to contact with a <i>zav</i>, <b>before</b> he lay on it and rendered it impure with the ritual impurity imparted by <b>treading.</b> In that case, the <b>severe</b> form of ritual <b>impurity</b> imparted by the treading of the <i>zav</i>, which is a primary source of ritual impurity that imparts impurity to all people and items, <b>takes effect in addition to</b> the <b>lesser</b> form of <b>impurity</b> imparted by contact with a <i>zav</i>, which imparts impurity only to food and drink.
<b>But here,</b> in the case of part of a meal offering that was touched by one who immersed that day after having already become impure due to the touch of one who immersed that day, <b>where</b> both <b>this and that</b> are <b>lesser</b> forms of <b>impurity,</b> perhaps the impurity does <b>not</b> take effect a second time, as it is already impure.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> the proof against the existence of a principle that an item can be saturated with impurity and not susceptible to becoming impure a second time is <b>from the last clause</b> of a <i>baraita</i> that corresponds to the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes that in</b> a case of <b>two sheets that are folded and placed on</b> top of <b>one another, and a <i>zav</i> sat upon them, the top</b> sheet is rendered impure with the <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading, and the bottom</b> sheet is rendered impure with the <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading and</b> due to <b>contact</b> with the top sheet that has become ritually impure with impurity imparted by <b>treading.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>But</b> according to the opinion advanced in Rava’s dilemma, <b>why</b> would this be the case? <b>Let us say</b> that the bottom sheet is already <b>saturated with impurity</b> and cannot be rendered impure a second time.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There,</b> with regard to the bottom sheet, the two types of impurity take effect <b>simultaneously,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to the impure meal offering, the two forms of impurity take effect <b>one after the other.</b> It is only in the latter case that Rava suggests that the second type of impurity does not take effect. Therefore, there is no conclusive proof, and the question raised by Rava remains unresolved.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> In a case where one <b>divided a tenth</b> of an ephah of a meal offering into two halves, <b>and one</b> half was <b>lost and he separated another</b> half <b>in its stead, and</b> afterward <b>the first</b> lost half <b>was found, and all three are placed in a receptacle</b> together, if the one that had been <b>lost became impure, the</b> previously <b>lost</b> half-tenth of an ephah <b>and</b> the <b>first</b> half-tenth of an ephah <b>join together</b> and become impure, in accordance with the mishna cited earlier (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 20b) that a vessel joins the two together with regard to ritual impurity. But the half-tenth of an ephah that was <b>separated</b> to replace the lost half-tenth <b>does not join together</b> with the other half-tenths, and it remains pure.
If the one that had been <b>separated</b> to replace the lost half-tenth <b>became impure,</b> then the <b>separated</b> half-tenth <b>and</b> the <b>first</b> half-tenth <b>join together</b> and become impure, since the former was separated in order to complete the tenth together with the first half-tenth, while the previously <b>lost</b> half-tenth <b>does not join together</b> with them. If the <b>first</b> half-tenth <b>became impure,</b> then <b>both</b> the previously lost half-tenth as well as the half-tenth that was separated as its replacement <b>join together</b> and become ritually impure, as each of them had at one point been part of the same tenth as the first half-tenth.
<b>Abaye says: Even if</b> any <b>one of</b> the half-tenths <b>became impure, both</b> remaining half-tenths <b>join together</b> and become impure as well. <b>What is the reason? They are all residents of one cabin,</b> i.e., they were meant to be part of the same meal offering.
<b>And similarly,</b> according to Rava, <b>with regard to the removal of the handful,</b> if one <b>removed the handful from</b> the previously <b>lost</b> half-tenth, <b>its remainder and</b> the remainder of the <b>first</b> half-tenth of an ephah <b>are eaten</b> by the priests, while the half-tenth of an ephah that was <b>separated</b> in its stead <b>is not eaten.</b> Since it was not meant to join together with this other half-tenth, the removal of the handful does not permit its consumption. If one <b>removed the handful from</b> the one that had been <b>separated</b> in place of the lost half-tenth, then <b>its remainder and</b> the <b>first</b> half-tenth of an ephah <b>are eaten,</b> while the previously <b>lost</b> half-tenth <b>is not eaten.</b>
If one <b>removed the handful from</b> the <b>first</b> half-tenth, then <b>both</b> the previously lost half-tenth as well as the half-tenth that had been separated in its stead <b>are not eaten.</b> This is because the removal of the handful allows the remainder of only one tenth to be eaten, and it is not known whether the consumption of the previously lost half-tenth or the replacement half-tenth has now been permitted.
<b>Abaye says: Even if</b> one <b>removed the handful from</b> any <b>one of them, both</b> remaining half-tenths <b>are not eaten. What is the reason? They are all residents of one cabin,</b> and it is not possible to know whether the consumption of one or of the other has been permitted.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> ruling of Abaye: <b>And</b> is that to say that <b>in any event</b> the <b>remainder of</b> the half-tenth itself from which the handful was taken <b>is eaten? But one-sixth [<i>danka</i>] of</b> the <b>handful</b> that was removed <b>was not sacrificed</b> to permit this remainder. The handful was removed to permit the consumption of the remainders of all three half-tenths of an ephah in the receptacle. Since the handful included one-third that was removed to account for the half-tenth that is not needed, it turns out that each of the two actual half-tenths should have had an additional one-sixth removed to render them permitted.
<b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya,</b> also <b>objects to this</b> ruling of Abaye: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the handful itself, how can it be sacrificed? But one-third</b> of it, i.e., the portion separated to permit the extraneous half-tenth of an ephah, <b>is non-sacred.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> These questions present no difficulty, since with regard to the removal of the <b>handful, the matter is dependent on the intention of</b> the <b>priest. And when</b> the <b>priest removes the handful, he removes it to</b> permit the remainder of <b>the tenth</b> of an ephah, and not the remainder of the extraneous half-tenth. Still, the other two halves may not be eaten because it is not possible to know whether the consumption of one or of the other has been permitted.

Daf 25a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the handful became ritually impure and</b> despite this the priest <b>sacrificed it, the frontplate</b> worn by the High Priest <b>effects acceptance</b> of the meal offering, and the remainder is eaten by the priests. If the handful <b>left</b> its designated area <b>and</b> despite this the priest then <b>sacrificed it, the frontplate does not effect acceptance.</b> The reason is <b>that the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> offerings sacrificed when <b>ritually impure and does not effect acceptance for</b> offerings <b>that leave</b> their designated areas.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred items,</b> which the children of Israel shall hallow, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). The Sages expounded: <b>But which sin does he bear? If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated: “It shall not be credited</b> to him” (Leviticus 7:18). <b>If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b>
Evidently, the High Priest wearing the frontplate <b>bears only the sin of impurity</b> in the offering of an individual. The frontplate is understood to atone for the sin of sacrificing an impure offering, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of the <b>community,</b> since in a situation where the entire community is impure it is permitted to sacrifice impure communal offerings <i>ab initio</i>.
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the frontplate atones for the <b>sin</b> of sacrificing offerings that <b>leave</b> the courtyard and are thereby disqualified, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of an offering sacrificed on a private <b>altar</b> during the period after the Jewish people had entered Eretz Yisrael and before there was an established location for the Tabernacle?
<b>Abaye said to him: The verse states</b> with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be always upon his forehead, <b>that they may be accepted before the Lord”</b> (Exodus 28:38), teaching that in the case of <b>a sin</b> whose general prohibition is permitted <b>before the Lord,</b> i.e., in the Temple, <b>yes,</b> the frontplate atones for it. But in the case of the <b>sin</b> of offerings <b>that leave</b> the courtyard, whose general prohibition is not permitted before the Lord, the frontplate does <b>not</b> atone for it.
<b>Rabbi Ile’a objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the frontplate atones for the <b>sin</b> of performing the service using one’s <b>left</b> hand instead of one’s right, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> when the High Priest carries the spoon bearing the incense into the Holy of Holies with his left hand?
<b>Abaye said to him: The verse states:</b> “And Aaron shall bear <b>the sin</b> committed with the sacred items” (Exodus 28:38), to say that the frontplate atones for <b>a sin that was</b> committed <b>with</b> the offering <b>and I deferred it.</b> This serves <b>to exclude</b> the spoon bearing the incense of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> where there is no sin that was deferred, <b>since its proper</b> performance <b>is</b> for the High Priest to hold it <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, as he must hold both the coal pan and the spoon of incense.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The frontplate does not atone for the sin of sacrificing an offering with the left hand for a different reason: The verse states: “And Aaron shall bear <b>the sin committed with the sacred items [<i>hakodashim</i>],”</b> demonstrating that the frontplate atones for a sin inherent in the offering itself, <b>and not</b> for <b>a sin</b> committed by <b>those who bring the offering [<i>hamakdishin</i>].</b>
<b>Rav Sima, son of Rav Idi, said to Rav Ashi; and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Sima, son of Rav Ashi,</b> who said <b>to Rav Ashi: But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the frontplate atones for <b>the sin of a blemished animal</b> that is sacrificed, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of <b>birds? As the Master says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that an offering must be <b>unblemished and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a burnt offering must be <b>male</b> are taught <b>with regard to animal</b> offerings, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> requirement that an offering must be <b>unblemished and male with regard to birds.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> about blemished animals: <b>“It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:23), and: “But whatsoever has a blemish that you shall not bring; <b>for it shall not be acceptable for you”</b> (Leviticus 22:20), teaching that in no case are blemished animals accepted as offerings, even due to the frontplate.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering <b>that became impure and</b> a priest <b>sprinkled it</b> on the altar, if he did so <b>unwittingly,</b> the offering is <b>accepted</b> and effects atonement for the owner of the offering. If he sprinkled the blood <b>intentionally,</b> the offering is <b>not accepted. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of the offering of <b>an individual. But in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering, <b>whether</b> he sprinkled the blood <b>unwittingly</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so <b>intentionally,</b> the offering is <b>accepted. And in</b> the case of an offering of <b>a gentile</b> where the blood of the offering became impure, <b>whether</b> the priest sprinkled the blood <b>unwittingly</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so <b>intentionally, whether</b> he did so <b>due to circumstances beyond his control</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so <b>willingly,</b>

Daf 25b

the offering is <b>not accepted,</b> as the verse states with regard to the frontplate: “That it may be accepted for them before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38), with the term “for them” teaching that this applies only for Jews, not for gentiles.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what does the frontplate</b> worn by the High Priest <b>effect acceptance?</b> It effects acceptance <b>for the blood, for the flesh, and for the fat</b> of an offering <b>that became impure</b> in the Temple, <b>whether</b> they were rendered impure <b>unwittingly or intentionally, whether due to circumstances beyond one’s control or willfully, whether in</b> the case of the offering of <b>an individual or in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering. In contrast to the statement of the previous <i>baraita</i>, this <i>baraita</i> teaches that the frontplate does effect acceptance in the case of an individual offering for blood that became impure and was sprinkled intentionally.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate effects acceptance for impure blood of an individual offering that was sprinkled intentionally, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate does not effect acceptance, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from ritually impure</b> produce <b>for ritually pure</b> produce. <b>And if he separated <i>teruma</i></b> from impure produce <b>unwittingly, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> but if he did so <b>intentionally,</b> the Sages penalize him and <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yosei says: Whether</b> he did so <b>unwittingly or intentionally, his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b> Like the ruling found in the second <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yosei does not distinguish between a case where one acted unwittingly and where one acted intentionally.
The Gemara objects to the comparison: You can <b>say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> holds <b>that</b> the Sages <b>do not penalize</b> him. <b>Did you hear him</b> say, as the <i>baraita</i> teaches, <b>that</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> the impurity of portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions, so that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The frontplate does effect acceptance for</b> the impurity of portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet objects to this: And are you able to reverse</b> the opinions and say that according to Rabbi Eliezer the frontplate does not effect acceptance for the impurity of portions that are to be eaten? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> one who partakes of <b>impure sacrificial meat,</b> i.e., one who partakes of the meat while in a state of ritual impurity, <b>before the sprinkling of the blood</b> takes place, is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b>
To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Every one that is ritually pure may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), and immediately afterward the verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The juxtaposition of these verses teaches that if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which has become permitted to those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b>
<b>But</b> if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which is not permitted to those who are pure,</b> he is <b>not liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> Since it is not permitted to eat the sacrificial meat before the sprinkling of the blood, one who partakes of it at that point is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating it while ritually impure.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>is</b> the verse teaching <b>only</b> that if one who is impure partakes of that which <b>is eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure; but</b> in a case <b>where</b> he partakes of <b>that which is not eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>not liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure</b> despite the fact that its blood has already been sprinkled? <b>I would</b> then <b>exclude</b> sacrificial meat <b>that</b> was <b>left overnight and</b> meat <b>that leaves</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>which are not</b> permitted to be <b>eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> and I would derive that one who is impure who partakes of them is not liable for eating them.
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That belong to the Lord,”</b> which teaches that the verse <b>included</b> leftover meat and meat that leaves the Temple courtyard in the prohibition, and one who partakes of them while impure is liable for partaking of them.
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include</b> in the prohibition <b>the</b> meat that was rendered <b><i>piggul</i></b> through one’s intention of consuming it after its designated time <b>and the</b> meat that was rendered <b><i>notar</i>.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> interjects: <b>Isn’t <i>notar</i></b> identical to meat that was <b>left overnight,</b> and it has already been established that one is liable for partaking of leftover meat while in an impure state? <b>Rather,</b> what is meant is as follows: One might have thought to include in the prohibition <b>even the</b> meats that were rendered <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> just <b>as <i>notar</i></b> is included. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings,”</b> and the term “of the meat” <b>excluded</b> one who is impure who partakes of <i>piggul</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see to include these,</b> i.e., leftover meat and meat that leaves the courtyard, <b>and to exclude those,</b> i.e., <i>piggul</i>? It answers: <b>After the verse included</b> some offerings <b>and excluded</b> others, <b>you</b> should <b>say</b> the following: <b>I include these,</b> the leftover meat and the meat that leaves the Temple courtyard, <b>as they had a period of fitness</b> after their blood was sprinkled, before they were rendered unfit by being left over or by leaving the Temple courtyard. <b>And I exclude those,</b> <i>piggul</i>, <b>as they never had a period of fitness,</b> as they were already unfit when the blood was sprinkled.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And if you say</b> that if that is the case, then with regard to sacrificial <b>meat that became impure before the sprinkling of the blood, and</b> one who was impure <b>ate it after the sprinkling of the blood, for what</b> reason is he <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure</b> if it never had a period of fitness? The answer is that he is liable <b>because the frontplate effects acceptance</b> and the sprinkling is valid.
It arises from this <i>baraita</i> that if the offering <b>became impure,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the frontplate effects acceptance; but in the case of sacrificial meat that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard, the frontplate <b>does not</b> effect acceptance, and therefore it was never considered to have a period of fitness.
Rav Sheshet now states his question: <b>Who did you hear who says</b> that the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood is <b>not effective</b> in the case of sacrificial meat that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard? This is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as seen in tractate <i>Me’ila</i> (6b), <b>and</b> yet although this <i>baraita</i> is then clearly in accordance with his opinion, it <b>teaches that</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten.</b> Therefore, this too is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and the opinions in the <i>baraita</i> cited above should not be reversed.
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate effects acceptance for the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be eaten, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate does not effect acceptance, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara asks: You can <b>say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds <b>that</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten,</b> but <b>did you hear him</b> say <b>that</b> the Sages <b>did not penalize</b> one who acted willfully? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes. Just as you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> holds with regard to <i>teruma</i> that one who separated impure produce on behalf of pure produce is not penalized, <b>you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds the same. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Whether</b> one acted <b>unwittingly or intentionally, his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b>
The Gemara objects: You can <b>say that you heard Rabbi Eliezer</b> state this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, which</b> is <b>lenient,</b> but <b>did you hear him</b> say this <b>with regard to consecrated</b> items, <b>which</b> are more <b>severe?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that Rabbi Eliezer does not hold the same opinion with regard to consecrated items, <b>to whom will you attribute this</b> <i>baraita</i> that rules that the Sages did not penalize one who acted willfully? Rather, it must be that this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
<b>Ravina said</b> that the contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> should be resolved as follows: With regard to the circumstances of the contraction of <b>its ritual impurity,</b> regardless of whether the blood was rendered impure <b>unwittingly or intentionally,</b> the frontplate effects acceptance for the impurity and the offering is <b>accepted,</b> as the second <i>baraita</i> teaches. By contrast, with regard to <b>the sprinkling of</b> the blood, if it was <b>unwittingly</b> sprinkled after becoming ritually impure, meaning that the priest was unaware that it was impure, then the offering is <b>accepted,</b> but if it was <b>intentionally</b> sprinkled after becoming impure, it is <b>not accepted,</b> as the first <i>baraita</i> teaches.
<b>And Rabbi Sheila said</b> the opposite resolution: With regard to <b>the sprinkling of</b> the blood, <b>whether</b> it was performed <b>unwittingly or intentionally,</b> the offering is <b>accepted.</b> By contrast, with regard to the circumstances of the contraction of <b>its ritual impurity,</b> if it was rendered impure <b>unwittingly</b> the offering is <b>accepted,</b> and if it was rendered impure <b>intentionally</b> it is <b>not accepted.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>And according to Rav Sheila,</b> concerning that <b>which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that the frontplate effects acceptance for blood <b>that was rendered impure</b> regardless of <b>whether</b> it happened <b>unwittingly or intentionally, this</b> is what <b>it is saying:</b> If the blood <b>was rendered impure unwittingly and one sprinkled</b> its blood, <b>whether</b> it was sprinkled <b>unwittingly or intentionally,</b> it is accepted.

Daf 26a

The Gemara suggests a refutation of Rav Sheila’s opinion based on the first <i>baraita</i>: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering <b>that became impure and</b> a priest <b>sprinkled it</b> on the altar, if he did so <b>unwittingly,</b> the offering is <b>accepted</b> and achieves atonement for the owner of the offering. If he sprinkled the blood <b>intentionally,</b> the offering is <b>not accepted.</b> This contradicts Rav Sheila’s statement that even if the priest sprinkled the blood intentionally, it is accepted. The Gemara rejects this proof: According to Rav Sheila, <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> In the case of <b>blood that became impure and</b> a priest <b>sprinkled it, whether</b> it was sprinkled <b>unwittingly or intentionally,</b> if it was <b>rendered impure unwittingly</b> it is <b>accepted,</b> but if it was rendered impure <b>intentionally</b> then it is <b>not accepted.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If after the handful was removed <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>became ritually impure,</b> or if <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>was burned,</b> or if <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>was lost, according to the principle of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that with regard to an animal offering the blood is fit for sprinkling even if there is no meat that can be eaten, the meal offering is <b>fit,</b> and the priest burns the handful. <b>But according to the principle of Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who says that with regard to an animal offering the blood is fit for sprinkling only if there is meat that can be eaten, it is <b>unfit</b> and the priest does not burn the handful, as the handful serves to render permitted the remainder.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that according to Rabbi Yehoshua the meal offering is unfit if its remainder is rendered impure, <b>Rav says: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when all of its remainder became impure. But</b> if only <b>a part of its remainder</b> became impure, the meal offering is <b>not</b> unfit.
The Gemara comments: It <b>enters your mind</b> that Rav holds that only if a part of the remainder <b>became impure,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the meal offering is fit; but if part of the remainder <b>was lost or burned,</b> then the meal offering is <b>not</b> fit. The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> Rav <b>hold? If he holds</b> that <b>what remains is significant,</b> so that even if a portion of the remainder cannot be eaten the handful is still sacrificed to render the rest permitted, then why would this not also be the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if part of the remainder <b>was lost or burned?</b> Alternatively, <b>if he holds</b> that <b>what remains is not significant,</b> and the Gemara interjects: <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>what is the reason</b> that the handful is sacrificed if a part of the remainder <b>became impure?</b> It is <b>because</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance</b> for the impurity; <b>if that is so,</b> then <b>even</b> if <b>all of the remainder</b> became impure, the handful should still be sacrificed.
The Gemara explains: <b>Actually, he holds</b> that <b>what remains is significant, and</b> just as when a part of the remainder <b>became impure</b> but the offering is still fit, the rest of the remainder is sacrificed, <b>the same is true</b> with regard <b>to</b> a case where a part of the remainder <b>was lost or burned. And</b> the reason <b>that he stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> specifically in a case where it <b>became impure</b> is that <b>he employed</b> the terminology of <b>the beginning of</b> the mishna, which discusses a case where the remainder became impure.
Rava’s statement accords with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>all the offerings in the Torah from which there remains an olive-bulk of meat</b> that is fit to be eaten <b>or an olive-bulk of fat</b> that is fit to be sacrificed on the altar, the priest <b>sprinkles the blood.</b> Similarly, if a part of the remainder can be eaten the handful is still sacrificed, as the status of the remainder relative to the handful corresponds to the status of the meat relative to the blood.
The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: If all that remains is <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of fat,</b> the priest <b>does not sprinkle the blood.</b> This is because the half olive-bulk of meat and the half olive-bulk of fat do not combine to form one olive-bulk, since the former is eaten and the latter is sacrificed on the altar. <b>And with regard to a burnt offering, even</b> if all that was left was <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of fat,</b> the priest <b>sprinkles the blood, because it is consumed</b> on the altar <b>in its entirety.</b> Since both the meat and the fat are sacrificed on the altar, they combine to form one olive-bulk. <b>And with regard to a meal offering, although all of it remains</b> pure, the priest <b>shall not sprinkle</b> the blood.
The Gemara questions the last ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the mention of <b>a meal offering doing</b> here? The discussion is about sprinkling blood, which is not relevant in the case of a meal offering. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The meal offering mentioned is <b>the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings. It could <b>enter your mind</b> to say: <b>Since</b> this meal offering <b>accompanies</b> the animal <b>offering,</b> it is <b>comparable to the offering itself,</b> and therefore if the offering became impure but the meal offering remained pure, the blood of the offering is sprinkled due to the remaining meal offering. To counter this, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the <i>halakha</i> that if only an olive-bulk of the fat remains, the priest sprinkles the blood of the offering. <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, and</b> there are those who <b>determined</b> that <b>it</b> was stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: The verse states:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood against the altar of the Lord at the door of the Tent of Meeting, <b>and he shall make the fat smoke for a pleasing aroma to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:6). This verse never mentions the meat, but only the <b>fat,</b> indicating that the blood is sprinkled <b>even if there is no</b> ritually pure <b>meat,</b> but only fat.
The Gemara asks: <b>And we found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the priest sprinkles the blood if only <b>fat</b> remains. <b>From where do we</b> derive that the priest sprinkles the blood if all that is left is the <b>lobe</b> of the liver <b>or</b> the <b>two kidneys,</b> which are also sacrificed on the altar? The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that the priest sprinkles the blood in that case is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is taught</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And with regard to a meal offering, although all of it remains</b> pure, the priest <b>shall not sprinkle</b> the blood. This teaches that <b>it is</b> in the case of <b>a meal offering that</b> the priest <b>shall not sprinkle</b> the blood, as the meal offering is not part of the animal; <b>but</b> if the <b>lobe</b> of the liver <b>or</b> the <b>two kidneys</b> remain, the priest <b>sprinkles</b> the blood.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan himself says:</b> The verse states: <b>“For a pleasing aroma</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 17:6). This teaches that the blood is sprinkled whenever <b>anything that you offer up</b> on the altar <b>for a pleasing aroma</b> remains. This includes anything burned on the altar.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it <b>was necessary to write “fat”</b> in that verse, <b>and</b> it <b>was necessary to write “for a pleasing aroma.” As, if</b> the Merciful One <b>had written</b> only <b>“fat,” I would say</b> that if <b>fat</b> remains, <b>yes,</b> the priest sprinkles the blood, but if only the <b>lobe</b> of the liver <b>or</b> the <b>two kidneys</b> remain, since they are not as significant as the fat, the blood is <b>not</b> sprinkled. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote “for a pleasing aroma.” And if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“for a pleasing aroma,” I would say</b> that it includes <b>even a meal offering</b> brought with the libations that accompany animal offerings. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote “fat,”</b> to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to sacrificial parts of the animal, but not to accompanying libations and meal offerings.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A handful of a meal offering <b>that was not</b> sanctified <b>in a service vessel</b> is <b>unfit, and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b> If the priest <b>burned the handful of</b> a meal offering <b>twice,</b> i.e., in two increments, it is <b>fit.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states</b> with regard to a meal offering: <b>“It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). Rabbi Shimon derives from here that the handful of the meal offering may be placed on the altar in the manner of the blood of either a sin offering or a guilt offering. If a priest <b>comes to perform the</b> sacrificial <b>rites of</b> a meal offering <b>with</b> his <b>hand, as</b> one performs the sprinkling of the blood of <b>a sin offering,</b> which is performed with the priest’s right index finger, <b>he must perform its rites with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>like the sin offering.</b> If he performs the sacrificial rites <b>with a vessel,</b> as one performs the sprinkling of the blood of a guilt offering, whose blood is sprinkled from a vessel on the altar and whose sprinkling may be performed with the priest’s left hand, <b>he may perform its rites with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>like the guilt offering.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yannai says:</b> According to Rabbi Shimon there are no restrictions on the manner in which the handful is sacrificed, as <b>once</b> the priest has <b>removed the handful from a service vessel, he may bring it up and burn it even</b> if he placed it <b>in his belt, or even in an earthenware vessel. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: All concede that</b> the <b>handful requires sanctification</b> in a service vessel before it is sacrificed.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Zevaḥim</i> 1:11): With regard to <b>the burning of</b> the <b>fats, and</b> the <b>limbs, and</b> the <b>wood</b> that were brought up to the altar, <b>that</b> the priest <b>brought them up</b> to the altar, <b>whether by hand or with a vessel, whether with</b> the <b>right</b> hand <b>or with</b> the <b>left</b> hand, <b>they are fit.</b> With regard to <b>the handful, and the incense, and the frankincense, that</b> the priest <b>brought them up</b> to the altar, <b>whether by hand or with a vessel, whether with</b> the <b>right</b> hand <b>or with</b> the <b>left</b> hand, <b>they are fit.</b> The Gemara suggests: This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who stated that if the handful is sacrificed by hand, it must be sacrificed only with the right hand.
The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> it <b>disjunctively,</b> and the statement should be understood as follows: If these items are brought up <b>by hand, with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, or <b>with a vessel, whether with</b> the <b>right</b> hand <b>or with</b> the <b>left,</b> they are fit.
The Gemara attempts to refute the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak that all concede that the handful requires sanctification in a service vessel before it is sacrificed. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If the priest <b>removed the handful,</b> but <b>not from a service vessel, and sanctified it,</b> but <b>not in a service vessel, and brought it up and burned it,</b> but <b>not in a service vessel,</b> then it is <b>unfit. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon deem</b> it <b>fit in</b> a case where the handful had been <b>placed</b> in any type of <b>vessel.</b> This contradicts Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s claim that all concede that the handful must be sanctified in a service vessel.
The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> that according to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, <b>from</b> the point when the handful has been <b>placed</b> in a service <b>vessel</b> and sanctified <b>and onward,</b> it is no longer necessary to take it in a service vessel to the altar to sacrifice it. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> does not contradict Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement.
The Gemara suggests another refutation of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:15). <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: And the Rabbis say:</b> The <b>handful requires</b> sanctification in <b>a service vessel. How</b> is this sanctification performed? The priest <b>removes the handful from a service vessel, and sanctifies it in a service vessel, and brings it up and burns it in a service vessel. Rabbi Shimon says: Once the handful is removed from a service vessel,</b> the priest may <b>bring it up and burn it</b> even if it is <b>not in a service vessel, and</b> this <b>is sufficient for it.</b> This <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that, in contrast to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement, Rabbi Shimon does not hold that the handful must be sanctified in a service vessel.
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>once</b> the priest <b>removes the handful and sanctifies it in a service vessel,</b> he may <b>bring it up and burn it, and</b> this <b>is sufficient for it.</b>
The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If the priest <b>removed the handful with his right</b> hand <b>and put</b> it <b>in his left</b> hand, <b>he shall return it to his right</b> hand. If the handful was <b>in his left</b> hand

Daf 26b

<b>and he intended</b> to partake <b>of</b> the meal offering in an improper manner, <b>whether outside its</b> designated <b>area or beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the offering is <b>not valid, but there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> if one partakes <b>of it.</b>
The Gemara presents an alternative version of this <i>baraita</i>: If, while the handful was in his right hand, <b>he intended</b> to partake <b>of</b> the meal offering <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the offering is <b>not valid, but there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> if one partakes <b>of it.</b> If he intended to partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> then the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and</b> one who partakes of it <b>is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: Once he put</b> the handful <b>in</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the <b>placing</b> of it in his left hand <b>renders it unfit</b> and it cannot be rendered fit by returning it to his right hand. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because it requires sanctification in</b> a service <b>vessel, and once he put it in</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>it is considered like blood that spilled from an animal’s neck onto the floor</b> before being collected in a service vessel <b>and one</b> then <b>gathered it, which</b> is <b>unfit</b> and cannot be rendered fit by then being placed in a service vessel.
The Gemara notes: <b>By inference,</b> one can conclude <b>that Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon do not require</b> sanctification of the handful by <b>placing</b> it in a service <b>vessel.</b> Accordingly, this serves as <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman</b> bar Yitzḥak, who stated that even Rabbi Shimon requires sanctification in a service vessel. The Gemara affirms: This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of his opinion.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that according to Rabbi Shimon, if the priest transferred the handful to his left hand he should return the handful to his right hand. The Gemara comments: This <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> as he said that according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon the rites of the meal offering must be performed with the priest’s right hand. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yannai,</b> as it teaches that the handful must be transferred back to his right hand, whereas he states that once the handful has been removed from a service vessel it may be sacrificed in any manner?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yannai</b> could <b>say to you: I stated</b> my ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> who taught <b>that</b> the <b>burning</b> of the fats and the limbs and the sacrifice of the meal offering can all take place with either the right or left hand. <b>And</b> I hold that he <b>does not teach</b> it <b>disjunctively,</b> as it was explained in order to reconcile the <i>baraita</i> with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya. Rather, it is to be understood according to its straightforward meaning.
§ The mishna teaches: If the priest <b>burned the handful of</b> a meal offering <b>twice,</b> i.e., in two increments, it is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The handful is fit if it is burned <b>twice,</b> where half of the handful is burned each time, <b>but not</b> if it is burned <b>several times,</b> in smaller increments. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is fit if it is burned <b>twice, and</b> it is fit <b>even</b> if it is burned <b>several times.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the basis for the dispute <b>between</b> the two opinions? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The dispute <b>between</b> the two <b>is</b> with regard to whether <b>there is</b> significance to <b>a handful</b> that is <b>less than</b> the size of <b>two olives and whether there is</b> significance to the <b>burning</b> of <b>less than an olive-bulk</b> on the altar.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi holds</b> that <b>there is no</b> significance to <b>a handful</b> that is <b>less than</b> the size of <b>two olives and there is no</b> significance to the <b>burning</b> of <b>less than an olive-bulk</b> on the altar. Therefore, the mishna’s statement that the handful may be burned in two increments is meant literally, and the handful may be divided into only two equal portions, where each one contains exactly one olive-bulk. It may not be divided further, since doing so would result in the burning of less than an olive-bulk on the altar. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that <b>there is</b> significance to <b>a handful</b> that is <b>less than</b> the size of <b>two olives and there is</b> significance to the <b>burning</b> of <b>less than an olive-bulk</b> on the altar. Therefore, if the handful was divided into several small portions and each portion was burned separately, it is fit.
§ <b>It was stated: From when</b> precisely <b>does</b> the sacrifice of the <b>handful render permitted</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the meal offering <b>for consumption</b> by the priests? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: From when the fire takes hold of it,</b> i.e., when it ignites. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From when the fire consumes most of</b> the handful.
<b>Rav Yehuda said to Rabba bar Rav Yitzḥak: I will explain to you the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The verse states: “And behold, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace”</b> (Genesis 19:28), and <b>a furnace does not release smoke until the fire takes hold of the majority of</b> the fuel. Rabbi Yoḥanan derived from this verse that the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire, since the priests are instructed to make the handful smoke, as it is written: “And the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2).
<b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said to Rava: Your students say</b> that <b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items whose</b> usual <b>manner</b> is <b>to be sacrificed at night, for example,</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the burnt offering <b>and</b> the <b>fats [<i>pedarim</i>]</b> of the burnt offering, <b>that</b> the priest <b>may bring them up and burn them after sunset and they are consumed throughout the entire night.</b> This is derived from the verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering: It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning” (Leviticus 6:2).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>items whose</b> usual <b>manner is to be sacrificed during the day, for example, the handful</b> of the meal offering, <b>the frankincense, the incense, the meal offering of priests, the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>and the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations,</b> from where is it derived <b>that</b> the priest <b>may bring them up and burn them after sunset?</b>
The Gemara interjects: Why would they be allowed to be burned after sunset? <b>But didn’t you say</b> that these are items <b>whose</b> usual <b>manner is to be sacrificed during the day?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> the question of the <i>baraita</i> is as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these items may be brought up and burned concurrent <b>with the setting of the sun,</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>they are consumed throughout the entire night</b> and not during the day? <b>The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), which <b>included</b> everything that is sacrificed on the altar.
Ravin bar Rav Adda challenges: <b>But</b> if the handful is brought up and burned concurrent <b>with the setting of the sun, you do not find that the majority of it is consumed by the fire</b> before sunset. How does this <i>baraita</i> accord with Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire in order to render permitted the consumption of the remainder by the priests? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> does not require the consumption by fire of the majority of the handful, it is referring only to that which is required in order for the altar <b>to receive</b> the handful, so that it is considered the food of the altar and may continue to burn all night long. <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan states that in order <b>to render permitted</b> the consumption of the remainder by the priests, the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire.
The Gemara notes: <b>Rabbi Elazar teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> the way it was initially presented, as asking how it is known that items that are usually sacrificed during the day may be burned <b>after sunset. And he interprets</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to</b> parts of the offering that were <b>dislodged</b> from the fire after sunset, which may be returned to the fire throughout the night. <b>And similarly, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yannai said</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> parts that were <b>dislodged</b> from the fire after sunset.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yannai</b> in fact <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabbi Yannai say:</b> In the case of <b>incense that was dislodged from on top of the altar,</b> the priests <b>may not return even small lumps of it</b> to the fire? <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Ḥanina bar Minyumi from the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This teaches that if parts <b>of a burnt offering</b> that were partially <b>consumed</b> were dislodged from the external altar <b>you shall return</b> them, <b>but you do not return incense</b> that was partially <b>consumed</b> and was dislodged from the internal altar. The Gemara answers: <b>Remove from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>here</b> the word <b>incense,</b> so that it is not included in the list of items that may be burned throughout the night.
<b>Rabbi Asi said: When Rabbi Elazar would explain</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of</b> the <b>meal offerings,</b> he would <b>raise</b> this <b>dilemma: Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a handful that</b> a priest <b>arranged</b> on the altar, <b>and he arranged the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar <b>on top of it, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is <b>this</b> considered a proper <b>manner of burning, or</b> is <b>this not</b> considered a proper <b>manner of burning,</b> since the handful is not arranged on top of the wood? The Gemara comments: No answer was found, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Ḥizkiyya raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>limbs</b> of the burnt offering <b>that</b> a priest <b>arranged</b> on the altar <b>and arranged the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar <b>on top of them, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces and the head, and the fat, in order <b>upon the wood</b> that is on the fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8), teaching that they must be placed <b>specifically upon the wood? Or perhaps, since it is written</b> in <b>another verse: “That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that the burnt offering may be arranged directly on the altar, <b>if</b> the priest <b>desires</b> to arrange the limbs in <b>this</b> manner he may <b>do</b> so, <b>and if</b> he <b>desires</b> to arrange them in <b>that</b> manner he may also <b>do</b> so. The Gemara comments: No answer was found, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>limbs</b> of an offering <b>that</b> a priest <b>arranged adjacent to the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>Do not raise the dilemma according to</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says</b> that the phrase <b>“upon [<i>al</i>]</b> the wood” is meant <b>literally,</b>

Daf 27a

<b>as “upon [<i>al</i>]</b> the wood” <b>is written,</b> and not: Next to the wood.
<b>When should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says</b> in the mishna (96a) that the term <b>“upon [<i>al</i>]”</b> (see Numbers 2:20) means <b>adjacent to.</b> According to that <i>tanna</i>, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Is it explained that <b>here, too,</b> the phrase <b>“upon [<i>al</i>]</b> the wood” can mean <b>adjacent to</b> the wood? <b>Or perhaps,</b> the phrase “upon [<i>al</i>] the wood that is on the fire upon the altar” teaches that <b>“upon the wood”</b> is to be understood as <b>similar to “upon the altar”: Just as there “upon</b> the altar” is meant <b>literally, so too here,</b> the phrase <b>“upon</b> the wood” is meant <b>literally.</b> The Gemara comments: No answer was found, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the handful,</b> failure to sacrifice <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was sacrificed, from rendering it permitted for the priests to consume the remainder of the meal offering. With regard to <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour brought as a meal offering, failure to sacrifice <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was sacrificed, from qualifying as a proper meal offering. With regard to <b>the wine</b> poured as a libation, failure to pour <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was poured, from qualifying as a proper libation. With regard to <b>the</b> <i>log</i> of <b>oil</b> that is required for the meal offering, failure to add <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was added, from being a sufficient measure of oil.
With regard to <b>the fine flour and the oil,</b> failure to bring <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> failure to burn <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the failure to sacrifice the minority of the handful disqualifies the entire offering? This is derived from the fact that <b>the verse states “his handful” twice,</b> once with regard to the voluntary meal offering (Leviticus 2:2) and once with regard to the meal offering of a sinner (Leviticus 5:12), and any <i>halakha</i> repeated in the verses is deemed indispensable.
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour brought as a meal offering, failure to sacrifice <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from qualifying as a proper meal offering. <b>What is the reason? The verse states:</b> “The priest shall remove of it a handful <b>of its fine flour”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The usage of the term “of its fine flour” instead of: Of the fine flour, teaches <b>that if any amount</b> of its flour <b>was missing,</b> it is <b>not valid.</b>
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the wine</b> poured as a libation, failure to pour <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from qualifying as a proper libation. What is the reason? The verse states concerning the libations: <b>“So</b> shall it be done” (Numbers 15:11). The term “so” indicates that the libations must be sacrificed exactly in the manner described, without any deviation.
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the</b> <i>log</i> of <b>oil</b> that is required for the meal offering, failure to add <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from being a sufficient measure of oil. In the case of the oil <b>of the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is learned from the term: <b>“So”</b> (Numbers 15:11), stated with regard to the libations. <b>And</b> in the case of the <i>log</i> of oil that accompanies <b>a voluntary meal offering, the verse states: “And of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), demonstrating <b>that if any amount</b> of its oil was <b>missing,</b> it is <b>not valid.</b>
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the fine flour and the oil,</b> failure to bring <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the fact that the two are juxtaposed in the verse: “The priest shall remove of it a handful <b>of its fine flour and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and the fact that this requirement is repeated in the verse: <b>“Of its groats, and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:16), teaches that each is indispensable.
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> failure to burn <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the repetition of the mention of the two together in the verse, as it is written: “The priest shall remove of it a handful of its fine flour and of its oil, <b>as well as all of its frankincense”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and again with regard to the meal offering of a sinner it is stated: <b>“And all the frankincense which is upon the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the two goats of Yom Kippur,</b> the absence of <b>each</b> goat <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the two sheep</b> brought together with the meal offering of the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of the sheep <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to the <b>two loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, failure to bring <b>each</b> of the loaves <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b>
With regard to the <b>two arrangements</b> of the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the arrangements <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the bowls <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>and the bowls</b> of frankincense, failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b>
With regard to the <b>two types</b> of loaves <b>that</b> accompany the offerings <b>of a nazirite:</b> The bread and wafers (see Numbers 6:15); the <b>three</b> species <b>that</b> are part of the rite <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer:</b> The cedar, hyssop, and scarlet wool (see Numbers 19:6); <b>and</b> the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering:</b> The loaves, wafers, loaves soaked in hot water, and leavened bread (see Leviticus 7:12); <b>and</b> the <b>four</b> species <b>of the <i>lulav</i>:</b> The <i>lulav</i>, <i>etrog</i>, myrtle, and willow (see Leviticus 23:40); <b>and</b> the <b>four</b> species <b>that are</b> used <b>in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper:</b> The cedar, hyssop, scarlet wool, and birds (see Leviticus 14:4), failure to bring <b>each</b> of the components <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b>
With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> that the priest sprinkles opposite the entrance to the Sanctuary (see Numbers 19:4), failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on</b> the Ark <b>between the staves</b> (see Leviticus 16:14–15), the seven sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, and the sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the golden altar</b> on Yom Kippur, and from all other inner sin offerings, failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the two goats of Yom Kippur,</b> the absence of <b>each</b> goat <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> This is derived from the verse that states with regard to the Yom Kippur service: “And it shall be <b>a statute</b> forever” (Leviticus 16:29), since wherever the term “statute” appears concerning a sacrificial rite, it signifies that the rite is an indispensable requirement.
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the two sheep</b> brought together with the meal offering of the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of the sheep <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> This is derived from the verse: “They shall be holy” (Leviticus 23:20), since the employment of a term of <b>being</b> indicates an indispensable requirement. Similarly, with regard to the <b>two loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, the reason failure to bring each of the loaves prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse states: “They shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17), employing a term of <b>being.</b>
With regard to the <b>two arrangements</b> of the shewbread, the reason failure to place each of the arrangements prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse employs the term <b>statute</b> concerning them (see Leviticus 24:9). With regard to the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread, the reason failure to place each of the bowls prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse employs the term <b>statute</b> concerning them (see Leviticus 24:9). With regard to <b>the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>and the bowls</b> of frankincense, the reason failure to bring each of them prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse employs the term <b>statute</b> concerning them, as that verse addresses each of these two components.
With regard to the <b>two types</b> of loaves <b>that</b> accompany the offerings <b>of a nazirite,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the nazirite: <b>“So he must do</b> after the law of his naziriteship” (Numbers 6:21), demonstrating that must bring his offerings precisely as detailed in the verse. With regard to the <b>three</b> species <b>that</b> are part of the rite <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, since the term <b>statute</b> is written about them: “This is the statute of the law” (Numbers 19:2).
With regard to the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>since</b> the thanks offering <b>is juxtaposed to</b> the offerings of <b>a nazirite, as it is written</b> with regard to the thanks offering: <b>“With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving”</b> (Leviticus 7:13). <b>And the Master said:</b> The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of <b>the peace offering of a nazirite,</b> and it has already been demonstrated that with regard to the loaves that accompany the offerings of a nazirite, each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.
<b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>that are in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper”</b> (Leviticus 14:2), and the term “shall be” indicates an indispensable requirement. <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>of the <i>lulav</i>,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, as the verse states: <b>“And you shall take” [<i>ulkaḥtem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:40), which alludes to: <b>A complete taking [<i>lekiḥa tamma</i>],</b> comprising all four species.
§ <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the four species of the <i>lulav</i> are necessary for the fulfillment of the mitzva <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one did not have</b> all four species; <b>but</b> if <b>one has</b> all four species, failure to take each of the components <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, and he fulfills the mitzva by taking each species individually.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>four species of the <i>lulav</i>, two of them,</b> the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>, <b>produce fruit, and two of them,</b> the myrtle and willow, <b>do not produce fruit. Those that produce fruit have a bond with those that do not produce fruit, and those that do not produce fruit have a bond with those that produce fruit. And a person does not fulfill his obligation</b> of taking the <i>lulav</i> <b>until they are all</b> bound together <b>in a single bundle.</b>
<b>And so too,</b> when <b>the Jewish people</b> fast and pray <b>for acceptance</b> of their repentance, this is not accomplished <b>until they are all</b> bound together <b>in a single bundle, as it is stated: “It is He that builds His upper chambers in the Heaven, and has established His bundle upon the earth”</b> (Amos 9:6), which is interpreted as stating that only when the Jewish people are bound together are they established upon the earth. This <i>baraita</i> contradicts Rav Ḥanan bar Rava’s statement, since it teaches that the four species of the <i>lulav</i> must be taken together in order for one to fulfill his obligation of taking the <i>lulav</i>.
The Gemara answers: Whether the different species must be taken together <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>; as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>lulav</i>, whether</b> it is <b>bound</b> with the myrtle and willow or <b>whether</b> it is <b>not bound,</b> is <b>fit. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it is <b>bound,</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is <b>not bound,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: By means of a verbal analogy, he <b>derives</b> the term <b>taking,</b> written with regard to the four species, <b>from</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to <b>the bundle of hyssop.</b> It is written there, in the context of the sacrifice of the Paschal offering in Egypt: “Take a bundle of hyssop” (Exodus 12:22), and it is written here, with regard to the four species: “And you shall take for you on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40).
<b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, the mitzva to take the hyssop is specifically <b>in a bundle, so too here,</b> the mitzva to take the four species is specifically <b>in a bundle.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They do not derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>taking</b> from the meaning of the term <b>taking</b> by means of the verbal analogy.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>a mitzva to bind</b> the myrtle and the willow together with the <b><i>lulav</i>, but if one did not bind it,</b> it is <b>fit? In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> if <b>one did not bind it, why</b> is it <b>fit? If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what mitzva</b> is one fulfilling by binding it?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And what mitzva</b> is one fulfilling? The mitzva is <b>due to</b> the fact that it is stated: <b>“This is my God and I will beautify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2), which is interpreted to mean that one should beautify himself before God in the performance of the mitzvot. The Rabbis agree that although failure to bind the three species does not render them unfit for performing the mitzva, the performance of the mitzva is more beautiful when the <i>lulav</i> is bound.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood <b>of the heifer</b> that the priest sprinkles opposite the entrance to the Sanctuary, failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others,</b> since the term <b>statute</b> is written about them (see Numbers 19:2).
The mishna further teaches: With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on</b> the Ark <b>between the staves, and</b> the sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the golden altar</b> on Yom Kippur, and the sprinklings from all other inner sin offerings that are sprinkled on the golden altar, <b>and</b> the seven sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> With regard to the sprinklings <b>of Yom Kippur,</b> the reason that each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others is that the term <b>“statute” is written</b> about the Yom Kippur service (see Leviticus 16:29).
With regard to the sprinklings <b>of the bull of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>and of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and</b> those <b>of the goats of idol worship,</b> which are sprinkled on the Curtain and on the golden altar, the reason that each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin: <b>“So shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull</b> of the sin offering” of the anointed priest (Leviticus 4:20). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> that the bull offering for an unwitting communal sin is sacrificed in the same manner as the bull of the anointed priest, when the Torah has already explicitly specified the manner in which the service should take place? The reason it states it is in order <b>to repeat</b> the command <b>of the sprinklings,</b>

Daf 27b

to teach <b>that if one omitted one of the placements</b> of blood, <b>he has done nothing.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the priest <b>performed the seven sprinklings of</b> the blood of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer</b> improperly, <b>either</b> by performing them <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake or</b> performing them <b>not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b> of the Tabernacle (Numbers 19:4), which corresponds to the Sanctuary in the Temple, <b>they are not valid.</b>
<b>But</b> with regard to the sprinkling of the blood <b>that</b> takes place <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, of inner sin offerings, the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, the blood of the bull of the anointed priest, the blood of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and the blood of the goats of idol worship, which are to be sprinkled “before the Lord, in front of the Curtain of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>and</b> the sprinkling of the oil <b>that</b> takes place during the purification <b>of the leper,</b> which is done “seven times before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16), if these are performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> then <b>they are not valid.</b> But if they are performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the direction where they should be sprinkled, <b>they are valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>concerning</b> the sprinklings of the blood of the red <b>heifer</b> that if they were performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake, they are not valid,</b> but if they were performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting or Sanctuary, <b>they are valid? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult; this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whereas <b>that</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kelim</i> 1:10): With regard to <b>those who have not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, and therefore are not permitted to enter the Temple or partake of sacrificial meat, <b>who entered the</b> Temple <b>courtyard unwittingly,</b> they are <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering.</b> If they entered <b>intentionally,</b> then this is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>. And needless to say,</b> the same applies to <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed <b>and all the others who are ritually impure</b> and have not yet immersed.
<b>And</b> with regard to those who are <b>pure who entered beyond their boundaries,</b> i.e., beyond where it is permitted for them to enter, such as a priest who enters the Sanctuary for a purpose other than performing the Temple service, if one entered <b>any</b> part <b>of the Sanctuary,</b> he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>forty</b> lashes. If he entered <b>within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, i.e., into the Holy of Holies, or he entered the Holy of Holies all the way until he was <b>before the Ark Cover,</b> he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he entered <b>any</b> part <b>of the Sanctuary or within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>forty</b> lashes; <b>but</b> if he entered the Holy of Holies all the way until he was <b>before the Ark Cover,</b> he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven.
<b>With regard to what</b> issue <b>do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the proper understanding of <b>this verse: “And the Lord said to Moses: Speak to Aaron your brother, that he not come at all times into the holy place, within the Curtain, before the Ark Cover which is upon the Ark, that he not die”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that entering <b>into the holy place,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, is <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of: <b>He shall not come,</b> and one who violates it is punished with lashes, whereas entering <b>within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies <b>and before the Ark Cover</b> is <b>subject to</b> the warning of: <b>He shall not die,</b> and entering there is punished by death at the hand of Heaven.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that entering <b>into the holy place,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, <b>and within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies is <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of: <b>He shall not come,</b> and one who violates it is punished with lashes, whereas entering <b>before the Ark Cover</b> is <b>subject to</b> the warning of: <b>He shall not die,</b> and entering there is punished by death at the of Heaven.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the interpretation <b>of the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> to explain the verse <b>as Rabbi Yehuda says,</b> then <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> That he not come at all times <b>into the holy place and before the Ark Cover</b> that he not die, <b>and there is no need</b> to write <b>“within the Curtain,” and I would say:</b> If one <b>becomes liable</b> to receive lashes for even entering the <b>Sanctuary, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one incurs this punishment for entering <b>within the Curtain? Why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“within the Curtain” that the Merciful One wrote? Learn from</b> that seemingly extraneous term that entering the Holy of Holies is punishable <b>by death</b> at the hand of Heaven.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> understands: <b>If the Merciful One had written</b> only that it is prohibited to come <b>“into the holy place” and did not write “within the Curtain,” I would say: What</b> is the <b>holy place?</b> It is <b>within the Curtain,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies, and one who enters it violates a prohibition, <b>but</b> if one enters the <b>Sanctuary</b> he does <b>not even</b> violate <b>a prohibition. And the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim: <b>You cannot say that, as the entire Sanctuary is called</b> “the <b>holy place,” as it is stated: “And the Curtain shall divide for you between the holy place and the Holy of Holies”</b> (Exodus 26:33).
<b>And what is the reason</b> for the interpretation <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Why does he hold that one who enters the Holy of Holies violates a prohibition but is not punished with death at the hand of Heaven? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda holds that <b>if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> to explain <b>as the Rabbis say,</b> that entering the Holy of Holies is punishable by death at the hand of Heaven, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> That he not come at all times <b>into the holy place and within the Curtain</b> that he not die, <b>and there is no need</b> to write <b>“before the Ark Cover.” And I would say:</b> If entering <b>within the Curtain,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies, is punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one incurs this punishment for entering <b>before the Ark Cover? Why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“before the Ark Cover” that the Merciful One wrote? Learn from</b> that seemingly extraneous term that entering <b>before the Ark Cover</b> is punishable <b>by death</b> at the hand of Heaven, but entering <b>within the Curtain</b> merely violates <b>a prohibition.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis</b> understand: <b>Indeed,</b> it is so <b>that</b> in order to teach the punishment of death at the hand of Heaven it <b>is not necessary</b> for the verse to also state “before the Ark Cover.” <b>And</b> the reason <b>that the Merciful One wrote “before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover”</b> was in order <b>to exclude</b> one who entered the Holy of Holies through <b>a roundabout path,</b> as one who did not enter facing the Ark Cover, i.e., from the east, is not punished with death at the hand of Heaven.
This is <b>as the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught:</b> With regard to the verse: “And he shall sprinkle it with his finger <b>before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover to the east”</b> (Leviticus 16:14), <b>this established a paradigm</b> that <b>any place</b> in the Torah <b>where it is stated: “Before [<i>penei</i>],”</b> it is referring to <b>nothing other than before</b> the <b>eastern</b> side.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this, as it is clear that the term “before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover” is necessary to exclude one who entered the Holy of Holies through a roundabout path? The Gemara answers: According to Rabbi Yehuda, if the purpose was for that reason, <b>let the verse say: Before [<i>penei</i>]</b> the Ark Cover. <b>What</b> is the purpose of the word <b><i>el</i>? Learn from</b> that seemingly extraneous term that one is punished with death at the hand of Heaven <b>specifically</b> if he entered directly <b>before</b> the Ark, but not if he merely entered the Holy of Holies. <b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that the term <b>“<i>el</i>”</b> does <b>not</b> mean <b>specifically</b> one who enters directly before the Ark Cover.
The Gemara now returns to its suggestion that the contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> with regard to whether the sprinklings of the red heifer are valid or not when performed not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting can be resolved by explaining that one <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and the other is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that the expression <b>“before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover”</b> teaches that the punishment is limited to one who <b>specifically</b> entered directly before the Ark Cover, holds that the expression: <b>“And sprinkle</b> of its blood <b>toward [<i>el</i>] the front”</b> (Numbers 19:4), <b>also</b> means that the sprinklings must be performed <b>specifically</b> toward the front of the Sanctuary.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> are of the opinion that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that there</b> the term <i>el</i> does <b>not</b> mean <b>specifically</b> that one is liable to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven only if he enters directly before the Ark Cover, <b>here too</b> they hold that it is <b>not</b> meant <b>specifically,</b> and therefore the sprinklings are valid even when performed not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this</b> explanation: <b>According to Rabbi Yehuda, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> there the term <b><i>el</i></b> is used <b>specifically,</b> the verse: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood <b>before [<i>al</i></b> <i>penei</i>] the Ark Cover” (Leviticus 16:14) should <b>also</b> mean that the sprinkling must be performed <b>specifically</b> upon the Ark Cover. <b>But</b> in the time <b>of the Second Temple, where there was no Ark or Ark Cover,</b> would Rabbi Yehuda then say that <b>indeed</b> the <b>sprinklings were not performed?</b> This is clearly not correct, as all agree that the sprinklings were performed in the Second Temple (see <i>Yoma</i> 53b).
<b>Rabba bar Ulla said</b> in response: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And he shall make atonement for the most holy place [<i>mikdash hakodesh</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 16:33), which is interpreted as follows: He will sprinkle the blood to make atonement not specifically on the Ark [<i>hakodesh</i>], but even on <b>the place that is dedicated [<i>hamkudash</i>] for the Ark [<i>lakodesh</i>].</b>
The Gemara offers another resolution of the contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i> concerning whether the sprinklings of the red heifer are valid or invalid when performed not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. <b>Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis:</b>

Daf 28a

<b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the sprinklings are valid only when performed precisely toward the entran ce of the Tent of Meeting, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest is <b>standing</b> with his back to the <b>east and</b> his front facing <b>west and he sprinkles</b> the blood. In this case, although the priest does not direct the sprinklings precisely toward the entrance of the Sanctuary, they are valid since he himself is facing the Sanctuary. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the sprinklings are not valid when performed not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest is <b>standing</b> facing <b>north or south and he sprinkles</b> the blood. In this case, since he is facing the wrong direction they are not valid.
§ <b>The Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> with regard to the sprinkling of the blood <b>that</b> takes place <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and</b> the sprinkling of the oil <b>that</b> takes place during the purification <b>of the leper,</b> if these are performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> then <b>they are not valid.</b> But if they were performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the Holy of Holies, <b>they are valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to the sprinklings of oil during the purification of the leper, <b>whether</b> they were performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake or</b> whether they were performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the Holy of Holies, <b>they are valid?</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, and that</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> He explains: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is the <i>tanna</i> <b>who juxtaposes</b> the <b>guilt offering to a sin offering,</b> teaching that just as a sin offering is disqualified when sacrificed not for its sake, so too, the guilt offering, such as the leper’s guilt offering, is disqualified when sacrificed not for its sake, as it is written: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; there is one law for them” (Leviticus 7:7). He <b>also juxtaposes</b> the <b><i>log</i></b> of oil of the leper <b>to</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> of the leper in the same verse, teaching that if the sprinkling from the <i>log</i> of oil was performed not for its own sake, it is not valid. In contrast, <b>the Rabbis do not juxtapose</b> the guilt offering to the sin offering, and therefore they have no reason to invalidate the sprinkling from the leper’s <i>log</i> of oil that is performed not for its own sake.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer, is it so that a matter derived via juxtaposition then teaches</b> a <i>halakha</i> to another case <b>via juxtaposition?</b> There is a principle that with regard to consecrated matters, a <i>halakha</i> derived via juxtaposition cannot subsequently teach a <i>halakha</i> via juxtaposition. Therefore, the necessity for the sprinklings of the <i>log</i> of oil to be performed for its own sake cannot be derived from juxtaposition between the guilt offering of the leper and the sprinkling of the oil.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the sprinklings are valid, it means that they were effective <b>in rendering the offering valid</b> and allowing the priests to partake of the remainder of the <i>log</i>, whereas <b>there,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the sprinklings are not valid, it means that they do not <b>effect acceptance, as they do not satisfy the obligation of the owner,</b> and therefore the leper is still prohibited from partaking of sacrificial meat.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the <b>seven branches of the Candelabrum</b> (see Exodus 25:32), the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> With regard to <b>its seven lamps</b> atop the branches, the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> With regard to the <b>two passages that are in the <i>mezuza</i>,</b> which are the first (Deuteronomy 6:1–9) and second (Deuteronomy 11:13–21) paragraphs of <i>Shema</i>, the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> Furthermore, the absence of <b>even one letter prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with</b> the rest of <b>them.</b>
With regard to the <b>four passages that are in the phylacteries,</b> which are the two passages in the <i>mezuza</i> and two additional passages (Exodus 13:1–10, 11–16), the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> Furthermore, the absence of <b>even one letter prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with</b> the rest of <b>them.</b> With regard to the <b>four ritual fringes</b> on a garment, the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, as the four of them</b> constitute <b>one mitzva. Rabbi Yishmael says: The four of them are four</b> discrete <b>mitzvot,</b> and the absence of one does not prevent fulfillment of the mitzva with the rest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the absence of any of the seven branches of the Candelabrum prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written concerning them</b> a term of <b>being:</b> “Their knobs and their branches shall be of one piece with it” (Exodus 25:36), and a term of being indicates an indispensable requirement.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ḥullin</i> 1:18): The <b>Candelabrum was fashioned from</b> a complete <b>block [<i>ha’eshet</i>] and from gold.</b> If they <b>fashioned it from fragments [<i>hagerutaot</i>]</b> of gold then it is <b>unfit,</b> but if they fashioned it <b>from other types of metal</b> rather than gold, it is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>different</b> about a Candelabrum made <b>from fragments</b> of gold, that it is rendered <b>unfit? As it is written</b> with regard to it: “Their knobs and their branches shall be of one piece with it, the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold” (Exodus 25:36), employing the term <b>“beaten [<i>miksha</i>]” and</b> a term of <b>being,</b> indicating that it is an indispensable requirement. But accordingly, a Candelabrum fashioned from <b>other types of metal</b> should be rendered unfit <b>as well,</b> since the verse states that it is made from <b>gold and</b> uses a term of <b>being.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work <b>will</b> the Candelabrum <b>be made”</b> (Exodus 25:31), <b>to include other types of metal.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the expression “will be made” serves <b>to include</b> a Candelabrum fashioned from <b>fragments</b> of gold? The Gemara answers: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as</b> the term of <b>being,</b> which indicates an indispensable requirement, <b>is written with regard to</b> the command that the Candelabrum be <b>a beaten work,</b> i.e., fashioned from a single block and not from different fragments, as it is stated: “Shall be of one beaten work” (Exodus 25:36).
The Gemara challenges: But the term <b>“will be made” is also written with regard to</b> the command that the Candelabrum be <b>a beaten work,</b> as it is written: “Of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31). The Gemara answers: The term <b>“beaten work”</b> appears in Exodus 25:31, and the term <b>“beaten work”</b> appears again in Exodus 25:36, <b>to</b> demonstrate that this requirement is <b>indispensable.</b>
The Gemara challenges: But the term <b>“gold”</b> appears in Exodus 25:31, and the term <b>“gold”</b> appears again in Exodus 25:36. Why not also say that this <b>as well</b> is <b>to</b> demonstrate that this requirement is <b>indispensable?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that when the Candelabrum is fashioned <b>from fragments</b> of gold it is <b>unfit</b> but when fashioned <b>from other types of metal</b> it is <b>fit,</b> then <b>this is</b> the reason that it was necessary for the verse to state <b>“gold,” “gold”</b> twice, and <b>“a beaten work,” “a beaten work”</b> twice, <b>to</b> teach <b>an interpretation,</b> which is explained shortly. <b>But if you say</b> that when the Candelabrum is fashioned <b>from fragments</b> of gold it is <b>fit</b> but when fashioned <b>from other types of metal</b> it is <b>unfit, what do you interpret from</b> the repeated terms <b>“gold,” “gold”</b> and <b>“a beaten work,” “a beaten work”?</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>What interpretation</b> is referenced above? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Of a talent of pure gold will it be made, with all these vessels”</b> (Exodus 25:39); this verse teaches that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold,</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> with the precise weight of <b>a talent;</b> and if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> with the precise weight of <b>a talent.</b> Similarly, the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work shall the Candelabrum be made, even its base, its shaft, <b>its goblets, its knobs, and its flowers”</b> (Exodus 25:31), teaches that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>goblets, knobs, and flowers,</b> and if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>goblets, knobs, and flowers.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then why not <b>also say</b> with regard to the branches of the Candelabrum, which are described in Exodus 25:31 along with the term “gold,” that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>branches,</b> but if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>branches?</b> The Gemara answers: A vessel like <b>that is called a candlestick [<i>pamot</i>],</b> not a candelabrum.
With regard to the second derivation mentioned, the Gemara elaborates: The verse states: <b>“And this was the work of the Candelabrum, beaten work of gold,</b> to the base thereof, and to the flowers thereof, it was beaten work” (Numbers 8:4). This teaches that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> as <b>a beaten work,</b> but if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> as <b>a beaten work</b> and may be made from fragments.
The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> purpose does the term <b>“beaten work”</b> that is repeated again <b>in the latter clause</b> of the verse <b>come?</b> The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to exclude</b> the <b>trumpets,</b> teaching that they are fit even if they were not fashioned from a single block. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The silver <b>trumpets</b> that Moses was commanded to fashion in the wilderness <b>were</b> to be <b>fashioned from</b> a complete <b>block</b> and <b>from silver.</b> If one <b>fashioned them from fragments they are fit,</b> but if he fashioned them <b>from other types of metal</b> then <b>they are unfit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is <b>different</b> about trumpets made <b>from other types of metal</b> that <b>they are</b> rendered <b>unfit? As it is written</b> with regard to the trumpets: “Make for yourself two trumpets of silver; of beaten work you shall make them; and they shall be for you for the calling of the congregation” (Numbers 10:2). The verse employs the terms <b>silver and being,</b> indicating that it is an indispensable requirement. But accordingly, trumpets fashioned <b>from fragments</b> should be rendered unfit <b>as well,</b> since the verse employs the terms <b>beaten work and being.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excludes</b> the trumpets when it states <b>with regard to</b> the <b>Candelabrum: “It was beaten work”</b> (Numbers 8:4), indicating that <b>it</b> alone, <b>but not</b> the <b>trumpets,</b> was beaten work.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of the vessels</b>

Daf 28b

<b>that Moses fashioned</b> were <b>fit for his</b> generation <b>and</b> were <b>fit for</b> future <b>generations.</b> Yet the <b>trumpets</b> that Moses fashioned were <b>fit for his</b> generation <b>but</b> were <b>unfit for</b> future <b>generations.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <b>trumpets</b> were unfit for future generations? <b>If we say that</b> it is because <b>the verse states: “Make for you</b> two silver trumpets” (Numbers 10:2), meaning that they are fit <b>for you, but not for</b> future <b>generations,</b> that is difficult; <b>if that is so,</b> then the verse: <b>“Make for you an Ark of wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1), should <b>also</b> teach <b>that</b> the Ark is fit only <b>for you, but not for</b> future <b>generations.</b> This cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as the <i>baraita</i> stated explicitly that all vessels, other than the trumpets, that were fashioned by Moses were fit for future generations.
<b>Rather,</b> the term “for you” that is written with regard to the fashioning of the Ark should be understood <b>either according to the one who says</b> that <b>“for you”</b> means <b>from your own</b> property, <b>or according to the one who says</b> that God said to Moses: <b>I desire, as it were,</b> that the Ark be fashioned <b>from your</b> property <b>more than</b> I desire that it be fashioned <b>from</b> the property <b>of</b> the rest of the nation (see <i>Yoma</i> 3b). Accordingly, <b>here too,</b> with regard to the trumpets, the term “for you” <b>should be</b> understood in <b>this</b> manner. The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> with regard to the trumpets, <b>it is different, as the verse states “for you” twice: “Make for you</b> two trumpets of silver, of beaten work you shall make them, <b>and they shall be for you</b> for the calling of the congregation” (Numbers 10:2).
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa, son of Rav Ḥanin, taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yosef:</b> The <b>Candelabrum</b> could be <b>fashioned from</b> a complete <b>block</b> and <b>from gold.</b> If one <b>fashioned it from silver,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If one fashioned it <b>from tin, or from lead, or from other types of metal [<i>gisteron</i>], Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>unfit, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems</b> it <b>fit.</b> If one fashioned it <b>from wood, or from bone, or from glass, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>unfit.</b>
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: What,</b> in <b>your opinion,</b> is the explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? Rav Pappa, son of Rav Ḥanin, <b>said to him: Both</b> this <b>Sage and</b> that <b>Sage interpret</b> the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31), by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> The verse begins with a generalization: “And you will make a Candelabrum,” followed by a detail: “Of pure gold,” which is then followed by a generalization: “Will the Candelabrum be made.” According to the hermeneutic principle of generalizations and details, this teaches that any item that is similar to the detail is also deemed fit.
<b>But</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined</b> as a type <b>of metal, so too, all</b> other types <b>of metal</b> may be used in fashioning the Candelabrum. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined</b> as <b>an item of substantial value, so too, all items of substantial value</b> may be used in fashioning the Candelabrum. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Remove your</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>in light of my</b> <i>baraita</i>.
Rav Yosef continued: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to Temple <b>service vessels that</b> one <b>fashioned from wood, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> them <b>unfit and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems</b> them <b>fit.</b> According to this <i>baraita</i>, their dispute was with regard to a Candelabrum fashioned from wood, not from metal. Rav Yosef explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>interprets</b> verses by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, interprets</b> verses by means of the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b>
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>interprets</b> the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31), by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details. “And you will make a Candelabrum of”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as the material of the Candelabrum is not specified; <b>“pure gold”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> limiting the material exclusively to gold; and by then stating: <b>“Of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made,”</b> the verse <b>then makes a generalization.</b> The result is <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization,</b> from which <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail,</b> leading to this conclusion: <b>Just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined</b> as a type <b>of metal, so too, all</b> other types <b>of metal</b> may be used in fashioning the Candelabrum.
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, interprets</b> the verse by means of the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions. “And you will make a Candelabrum of”</b> is <b>an amplification,</b> as the material of the Candelabrum is not specified; <b>“pure gold”</b> is <b>a restriction,</b> limiting the material exclusively to gold; and by then stating: <b>“Of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made,”</b> the verse <b>repeated and amplified.</b> There is a hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except the specific matter excluded in the restriction. <b>And what did</b> the verse <b>include? It includes all materials,</b> even wood. <b>And what did</b> the verse <b>exclude</b> with this restriction? <b>It excluded</b> a Candelabrum fashioned <b>from earthenware,</b> which is furthest in quality from gold.
Rav Pappa, son of Rav Ḥanin, said to him: <b>On the contrary, remove your</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>in light of my</b> <i>baraita</i>. Rav Yosef responded: That <b>cannot enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: If the one who is fashioning the Candelabrum <b>has no gold, he may bring even</b> a Candelabrum made <b>of silver, of copper, of iron, of tin, or of lead. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems</b> it <b>fit even</b> if it was fashioned <b>from wood.</b> It is evident from this <i>baraita</i> that the dispute pertains only to a Candelabrum fashioned from wood, and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees that it may be fashioned from other types of metal.
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not construct a house</b> in the exact <b>form of</b> the <b>Sanctuary,</b> nor <b>a portico [<i>akhsadra</i>] corresponding to</b> the <b>Entrance Hall</b> of the Sanctuary, nor <b>a courtyard corresponding to</b> the Temple <b>courtyard,</b> nor <b>a table corresponding to</b> the <b>Table</b> in the Temple, nor <b>a candelabrum corresponding to</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> in the Temple. <b>But one may fashion</b> a candelabrum <b>of five or of six or of eight</b> branches. <b>And</b> one <b>may not fashion</b> a candelabrum <b>of seven</b> branches, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if he constructs it <b>from other kinds of metal</b> rather than gold, since the Candelabrum used in the Temple may be fashioned from other metals.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> One <b>may not even fashion</b> a candelabrum <b>from wood, in the manner that the kings of the Hasmonean monarchy did</b> in the Temple. The Candelabrum used in the Temple in the time of the Hasmonean kings was fashioned from wood. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda: You seek to bring <b>a proof from there?</b> In the time of the Hasmoneans the Candelabrum was not fashioned from wood but from <b>spits [<i>shappudim</i>] of iron, and they covered them with tin.</b> Later, when <b>they grew richer</b> and could afford to fashion a Candelabrum of higher-quality material, <b>they fashioned</b> the Candelabrum <b>from silver.</b> When <b>they again grew richer, they fashioned</b> the Candelabrum <b>from gold.</b>
§ <b>Shmuel says in the name of</b> a certain <b>elder: The height of</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> was <b>eighteen handbreadths. The base and the flower</b> that was upon the base were a height of <b>three handbreadths; and two handbreadths</b> above that were <b>bare; and</b> there was above that <b>one handbreadth, which</b> had <b>a goblet, knob, and flower on it. And two handbreadths</b> above that were <b>bare, and</b> there was above that <b>one handbreadth</b> that had <b>a knob.</b>
<b>And two branches emerge from</b> the knob, <b>one toward this</b> direction <b>and one toward that</b> direction, <b>and they extend and rise up to the height of the Candelabrum. And one handbreadth</b> above that was <b>bare, and</b> there was above that <b>one handbreadth</b> that had <b>a knob. And two branches emerge from</b> the knob, <b>one toward this</b> direction <b>and one toward that</b> direction, <b>and they extend and rise up to the height of</b> the <b>Candelabrum. And</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> above that was <b>bare, and</b> there was above that one <b>handbreadth</b> that had <b>a knob. And two branches emerge from</b> the knob, <b>one toward this</b> direction <b>and one toward that</b> direction, <b>and they extend and rise up to the height of</b> the <b>Candelabrum. And two handbreadths</b> above that were <b>bare.</b> There then <b>remained there three handbreadths in which</b> there were <b>three goblets, and a knob, and a flower.</b>
<b>And</b> the <b>goblets</b> of the Candelabrum, <b>to what are they similar?</b> They were <b>like Alexandrian goblets,</b> which are long and narrow. The <b>knobs, to what are they similar?</b> They were <b>like</b> the shape of <b>the apples of the Cherethites.</b> The <b>flowers, to what are they similar?</b> They were <b>like the ornaments</b> that are etched in <b>columns. And</b> there <b>are found to be</b> a total of <b>twenty-two goblets, eleven knobs,</b> and <b>nine flowers</b> on the Candelabrum.
With regard to the <b>goblets,</b> the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others;</b> with regard to the <b>knobs,</b> the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others;</b> with regard to the <b>flowers,</b> the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> With regard to the <b>goblets, knobs, and flowers,</b> the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> there were <b>twenty-two goblets</b> on the Candelabrum, <b>as it is written: “And in the Candelabrum four goblets</b> made like almond blossoms” (Exodus 25:34), <b>and it is written: “Three goblets made like almond blossoms in one branch, a knob, and a flower;</b> and three goblets made like almond blossoms in the other branch, a knob, and a flower; so for the six branches going out of the Candelabrum” (Exodus 25:33). Therefore, the Candelabrum contains the <b>four</b> goblets <b>of its</b> main shaft,

Daf 29a

<b>and</b> the <b>eighteen of the</b> six <b>branches; this</b> equals <b>twenty-two</b> goblets. Concerning the <b>knobs as well,</b> it is clear how the number <b>eleven</b> was reached. The Candelabrum contains the <b>two knobs of its</b> main shaft, as the verse states: “Its knobs” (Exodus 25:34), with the plural “knobs” indicating that there were two, <b>and</b> the <b>six of</b> the six <b>branches,</b> as it is written: “In one branch, a knob and a flower” (Exodus 25:33). In addition to these eight knobs, the verse states: <b>“And a knob</b> under two branches of one piece with it, <b>and a knob</b> under two branches of one piece with it, <b>and a knob</b> under two branches of one piece with it” (Exodus 25:35); <b>this</b> equals <b>eleven</b> knobs.
<b>But from where do we</b> derive that the Candelabrum contained <b>nine flowers?</b> According to the verse there are the <b>two flowers of its</b> main shaft, as it is written: “And its flowers” (Exodus 25:34), <b>and the six of</b> the six <b>branches,</b> as it is written: “In one branch, a knob and a flower” (Exodus 25:33), meaning that <b>there are eight,</b> not nine, flowers on the Candelabrum. <b>Rav Shalman said</b> in response: <b>It is written: “It was a beaten work, from the base to the flower”</b> (Numbers 8:4), which teaches that there was a ninth flower near the base.
<b>Rav says: The height of</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> is <b>nine handbreadths. Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Rav:</b> We learned in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 30b): <b>There was a stone before</b> the <b>Candelabrum and it had three steps, upon which the priest</b> would <b>stand and prepare the lamps</b> for kindling. If the Candelabrum was only nine handbreadths high, why would it be necessary for the priest to stand on an elevated surface to reach the lamps?
Rav <b>said to him: Shimi,</b> is it <b>you</b> who is asking me such a question? <b>When I said</b> that the height of the Candelabrum is nine handbreadths, I was referring not to the total height, which is eighteen handbreadths; rather, I meant that the Candelabrum is nine handbreadths <b>from the point</b> at which the <b>branches</b> extend from the main shaft <b>and above.</b>
§ <b>It is written: “And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold [<i>mikhlot zahav</i>]”</b> (II Chronicles 4:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b><i>mikhlot zahav</i>? Rav Ami says:</b> It is a reference to the fact <b>that</b> the Candelabrum and its vessels <b>exhausted [<i>kilattu</i>] all of Solomon’s pure [<i>sagur</i>] gold [<i>zahav</i>],</b> which was used in its fashioning in such great quantities. <b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav said: Solomon made ten Candelabrums, and for each and every one he brought one thousand talents of gold, and they placed</b> the gold <b>in the furnace</b> to refine it <b>one thousand times, until they reduced</b> the gold <b>to</b> one <b>talent</b> for each Candelabrum, as it is stated: “Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made” (Exodus 25:39).
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so</b> that all of Solomon’s gold was exhausted for the fashioning of the Candelabrum and its vessels? <b>But isn’t it written: “And all King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon”</b> (II Chronicles 9:20)? The Gemara answers: <b>We are saying</b> that Solomon’s <b>pure gold</b> was exhausted for the fashioning of the Candelabrum, but not all of his gold.
The Gemara asks: <b>And would</b> refining the gold <b>reduce</b> it <b>to this extent,</b> that one thousand talents of gold would be reduced to one talent? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: An incident</b> occurred where the weight of <b>the Candelabrum of the Temple was</b> found to be <b>greater than</b> the weight of the Candelabrum <b>of Moses by</b> one <b><i>Kordikini</i> gold dinar, and they placed it in the furnace eighty times until</b> the weight of the Candelabrum <b>stood at</b> precisely one <b>talent.</b> Evidently, putting the Candelabrum into a furnace reduces its weight by very little. The Gemara answers: <b>Once it is standing, it is standing,</b> i.e., since the gold was refined to such a degree in the time of Solomon, later when it was refined eighty times it was reduced by the weight of only one dinar.
§ <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Upon the pure Candelabrum”</b> (Leviticus 24:4)? It teaches <b>that</b> the procedure for <b>fashioning it descended,</b> i.e., was shown to Moses, <b>from the place of purity,</b> i.e., by God, who showed Moses a model of the Candelabrum. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> is that to say that phrase <b>“upon the pure Table”</b> (Leviticus 24:6) also teaches <b>that</b> the procedure for <b>fashioning it</b> was shown to Moses <b>from the place of purity? Rather,</b> the expression “the <b>pure</b> Table” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure. Here too,</b> the expression “the <b>pure</b> Candelabrum” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Granted,</b> the inference drawn <b>there</b> with regard to the Table is <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Reish Lakish</b> says; <b>as Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Upon the pure Table”</b> (Leviticus 24:6)? The expression “pure Table” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure,</b> but why? Isn’t the Table <b>a wooden vessel designated to rest</b> in a fixed place, <b>and any wooden vessel that is designated to rest</b> in a fixed place <b>is not susceptible to</b> becoming <b>ritually impure? Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that</b> the Table was not always left in a fixed place; the priests would <b>lift</b> the Table with its shewbread <b>to display the shewbread to the pilgrims</b> standing in the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> a priest would <b>say to them: See your affection before the Omnipresent.</b> For this reason, the Table is susceptible to becoming ritually impure.
Parenthetically, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: See <b>your affection</b> before God? It is <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: A great miracle was performed with the shewbread:</b> Its condition at the time of <b>its removal</b> from the Table, after having been left there for a week, was <b>like</b> its condition at the time of <b>its arrangement</b> on the Table, <b>as it is stated: “To place hot bread on the day when it was taken away”</b> (I Samuel 21:7), indicating that it was as hot on the day of its removal as it was on the day when it was placed on the Table.
The Gemara resumes stating its objection: <b>But here,</b> with regard to the Candelabrum, there is no reason to explain that the expression “the <b>pure</b> Candelabrum” teaches, <b>by inference, that it is</b> susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure;</b> this is <b>obvious,</b> as the Candelabrums <b>are metal vessels, and metal vessels are susceptible to</b> becoming <b>ritually impure</b> whether or not they remain in a fixed location. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the expression “the pure Candelabrum” teaches <b>that</b> the procedure for <b>fashioning it descended,</b> i.e., was shown to Moses, <b>from the place of purity.</b>
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: An Ark of fire and a Table of fire and a Candelabrum of fire descended from the Heavens, and Moses saw</b> their format <b>and fashioned</b> the vessels for the Tabernacle <b>in their likeness. As it is stated</b> after the command to fashion these items: <b>“And see that you make them after their pattern, which is being shown to you in the mount”</b> (Exodus 25:40).
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> is that to say that the verse: <b>“And you shall set up the Tabernacle according to its fashion which has been shown to you in the mount”</b> (Exodus 26:30), <b>also</b> indicates that God showed Moses a Tabernacle of fire? The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, <b>it is written: “According to its fashion,”</b> meaning that it should be built according to the instructions given to Moses, whereas <b>there,</b> with regard to the Ark, Table, and Candelabrum, <b>it is written: “After their pattern,”</b> indicating that an actual model of the items was shown to Moses.
Apropos this discussion the Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The angel <b>Gabriel</b> was <b>girded with a type of</b> wide <b>belt [<i>pesikiyya</i>]</b> in the manner of artisans who tie up their clothes to prevent these clothes from hindering them in their work. <b>And he showed</b> the precise <b>way to fashion the Candelabrum to Moses, as it is written: “And this is the work of the Candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:4), and the term “this” indicates that an exact replica was shown to him.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Three matters were difficult for Moses</b> to comprehend precisely, <b>until the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed</b> them to <b>him with His finger, and these are</b> the three matters: The form of the <b>Candelabrum, and</b> the exact size of the <b>new moon, and</b> the impure <b>creeping animals.</b> The <b>Candelabrum</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And this is the work of the Candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:4). The <b>new moon</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “This month shall be for you the beginning of months”</b> (Exodus 12:2). The <b>creeping animals</b> were shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And these are they which are unclean for you</b> among the swarming things” (Leviticus 11:29). <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that God <b>also</b> showed Moses <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughtering, as it is stated: “Now this is that which you shall sacrifice upon the altar”</b> (Exodus 29:38), and slaughtering is the first ritual of sacrifice.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the <b>two passages that are in the <i>mezuza</i>,</b> the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others. And</b> furthermore, the absence of <b>even one letter prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with</b> the rest of <b>them.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the absence of even one letter prevents fulfillment of the mitzva, since it is written: “And you shall write them [<i>ukhtavtam</i>]” (Deuteronomy 6:9), which teaches that the writing [<i>ketav</i>] must be complete [<i>tam</i>]?
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It <b>was necessary</b> to state that <b>only</b> to teach that even the absence of <b>the thorn,</b> i.e., the small stroke, <b>of</b> a letter <b><i>yod</i></b> prevents fulfillment of the mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t <b>this also obvious,</b> since the letter is not formed properly? <b>Rather,</b> it is necessary <b>according to another</b> statement <b>that Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav</b> says, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Any letter that is not encircled with</b> blank <b>parchment on</b> all <b>four of its sides,</b> i.e., where its ink connects to the letter above it, below it, preceding it, or succeeding it, is <b>unfit.</b> When the mishna makes reference to one letter preventing fulfillment of the mitzva, it is referring to a letter that touches an adjacent letter.
<b>Ashiyan bar Nadbakh says in the name of Rav Yehuda:</b> If <b>the inner</b> part <b>of</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> was perforated</b> it is <b>fit,</b> but if the perforation was in <b>the leg of</b> the letter <i>heh</i> it is <b>unfit. Rabbi Zeira says:</b> This matter was <b>explained to me by Rav Huna, and Rabbi Ya’akov says:</b> This matter was <b>explained to me by Rav Yehuda:</b> If <b>the inner</b> part <b>of</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> was perforated</b> it is <b>fit.</b> In a case where the perforation was in <b>the leg of</b> the letter <i>heh</i>, then <b>if there remained in</b> the leg that is attached to the roof of the letter <b>the equivalent of the measure of a small letter,</b> i.e., the letter <i>yod</i>, then it is <b>fit. But if not,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Agra, the father-in-law of Rabbi Abba,</b>

Daf 29b

had the <b>leg of</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> in</b> the term: <b>“The nation [<i>ha’am</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:3), written in his phylacteries, <b>severed by a perforation. He came before</b> his son-in-law <b>Rabbi Abba</b> to clarify the <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: If there remains in</b> the leg that is attached to the roof of the letter <b>the equivalent of the measure of a small letter,</b> i.e., the letter <i>yod</i>, it is <b>fit. But if not,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rami bar Tamrei, who</b> was <b>the father-in-law of Rami bar Dikkulei,</b> had the <b>leg of</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> in</b> the term: <b>“And</b> the Lord <b>slew [<i>vayaharog</i>]</b> all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:15), written in his phylacteries, <b>severed by a perforation. He came before Rabbi Zeira</b> to clarify the <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Go bring a child who is neither wise nor stupid,</b> but of average intelligence; <b>if he reads</b> the term as <b>“And</b> the Lord <b>slew [<i>vayaharog</i>]”</b> then it is <b>fit,</b> as despite the perforation the letter is still seen as a <i>vav</i>. But <b>if not,</b> then it is as though the term <b>were: Will be slain [<i>yehareg</i>],</b> written without the letter <i>vav</i>, <b>and</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: When Moses ascended on High, he found the Holy One, Blessed be He, sitting and tying crowns on the letters</b> of the Torah. Moses <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, who is preventing You</b> from giving the Torah without these additions? God <b>said to him: There is a man who is destined to be</b> born <b>after several generations, and Akiva ben Yosef</b> is <b>his name; he is destined to derive from each and every thorn</b> of these crowns <b>mounds</b> upon <b>mounds of <i>halakhot</i>.</b> It is for his sake that the crowns must be added to the letters of the Torah.
Moses <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, show him to me.</b> God <b>said to him: Return behind you.</b> Moses <b>went and sat at the end of the eighth row</b> in Rabbi Akiva’s study hall <b>and did not understand what they were saying.</b> Moses’ <b>strength waned,</b> as he thought his Torah knowledge was deficient. <b>When</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>arrived at</b> the discussion of <b>one matter, his students said to him: My teacher, from where do you</b> derive this? Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them:</b> It is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> When Moses heard this, <b>his mind was put at ease,</b> as this too was part of the Torah that he was to receive.
Moses <b>returned and came before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> and <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, You have a man</b> as great <b>as this and</b> yet <b>You</b> still choose to <b>give the Torah through me.</b> Why? God <b>said to him: Be silent; this intention arose before Me.</b> Moses <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, You have shown me</b> Rabbi Akiva’s <b>Torah,</b> now <b>show me his reward.</b> God <b>said to him: Return</b> to where you were. Moses <b>went back</b> and <b>saw that they were weighing</b> Rabbi Akiva’s <b>flesh in a butcher shop [<i>bemakkulin</i>],</b> as Rabbi Akiva was tortured to death by the Romans. Moses <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, this is Torah and this is its reward?</b> God <b>said to him: Be silent; this intention arose before Me.</b>
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the crowns on letters of the Torah: <b>Rava says: Seven letters require three crowns [<i>ziyyunin</i>], and they are</b> the letters <b><i>shin</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>tet</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>zayin</i>; <i>gimmel</i></b> and <b><i>tzadi</i>. Rav Ashi says: I have seen that the exacting scribes of the study hall of Rav would put a hump-like stroke on the roof of</b> the letter <b><i>ḥet</i> and they would suspend the</b> left <b>leg of</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>,</b> i.e., they would ensure that it is not joined to the roof of the letter.
Rava explains: <b>They would put a hump-like stroke on the roof of</b> the letter <b><i>ḥet</i> as if to</b> thereby <b>say:</b> The Holy One, Blessed be <b>He, lives [<i>ḥai</i>] in the heights of the universe. And they would suspend the</b> left <b>leg of</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>, as Rabbi Yehuda Nesia asked Rabbi Ami: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord [<i>beYah</i>] is God, an everlasting [<i>olamim</i>] Rock”</b> (Isaiah 26:4)? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: Anyone who puts their trust in the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will have Him as <b>his refuge in this world and in the World-to-Come.</b> This is alluded to in the word “<i>olamim</i>,” which can also mean: Worlds.
Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: I was not asking about the literal meaning of the verse; <b>this is</b> what poses <b>a difficulty for me: What is different</b> about that <b>which is written:</b> “For <b>in the Lord [<i>beYah</i>],” and it is not written:</b> For <b>the Lord [<i>Yah</i>]?</b>
Rav Ashi responded: It is <b>as Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Elai taught:</b> The verse “For in the Lord [<i>beYah</i>] is God, an everlasting Rock [<i>Tzur olamim</i>]” is understood as follows: The term “<i>Tzur olamim</i>” can also mean Creator of worlds. <b>These</b> letters <i>yod</i> and <i>heh</i> that constitute the word <i>yah</i> are referring to the <b>two worlds that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created; one with [<i>be</i>]</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> and one with [<i>be</i>]</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i>. And I do not know whether the World-to-Come</b> was created <b>with</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i> and this world</b> was created <b>with</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>,</b> or <b>whether this world</b> was created <b>with</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i> and the World-to-Come</b> was created <b>with</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>.</b>
<b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created [<i>behibare’am</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:4), <b>do not read</b> it as <b><i>behibare’am</i>,</b> meaning: When they were created; <b>rather,</b> read it as <b><i>beheh bera’am</i>,</b> meaning: He created them with the letter <i>heh</i>. This verse demonstrates that the heaven and the earth, i.e., this world, were created with the letter <i>heh</i>, and therefore the World-to-Come must have been created with the letter <i>yod</i>.
<b>And for what</b> reason <b>was this world created</b> specifically <b>with</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>?</b> It is <b>because</b> the letter <i>heh</i>, <b>which</b> is open on its bottom, has <b>a similar</b> appearance <b>to a portico,</b> which is open on one side. And it alludes to this world, <b>where anyone who wishes to leave may leave,</b> i.e., every person has the ability to choose to do evil. <b>And what is the reason</b> that the left <b>leg of</b> the letter <i>heh</i> <b>is suspended,</b> i.e., is not joined to the roof of the letter? It is <b>because if one repents, he is brought</b> back <b>in</b> through the opening at the top.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>let him enter through that</b> same way that he left? The Gemara answers: That would <b>not be effective,</b> since one requires assistance from Heaven in order to repent, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34)? Concerning one who <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become pure, he is assisted</b> from Heaven, as it is written: “But to the humble He gives grace.” Concerning one who <b>comes to become impure, he is provided with an opening</b> to do so. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that the letter <i>heh</i> <b>has a crown</b> on its roof? The Gemara answers: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: If</b> a sinner <b>returns,</b> repenting for his sin, <b>I tie</b> a crown <b>for him</b> from above.
The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> reason <b>was the World-to-Come created</b> specifically <b>with</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i>,</b> the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because the righteous of</b> the world <b>are</b> so <b>few. And for what</b> reason is the left side of <b>the top of</b> the letter <i>yod</i> <b>bent</b> downward? It is <b>because the righteous who are in</b> the World-to-Come <b>hang their heads</b> in shame, <b>since the actions of one are not similar to those of another.</b> In the World-to-Come some of the righteous will be shown to be of greater stature than others.
§ <b>Rav Yosef says: Rav states these two matters with regard to scrolls, and</b> in each case a statement <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that constitutes <b>a refutation of his</b> ruling. <b>One</b> is <b>that which Rav says: A Torah scroll that contains two errors on each and every column may be corrected,</b> but if there are <b>three</b> errors on each and every column then it <b>shall be interred.</b>
<b>And</b> a statement <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that constitutes <b>a refutation of his</b> ruling: A Torah scroll that contains <b>three</b> errors on every column <b>may be corrected,</b> but if there are <b>four</b> errors on every column then it <b>shall be interred.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the Torah scroll <b>contains one complete column</b> with no errors, <b>it saves the entire</b> Torah scroll, and it is permitted to correct the scroll rather than interring it. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta says in the name of Rav: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when the majority of the scroll is written properly</b> and is not full of errors.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: If that column contained three errors, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Since</b> the column itself <b>may be corrected,</b> it <b>enables the correction</b> of the entire scroll. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a Torah scroll may not be fixed if it is full of errors, <b>this statement</b> applies when letters <b>are missing</b> and must be added in the space between the lines. <b>But</b> if there were <b>extraneous</b> letters, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> since they can easily be erased. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that a scroll with letters <b>missing</b> may <b>not</b> be corrected? <b>Rav Kahana said: Because it would look speckled</b> if one adds all of the missing letters in the spaces between the lines.
The Gemara relates: <b>Agra, the father-in-law of Rabbi Abba, had</b> many <b>extraneous</b> letters <b>in his scroll. He came before Rabbi Abba</b> to clarify the <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: We said</b> that one may not correct the scroll <b>only in</b> a case where the letters are <b>missing.</b>

Daf 30a

<b>But</b> if there are <b>extraneous</b> letters, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and one may erase them. This is the first <i>halakha</i> that Rav stated, which is refuted in a <i>baraita</i>.
<b>The other</b> is that <b>which Rav says: One who writes a Torah scroll and comes to finish</b> writing it <b>may finish</b> writing it anywhere in the column, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to finishing it <b>in the middle of the column.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who writes a Torah scroll</b> and <b>comes to finish</b> writing it <b>may not finish</b> writing it <b>in the middle of the column in the manner that one finishes</b> writing one of the <b>five</b> books of the Torah written as an independent scroll. <b>Rather,</b> he should <b>progressively shorten</b> the width of the lines <b>until</b> he finishes the scroll at the <b>end of the column.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rav says</b> that one may finish writing even in the middle of a column, he was referring <b>to</b> one of the <b>five</b> books of the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> Rav <b>say</b> his statement with regard to <b>a Torah scroll?</b> The Gemara answers: He was referring <b>to</b> one of the <b>five</b> books <b>that</b> constitute <b>a Torah scroll.</b> Rav meant that when writing a Torah scroll, one may finish writing any of the first four books in the middle of a column. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The words: <b>“In the sight of all Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:12), which conclude the Torah, may be written even <b>in the middle of the column?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> ruling that <b>was stated</b> is <b>with regard to</b> finishing the Torah scroll <b>in the middle of</b> the <b>line,</b> i.e., in the middle of the width of the column.
The Gemara cites another opinion: <b>The Rabbis say</b> that one may finish writing a Torah scroll <b>even in the middle of</b> the <b>line,</b> but one may finish writing it at the end of the line as well. <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that one must finish writing the Torah scroll <b>specifically in the middle of</b> the <b>line. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that it must be ended <b>specifically in the middle of</b> the <b>line.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the last <b>eight verses of the Torah</b> (Deuteronomy 32:5–12), a single <b>individual reads them in the synagogue,</b> as that section may not be divided between two readers. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this said? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And Moses the servant of the Lord died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>Is it possible</b> that after <b>Moses died, he</b> himself <b>wrote: “And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote</b> the entire Torah <b>until this</b> point, and <b>Joshua bin Nun wrote from this</b> point <b>forward;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> stated this opinion.
<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll</b> was <b>missing a single letter? But it is written</b> that God instructed Moses: <b>“Take this Torah scroll and put it</b> by the side of the Ark of the Covenant” (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it.
Rabbi Shimon explains: <b>Rather, until this</b> point, i.e., the verse describing the death of Moses, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote</b> the text <b>and repeated</b> after Him. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> with regard to Moses’ death, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears</b> without repeating the words, due to his great sorrow. <b>As it is stated there</b> with regard to Jeremiah’s dictation of the prophecy of the destruction of the Temple to Baruch ben Neriah: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18), but he did not repeat the words after Jeremiah.
The Gemara now states its inference: <b>Shall we say that</b> the ruling of Rav that the last verses of the Torah are read by only one reader is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> since according to Rabbi Shimon these verses are similar to all other verses of the Torah, as they were all written by Moses? The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that Rav’s ruling was stated in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon; since they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in one way, as Moses wrote them without repeating the words, <b>they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in this way as well, and they may not be divided between two readers.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who purchases a Torah scroll in the marketplace is akin to one who snatches a mitzva in the marketplace,</b> as the proper manner in which to perform the mitzva of writing a Torah scroll is to write one for himself. And if he himself <b>writes</b> a Torah scroll, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he received it at Mount Sinai. Rav Sheshet says: If he emended even a single letter</b> of the Torah scroll, thereby completing it, the verse <b>ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he had written it</b> in its entirety.
§ Before continuing its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of writing a Torah scroll, the Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the upcoming <i>halakhot</i>: <b><i>Samekh</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>mem</i>. The Sages taught: A person may prepare</b> for a Torah scroll <b>a sheet</b> of parchment of any size <b>from three columns and until eight columns,</b> but <b>one may not prepare</b> a sheet of parchment that has <b>less than</b> three <b>or more than</b> eight columns.
<b>And he may not increase</b> the number <b>of columns,</b> e.g., by writing eight columns on a narrow sheet of parchment, <b>since</b> then each column <b>has the appearance of a missive</b> due to its narrow lines. <b>And he may not decrease</b> the number <b>of columns,</b> e.g., by writing three columns on a wide sheet of parchment, <b>since</b> then the lines will be so wide that the reader’s <b>eyes</b> will <b>wander,</b> as it will be difficult to find the beginning of a line. <b>Rather,</b> the ideal width of a line is, <b>for example,</b> where one can write <b>“<i>lemishpeḥoteikhem</i>,” “<i>lemishpeḥoteikhem</i>,” “<i>lemishpeḥoteikhem</i>,”</b> for a total of <b>three times.</b>
If one <b>happened</b> to acquire <b>a sheet</b> of parchment that <b>has</b> space for <b>nine columns,</b> exceeding the eight-column limit, <b>he should not divide</b> it into two sheets of parchment with <b>three</b> columns <b>here and six</b> columns <b>there; rather,</b> he should divide it into two sheets of parchment with <b>four</b> columns <b>here and five</b> columns <b>there,</b> so that the two sheets will be similar in width.
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the sheet must contain a minimum of three columns <b>said?</b> It is said with regard to sheets <b>at the beginning</b> and middle <b>of the scroll. But at the end of the scroll,</b> a sheet may consist of <b>even one verse, and even one column.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that a sheet may contain <b>one verse? Rather, say</b> that it may consist of even <b>one verse on one column.</b>
<b>The measure of</b> the <b>margin</b> of a Torah scroll is as follows: The size of the <b>lower</b> margin is <b>one handbreadth [<i>tefaḥ</i>].</b> There is a requirement for a large margin there, so that a reader not inadvertently rest his arm on the writing. The size of the <b>upper</b> margin, which is less susceptible to that occurrence, is <b>three fingerbreadths [<i>etzba’ot</i>], and</b> the space <b>between each column</b> is <b>equal to the full width of two fingerbreadths. And with regard to</b> one of <b>the five</b> books of the Torah that is written as an independent scroll, the size of the <b>lower</b> margin is <b>three fingerbreadths,</b> the size of the <b>upper</b> margin is <b>two fingerbreadths, and</b> the space <b>between each column</b> is <b>equal to the full width of a thumb-breadth [<i>gudal</i>].</b>
<b>And</b> the space <b>between</b> one <b>line</b> of a Torah scroll <b>and</b> the following <b>line</b> must be <b>equal to</b> the space of <b>a full line, and</b> the space <b>between</b> one <b>word and</b> the following <b>word</b> must be <b>equal to a full small letter, and</b> as for the space <b>between</b> one <b>letter and</b> the following <b>letter,</b> it is sufficient for it to be <b>equal to a full hairbreadth.</b>
The <i>halakhot</i> of the margins notwithstanding, <b>a person may not reduce</b> the size of <b>the writing</b> in a manner that the size of the writing is not consistent, <b>not in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space for the lower</b> margin, <b>nor in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space for the upper</b> margin, <b>nor in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space between</b> one <b>line and</b> the following <b>line, nor in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space between</b> one <b>passage and</b> the following <b>passage,</b> as this is not aesthetically pleasing.
If <b>one happens upon a word that comprises five letters</b> and cannot be written in its entirety within the column, <b>he may not write two</b> letters <b>within the column and three outside of the column,</b> in the margin.

Daf 30b

<b>Rather,</b> he should write <b>three</b> letters <b>in the column and two outside of the column.</b> If <b>he happens</b> upon <b>a word that comprises two letters</b> and cannot be written in its entirety within the column, <b>he may not cast it</b> in the margin <b>between the</b> two <b>columns; rather, he should return and write</b> the word <b>at the beginning of the</b> following <b>line.</b>
§ <b>One who mistakenly</b> omitted <b>the name</b> of God and wrote the next word before discovering his error should <b>scrape off that which he wrote, and suspend</b> the words <b>that he scraped off</b> above the line, <b>and write the name</b> of God <b>upon the place that had been scraped;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: One may even suspend the name</b> of God above the line, without scraping off the word that was written in its place. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> Not only may one scrape off the dry ink of the next word, but one may <b>even wipe away</b> the word while the ink is still wet <b>and write</b> the name of God in its place.
<b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> A scribe <b>may suspend the entire name</b> of God above the line, but he <b>may not suspend part of</b> the name of God above the line. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> A scribe <b>may not write the name</b> of God <b>either upon the place that had been scraped or upon the place that had been wiped away, and</b> he <b>may not suspend it</b> above the line, as none of these options exhibit sufficient respect for the name of God. <b>What should</b> the scribe <b>do? He should remove the entire sheet</b> of parchment <b>and inter it.</b>
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the final halakhic ruling: <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one <b>suspends the name</b> of God above the line. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one may even <b>wipe away</b> the word while the ink is still wet <b>and write</b> the name of God in its place.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why is it necessary to state the actual opinions? <b>Let</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rav Ḥananel in the name of Rav, <b>say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei; <b>and</b> let this <b>Sage,</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel, say that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of that <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> there are those <b>who reverse</b> the opinions of the <i>tanna’im</i>, they needed to state the opinions explicitly.
<b>Ravin bar Ḥinnana says</b> that <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri; and moreover,</b> not only is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his opinion with regard to this matter, but in <b>any place where Rabbi Shimon Shezuri taught</b> a <i>halakha</i>, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion.
The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> statement of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to</b> the statement <b>here,</b> where <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> A scribe <b>may suspend the entire name</b> of God above the line, but he <b>may not suspend part of</b> the name of God above the line, that is difficult: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one <b>suspends the name</b> of God above the line, <b>and Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one may even <b>wipe away</b> the word while the ink is still wet <b>and write</b> the name of God in its place?
<b>And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to this matter, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with those <i>amora’im</i> that the <i>halakha</i> is that one suspends the entire name of God above the line, but not a part of the name.
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri was referring not to the discussion here, but was stated <b>with regard to this</b> mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 74b): <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> If one ritually slaughtered a pregnant cow and the calf was then removed alive, the ritual slaughter of the mother is effective with regard to the calf as well. And <b>even</b> if the calf is <b>five years old and plowing the field</b> when one wants to eat it, <b>the</b> earlier <b>slaughter of its mother renders it permitted,</b> and it does not require ritual slaughter before it is eaten.
The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri? And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to this matter, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with Ze’eiri that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to this</b> mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 65b): <b>Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say:</b> With regard to <b>one who was taken out in a collar [<i>kolar</i>]</b> to be executed <b>and said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, these</b> people <b>should write and give</b> her the document. Although he did not explicitly say the word give, this is understood to have been his intention, in order to release her from the obligation to perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>They then said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to <b>one who sets sail and one who departs with a caravan</b> to a distant place. A bill of divorce is given to his wife under these circumstances even if her husband said only: Write a bill of divorce for my wife. <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even</b> in the case of <b>one who is dangerously ill</b> who gives that instruction, they write the bill of divorce and give it to his wife.
<b>Alternatively,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: In the case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i>,</b> which is separated from the produce received from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, who is suspected of not separating tithes properly, <b>that returned to its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., it became mixed with the produce from which it had been separated, <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> In this situation, not only did the Sages permit one to ask the <i>am ha’aretz</i> whether he had set aside his tithes in the proper manner and to rely on his response on Shabbat, a day when it is not permitted to separate tithes, but <b>one may ask him and eat based on his</b> statement <b>even on a weekday.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to</b> those <i>mishnayot</i> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri in</b> the case of one who is <b>dangerously ill, and in</b> the case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i>? And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to these <i>mishnayot</i>, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with Rabbi Yoḥanan that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was made <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar says in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri:</b> If one <b>planted a cowpea</b> plant <b>for</b> its <b>seed,</b> i.e., not to be eaten as a vegetable but for one to either eat or plant its seeds, and <b>some of</b> the plants <b>took root before Rosh HaShana, while some of</b> them took root only <b>after Rosh HaShana, one may not separate <i>teruma</i></b> or tithes <b>from this for that, as one may not separate <i>teruma</i> or tithes from the new</b> crop <b>for the old or from the old</b> crop <b>for the new.</b>
<b>How,</b> then, <b>shall one act</b> so that he not err and set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes incorrectly? It is difficult to know when the plants took root. He shall <b>pile</b> the entire stock onto <b>his threshing floor, into</b> the middle of <b>it,</b> mix the stock together, and then separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes; <b>and</b> consequently <b>it will turn out</b> that he has <b>separated <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the new</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the new</b> crop <b>in it, and from the old</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the old</b> crop <b>in it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to that</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says that Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri? And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to this <i>baraita</i>, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to a chest. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it was <b>with regard to wine.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Pappa said</b>

Daf 31a

that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to a chest, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 18:1): A wooden chest that is large enough to contain forty <i>se’a</i> is not susceptible to contracting ritual impurity, since it is no longer considered a vessel. In determining its capacity, <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>it is measured on the inside, and Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>it is measured on the outside</b> so that the volume of the walls of the chest itself is included in the measurement. <b>And</b> both Beit Shammai <b>and</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede that the volume of the legs and the volume of the rims [<i>halevazbazin</i>]</b> are <b>not measured.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: They concede that the volume of the legs and the volume of the rims</b> are <b>measured, but</b> the space enclosed <b>between</b> the rims and the legs <b>is not measured. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: If</b> the <b>legs were</b> one <b>handbreadth high</b> then the space <b>between</b> the legs <b>is not measured,</b> since the area has an independent significance, <b>but if</b> the space is <b>not</b> one handbreadth high, the space <b>between</b> the legs <b>is measured</b> as part of the chest. It is with regard to this statement that Rabbi Ḥanina said the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to wine, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:2): <b>Rabbi Meir says: Oil,</b> an example of a liquid, that contracted impurity, is <b>always</b> considered to have <b>first</b>-degree ritual impurity, even if it came into contact with an item that was impure with second-degree ritual impurity, which, according to the standard <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, should result in it having third-degree ritual impurity. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to <b>honey. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to <b>wine.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> is that to say <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>wine</b> is <b>not</b> considered a liquid? Rather, <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Wine</b> is considered a liquid, but oil and honey are not.
§ The Gemara relates another statement of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri said: Once, my untithed produce became mixed together with</b> a greater quantity of <b>non-sacred,</b> i.e., tithed, <b>produce, and I came and asked Rabbi Tarfon</b> how I should separate tithes from the untithed produce that was mixed with the tithed produce. <b>And he said to me: Go and take from the market</b> doubtfully tithed produce, which requires the removal of tithes by rabbinic law, <b>and separate tithes from it on behalf of</b> the untithed produce that is mixed with the tithed produce.
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Tarfon <b>holds</b> that <b>by Torah law</b> the minority of untithed produce is <b>nullified in the majority</b> of tithed produce and is therefore exempt from tithes; it is by rabbinic law that it is not nullified and one is obligated to separate tithes from it. <b>And</b> additionally, he holds that <b>the majority of those who are unreliable with regard to tithes [<i>amei ha’aretz</i>] do separate tithes,</b> in which case by Torah law one is not obligated to separate tithes from produce purchased from the market. <b>And</b> therefore, if Rabbi Shimon Shezuri receives produce from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>he is considered</b> by Torah law <b>to be separating tithes from exempt</b> produce <b>on behalf of exempt</b> produce, while all of it is obligated in tithes by rabbinic law.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>say to him: Go and take</b> produce <b>from a gentile.</b> Since it is exempt from tithes by Torah law but requires tithing by rabbinic law, he could then separate tithes from this produce on behalf of the untithed produce that is nullified by the tithed produce. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Tarfon <b>holds</b> that <b>a gentile has no acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to abrogate</b> the sanctity of the land, thereby removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce. <b>And</b> therefore, if Rabbi Shimon Shezuri were to take produce from a gentile, he would be <b>considered to be</b> separating tithes <b>from</b> produce <b>that is obligated</b> in tithes by Torah law <b>on behalf of exempt</b> produce, which one may not do.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to him: Go and take</b> produce <b>from a gentile</b> and separate tithes from it on behalf of the untithed produce that is intermingled in the majority of tithed produce. Accordingly, Rabbi Tarfon <b>holds</b> that <b>a gentile has acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to abrogate</b> the sanctity of the land, thereby removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce. <b>And</b> therefore, if Rabbi Shimon Shezuri takes produce from a gentile, <b>he is considered,</b> by Torah law, <b>to be</b> separating tithes <b>from exempt</b> produce <b>on behalf of exempt</b> produce, while all of it is obligated in tithes by rabbinic law.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>say to him:</b> Go and <b>take</b> produce <b>from</b> an <i>am ha’aretz</i> in <b>the market</b> and separate tithes from it on behalf of the mixed untithed produce. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Tarfon <b>holds</b> that <b>the majority of <i>amei ha’aretz</i> do not separate tithes,</b> in which case he is considered to be separating tithes from produce that is obligated in tithes by Torah law on behalf of exempt produce.
<b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya sent</b> the following question <b>to Rav Pappa: That which Ravin bar Ḥinnana said</b> that <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, and moreover, any place where Rabbi Shimon Shezuri taught</b> a <i>halakha</i>, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, was that said <b>even with regard to</b> the case of <b>one whose untithed produce became mixed together with non-sacred,</b> i.e., tithed, <b>produce,</b> or was Rabbi Ḥanina referring only to cases where Rabbi Shimon Shezuri stated his opinion in the Mishna, but not in a <i>baraita</i>?
Rav Pappa <b>said to him: Yes,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri even with regard to untithed produce that was mixed together with tithed produce. <b>Rav Ashi said: Mar Zutra said to me: Rabbi Ḥanina of Sura raised a difficulty with this:</b> Isn’t it <b>obvious?</b>

Daf 31b

<b>Does</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>say</b> that wherever Rabbi Shimon Shezuri taught a <i>halakha</i> <b>in our Mishna</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion? Rather, <b>he says</b> that <b>any place where he taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion, and this applies even to <i>baraitot</i>.
§ <b>Rav Ze’eira says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>a tear</b> in the parchment of a Torah scroll <b>extends into two lines, one can sew</b> the parchment to render the scroll fit, but if it extends <b>into three</b> lines then <b>one cannot sew</b> it to render it fit. <b>Rabba Zuti said to Rav Ashi: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said in the name of Rava: That which we say,</b> that if the tear extends <b>into three</b> lines <b>one cannot sew</b> it to render it fit, <b>we say only with regard to old</b> sheets of parchment. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>new</b> sheets of parchment, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And old</b> does <b>not</b> mean <b>literally old, and new</b> does <b>not</b> mean <b>literally new. Rather, those</b> sheets of parchment <b>that are not processed with gall</b> are labeled as old and cannot be sewn, whereas <b>those</b> sheets of parchment <b>that are processed with gall</b> are labeled as new and can be sewn. <b>And this statement,</b> that one can sew the parchment and render it fit, applies to sewing it <b>with sinew; but</b> if one sews the parchment <b>with thread [<i>bigradin</i>],</b> it is <b>not</b> rendered fit.
<b>Rav Yehuda bar Abba asks:</b> If the tear occurred in the space <b>between</b> one <b>column and</b> another <b>column</b> but it was of the length that had it occurred inside a column it would have extended more than three lines, and similarly, if the tear occurred <b>between</b> one <b>line and</b> another <b>line</b> horizontally, but not tearing through any letters, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? No answer was found, and therefore the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabbi Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says: A <i>mezuza</i> that one wrote two</b> by <b>two,</b> i.e., two words on each line, is <b>fit. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one wrote <b>two</b> words on one line, <b>and three</b> words on the following line, <b>and one</b> word on the line after that, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: All the more so</b> that it is fit, <b>as he prepared it as</b> one writes <b>a poem</b> in the Torah scroll. The song sung by the Jewish people at the sea after the Exodus is written in lines whose length is not uniform. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one wrote it as</b> one writes <b>a poem</b> in the Torah, <b>or if one wrote a poem</b> in the Torah <b>as</b> one writes it, it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to a Torah scroll,</b> not a <i>mezuza</i>.
It <b>was stated</b> by <i>amora’im</i> <b>as well: Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar bar Ḥana</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>mezuza</i> that one prepared</b> with <b>two</b> words on one line, <b>and three</b> words on the following line, <b>and one</b> word on the line after that, it is <b>fit, provided that he does not prepare it like</b> the shape of <b>a tent,</b> i.e., progressively widening the lines, starting with a line of one word, then a line of two words and a line of three, <b>and provided that he does not prepare it like</b> the shape of <b>a tail,</b> progressively shortening the lines, from three words to two to one.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> One writes the last two words of a <i>mezuza</i>, <b><i>al ha’aretz</i>,</b> meaning “above the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21), by themselves <b>on the final line,</b> without the preceding word. The Sages disagreed as to how this is done. <b>Some say</b> that one writes this phrase <b>at the end of</b> the final <b>line, and some say</b> that one writes it <b>at the beginning of</b> the final <b>line.</b>
The Gemara explains their dispute: <b>The one who says</b> that one writes it <b>at the end of</b> the final <b>line</b> interprets the verse: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heaven above the earth,” in a similar manner to the verse: <b>“For as the heaven is high above the earth”</b> (Psalms 103:11). Consequently, if one writes “above the earth” at the end of the final line, it will appropriately be below the term “the heaven” at the end of the previous line. <b>And the one who says</b> that one writes it <b>at the beginning of</b> the final <b>line</b> explains the phrase “as the days of the heaven above the earth” as meaning: <b>Just as</b> the <b>heaven is far from the earth.</b> Consequently, if one writes “above the earth” at the beginning of the final line, it is far from the term “the heaven” at the end of the previous line.
<b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said: I saw Rav Huna wrap</b> a written <i>mezuza</i> <b>from</b> the word <b><i>eḥad</i> to</b> the word <b><i>shema</i>,</b> i.e., rolling it from left to right, as the first verse written in a <i>mezuza</i> is: “Listen [<i>Shema</i>], O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one [<i>eḥad</i>]” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> he <b>prepared</b> the two <b>passages of</b> the <i>mezuza</i> in the <b>closed</b> manner, i.e., starting the second passage (Deuteronomy 11:13–21) on the same line that he finished writing the first passage (Deuteronomy 6:4–9).
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir would write</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on <i>dokhsostos</i>,</b> the inner layer of animal hide, not on parchment, which is from the outer layer, and he would prepare it <b>like a column</b> of a Torah scroll, i.e., long and narrow.

Daf 32a

<b>And he would make a space above and a space below</b> the text <b>and would prepare the passages of</b> the <i>mezuza</i> in the <b>open</b> manner, i.e., he would begin the second passage on the line following the end of the first passage. <b>I said to him: My teacher,</b> for <b>what reason</b> do you prepare the passages in the open manner, when in a Torah scroll those same passages are written in the closed manner? <b>He said to me: Since</b> the passages <b>are not adjacent</b> to one another <b>in the Torah,</b> as the first passage is Deuteronomy 6:4–9 and the second is Deuteronomy 11:13–21, I prepare them as open passages.
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. What, is it not</b> correct that Rav stated this <b>with regard to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s opinion that one prepares the passages in the <b>open</b> manner? This would present a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Huna, Rav’s student, who wrote them in the closed manner.
The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> he meant that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>with regard to</b> the <b>space</b> that one must leave above and below the text. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much space</b> must one leave? <b>Rav Menashya bar Ya’akov says, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Shmuel bar Ya’akov</b> who <b>says:</b> The space <b>of a full scribe’s clip [<i>atba</i>],</b> with which the sheets of parchment are held.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: And you, do you not hold that when Rav said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar he was referring <b>to</b> the <b>space,</b> not the manner of writing the passages? <b>But Rav is of</b> the opinion that an established <b>custom</b> must be observed, <b>and nowadays the general custom</b> is to write the passages of the <i>mezuza</i> <b>in</b> the <b>closed</b> manner.
The Gemara provides the source that according to Rav one must observe established customs. <i>Ḥalitza</i> is the ritual that frees the widow of a childless man from the obligation to enter into levirate marriage with her late husband’s brother. This ceremony involves the widow removing her brother-in-law’s sandal from his foot. Rabba spoke of the importance of observing customs in that context, <b>as Rabba says</b> that <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>Rav says: If Elijah comes and says</b> that <b>one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with a shoe,</b> the Sages <b>listen to him.</b> But if he says that <b>one may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with a sandal, they do not listen to him, as the people are already accustomed</b> to performing <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with a sandal.</b>
The Gemara presents another version of Rav’s statement: <b>And Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>Rav says: If Elijah comes and says</b> that <b>one may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with a shoe,</b> the Sages <b>listen to him;</b> if he says that <b>one may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with a sandal, they do not listen to him, as the people are already accustomed</b> to performing <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with a sandal.</b>
Abaye continues: <b>And we say,</b> when discussing these versions of his statement: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> these two versions of his statement? The <b>difference is</b> whether one may use <b>a shoe <i>ab initio</i>.</b> In any case, according to both statements Rav maintains that a custom must be observed, and the custom in this case is to write the passages in a closed manner. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that when Rav says that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar he was speaking <b>of</b> the <b>space,</b> not the manner of preparing the passages? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is correct.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is <b>a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i> <b>to prepare</b> the passages of a <i>mezuza</i> in the <b>closed</b> manner,<b>but if one prepared them</b> in the <b>open</b> manner, it is <b>permitted</b> to use the <i>mezuza</i>. <b>And what is Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar saying</b> when he says that Rabbi Meir would prepare the passages in the <b>open</b> manner? He means that one may prepare them <b>even</b> in the <b>open</b> manner.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports his</b> opinion: <b>Similarly,</b> just as one may not convert phylacteries of the head into phylacteries of the arm, with regard to <b>a Torah scroll that became worn and</b> parchment of <b>phylacteries that became worn, one may not fashion them into a <i>mezuza</i></b> by excising the relevant passages, despite the fact that the Torah passages of a <i>mezuza</i> appear in them. This is prohibited <b>because one does not reduce</b> the sanctity of an item <b>from</b> a level of <b>greater sanctity,</b> that of a Torah scroll or phylacteries, <b>to</b> a level of <b>lesser sanctity,</b> that of a <i>mezuza</i>. The Gemara infers from this <i>baraita</i>: If it were permitted to <b>reduce</b> the sanctity of an item from a level of greater sanctity to a level of lesser sanctity, one could <b>fashion</b> a <i>mezuza</i> from a Torah scroll.
The Gemara explains the proof: But <b>why</b> is that the <i>halakha</i>, when <b>here,</b> in a Torah scroll, the passages are prepared in the <b>closed</b> manner, <b>but there,</b> in a <i>mezuza</i>, the passages are prepared in the <b>open</b> manner? Evidently, it is permitted to write a <i>mezuza</i> with the passages prepared in the closed manner. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> one should infer from the <i>baraita</i> that were it not for the fact that it is prohibited to reduce the sanctity of an item from a level of greater sanctity to a level of lesser sanctity, one would be allowed <b>to complete</b> a line or two of a <i>mezuza</i> by sewing to it those lines from a Torah scroll or parchment of phylacteries that became worn, but one may not fashion an entire <i>mezuza</i> from a sheet of a Torah scroll or parchment of phylacteries, as the passages in a Torah scroll and phylacteries are prepared in the closed manner.
The Gemara asks another question: The <i>baraita</i> indicates <b>that</b> if it were permitted to <b>reduce</b> the sanctity of an item from a level of greater sanctity to a level of lesser sanctity, one could <b>fashion</b> a <i>mezuza</i> from phylacteries. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai</b> that the passages of <b>phylacteries</b> are written <b>on parchment,</b> the outer layer of an animal’s hide, <b>and</b> the passages of <b>a <i>mezuza</i></b> are written <b>on <i>dokhsostos</i>,</b> the inner layer, and when writing on <b>parchment,</b> one writes <b>on the side of</b> the hide that faced the <b>flesh;</b> when writing on <b><i>dokhsostos</i>,</b> one writes <b>on the side of</b> the hide on which there was <b>hair?</b> How, then, can one use the other side of the hide for a <i>mezuza</i>? The Gemara answers that this requirement is of <i>dokhsostos</i> for a <i>mezuza</i> is stated <b>as a mitzva,</b> but it is not indispensable.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one <b>changed</b> between parchment and <i>dokhsostos</i>, the item is <b>unfit?</b> The Gemara responds that this <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to phylacteries</b> that one wrote on <i>dokhsostos</i> in the manner of a <i>mezuza</i>, not to a <i>mezuza</i> which one wrote on parchment. The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one <b>changed whether in this</b> manner <b>or in that</b> manner, it is <b>unfit?</b> The Gemara explains that this <i>baraita</i> does not mean that one changed either in the case of phylacteries or a <i>mezuza</i>. Rather, both <b>this</b> manner <b>and that</b> manner are referring <b>to phylacteries, and this</b> case is <b>where one wrote them on parchment</b> but <b>on the side of</b> the hide on which there was <b>hair,</b> not on the side that faced the flesh, <b>and that</b>

Daf 32b

case is <b>where one wrote them on <i>dokhsostos</i> on the side</b> that faced the <b>flesh.</b> In both of these situations the phylacteries are unfit, but a <i>mezuza</i> that one wrote on parchment is fit.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that if one <b>changed whether in this</b> manner <b>or in that</b> manner it is unfit is in fact referring to a <i>mezuza</i> that one wrote on parchment, and this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>changed in this</b> manner <b>or in that</b> manner it is <b>unfit. Rabbi Aḥa, in the name of Rabbi Aḥai, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, deems</b> it <b>fit; and some say</b> he said this ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Akiva, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> indicates <b>that</b> if it were permitted to <b>reduce</b> the sanctity of an item from a level of greater sanctity to a level of lesser sanctity, one could <b>make</b> a <i>mezuza</i> from phylacteries that became worn. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>requires scoring,</b> i.e., the parchment must have lines etched in it before writing, <b>as Rav Minyumi bar Ḥilkiya says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says: Any <i>mezuza</i> that is not scored</b> is <b>unfit, and Rav Minyumi bar Ḥilkiya himself says</b> concerning this: <b>The scoring of a <i>mezuza</i></b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> With regard to phylacteries, by contrast, he does not teach that their parchment requires scoring.
The Gemara answers that this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says in the name of our teacher,</b> Rav: <b>Phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> may be written</b> when the scribe is <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written</b> text, <b>and</b> their parchment <b>does not require scoring.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the parchment of <b>phylacteries does not require scoring, but</b> the parchment of <b>a <i>mezuza</i> requires scoring. And</b> unlike a Torah scroll, both <b>these and those,</b> phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>may be written</b> when the scribe is <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written</b> text. <b>What is the reason</b> for this leniency? These short texts <b>are well known</b> to all scribes, and therefore it is permitted to write them by heart.
In connection to Rav Ḥelbo relating the customs of Rav Huna, the Gemara cites that <b>Rav Ḥelbo says: I</b> myself <b>saw Rav Huna as</b> he wished <b>to sit on his bed, which had a Torah scroll</b> placed <b>on it. And he overturned a jug on the ground and placed the Torah scroll on it, and</b> only <b>then sat on the bed.</b> The reason he did so is that <b>he holds</b> that it is <b>prohibited to sit on a bed upon which a Torah scroll is placed.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>disagrees</b> with a ruling <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is permitted to sit on a bed upon which a Torah scroll is placed. And if a person whispers to you, saying:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Elazar, who was sitting on a bed and realized that a Torah scroll was placed on it, and</b> he immediately <b>slipped off</b> the bed <b>and sat upon the ground, and</b> in doing so he looked <b>like one who had been bitten by a snake,</b> i.e., he jumped up in a panic, that incident is no proof. <b>There,</b> the <b>Torah scroll was</b> placed <b>on the ground.</b> It is certainly disgraceful for one to sit on a bed while a Torah scroll is on the ground.
The Gemara returns to the discussion about the <i>halakhot</i> of writing a <i>mezuza</i>. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>wrote</b> a <i>mezuza</i> in the manner of <b>a missive</b> that one composes to a friend, i.e., without being exact about the lettering of each word, it is <b>unfit. What is the reason?</b> This is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between <b>“writing,”</b> and <b>“writing,” from a scroll,</b> which must be written in precisely the correct manner.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one hung</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on a stick</b> in the entranceway, without affixing it to the doorpost, it is <b>unfit. What is the reason? We require</b> the fulfillment of the verse: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and <b>upon your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9). <b>This</b> ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one hung</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on a stick, or placed it</b> so that it was affixed <b>behind the door</b> within the house, he exposes himself to <b>danger, and it</b> does <b>not</b> enable him to fulfill the <b>mitzva.</b>
The Gemara relates: The members <b>of the household of King Munbaz would do so,</b> i.e., hang <i>mezuzot</i> on sticks, <b>in their inns,</b> i.e., when they would sleep in an inn. They would not do this in order to fulfill the mitzva, as one who sleeps in an inn is exempt from placing a <i>mezuza</i>, but <b>in remembrance of</b> the <b><i>mezuza</i>.</b> Since they would travel frequently, they wanted to remember the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>, which they did not fulfill often.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to place</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>within the airspace of the entrance,</b> not on the outside. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> After all, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And <b>upon your gates,”</b> which indicates that it must be within the area of the gate, rather than the outside. The Gemara explains that it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rava says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to place</b> the <i>mezuza</i>

Daf 33a

<b>in the handbreadth adjacent to the public domain,</b> perhaps <b>the further</b> the <i>mezuza</i> is from the inside of the house the <b>better,</b> and one may affix it even fully outside the airspace of the entrance. To counter this, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>mezuza</i> must be within the airspace of the entrance itself.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>wrote</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on two sheets</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that teaches: If one <b>wrote</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on two sheets and placed it on</b> the <b>two doorposts</b> of the entrance, it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara states the objection: By inference, if the <i>mezuza</i> was affixed <b>on one doorpost,</b> it is <b>fit,</b> despite the fact that it is written on two sheets. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is not referring to a case where one affixed the <i>mezuza</i> on two doorposts. Rather, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying</b> that if it was written on two sheets in such a manner that it is <b>fit to</b> be affixed to <b>two doorposts,</b> i.e., there is a space between the writing of the first and second passages, so that one can separate the two sheets for different doorposts, it is unfit. This is in accordance with the statement of Rav Yehuda, citing Shmuel.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that a <i>mezuza</i> must be affixed to the doorpost on its right side, and the right side is determined by the direction from which one enters the room. <b>With regard to a <i>mezuza</i>,</b> when deciding which side is the right side, one should <b>follow the indication of</b> the <b>hinge.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the indication of</b> the <b>hinge? Rav Adda said: The socket</b> into which the hinge is inserted. The room with the socket is considered the inside room, and the <i>mezuza</i> is affixed to the side which is on one’s right when entering that room. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances,</b> i.e., in what kind of case was this guideline to follow the indication of the hinge necessary? The Gemara answers: This indication is necessary in a case <b>where</b> there is <b>an entrance that is between two houses,</b> e.g., <b>between a room for men and a room for women,</b> as in such a situation the direction of the entrance is unclear.
The Gemara relates: <b>The Exilarch built</b> a new <b>house. He said to Rav Naḥman: Affix <i>mezuzot</i> for me</b> in the house. <b>Rav Naḥman said: First erect the doors,</b> so that I can affix the <i>mezuzot</i> in the appropriate places, according to the placement of the hinges.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one <b>fashioned</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>like a bolt,</b> i.e., he wedged it into a hole in the doorpost of a gate, or affixed it to the doorpost horizontally, it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: All the <i>mezuzot</i> in the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>were fashioned like a bolt, and</b> he also said: <b>That entrance by which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>entered the study hall did not have a <i>mezuza</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling, that it is unfit, is referring to a case <b>where it is prepared like a peg,</b> i.e., he inserted it deep into the doorpost while it was lying horizontally. <b>That</b> ruling, that it is fit, is referring to a case <b>where it is prepared like an ankle [<i>ke’istevira</i>],</b> i.e., it is vertical.
With regard to the second element of Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef’s statement, that the entrance by which Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi entered the study hall did not have a <i>mezuza</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But</b> what of <b>that entrance by which Rav Huna would enter the study hall, which had a <i>mezuza</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> entrance <b>was</b> the one through which all were <b>accustomed</b> to enter the study hall. By contrast, the entrance that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi used was a side entrance, which was designated for him alone. Consequently, it was exempt from the obligation to affix a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: With regard to a <i>mezuza</i>, follow the</b> entrance that people are <b>accustomed</b> to using.
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to place</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>at the beginning of the upper third</b> of the doorpost. <b>And Rav Huna says:</b> One <b>raises</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>a handbreadth from the ground, or</b> one <b>distances</b> it <b>from the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> i.e., the lintel, <b>a handbreadth, and the entire entrance</b> between those two handbreadths is <b>fit for</b> the placement of the <b><i>mezuza</i>.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>raises</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>a handbreadth from the ground, or</b> one <b>distances</b> it <b>from the</b> cross <b>beam a handbreadth, and the entire entrance</b> between those two handbreadths is <b>fit for</b> the placement of the <b><i>mezuza</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and then it states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9). <b>Just as</b> the <b>binding</b> of the phylacteries is performed <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part of the arm, <b>so too,</b> the <b>writing,</b> i.e., the placement, of a <i>mezuza</i> must be specifically <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part of the entrance.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>Granted, according to Rav Huna, he states</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda; but according to Shmuel, in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does he state</b> his ruling? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said: Actually,</b> Shmuel’s ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b>

Daf 33b

<b>and what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>The beginning of the upper third</b> of the entrance, <b>that</b> Shmuel <b>says?</b> This is referring <b>to</b> the maximum <b>distancing of</b> the <i>mezuza</i> from the doorframe, i.e., <b>that one should not distance it from the upper</b> cross <b>beam more than one-third</b> of the height of the entrance.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to place</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>in the handbreadth adjacent to the public domain.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Rabbis say</b> that it is <b>in order that one encounter the <i>mezuza</i> immediately</b> upon one’s entrance to the house. <b>Rav Ḥanina from Sura says:</b> It is <b>in order that</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>protect</b> the entire house, by placing it as far outside as one can.
The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is not like the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that <b>a king sits inside</b> his palace, <b>and</b> the <b>people protect him from the outside,</b> whereas with regard to <b>the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> it is <b>not so.</b> Rather, <b>His servants,</b> the Jewish people, <b>sit inside</b> their homes, <b>and He protects them from the outside. As it is stated: “The Lord is your keeper, the Lord is your shade upon your right hand”</b> (Psalms 121:5).
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rava, taught in the name of Rava:</b> If one <b>dug one handbreadth deep</b> into the doorpost and placed a <i>mezuza</i> there, it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports his</b> ruling: In a case where one <b>affixed</b> a <i>mezuza</i> deep <b>in the wooden doorpost</b> of an entrance, <b>or</b> after placing it in the entrance one <b>added [<i>tala</i>]</b> an inner <b>framework [<i>malben</i>] to it</b> that covers the doorpost, <b>if there is</b> a depth of <b>one handbreadth there,</b> one <b>requires another <i>mezuza</i>,</b> but <b>if not,</b> one <b>does not require another <i>mezuza</i>.</b>
The Gemara deflects the support: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to an entrance that is behind the door,</b> i.e., there is another entrance on the other side of the framework, which serves for both entrances. The <i>baraita</i> is teaching that if the framework is one handbreadth thick, then each side is considered a separate entrance, and each requires its own <i>mezuza</i>.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: But the same <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches explicitly</b> this ruling of the case of another entrance: With regard to <b>an entrance that is behind the door, if there is</b> a depth of <b>one handbreadth there,</b> one <b>requires another <i>mezuza</i>, but if not,</b> one <b>does not require another <i>mezuza</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: This clause of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>teaching which</b> case is the subject of the previous clause, i.e., the <i>baraita</i> does not state two <i>halakhot</i> but only one, which it explains as it proceeds: In what case is it taught that if there is a depth of a handbreadth there, one requires another <i>mezuza</i>? It is taught in the case of an entrance that is behind the door.
§ It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the affixing of a <i>mezuza</i>: If one <b>positions</b> a <i>mezuza</i> in an entrance which was <b>a framework of reeds,</b> to which one cannot affix the <i>mezuza</i> with nails, he <b>carves</b> a kind of <b>tube</b> from the reed on the right side <b>and places</b> the <i>mezuza</i> in that tube. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says: They taught</b> that one may affix the <i>mezuza</i> in this manner <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one positioned</b> the framework in its place first, <b>and ultimately carved</b> a tube <b>and</b> then <b>placed</b> the <i>mezuza</i> in <b>it. But</b> if before positioning the framework one <b>carved</b> a tube <b>and placed</b> the <i>mezuza</i> in it, <b>and ultimately positioned</b> the framework, the <i>mezuza</i> is <b>unfit.</b> This in accordance with the principle stated with regard to objects used for mitzvot: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared.</b> In this case he affixed the <i>mezuza</i> before the obligation took effect with regard to the framework.
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>these broken entrances [<i>pitḥei shima’ei</i>],</b> which lack the proper form of doorways, one is <b>exempt from the</b> obligation of placing <b>a <i>mezuza</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are broken entrances? Rav Riḥumi and Abba Yosei disagree with regard to this. One says that they do not have</b> a proper <b>ceiling, and one says that they do not have lintels [<i>shakofei</i>]</b> above the openings.
<b>Rabba bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>a portico,</b> i.e., a structure at the entrance to a house that is entirely open on its front side, one is <b>exempt from the</b> obligation of placing <b>a <i>mezuza</i>, because it does not have doorposts [<i>patzimin</i>]</b> on its sides. The Gemara questions this reason: This indicates <b>that</b> if <b>it has doorposts,</b> one would be <b>obligated</b> to place a <i>mezuza</i>. But that is not logical, as these doorposts are not there to serve as an entrance; rather, <b>they are made to strengthen the ceiling.</b> In that case, why should one be obligated?
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what Rav Ḥisda <b>is saying: Even if it has doorposts,</b> one is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation to place a <i>mezuza</i> there, <b>because they are made only to strengthen the ceiling,</b> not as an entrance. Similarly, <b>Abaye said: I saw the porticos [<i>le’ispelidei</i>] of the house of the Master,</b> Rabba, <b>that they had doorposts but they did not have <i>mezuzot</i>.</b> Rabba evidently <b>holds</b> that its doorposts <b>are made to strengthen the ceiling.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a gatehouse, a portico, and a balcony,</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> place <b>a <i>mezuza</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a specific type of portico, <b>the portico of a study hall,</b> which is closed on all sides, but its walls do not reach the ceiling. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>A portico of a study hall is like a full-fledged room [<i>inderona</i>],</b> and therefore it should not be labeled a portico with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>mezuza</i>. The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a Roman portico,</b> which is more open than the portico of a study hall, as it is built with many windows instead of proper walls. The <i>baraita</i> is teaching that one is obligated to place a <i>mezuza</i> on this type of portico.
§ <b>Raḥava says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>bei harziki</i>,</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> place <b>two <i>mezuzot</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>bei harziki</i>? Rav Pappa the Elder says in the name of Rav:</b> It is <b>a gatehouse that opens to a courtyard, and houses</b> also <b>open</b> directly <b>to</b> the <b>gatehouse.</b> It requires two <i>mezuzot</i>, one for the entrance from the courtyard to the gatehouse, and one for the entrance from the gatehouse to the houses.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a gatehouse that</b> has two entrances, as it <b>opens</b> both <b>to a garden,</b> which is exempt from a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>and to a small room [<i>ulekitonit</i>], Rabbi Yosei says: Its</b> halakhic <b>status is like</b> that of <b>a small room,</b> and it requires a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>and the Rabbis say:</b> Its halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a gatehouse,</b> and it does not require a <i>mezuza</i>. There is a difference of opinion among <i>amora’im</i> with regard to this dispute. <b>Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> With regard to the entrance through which one enters <b>from the garden to the house,</b> i.e., the entrance of the gatehouse to the small room, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one is <b>obligated</b> to place a <i>mezuza</i>. <b>What is the reason? It is</b> the way of <b>entering</b> the <b>house,</b> and the house requires a <i>mezuza</i>.
Rav and Shmuel continue: <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to the entrance through which one enters <b>from</b> the <b>house to the garden,</b> i.e., the entrance of the gatehouse to the garden. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that the <b>small room</b> into which the gatehouse opens is the <b>main</b> area, and therefore the gatehouse, which is used for entering the small room, is considered like a regular gatehouse to a house, and all its entrances require a <i>mezuza</i>. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>hold</b> that the <b>garden</b> is the <b>main</b> area, and therefore this entrance does not require a <i>mezuza</i>.
Conversely, <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say:</b> With regard to the entrance through which one enters <b>from</b> the <b>house to the garden,</b> i.e., the entrance between the gatehouse and the garden, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one is <b>exempt</b> from placing a <i>mezuza</i>. <b>What is the reason? It is</b> the <b>entrance to the garden,</b> and the garden does not require a <i>mezuza</i>. <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to the entrance <b>from</b> the <b>garden to the house,</b> i.e., the entrance between the gatehouse and the small room. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is</b> the way of <b>entering the house,</b> and the house requires a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>the entire</b>

Daf 34a

area <b>is made for the purpose of</b> reaching the <b>garden,</b> not for entering the house, and therefore even with regard to the entrance between the gatehouse and small room, one is exempt from placing a <i>mezuza</i> at the entrance of the small room.
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye and Rava would act in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef,</b> i.e., they would not place a <i>mezuza</i> on the two entrances of a gatehouse, neither to the garden nor to the small room, in accordance with the ruling of the Rabbis. <b>And Rav Ashi would act in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav and Shmuel, stringently,</b> i.e., following the ruling of Rabbi Yosei that both entrances require a <i>mezuza</i>. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav and Shmuel, stringently.</b>
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>an aperture that opens from</b> the ceiling of <b>a house</b> occupied by one person <b>to a loft</b> occupied by another, with a walled staircase leading from the lower floor to the loft, <b>Rav Huna says: If</b> the staircase <b>has one entrance,</b> i.e., one doorway, either from the house or from the upper story, one is <b>obligated to</b> affix <b>one <i>mezuza</i>; if it has two entrances,</b> both from below and above, one is <b>obligated to</b> affix <b>two <i>mezuzot</i>. Rav Pappa says:</b> One can <b>learn from that</b> statement <b>of Rav Huna</b> that with regard to <b>this</b> type of <b>room that has four gates,</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> affix <b>four <i>mezuzot</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach that <b>even though one is accustomed to</b> using <b>one</b> particular gate, nevertheless, all four require a <i>mezuza</i>.
<b>Ameimar said:</b> With regard to <b>this entrance which</b> is located <b>at the corner</b> of a house, one is <b>obligated to</b> affix <b>a <i>mezuza</i>. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But it does not have doorposts.</b> Ameimar <b>said to him: These [<i>adei</i>] are its doorposts,</b> i.e., the end of the walls serve as its doorposts.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Mar Shmuel,</b> where <b>he saw a certain entrance that had only one doorpost to the left</b> of the entrance, <b>and</b> yet Mar Shmuel <b>had affixed a <i>mezuza</i> to</b> that doorpost. Rav Pappa <b>said to him: In accordance with whose</b> opinion did you do this? Did you act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who deems one obligated to affix a <i>mezuza</i> to an entrance that has only one doorpost? But one can <b>say that Rabbi Meir says</b> that one must do so only in a case where the doorpost is <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> of the entrance. <b>Does he say</b> that it requires a <i>mezuza</i> if the entrance is <b>to</b> the <b>left?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the source for <b>this</b> requirement that the <i>mezuza</i> be affixed to the right side? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of <b>your house [<i>beitekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), the word <i>beitekha</i> is interpreted as <b><i>biatekha</i>,</b> your entry, i.e., the <i>mezuza</i> must be affixed to the side by which you enter, which is <b>from the right. Do you say</b> it is <b>from the right, or</b> is it <b>only from the left?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: Your house [<i>beitekha</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> here? <b>Rabba says:</b> The <i>mezuza</i> is affixed in <b>the way that you enter</b> the house, which is <b>from the right, as when a person lifts his foot</b> to begin walking, <b>he lifts his right</b> foot first. Therefore, the <i>mezuza</i> is affixed to the right side of the doorway.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa said before Rav Pappa in the name of Rava bar Ulla</b> that the requirement that the <i>mezuza</i> be affixed to the right of the entrance is derived <b>from here: “And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the House of the Lord; and the priests that kept the threshold put in there all the money that was brought into the House of the Lord”</b> (II Kings 12:10). This indicates that an object designed for those entering a house is placed to the right of the one entering.
The Gemara further inquires: <b>What</b> is this statement of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> referred to by Rav Pappa, that he deems one obligated to place a <i>mezuza</i> on an entrance that has only one doorpost? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a house that has only one doorpost, Rabbi Meir deems</b> one <b>obligated to</b> affix <b>a <i>mezuza</i>, and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from affixing a <i>mezuza</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? It is written:</b> “And you shall write them upon the <b>doorposts</b> of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), in the plural, which indicates that there must be two doorposts.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Meir,</b> that one doorpost suffices to obligate one to affix a <i>mezuza</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When it states <b>“doorposts”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), <b>I</b> would <b>derive the minimum</b> number <b>of doorposts,</b> which is <b>two. When it says “doorposts” in the second passage</b> (Deuteronomy 11:20), this also serves to teach a <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> otherwise there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. This <b>is</b> one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification, and</b> the principle is that <b>an amplification following an amplification is</b> stated <b>only</b> in order <b>to restrict</b> its extent. In this manner <b>the verse restricted</b> the minimum number <b>to one doorpost.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This proof <b>is not necessary.</b> Rather, <b>when</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And strike <b>the lintel and the two doorposts”</b> (Exodus 12:22), one can claim that there is a superfluous word in this verse, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “two,”</b> since the minimum of doorposts is two. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “two”? This established a paradigm</b> that <b>anywhere where it is stated “doorposts,”</b> it means <b>only one</b> doorpost, <b>unless the verse specifies</b> that it is referring to <b>two</b> doorposts.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one writes</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on the stones</b> of the entrance. To counter this, an expression of <b>writing is stated here,</b> with regard to a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>and</b> an expression of <b>writing is stated there. Just as there</b> the mitzva of writing means <b>on a book,</b> i.e., parchment, <b>so too,</b> a <i>mezuza</i> must be written <b>on a book.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go [<i>kalekh</i>] this way,</b> i.e., one can suggest a different interpretation: An expression of <b>writing is stated here,</b> with regard to a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>and writing is stated there,</b> with regard to the mitzva of writing the words of the Torah on stones upon the entry to Eretz Yisrael (Deuteronomy 27:3). <b>Just as there,</b> the words are written <b>on the stones</b> themselves, <b>so too here,</b> the <i>mezuza</i> should be written <b>on the stones.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Let us see to which it is similar,</b> i.e., which comparison appears more apt. <b>We derive writing that is performed in</b> all <b>generations,</b> i.e., that of a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>from</b> another <b>writing that is performed in</b> all <b>generations, but we do not derive writing that is performed in</b> all <b>generations from writing that is not performed in</b> all <b>generations. And</b> furthermore, a <i>mezuza</i> must be written with ink, <b>as it is stated below: “And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18).
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: The Merciful One states: “Upon the doorposts,”</b> which indicates that a <i>mezuza</i> should be written on the doorposts themselves, <b>and</b> yet <b>you say: Let us derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“writing”</b> and <b>“writing,”</b> to teach that one writes it on parchment. Why isn’t the verse interpreted in accordance with its straightforward meaning? Rav Ashi said to him: <b>The verse states: “And you shall write them [<i>ukhtavtam</i>],”</b> which means that it should first be <b>complete writing [<i>ketiva tamma</i>],</b> i.e., the full passages written down, <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> should one place them <b>“upon the doorposts”</b> of the house.
The Gemara asks: <b>And since it is written:</b> “And you shall write them,” from which it is derived that the <i>mezuza</i> should be written first and then placed on the doorpost, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this verbal analogy</b> between “writing” and “writing”? The Gemara explains that <b>were it not</b> for the <b>verbal analogy, I would say</b> that one <b>should write</b> the passages of a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on a stone, and</b> afterward <b>affix</b> the stone <b>to the doorpost.</b> To counter this, the verbal analogy <b>teaches us</b> that a <i>mezuza</i> must be written on a scroll.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the four passages that are in the phylacteries,</b> i.e., the two passages that are written in the <i>mezuza</i> and two additional passages (Exodus 13:1–9, 11–16), the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, and</b> the absence of <b>even one letter prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with</b> the rest of <b>them.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the inclusion of every letter is necessary?
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>necessary</b> to state this ruling <b>only</b> to teach <b>that</b> even the absence of <b>the thorn,</b> i.e., a small stroke, <b>of</b> a letter <b><i>yod</i></b> prevents fulfillment of the mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t <b>this also obvious,</b> since the letter is not formed properly? <b>Rather, it is necessary only according to another</b> statement <b>that Rav Yehuda</b> says. <b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Any letter that is not encircled with</b> blank <b>parchment on</b> all <b>four of its sides,</b> as its ink connects to the letter above it, below it, preceding it, or succeeding it, is <b>unfit.</b>

Daf 34b

§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the number of compartments in the phylacteries of the head, the verse states: “It shall be for a sign upon your hand, and <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), with the word <i>totafot</i> spelled deficient, without a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a way that can be read as singular; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), spelled as a singular word; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18), this time spelled plene, with a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a manner that must be plural. <b>There are four</b> mentions of <i>totafot</i> <b>here,</b> as the third one is written in the plural and therefore counts as two. Consequently, it is derived that the phylacteries of the head must have four compartments. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: There is no need</b> for this proof, as the requirement of four compartments can be derived from the word <i>totafot</i> itself: The word <b><i>tot</i> in</b> the language of <b>Katfei</b> means <b>two,</b> and the word <b><i>pat</i> in</b> the language of <b>Afriki</b> also means <b>two,</b> and therefore <i>totafot</i> can be understood as a compound word meaning four.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that a scribe <b>should write</b> the passages of the phylacteries of the head <b>on four</b> separate <b>hides,</b> i.e., parchments, <b>and place them in four compartments of four hides,</b> one passage in each compartment. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And for a memorial between your eyes”</b> (Exodus 13:9). This teaches: <b>I said to you</b> that the phylacteries are <b>one memorial, but not</b> that they are <b>two or three memorials,</b> i.e., the phylacteries themselves must be one unit. <b>How so?</b> One <b>writes</b> the passages <b>on four hides and places them in four compartments</b> fashioned <b>of one hide.</b>
<b>And if</b> a scribe <b>wrote</b> all four of <b>them on one hide and placed them in four compartments</b> by slitting the parchment between each of the passages, one who dons these phylacteries has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And</b> in such a case it is <b>necessary for there to be a space between</b> each of the passages, so that each can be placed in a separate compartment; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: It is not necessary</b> for there to be a space between them. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis <b>agree that one places a string or</b> a thicker <b>band between each and every one</b> of the four compartments. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And if their furrows,</b> i.e., the lines marking the separation between the compartments, <b>are not noticeable</b> from the outside, the phylacteries <b>are unfit.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does</b> a scribe <b>write them?</b> With regard to <b>the phylacteries of the arm, he writes it on one hide. But if he wrote it on four</b> separate <b>hides and placed it in one compartment,</b> one who wears it has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And</b> in such a case <b>it is necessary to attach</b> the four parchments, <b>as it is stated: “And it shall be for a sign for you upon your arm”</b> (Exodus 13:9). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the phylacteries of the arm are <b>one sign on the outside,</b> as the compartment is fashioned from a single hide, <b>so too,</b> they must be <b>one sign on the inside,</b> i.e., the four passages must be on a single parchment. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: It is not necessary</b> to attach the passages.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: And Rabbi Yehuda the Distinguished [<i>Beribbi</i>] concedes to me that if one does not have phylacteries of the arm but has two phylacteries of the head, that he covers one of them with patches of hide,</b> to render it like one compartment, <b>and places it</b> on his arm. The Gemara asks: How can Rabbi Yosei say that Rabbi Yehuda <b>concedes</b> to him in this case? <b>This is</b> the very situation in which <b>their dispute</b> applies, as they disagree over whether or not the passages of the phylacteries of the arm may be written on separate parchments. <b>Rava said: From Rabbi Yosei’s statement</b> one can infer that <b>Rabbi Yehuda retracted</b> his opinion and accepted Rabbi Yosei’s ruling.
Rabbi Yosei said that all agree that one can convert phylacteries of the head into phylacteries of the arm. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But Rav Ḥananya sent</b> the following ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If one has <b>phylacteries of the arm,</b> he <b>can convert it to</b> phylacteries <b>of the head, but</b> if one has phylacteries <b>of the head,</b> he <b>cannot convert it to</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm, because one does not reduce</b> the sanctity of an item <b>from</b> a level of <b>greater sanctity</b> of phylacteries of the head <b>to</b> a level of <b>lesser sanctity</b> of phylacteries of the arm.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling is stated <b>with regard to old</b> phylacteries, which have already been worn on one’s head and therefore have a greater level of sanctity, whereas <b>that</b> ruling is stated <b>with regard to new</b> phylacteries, which have not yet been used. The Gemara adds: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>designation is significant,</b> i.e., once one designates an item for use in fulfilling a particular mitzva, it assumes the sanctity of an item used for mitzvot, this ruling is stated with regard to a case <b>where he stipulated with regard to them from the outset</b> that he may convert it from phylacteries of the head to phylacteries of the arm, and only in this circumstance it is permitted to convert them.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one arrange</b> the four passages inside the phylacteries? The passage of: <b>“Sanctify unto Me”</b> (Exodus 13:1–10), and the passage of: <b>“And it shall be when He shall bring you”</b> (Exodus 13:11–16), are placed <b>on the right;</b> the passage of: <b>“Listen,</b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4–9), and the passage of: <b>“And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:13–21), are placed <b>on the left.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one places them in the <b>opposite</b> manner, with the first two passages on the left and the latter two on the right? <b>Abaye said</b> that it is <b>not difficult: Here</b> it means <b>to the right of</b> the <b>reader,</b> i.e., one who is standing opposite the one donning the phylacteries, whereas <b>there</b> it means <b>to the right of</b> the <b>one who is donning</b> the phylacteries. <b>And</b> in this manner <b>the reader reads</b> the passages <b>in their order,</b> as they appear in the Torah, starting with Exodus 13:1–10 to his right.
<b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one exchanged its passages,</b> i.e., placed them in a different order within the compartment, the phylacteries <b>are unfit. Abaye said: We did not say</b> this

Daf 35a

<b>unless</b> it is a case where one exchanges <b>an inner</b> passage <b>for an outer</b> one, e.g., he placed the passage of Exodus 13:11–16 to the right of Exodus 13:1–10, <b>or an outer</b> passage <b>for an inner one,</b> e.g., he placed the passage of Deuteronomy 11:13–21 to the right of Deuteronomy 6:4–9. <b>But</b> if one exchanges <b>an inner</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>inner</b> one, i.e., he exchanges Exodus 13:11–16 with Deuteronomy 6:4–9, <b>or an outer</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>outer</b> one, i.e., he exchanges Exodus 13:1–10 with Deuteronomy 11:13–21, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>What is different</b> about the cases of exchanging <b>an inner</b> passage <b>for an outer</b> one, <b>and an outer</b> passage <b>for an inner</b> one, such <b>that</b> the phylacteries are <b>not</b> fit? The reason is <b>that this</b> passage, <b>which needs to see the air,</b> i.e., to be placed on the outer side, <b>does not see</b> it, <b>and that</b> passage, <b>which does not need to see the air, does see it.</b> But in a case where one exchanges <b>an outer</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>outer</b> one <b>or an inner</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>inner</b> one, it should be unfit <b>as well,</b> as <b>this</b> passage, <b>which needs to see the air of</b> the <b>right</b> side, <b>sees the air of</b> the <b>left</b> side, <b>and</b> that passage, which requires to see the air <b>of</b> the <b>left</b> side, <b>sees the air of</b> the <b>right</b> side. <b>Rather,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between any of these cases, and any change in the order renders the phylacteries unfit.
§ <b>And Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The requirement to have <b>the <i>titora</i> of phylacteries,</b> i.e., the base of phylacteries upon which the compartments rest, is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Abaye said:</b> The requirement to have <b>the <i>ma’ebarta</i> of phylacteries,</b> i.e., the passageway through which the straps are inserted, is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. And Abaye says:</b> The requirement to have a letter <b><i>shin</i></b> protruding <b>on</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> of one’s head, which is achieved by pressing the hide into the shape of that letter, is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b>
Abaye further says: <b>And there is a requirement that</b> the <b>furrow</b> between each of the compartments of phylacteries of the head <b>reach the place of the stitches,</b> i.e., the <i>titora</i>, to which the compartments are sewn. <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a says: Once it is noticeable</b> that there is a furrow between each of the compartments, <b>it is not necessary</b> for them to reach all the way to the <i>titora</i>.
<b>And Abaye says:</b> With regard to <b>this parchment</b> upon which one writes the passages <b>of phylacteries,</b> the scribe <b>must examine it</b> before writing, <b>as perhaps it has a flaw,</b> i.e., a perforation, <b>and complete writing is required, and</b> that requirement would <b>not</b> be fulfilled if a letter were perforated. <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a says: No</b> prior examination is <b>required;</b> rather, <b>the quill examines it</b> as one writes, as any perforation which the ink covers is disregarded.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The requirement that the <b>straps</b> of the phylacteries be <b>black</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may tie phylacteries only</b> with straps <b>of their</b> same <b>type,</b> i.e., the straps must be made from hide, and it does not matter <b>whether</b> they are <b>green, or black, or white.</b> Nevertheless, <b>one should not make red</b> straps, <b>because</b> this is <b>deprecatory</b> to him, as it looks like he has wounds on his head, <b>and</b> also due to <b>something else,</b> i.e., lest people suspect him of engaging in sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman and getting blood on the straps.
The Gemara cites the continuation of that <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva’s student, who would tie his phylacteries with strips of sky</b>-<b>blue wool</b> rather than hide, <b>and</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>did not say anything to him.</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>that righteous man saw his student</b> doing something improper <b>and he did not object to his</b> conduct? Another Sage <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Yes,</b> it is possible that the student acted improperly, as Rabbi Akiva <b>did not see him, and if he had seen him, he would not have allowed him</b> to do so.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: There was <b>an incident involving Hyrcanus, the son of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, who would tie his phylacteries with strips of purple wool, and</b> his father <b>did not say anything to him.</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>that righteous man saw his son</b> doing something improper <b>and he did not object to his</b> conduct? The Sages <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it is possible that his son acted improperly, as Rabbi Eliezer <b>did not see him, and if he had seen him, he would not have allowed him</b> to do so. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains the objection from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that it does not matter <b>whether</b> the straps are <b>green, or black, or white,</b> whereas Rabbi Yitzḥak maintains that it is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai that the straps of the phylacteries must be black. The Gemara answers that it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the inside</b> of the straps, which touch the body. These may be any color other than red. Conversely, <b>there,</b> when Rabbi Yitzḥak says that the straps of the phylacteries must be black, he is speaking of <b>the outside</b> of the straps.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing <b>the inside</b> of the straps, <b>what deprecatory</b> matter <b>or</b> problem of <b>something else is there</b> with straps that are red on the inside? After all, this side is not seen. The Gemara answers: <b>Sometimes his</b> straps <b>become reversed,</b> and therefore these concerns are applicable.
It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The requirement that <b>phylacteries</b> be <b>square</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Rav Pappa says</b> about this <i>halakha</i>: Square means <b>along their seams and their diagonals,</b> i.e., they must be perfectly square where the compartments are sewn to the <i>titora</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a mishna <b>supports</b> this opinion (<i>Megilla</i> 24b): <b>One who fashions his phylacteries</b> in <b>a round</b> shape exposes himself to <b>danger, and it</b> does <b>not</b> enable him to fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> of phylacteries. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is no support, as one can say that <b>the mishna</b> is referring to phylacteries <b>that are fashioned like a nut,</b> i.e., their underside is rounded, and therefore there is a danger that if he strikes his head on a wall the underside will press into his head and injure him. By contrast, if the underside is flat one might have thought that it is fit despite the fact that it is not square. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that phylacteries must be square.
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to <b>phylacteries</b> of the head, <b>as long as the surface of outer hide is intact,</b> i.e., it is not torn, <b>they are fit,</b> even if the hide between the compartments has torn. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If <b>two</b> of the walls between the compartments <b>tore,</b> such phylacteries <b>are fit,</b> but if <b>three</b> of these inner walls tore, <b>they are unfit.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> Concerning <b>that which you said,</b> that if <b>two</b> of the walls between the compartments tore <b>they are fit, we said</b> this <b>only</b> if the inner walls that tore are <b>not aligned with each other,</b> i.e., they are not adjacent to one another. <b>But</b> if the torn walls are <b>aligned with each other,</b> the phylacteries <b>are unfit. And</b> furthermore, <b>even</b> in a case where the torn walls are <b>aligned with each other, we said</b> that they are unfit <b>only with regard to new</b> phylacteries, as the hide is certainly defective. <b>But with regard to old</b> phylacteries, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> as they tore due to aging.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What are the circumstances</b> of <b>new</b> phylacteries, <b>and what are the circumstances</b> of <b>old</b> phylacteries? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> In <b>any</b> case <b>where if one holds the hide and pulls it, it returns to its place [<i>ḥaleim</i>],</b> these phylacteries are considered <b>old; and</b> in <b>the other</b> case, where hide that was pulled does not return to its place, they are considered <b>new.</b>

Daf 35b

<b>Alternatively,</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where if</b> the phylacteries are <b>hanging by the strap</b> the compartment <b>follows</b> the strap, i.e., it remains attached, these phylacteries are considered <b>new; and</b> in <b>the other</b> case, where the phylacteries would fall off, they are considered <b>old.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye was sitting before Rav Yosef</b> when the <b>strap of his phylacteries tore.</b> Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether one may <b>tie</b> the strap? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: It is written</b> with regard to phylacteries: <b>“And you shall bind them [<i>ukshartam</i>]</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), which teaches <b>that</b> the <b>binding must be complete [<i>keshira tamma</i>],</b> whole and beautiful, and that would not be the case with a makeshift knot.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether one may <b>sew</b> a strap that tore <b>and insert</b> the <b>stitching inside,</b> so that it is not visible from the outside? Rav Ashi <b>said</b> to him: <b>Go out and see what the people are doing.</b> If the common custom is to do this, it is permitted.
<b>Rav Pappa says: The remnants of straps,</b> i.e., what remains when part of the strap has been cut off, <b>are fit.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And it is not so,</b> as can be derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say: The remnants of</b> the <b>sky</b>-<b>blue wool</b> of ritual fringes, when only a small thread remains, <b>and</b> likewise <b>the remnants of</b> the <b>hyssop,</b> used for the sprinkling of the purification water of the red heifer, <b>are fit.</b> They did not include the remnants of straps of phylacteries in this <i>halakha</i>. The reason for this difference is that <b>it is there</b> that the remnants are fit, <b>as they are</b> mere <b>articles</b> used in the performance <b>of a mitzva; but here,</b> phylacteries <b>are articles of sanctity,</b> which are of greater sanctity, and therefore their remnants are <b>not</b> fit.
The Gemara states: From this line of inquiry one can conclude <b>by inference that</b> the straps of phylacteries <b>have</b> a minimum requisite <b>measure. And how much is their measure? Rami bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> It is <b>until the index finger.</b> In explanation of this size, <b>Rav Kahana</b> would <b>demonstrate a bowed</b> measure, i.e., from the tip of the middle finger until the tip of the index finger, with the fingers spread. <b>Rav Ashi</b> would <b>demonstrate a straight</b> measure, from the tip of the thumb until the tip of the index finger, with the fingers spread.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba</b> would <b>tie</b> the straps <b>and release</b> them <b>and let them fall</b> behind him. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> would <b>tie them and plait them</b> together like a braid. <b>Mar, son of Rabbana,</b> would <b>act like we</b> do, i.e., he would let the straps fall and hang over the front of his body.
<b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, says in the name of Rav:</b> The form of the <b>knot of phylacteries,</b> i.e., that there must be the form of a letter <i>dalet</i> in the knot of the phylacteries of the head and the letter <i>yod</i> in the knot of the phylacteries of the arm, is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Rav Naḥman says: And their decorative</b> side, the black side of the knot where the shape of the letter is visible, must face <b>outward.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ashi was sitting before Mar Zutra</b> when the <b>strap of</b> his <b>phylacteries became reversed.</b> Mar Zutra <b>said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with the ruling that <b>their decorative</b> side must face <b>outward?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> It did <b>not</b> enter <b>my mind,</b> i.e., I did not notice.
With regard to the verse: <b>“And all the nations of the land shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you, and they shall be afraid of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:10), it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: This</b> is a reference to <b>the phylacteries of the head,</b> upon which the name of God is written, as they demonstrate to all that the name of God is called upon the Jewish people. With regard to the statement of God to Moses: <b>“And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back”</b> (Exodus 33:23), <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says:</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed Moses the knot of</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> of the head.
<b>Rav Yehuda says: The knot of phylacteries must be above,</b> i.e., it must rest on the head rather than on the neck, <b>in order that the Jewish people should be above and not below. And</b> likewise <b>it must be placed toward the front [<i>panim</i>],</b> i.e., not on the sides of the head, <b>in order that the Jewish people should be in front [<i>lefanim</i>] and not behind.</b>
§ <b>Rav Shmuel bar Bideri says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Aḥa Arikha,</b> i.e., Rabbi Aḥa the Tall, <b>says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Menashya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>phylacteries, from when does one recite a blessing over them? From the time when one dons them</b> on the arm and onward. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>all the mitzvot, one recites a blessing over them prior to their performance?</b> How, then, can one recite a blessing over phylacteries after donning them? <b>Abaye and Rava both say:</b> One recites the blessing <b>from the time of donning</b> the phylacteries <b>until the time of binding</b> them, as the binding constitutes the performance of the mitzva.

Daf 36a

§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If one <b>spoke between</b> donning the <b>phylacteries</b> of the arm <b>and</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> of the head, he must <b>recite the blessing again</b> when donning the phylacteries of the head.
The Gemara notes: One can infer that if he <b>spoke, yes,</b> he must recite a blessing when donning the phylacteries of the head, but if he <b>did not speak,</b> he does <b>not</b> recite a blessing. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, sent</b> a ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: On the phylacteries of the arm</b> one <b>says</b> the blessing: <b>Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, <b>Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us to don phylacteries. On the phylacteries of the head</b> one <b>says</b> the blessing: <b>Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, <b>Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us concerning the mitzva of phylacteries.</b> This indicates that one always recites a blessing when donning the phylacteries of the head.
<b>Abaye and Rava both say,</b> to resolve this apparent contradiction: Rabbi Yoḥanan meant that if one <b>did not speak,</b> he <b>recites one</b> blessing; if he <b>spoke,</b> he <b>recites two</b> blessings, when donning the phylacteries of the head as well as when donning the phylacteries of the arm.
Concerning this, it is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>spoke between</b> donning the <b>phylacteries</b> of the arm <b>and</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> of the head, <b>he has a sin, and due to</b> that sin <b>he returns from the ranks of</b> soldiers waging <b>war.</b> This is referring to the preparation for war, when the officers announce: “What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house” (Deuteronomy 20:8). The Sages explained that this is referring to one who is fearful due to his transgressions.
It is further <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one dons</b> phylacteries, he first <b>dons</b> the phylacteries <b>of the arm and afterward dons</b> the phylacteries <b>of the head. And when he removes</b> his phylacteries, he first <b>removes</b> the phylacteries <b>of the head and afterward removes</b> the phylacteries <b>of the arm.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the ruling that <b>when one dons</b> phylacteries he first <b>dons</b> the phylacteries <b>of the arm and afterward dons</b> the phylacteries <b>of the head</b> is understood, <b>as it is</b> first <b>written: “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your arm,” and then</b> it is written: <b>“And they shall be for frontlets between your eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:8).
<b>But from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that <b>when he removes</b> his phylacteries, he first <b>removes</b> the phylacteries <b>of the head and afterward he removes</b> the phylacteries <b>of the arm? Rabba said</b> in explanation: <b>Rav Huna explained to me</b> the source of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your arm <b>and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes,”</b> and it is derived from here: <b>As long as</b> the phylacteries of the head are <b>between your eyes,</b> the number of phylacteries you are wearing <b>shall be two.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>phylacteries, from when does one recite a blessing over them? From</b> when <b>the time</b> arrives to <b>don them. How so? If one is rising early to leave</b> his home <b>to</b> travel on <b>the road and is afraid lest</b> his phylacteries <b>become lost</b> during the journey, he <b>dons them</b> even at night, despite the fact that this is not the proper time for the mitzva of phylacteries. <b>And when</b> the <b>time</b> for <b>their</b> mitzva <b>arrives,</b> in the morning, <b>he touches them and recites a blessing over them.</b>
<b>And until when does one wear them? Until the sun sets. Rabbi Ya’akov says: Until traffic in the marketplace ceases. And the Rabbis say: Until the time of sleep. And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Ya’akov that if one removed them to go out to the bathroom or to enter the bathhouse and the sun set, one does not don them again.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov.</b> The Gemara likewise relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna would pray in the evening,</b> i.e., the evening service, <b>with</b> phylacteries. <b>Some say</b> that Rav Naḥman ruled that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> but in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> that the mitzva of phylacteries ends at sunset.

Daf 36b

The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna would pray in the evening with</b> phylacteries. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> opinion represented in this incident <b>disagrees</b> with the ruling of Rav Naḥman.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that the mitzva of phylacteries applies at night? <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar Rav Huna say:</b> If it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>nightfall</b> or whether it is <b>not nightfall,</b> one <b>neither removes</b> his phylacteries, as it is not yet definitely night, <b>nor dons</b> them <i>ab initio</i>. <b>This</b> indicates that if it is <b>definitely nightfall,</b> one <b>removes</b> his phylacteries. The Gemara answers: Rabba bar Rav Huna’s ruling <b>there was stated with regard to Shabbat eve,</b> as one may not don phylacteries on Shabbat, when the mitzva does not apply.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>What does</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>hold? If he holds</b> that <b>night</b> is <b>a time</b> when one performs the mitzva of wearing <b>phylacteries,</b> then <b>Shabbat</b> is <b>also a time</b> when one performs the mitzva of wearing <b>phylacteries. If he holds</b> that <b>Shabbat</b> is <b>not a time</b> when one performs the mitzva of wearing <b>phylacteries,</b> then <b>night</b> is <b>also not a time</b> when one performs the mitzva of wearing <b>phylacteries.</b> The reason for this statement is <b>that from</b> the source <b>where Shabbat is excluded</b> from the mitzva of phylacteries, <b>nights are excluded from there</b> as well.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the end of the passage of the Torah that discusses both the mitzvot of the Paschal offering and phylacteries: <b>“And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [<i>miyamim</i>] to year”</b> (Exodus 13:10). This indicates that these mitzvot apply during the <b>days [<i>yamim</i>] but not</b> during the <b>nights.</b> Furthermore, the letter <i>mem</i>, meaning from, in the term: <b>“From year [<i>miyamim</i>],”</b> teaches: These mitzvot apply on some days, <b>but not</b> on <b>all days.</b> This <b>excludes <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals,</b> on which phylacteries are not worn. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says: This</b> verse, mentioning <b>an ordinance, is stated only with regard to the Paschal</b> offering, and it is not referring to phylacteries at all. Evidently, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says that at night one is exempt from the obligation of donning phylacteries, says that on Shabbat one is exempt as well.
The Gemara answers: Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>derives</b> the exemption from the obligation to don phylacteries on Shabbat <b>from</b> a different source, the source <b>where Rabbi Akiva derives it from, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person should don phylacteries on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm, and for a remembrance between your eyes,</b> so that God’s law shall be in your mouth; for with a strong arm God brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:9). This teaches that the obligation to don phylacteries applies when the Jewish people <b>require a sign</b> to assert their status as God’s nation, i.e., during the week. This serves to <b>exclude <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals, as they themselves are signs</b> of the Jewish people’s status as God’s nation and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: Anyone who dons phylacteries after sunset violates a positive mitzva. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He violates a prohibition.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that these Sages <b>disagree with regard to</b> the principle that <b>Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says. As Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: Any place where it is stated</b> in the Torah any of the terms: <b>Observe,</b> or: <b>Lest, or: Do not,</b> this means <b>nothing other than a prohibition,</b> as these are negative terms.
The Gemara explains this suggestion: <b>As</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Avin,</b> and therefore the verse: “And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year to year,” from which the exclusion of nights is derived, is a prohibition, as it employs the term “observe.” <b>And</b> that <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Avin,</b> and therefore the term: “And you shall observe,” is a positive mitzva.
The Gemara counters: <b>No, everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says, and here they disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds</b> that the term <b>“observe”</b> written <b>with regard to a prohibition</b> has the status of <b>a prohibition,</b> whereas that same term <b>“observe”</b> written <b>with regard to a positive</b> mitzva has the status of <b>a positive</b> mitzva, as the Torah is issuing a warning to take special care in the observance of a mitzva. Accordingly, the command with regard to the positive mitzva of phylacteries is a positive mitzva. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that the term <b>“observe”</b> written <b>with regard to a positive</b> mitzva is <b>also a prohibition.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: And</b> although it is prohibited to don phylacteries at night, <b>if</b> one does so in order <b>to safeguard them</b> from theft and the like, it is <b>permitted.And Ravina said: I was sitting before Rav Ashi and</b> it <b>grew dark, and he donned phylacteries. And I said to him: Does the Master need to safeguard them? And he said to me: Yes. But I saw that his intention</b> in donning them was <b>not</b> that he <b>needed to safeguard them;</b> rather, Rav Ashi <b>holds:</b> This is the <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> that night is an appropriate time for phylacteries, <b>but</b> a public <b>ruling is not issued to that effect.</b>
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says: A person is obligated to touch</b> his <b>phylacteries</b> regularly for <b>the entire time</b> that he is wearing them. This is derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest, as follows: <b>And if</b> with regard to the <b>frontplate, which has only one mention</b> of God’s name, <b>the Torah states: “And it should be always upon his forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), which means that the High Priest must always be aware that the frontplate is placed on his head and <b>that he should not be distracted from it,</b> then with regard to <b>phylacteries, which have numerous mentions</b> of God’s name, <b>all the more so</b> one must always be aware of them.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And it shall be for a sign for you on <b>your arm [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:9), that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>left</b> arm. <b>Do you say</b> it means the <b>left</b> arm, <b>or is it only</b> the <b>right</b> arm? <b>The verse states: “Even My hand [<i>yadi</i>] has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand [<i>vimini</i>] has spread out the heavens”</b> (Isaiah 48:13). <b>And</b> another verse <b>states: “Her hand [<i>yadah</i>] she put to the tent pin, and her right hand [<i>viminah</i>] to the workmen’s hammer”</b> (Judges 5:26), <b>and</b> another verse <b>states: “Why do You withdraw Your hand [<i>yadkha</i>], even Your right hand [<i>viminekha</i>]? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them”</b> (Psalms 74:11). All these verses employ the term <i>yad</i> with regard to the left hand, and use the term <i>yamin</i>, literally, right, without the term <i>yad</i>, to indicate the right hand.

Daf 37a

<b>Rabbi Yosei HaḤorem says:</b> This is no proof, as <b>we have found that</b> the <b>right</b> hand is also <b>called <i>yad</i>, as it is stated: “And when Joseph saw that his father was laying his right hand [<i>yad yemino</i>]”</b> (Genesis 48:17). The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, who maintains that the right hand is not called <i>yad</i>, how does he respond to this proof? He maintains that the right hand <b>is called “his right hand [<i>yad yemino</i>],”</b> but it <b>is not called a <i>yad</i> without</b> further <b>specification.</b>
<b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> This proof is <b>not necessary,</b> as <b>it says: “And you shall bind them</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and then it states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9). This teaches that <b>just as writing is with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, as most people write with their right hands, <b>so too,</b> the <b>binding</b> of phylacteries must be performed <b>with</b> the <b>right</b> hand. <b>And since binding is with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, this means that <b>donning is on</b> the <b>left</b> arm, as one cannot bind the phylacteries with the same hand upon which he is donning them. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Yosei HaḤorem,</b> who holds that the right hand is also called <i>yad</i> in the Torah, <b>derive that donning</b> phylacteries is <b>on</b> the <b>left</b> arm? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from where Rabbi Natan derives it.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The requirement that phylacteries be donned on the left arm is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “It shall be for a sign upon <b>your arm [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:16), which <b>is written with</b> a letter <b><i>heh</i></b> at the end. This is expounded as though it stated: Your <b>weak [<i>keha</i>]</b> arm. <b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <i>yadkha</i> should be interpreted as <i>yadko’aḥ</i>, with a letter <i>ḥet</i> at the end instead of a <i>heh</i>. If so, this would mean: <b>Your arm that is of strength [<i>shebeko’aḥ</i>],</b> which is the right arm. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Is</b> this word <b>written with a <i>ḥet</i>?</b>
The Gemara notes that Rav Ashi’s opinion, that the <i>halakha</i> that phylacteries are donned on the left arm is derived from the term <i>yadkha</i>, is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Yadkha</i></b> is written <b>with a <i>heh</i>,</b> indicating weakness, and <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>left</b> arm. <b>Others say: “Your arm,”</b> i.e., <i>yadkha</i>, serves <b>to include one without</b> a complete <b>arm,</b> i.e., one whose arm ends at the elbow, in the obligation to don phylacteries, as the remaining part is also categorized as a weak arm. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>does not have</b> a left <b>arm,</b> i.e., not even above the elbow, he is <b>exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>phylacteries. Others say: <i>Yadkha</i></b> serves <b>to include one without</b> a left <b>arm</b> even above the elbow, teaching that he must don phylacteries on his right arm.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A left-handed person dons phylacteries on his right</b> arm, <b>which is</b> equivalent to <b>his left</b> arm, i.e., his weaker arm. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that a left-handed person <b>dons</b> phylacteries <b>on his left</b> arm, <b>which is the left</b> arm <b>of every</b> other <b>person? Abaye said: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to one who has</b> equal <b>control with both his hands,</b> i.e., an ambidextrous person. Since such an individual also uses his right hand, he dons phylacteries on his left arm.
<b>The school of Menashe taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And you shall bind them for a sign on your arm, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8): <b>“On your arm”; this</b> is the <b>bicep. “Between your eyes”; this</b> is the <b>crown</b> of the head. The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> exactly on the crown of the head are the phylacteries placed? <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> Phylacteries are placed on the <b>place where</b> the bone above <b>the baby’s brain is soft</b> after birth.
§ The Sage <b>Peleimu raised a dilemma before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: In the case of <b>one who has two heads, on which of them does he don phylacteries?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Either get up</b> and <b>exile</b> yourself from here <b>or accept upon yourself excommunication</b> for asking such a ridiculous question. <b>In the meantime, a certain man arrived</b> and <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: A firstborn <b>child has been born to me who has two heads. How much</b> money <b>must I give to the priest</b> for the redemption of the firstborn? <b>A certain elder came</b> and <b>taught him: You are obligated to give him ten <i>sela</i>,</b> the requisite five for each head.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But Rami bar Ḥama teaches: Since it is stated</b> with regard to the redemption of the firstborn: <b>“The firstborn of man you shall redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:15), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even</b> if <b>he was ravaged,</b> e.g., by an animal, <b>within thirty</b> days of his birth, one should redeem him. To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b>

Daf 37b

<b>“Yet</b> the firstborn of man you shall redeem”; the addition of the word “yet” serves to <b>differentiate</b> and teach that there is a firstborn who is not redeemed, namely, one that was ravaged. A child with two heads is like one that was ravaged, as he will certainly not live. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as the Merciful One makes</b> the redemption of the firstborn <b>dependent on</b> his <b>skull,</b> as it is stated: “You shall take five shekels apiece, by the skull” (Numbers 3:47), which indicates that there is a case in which a firstborn with more than one skull must be redeemed.
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master says: “On your arm”; this</b> is the <b>bicep.</b> The term <i>yad</i> can mean either hand or arm. Therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As the Sages taught: “On your arm [<i>yadkha</i>]”; this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the arm. Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the arm, or</b> is it <b>only literally on your</b> actual <b>hand,</b> i.e., on the palm of the hand? <b>The Torah says: Don phylacteries on the <i>yad</i> and don phylacteries on the head; just as there,</b> with regard to the head, it means <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head,</b> as will be explained, <b>so too here,</b> it means <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the arm.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This proof is <b>not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “And it shall be for a sign for you</b> upon your arm” (Exodus 13:9), which teaches: It shall be <b>a sign for you, but not a sign for others,</b> i.e., one must don the phylacteries of the arm in a place where they are not seen by others. This is the arm, which is usually covered, whereas the hand is usually visible. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This proof is <b>not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “Therefore you shall place these words in your heart</b> and in your soul, <b>and you shall bind them”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:18). This teaches <b>that placing</b> the words, i.e., donning the phylacteries, <b>shall be opposite the heart,</b> on the bicep.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya,</b> would <b>direct</b> the placement of his phylacteries of the arm <b>and don</b> them <b>opposite his heart. Rav Ashi was sitting before Ameimar,</b> and <b>there was a cut in</b> the sleeve covering Ameimar’s <b>arm, and</b> as a result his <b>phylacteries were visible,</b> as they were not covered by a garment. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ameimar: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold</b> that the phylacteries shall be <b>a sign for you but not a sign for others?</b> Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> This does not mean that phylacteries must be hidden; rather, this <b>was stated</b> in order to teach that they must be donned <b>in a place</b> that is <b>a sign for you,</b> i.e., the bicep, which is generally not seen, but it does not matter if in practice the phylacteries are visible.
With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that the phylacteries of the head are donned on the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As the Sages taught: “Between your eyes”</b> (Exodus 13:9); <b>this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head. Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, or is it only literally between your eyes? It is stated here: “Between your eyes,” and it is stated there:</b> “You shall not cut yourselves, <b>nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), <b>Just as there,</b> the phrase “between your eyes” is referring to a place <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head,</b> as that is <b>a place where</b> one can <b>render</b> himself <b>bald</b> by removing his hair, <b>so too,</b> the place where phylacteries are donned is <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, a place where</b> one can <b>render</b> himself <b>bald.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This proof is <b>not necessary,</b> as <b>the Torah says: Don phylacteries on the arm</b> and <b>don phylacteries on the head. Just as there,</b> with regard to the phylacteries of the arm, it is referring <b>to a place which is fit to become ritually impure with</b> only <b>one</b> type of leprous <b>mark,</b> that of the skin, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the phylacteries of the head, it is referring <b>to a place which is fit to become ritually impure with</b> only <b>one</b> type of leprous <b>mark,</b> that of a place of hair (see Leviticus 13:29–37).
Rabbi Yehuda continues: This serves <b>to exclude</b> the area which is literally <b>“between your eyes,” as there is flesh and</b> the <b>hair</b> of the eyebrows present there, and therefore <b>there is</b> a possibility of leprosy through the growth of <b>a white hair,</b> which is impure according to the <i>halakhot</i> of leprosy of the skin (see Leviticus 13:3), <b>and there is also</b> a possibility of leprosy through the growth of <b>a yellow hair,</b> which is impure according to the <i>halakhot</i> of leprosy of the head or the beard (see Leviticus 13:30).
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the <b>four ritual fringes</b> on a garment, the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, as the four of them</b> constitute <b>one mitzva.</b> Rabbi Yishmael says: The four of them are four discrete mitzvot, and the absence of one does not prevent fulfillment of the rest. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yishmael? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> their opinions <b>is</b> with regard to a linen <b>sheet with</b> woolen <b>ritual fringes</b> that has fewer than four ritual fringes. The first <i>tanna</i> maintains that since one is not performing a mitzva, he may not wrap himself in the sheet, due to the prohibition of diverse kinds, i.e., the prohibition against wearing clothing made from a mixture of wool and linen threads. Conversely, Rabbi Yishmael permits one to wrap himself in it, as each ritual fringe is a separate mitzva, and the mitzva of ritual fringes overrides the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds.
<b>Rava bar Ahina said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> their opinions <b>is</b> with regard to <b>a cloak with five</b> corners. It is derived that a cloak of this kind requires ritual fringes (see 43b), but it is unclear whether ritual fringes must be placed on each corner. If each fringe is a discrete mitzva, then the obligation applies to the fifth corner as well, but if it is one mitzva then it applies only to four of the corners of this garment.
<b>Ravina said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> their opinions <b>is</b> with regard to the opinion <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: One who goes out</b> unwittingly to the public domain <b>on Shabbat with</b> a four-cornered <b>cloak that does not have</b> all of <b>the requisite ritual fringes</b> attached to its corners is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering,</b> because the remaining fringes are not an integral part of the garment. Since they do not enable the wearer to fulfill the mitzva, they are considered a burden, which may not be carried into the public domain on Shabbat. The first <i>tanna</i> agrees with this ruling, whereas Rabbi Yishmael maintains that since each corner with ritual fringes is the fulfillment of a mitzva, one is not liable to bring a sin offering due to carrying on Shabbat for wearing it into the public domain.
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: One who cuts</b> the corner of <b>his garmenthas not done anything</b> of consequence with regard to exempting the garment from the obligation of ritual fringes, as <b>he has rendered it a cloak with five</b> corners, to which the obligation of ritual fringes applies.
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya</b> similarly <b>says: One who ties his garment has not done anything</b> of consequence with regard to exempting the garment from the obligation of ritual fringes. <b>What is the reason? It is considered as though</b> the garment is <b>untied,</b> since the knot can be loosened at any time. <b>And we learned likewise</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:4): <b>All bound</b> leather <b>jugs,</b> i.e., those whose bottoms are not sewn but tied, <b>are ritually pure,</b> i.e., they are not susceptible to ritual impurity. This is because they are not considered receptacles, as these knots will be untied, <b>except for</b> leather <b>jugs of Arabs,</b> who would tie them with a permanent knot.
<b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a</b> similarly <b>says: One who sews his garment,</b> i.e., he folded over a long garment and sewed the edges together, <b>has not done anything</b> of consequence with regard to the obligation of ritual fringes, and he must place ritual fringes on the original corners. The reason is that <b>if it is so that he does not need</b> the folded part, which is why he is sewing it, <b>let him cut</b> it <b>and throw it</b> away.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: The four of them are four</b> discrete <b>mitzvot,</b> and the absence of one does not prevent fulfillment of the rest. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b> The Gemara states: <b>But the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with his</b> opinion.
The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina was walking behind Mar bar Rav Ashi on the Shabbat of the Festival</b> when <b>the corner</b> of Mar bar Rav Ashi’s garment <b>on</b> which <b>his ritual fringes</b> were hanging <b>tore, and</b> yet Ravina <b>did not say anything to him. When he arrived at</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi’s <b>house,</b> Ravina <b>said to him: Back there,</b> along the way, the corner <b>tore.</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If you would have told me</b> then, <b>I would have thrown off</b> the garment <b>there,</b> as once one of the ritual fringes is torn no mitzva is performed with the rest, and it is prohibited to walk in the public domain on Shabbat wearing such a garment. This is in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, who disagrees with the ruling of Rabbi Yishmael.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t the Master say: Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah?</b> This includes the prohibition against carrying on Shabbat in the public domain. That being the case, why would he remove his garment in public?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav bar Shabba interpreted</b> that statement <b>before Rav Kahana:</b>

Daf 38a

He stated this <b>with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall not deviate</b> to the left or the right of that which they tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). A prohibition by rabbinic law is overridden by human dignity, but not a prohibition by Torah law. Therefore, Mar bar Rav Ashi would have removed his garment had he known about the tear.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of this discussion: It was <b>when</b> they were <b>there,</b> in the place where the corner of Mar bar Rav Ashi’s garment tore, that Ravina <b>said to him</b> that it had torn, <b>and</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>What is your opinion?</b> Do you think <b>that I should throw</b> the garment off? <b>But doesn’t the Master say: Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah?</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But Rav bar Shabba interpreted</b> that statement <b>before Rav Kahana:</b> He stated this <b>with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall not deviate,”</b> not the prohibition against carrying in the public domain, which applies by Torah law. The Gemara answers that <b>here too,</b> it is not a prohibition by Torah law, as the place where they were walking was not a full-fledged public domain but <b>a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> in which carrying <b>is</b> prohibited <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The absence of <b>the sky-blue [<i>tekhelet</i>]</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of ritual fringes with <b>the white</b> strings, <b>and the</b> absence of <b>white</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the sky-blue</b> strings. If one has only one, he wears it without the other. Absence of the <b>phylacteries of</b> the <b>arm does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of the phylacteries <b>of</b> the <b>head, and</b> absence of the phylacteries <b>of</b> the <b>head does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of the phylacteries <b>of</b> the <b>arm.</b> If one has only one, he dons it without the other.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse requires one to place white and sky-blue strings upon the corners of his garments and then states: <b>“That you may look upon it”</b> (Numbers 15:39), it <b>teaches</b> that the lack of either <b>one prevents</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the other;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> The lack of one <b>does not prevent the</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.
The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, i.e., how does he derive his ruling from this verse? The Gemara explains: <b>As it is written:</b> “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread” (Numbers 15:38). “The fringe of <b>the corner”</b> is a reference to strings that are of the same <b>type</b> as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. Since garments are usually white, this phrase is referring to white strings. <b>And it is written</b> in this same verse: <b>“A sky-blue thread.” And the Merciful One states</b> in the following verse, referring to both types of strings: “And it shall be to you for a fringe <b>that you may look upon it”</b> (Numbers 15:39), in the singular. This teaches that one does not fulfill his obligation <b>until both</b> types <b>are present together.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the one can fulfill one obligation without the other, understand this verse? The Gemara answers: They hold that the phrase <b>“that you may look upon it” indicates</b> that one fulfills a mitzva with <b>each one individually.</b>
The Gemara concludes its initial suggestion: <b>Shall we say that</b> the mishna, which states that one can fulfill the mitzva with either white or sky-blue strings even in the absence of the other, is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and the ruling of the mishna <b>is necessary only with regard to granting precedence.</b> The white strings should precede the blue strings, but if the order is reversed, one still fulfills the mitzva.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is <b>a mitzva to</b> insert the <b>white</b> strings into the garment <b>before</b> inserting <b>the sky-blue</b> strings, <b>but if</b> one inserted the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>before the white</b> strings, he <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation <b>but omitted</b> the <b>mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean by the phrase: <b>Omitted</b> the <b>mitzva?</b>

Daf 38b

<b>If we say</b> that the individual <b>omitted</b> the <b>mitzva of white</b> strings <b>and fulfilled</b> only the <b>mitzva of sky-blue</b> strings, how is this possible? <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the absence of either one <b>prevents</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the other,</b> and therefore in this case one would not fulfill any mitzva at all.
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It means <b>that he omitted a mitzva but</b> nevertheless <b>performed a mitzva. And what</b> does it mean that he <b>omitted a mitzva?</b> It means <b>that he did not perform</b> the <b>mitzva in the optimal manner</b> because he did not insert the white strings first, but he did fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well</b> with regard to the mishna’s statement that absence of the <b>white</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the sky-blue</b> strings, which has been interpreted to mean that failing to insert the white strings before the sky-blue strings does not invalidate the ritual fringes. But <b>what is</b> the meaning of the mishna’s statement <b>that</b> the absence of <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the white</b> strings?
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> That statement of the mishna <b>is necessary only</b> in the case of <b>a garment that</b> consists <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool.</b> In such a case, one is supposed to insert the sky-blue strings before the white strings.
The Gemara notes that this <b>was also stated</b> by <i>amora’im</i>: <b>Levi said to Shmuel: Aryokh, do not sit on your feet until you explain to me this matter:</b> When the mishna states that the absence of <b>the sky-blue</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of ritual fringes <b>with the white</b> strings, <b>and the</b> absence of <b>white</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the sky-blue</b> strings, <b>what</b> does <b>it</b> mean? Shmuel <b>said to</b> Levi: That statement <b>is necessary only</b> in the case of a linen <b>cloak</b> on which one places <b>ritual fringes, where</b> there is <b>a mitzva to</b> insert the <b>white</b> strings <b>first.</b>
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? The verse states: “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread” (Numbers 15:38). “The fringe of <b>the corner”</b> is a reference to the string that is the same <b>type</b> as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. In the case of a linen cloak, which is generally white, this is a reference to the white strings, and since the verse mentions “the fringe of the corner” before the sky-blue thread, the white strings must be inserted before the sky-blue strings. The mishna therefore teaches that <b>if</b> one inserted the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>before the white</b> strings, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it</b> after the fact, and the ritual fringes are valid.
The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> with regard to the mishna’s statement <b>that</b> absence of the <b>white</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the sky-blue</b> strings. But <b>what is</b> the meaning of the mishna’s statement <b>that</b> the absence of <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the white</b> strings?
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said to him:</b> That statement of the mishna <b>is necessary only</b> in the case of <b>a garment that</b> consists <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool, where</b> it is <b>a mitzva to</b> insert the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>first, as</b> the phrase: “The fringe of <b>the corner”</b> indicates that the first strings one inserts into the garment are those that are the same <b>type</b> as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. The mishna therefore teaches that <b>if</b> one inserted the <b>white</b> strings <b>first, we have no</b> problem <b>with it</b> after the fact, and the ritual fringes are fit.
<b>Rava said: Is it</b> actually the <b>color</b> of the garment that <b>determines</b> the proper order in which one should insert the strings? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The ruling of the mishna <b>is necessary only for</b> a case of <b>severed</b> strings. The mishna teaches <b>that if</b> the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>were severed and</b> the <b>white</b> ones <b>remain, or if</b> the <b>white</b> strings <b>were severed and</b> the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>remain, we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and the ritual fringes are fit.
<b>As the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say: Severed</b> white or <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>are fit, and</b> similarly, <b>severed hyssop</b> branches <b>are fit</b> for sprinkling the water of purification mixed with the ashes of a red heifer. The Gemara asks: <b>What measure</b> do <b>severed</b> strings need to be in order to remain fit? <b>Bar Hamduri says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The strings must remain long <b>enough to tie them in a slipknot.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When Shmuel says that severed strings must still be long <b>enough to tie them in a slipknot,</b> does that mean <b>to tie all of the</b> strings <b>together in a slipknot? Or perhaps</b> the strings may be even shorter, provided that they are long enough to tie <b>each one individually.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Ashi asks:</b> If the strings are <b>thick</b> and <b>cannot be tied in a slipknot, but if they were</b> the same length but <b>thin</b> they <b>could be tied in a slipknot, what</b> is their status? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the strings are long enough to be fit if they are thin, <b>all the more so</b> they are fit if they are thick, <b>as the mitzva</b> one fulfills <b>with them is</b> more <b>recognizable</b> with thicker strings.
The Gemara cited the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that one cannot fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes without both white and sky-blue strings, and the Gemara explained that the mishna can be interpreted in accordance with his opinion. The Gemara now asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and holds that the sky-blue strings and the white strings are not interdependent? The Gemara answers: <b>It is this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says in the name of Rabbi Natan, who said in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri:</b> If <b>one does not have sky-blue</b> strings, he nevertheless <b>affixes white</b> strings.
<b>Rava said: Learn from</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya that one is <b>required to tie</b> a knot <b>after each and every set</b> of windings, and one cannot suffice with only one knot at the end of all the windings. <b>As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that one is <b>not required</b> to tie a knot after each set of windings, then <b>that which the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say: Severed</b> white or <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>are fit, and</b> similarly, <b>severed hyssop</b> branches <b>are fit,</b> is difficult: <b>Once the uppermost</b> knot <b>is undone,</b> all of the windings on <b>the entire</b> corner will <b>come undone,</b> as there are no other knots holding the windings in place, and in that case the garment will not have valid ritual fringes.

Daf 39a

The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya were referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>tied knots</b> between the sets of windings even though there is no obligation to do so.
<b>And Rabba says: Learn from it</b> that <b>the uppermost knot</b> in the ritual fringes is required <b>by Torah</b> law. <b>As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that it is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, whereas by Torah law it is sufficient to merely insert the strings into the hole without tying any knots, for <b>what</b> reason <b>was</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to permit</b> placing wool <b>ritual fringes</b> on a linen <b>cloak?</b> It is <b>obvious</b> that it is permitted, since if <b>one attaches</b> a swatch of wool and a swatch of linen <b>with a single connection, it is not</b> considered <b>a connection</b> with regard to the prohibition against wearing a garment that includes both wool and linen. <b>Rather, learn from</b> it that the uppermost knot is required <b>by Torah law.</b>
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says: If a string was severed at its base,</b> i.e., where it is connected to the garment, the ritual fringes are <b>unfit. Rav Naḥman sat</b> in the study hall <b>and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that there is a minimum length required for the strings? That is only when the strings are <b>initially</b> affixed to the garment. <b>But</b> in the <b>end,</b> i.e., after the strings are affixed in an acceptable manner, <b>its remainder and its severed</b> strings are fit at <b>any</b> length.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is <b>its remainder and what</b> are <b>its severed</b> strings? <b>What, is it not</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> mentions <b>its remainder</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> parts <b>of the</b> strings <b>were severed and</b> parts <b>of them remain, and</b> when the <i>baraita</i> mentions <b>its severed</b> strings it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the strings <b>were completely severed,</b> and nevertheless the strings are fit for the mitzva?
The Gemara responds to Rava’s objection: <b>No,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching one</b> <i>halakha</i>, and the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>The remainder of its severed</b> strings are fit at <b>any length.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> simply <b>say: Its severed</b> strings are fit at any length; <b>why do I</b> need the mention of <b>its remainder? This teaches us that we require a remainder of its severed</b> strings long <b>enough to</b> wrap them around the other strings and <b>tie them in a slipknot.</b>
§ <b>Rabba sat</b> in the study hall <b>and said in the name of Rav:</b> The <b>string</b> used <b>for winding</b> around the other strings <b>is counted in the quota</b> of ritual fringes, i.e., it is one of the eight strings on each corner, and there is no need to have an additional string for winding. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: <b>Shmuel said it, and not Rav.</b> This <b>was also stated</b> by another <i>amora</i>: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: Rabbi Yoshiya of Usha told me</b> that the <b>string</b> used <b>for winding</b> around the other strings <b>is counted in the quota</b> of ritual fringes.
<b>Rava sat</b> in the study hall <b>and said in the name of Shmuel:</b> If one <b>wound the majority of</b> the white and the <b>sky-blue</b> strings instead of leaving the larger portion of the strings hanging loose beyond the windings, the ritual fringes are nevertheless <b>fit. Rav Yosef said to</b> Rava: <b>Rav said it, and not Shmuel.</b> The Gemara supports Rav Yosef’s version from that which <b>was also stated: Rav Huna bar Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one <b>wound the majority of</b> the white and the <b>sky-blue</b> strings, the ritual fringes are nevertheless <b>fit.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Natan, teaches</b> this discussion <b>like this: Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one <b>wound the majority of</b> the white and the <b>sky-blue</b> strings, the ritual fringes are nevertheless <b>fit. And even</b> if <b>he wound only one set of</b> windings, the ritual fringes are <b>fit. But</b> the <b>finest</b> way to affix the white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings is to ensure that <b>one-third</b> of the length of the strings is <b>windings and two-thirds</b> are <b>loose</b> hanging strings.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the <b>measure</b> of <b>a set</b> of windings? It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is <b>such that one winds</b> once <b>and</b> winds <b>a second and third</b> time, i.e., each set must contain at least three windings. It was <b>taught: One who minimizes</b> the sets of windings <b>may not</b> have <b>fewer than seven</b> sets, <b>and one who adds</b> to this number of sets <b>may not</b> have <b>more than thirteen</b> sets of windings.
The Gemara provides explanations for these guidelines: <b>One who minimizes</b> the sets of windings <b>may not</b> wind <b>fewer than seven</b> sets, <b>corresponding to</b> the <b>seven firmaments. And one who adds</b> to this number of sets <b>may not</b> wind <b>more than thirteen</b> sets of windings, <b>corresponding to</b> the <b>seven firmaments and</b> the <b>six air</b> spaces <b>between them.</b>
It was <b>taught: When one begins</b> to form the windings, he <b>begins</b> winding <b>with a white</b> string. This is because the verse indicates that one first inserts “the fringe of <b>the corner”</b> (Numbers 15:38), i.e., the white strings, which are of the same <b>type</b> as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. <b>And when he concludes</b> the windings, <b>he concludes with a white</b> string, in accordance with the principle: <b>One elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and does not downgrade.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav and Rabba bar bar Ḥana were sitting</b> together. <b>A certain man was passing by wearing a cloak that</b> was made <b>entirely of sky-blue</b> wool, <b>on which he had affixed</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings,

Daf 39b

<b>and</b> the ritual fringes were composed <b>entirely</b> of <b>windings,</b> without any portion of the strings hanging loose. <b>Rav said: The cloak is beautiful, but the</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings are <b>not beautiful. Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: The cloak is beautiful, and the</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings are also <b>beautiful.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana holds</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in one verse: “You shall prepare yourself <b>twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), <b>and</b> in another <b>it is written:</b> “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue <b>thread”</b> (Numbers 15:38), it teaches that the ritual fringes may be composed entirely of <b>either twisted cords,</b> i.e., the windings, <b>or</b> loose threads or <b>strings.</b>
<b>And Rav holds</b> that <b>actually, we</b> also <b>require</b> loose <b>strings</b> in addition to the windings, <b>and</b> when <b>that</b> term <b>“twisted cords”</b> appears in the verse, <b>it comes for</b> the purpose of teaching the <b>number</b> of strings that are required. If the verse would have employed the singular term <b>twisted cord,</b> it would still indicate that <b>two</b> strings are required, as twisted means that two strings are wound around each other. Once the verse uses the plural term <b>“twisted cords,”</b> it thereby indicates that <b>four</b> strings are required. By using the terms “twisted cords” and “thread,” the verses indicates: <b>Form twisted cords</b> with the four strings that one attaches to each corner, <b>and let</b> the strings <b>hang loose from them.</b>
§ <b>Shmuel says in the name of Levi: Wool strings exempt</b> a garment made <b>of linen,</b> i.e., one fulfills the mitzva by affixing wool strings to a linen garment.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether strings made <b>of linen exempt</b> a garment made <b>of wool?</b> One can say that <b>it is</b> only <b>wool</b> strings <b>that exempt</b> a garment <b>of linen, as since the sky-blue</b> string, which must be wool, <b>exempts</b> a linen garment, <b>white</b> strings of wool <b>also exempt</b> the garment. <b>But</b> if one affixes <b>linen</b> strings <b>to a wool</b> garment, he does <b>not</b> fulfill his obligation.
<b>Or perhaps, since it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together. You shall prepare yourself twisted cords</b> upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:11–12), which indicates that one may wear wool and linen together in order to fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes, there <b>is no difference</b> whether one affixes <b>wool</b> strings <b>to</b> a garment of <b>linen, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether one affixes <b>linen</b> strings <b>to</b> a garment of <b>wool.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma, <b>as Raḥava says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says: Wool strings exempt</b> a garment made <b>of linen,</b> strings <b>of linen exempt</b> a garment made <b>of wool,</b> and <b>strings of wool and linen exempt</b> a garment <b>in any case,</b> i.e., all garments, <b>and even</b> garments made <b>from silks [<i>beshira’in</i>].</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this last point <b>disagrees</b> with a ruling <b>of Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says: <i>Shira’in</i> are</b> entirely <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of <b>ritual fringes. Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: Garments made from types of silks known as <b><i>shira’in</i>, <i>kalakh</i>, and <i>serikin</i> all require ritual fringes.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> means that there is an obligation <b>by rabbinic law,</b> whereas Rav Naḥman meant they are exempt by Torah law.
The Gemara challenges this suggestion: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these</b> garments, strings of <b>wool and linen exempt them.</b> This indicates that one may affix wool sky-blue strings and white linen strings. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the obligation of ritual fringes for silk garments is <b>by Torah law, that is</b> why <b>diverse kinds are permitted for them. But if you say</b> that the obligation is <b>by rabbinic law, how could diverse kinds be permitted for them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> instead: <b>Either wool or linen</b> strings exempt silk garments, but one may not affix both wool and linen strings to the same silk garment.
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to assume that this is the correct interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> Strings made from <b>these</b> silk fabrics <b>exempt</b> a garment <b>of their type</b> but <b>do not exempt</b> a garment <b>that is not of their type. Granted, if you say</b> that the obligation to attach ritual fringes to these garments is <b>by rabbinic law, that is</b> why <b>they are exempted</b> if one affixes strings <b>of their type. But if you say</b> that the obligation is <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>it</b> should be only <b>wool or linen that exempt</b> these garments.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> because one can maintain that other fabrics also fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes by Torah law, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one verse: “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread” (Numbers 15:38). The term <b>“the corner”</b> indicates that the fringe must be from the same <b>type</b> of fabric as the <b>corner. And</b> yet <b>it is written: “Wool and linen”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), immediately before the verse states: “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:12), indicating that ritual fringes must be from either wool or linen.
<b>How so?</b> Strings made of <b>wool or linen exempt</b> any garment, <b>whether</b> the garment is made <b>of their type</b> of fabric, or <b>whether</b> it is <b>not of their type</b> of fabric. Strings made of all <b>other types</b> of fabric <b>exempt</b> garments made <b>of their type</b> of fabric, e.g., silk strings exempt a silk garment, but <b>they do not exempt</b> a garment made from a fabric <b>that is not their type,</b> i.e., a garment made from a different fabric.
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rav Naḥman,</b> who holds that silk garments do not require ritual fringes by Torah law, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling stated by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
<b>As</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since</b> the word <b>garments is</b> usually <b>stated in the Torah without specification</b> as to the material from which the garments are made, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references to garments that it is referring to garments made from <b>wool or linen,</b> as it states: “And the garment in which there will be the mark of leprosy, whether it be a woolen garment or a linen garment” (Leviticus 13:47), it may be derived that <b>so too, all</b> garments mentioned in the Torah are those made from <b>wool or linen.</b> Other fabrics are not classified as garments by Torah law. Consequently, when the Torah requires strings on the corners of garments (see Numbers 15:38), it is referring specifically to garments made of wool or linen.
<b>Abaye said: This</b> statement by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael diverges from another</b> statement by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that all fabrics are considered garments. <b>As</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> From the fact that the verse states: “A woolen <b>garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:47), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a garment of wool</b> can become ritually impure. <b>From where</b> is it derived that garments made of <b>camels’ hair, rabbits’ wool, goats’ hair, or</b> the types of silk <b><i>kalakh</i>, <i>serikin</i>, and <i>shirayin</i>,</b> are also <b>included</b> in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “Or</b> a linen <b>garment.”</b> The word “or” serves as an amplification to include all types of fabric.

Daf 40a

<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>ritual fringes</b> on a linen <b>cloak, Beit Shammai deem</b> the cloak <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes due to the fact that the sky-blue strings must be made from wool, and there is a Torah prohibition against wearing a mixture of wool and linen. <b>And Beit Hillel deem</b> a linen cloak <b>obligated</b> in the mitzva of ritual fringes. <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Rabbi Tzadok says: But is it not</b> the case that <b>anyone who affixes sky-blue</b> strings to a linen cloak <b>in Jerusalem is</b> considered <b>nothing other than one of those who causes</b> others <b>to be astonished</b> at their behavior, as it appears that he is violating the prohibition against wearing a garment containing wool and linen?
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: If so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Beit Hillel and a linen cloak is required to have ritual fringes, <b>why did</b> the Sages <b>prohibit</b> attaching ritual fringes to linen garments in Jerusalem? It is <b>because</b> people <b>are not well versed</b> in the <i>halakha</i> and might ultimately wear garments of wool and linen even when it is not necessary for the mitzva of ritual fringes.
<b>Rava bar Rav Ḥana said to Rava:</b> If that is the concern, then <b>let ten</b> people <b>take</b> linen cloaks with ritual fringes <b>and go out to the marketplace and</b> thereby <b>publicize the matter,</b> i.e., that it is permitted to affix wool strings to a linen garment due to the mitzva. Rava answered: <b>All the more so</b> people <b>would be astonished at us</b> for acting in such an unconventional manner.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let</b> the Rabbis <b>teach during</b> their public <b>lecture</b> that affixing wool strings to a linen garment is permitted for the mitzva of ritual fringes. The Gemara answers: Wearing strings on a linen garment is prohibited because of a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern that people might use strings that were dyed blue with <b>indigo [<i>kala ilan</i>],</b> instead of with <i>tekhelet</i>, the sky-blue dye produced from the <i>ḥilazon</i> (see 44b), in which case they would not fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes and would violate the prohibition against wearing garments containing wool and linen.
The Gemara suggests: Even if one’s blue strings are not dyed with <i>tekhelet</i> as required for the mitzva, <b>let</b> them <b>be</b> considered <b>merely</b> as <b>white</b> strings. In the absence of <i>tekhelet</i> one fulfills the mitzva with white strings, and therefore it should be permitted to affix white woolen strings to a linen garment. The Gemara explains: <b>Since it is possible</b> to affix white strings that are <b>the same type</b> of material as the garment, i.e., linen, and thereby fulfill the mitzva without overriding the prohibition against wearing a garment made from wool and linen, one may <b>not</b> affix white wool strings to a linen garment.
The Gemara notes: This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says: Any place where you find a positive mitzva and a prohibition</b> that clash with one another, <b>if you are able to fulfill both of them,</b> that is <b>preferable; and if</b> that is <b>not</b> possible, <b>the positive mitzva shall come and override the prohibition.</b> In this case, the clash is between the mitzva of ritual fringes and the prohibition against wearing a garment that contains wool and linen. One can fulfill both of them by using white strings that are linen instead of wool if the garment is made from linen.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let them test</b> the strings to ascertain whether they are dyed with indigo or with <i>tekhelet</i>, as explained by the Gemara (42b). The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> the prohibition against affixing ritual fringes to a linen garment is a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern that perhaps the sky-blue strings were colored with <i>tekhelet</i> dye that had been used for <b>testing</b> the color of the dye in the vat and therefore became unfit (see 42b). In such a case, there would be no fulfillment of the mitzva of sky-blue ritual fringes to override the prohibition against wearing a garment of wool and linen.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>write letters</b> informing dye producers that <i>tekhelet</i> that was used for testing the color of the dye in the vat is unfit for ritual fringes. The Gemara explains: <b>Shall we go and rely on letters,</b> assuming that dye producers will follow the instructions they contain? <b>Rava</b> responded to this and <b>said: Now,</b>

Daf 40b

with regard to the prohibitions against eating <b>leavened bread on Passover and</b> eating on <b>Yom Kippur, which</b> are punishable by <b><i>karet</i>, we rely on letters</b> sent from the rabbinical court in Eretz Yisrael publicizing whether the year was declared a leap year and when they have declared the New Moon; <b>here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of ritual fringes, <b>which</b> is <b>merely a positive mitzva,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> correct that letters can be relied on?
<b>Rather, Rava said: This is a statement</b> that <b>I said, and it was stated in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Zeira in accordance with my</b> opinion: The reason for the rabbinic decree is <b>lest</b> one’s <b>cloak rip within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the corner of the garment, which is where the ritual fringes are placed, <b>and he sew it</b> with linen string and then use the excess string for ritual fringes.
<b>And</b> in such a case the ritual fringes would be unfit because <b>the Torah states:</b> “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords” (Deuteronomy 22:12), which teaches: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared.</b> Consequently, the strings must be attached to the garment for the sake of the mitzva of ritual fringes. When the individual places the linen string there in order to stitch the garment and then decides to use it for the mitzva of ritual fringes and adds sky-blue wool strings, he does not fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes and violates the prohibition against wearing a garment of wool and linen.
Because of this rabbinic decree, <b>Rabbi Zeira untied</b> the ritual fringes and removed them from <b>his</b> linen <b>cloak. Rav Zeira said:</b> The rabbinic <b>decree</b> prohibiting ritual fringes on a linen garment is <b>also due to</b> the concern that one might affix ritual fringes to <b>a nighttime garment.</b> Since the mitzva of ritual fringes does not apply in that case, if one wears the garment he would not fulfill the mitzva and would violate the prohibition against wearing a garment with wool and linen.
<b>And Rava said: This is a statement</b> that <b>I said, and it was stated in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Zeira in accordance with my</b> opinion: If a garment is made <b>from cloth and its corners</b> are made <b>from leather,</b> it is <b>required</b> to have ritual fringes. Conversely, if a cloak is made <b>from leather and its corners</b> are made <b>from cloth,</b> it is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of ritual fringes. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>We require</b> that <b>the main</b> part of the <b>garment</b> be obligated, and a leather garment is not required to have ritual fringes.
The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Aḥai</b> would <b>follow the corner</b> in determining whether the garment is required to have ritual fringes or not, because the Torah states: “On the corners of their garments” (Numbers 15:38).
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> In a case where one <b>affixed</b> ritual fringes <b>to</b> a garment <b>possessing</b> only <b>three</b> corners, which is not required to have ritual fringes, <b>and</b> then <b>completed</b> its <b>fourth</b> corner by sewing on additional material or cutting away some of the material, the ritual fringes he attached to the original three corners are <b>unfit.</b> This is due to the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared.</b> Once the garment is required to have ritual fringes one may attach the ritual fringes; the strings that were attached before the garment was required to have them are not fit.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: It is told of <b>the early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men that <b>once they weaved three</b> fingerbreadths of the length of the garment, <b>they would affix</b> the white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>to</b> the first two corners, even though the garment was not yet long enough to be obligated to have ritual fringes. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: <b>Once they completed [<i>shepatzu</i>]</b> the garment until there were only <b>three</b> fingerbreadths left to weave, <b>they would affix</b> the white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>to</b> the first two corners.
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we say: Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared? Is that so</b> that this principle disqualifies ritual fringes that one affixed to a garment before he was required to do so? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say:</b> If one <b>affixed</b> ritual fringes <b>to</b> a garment that already had ritual fringes <b>affixed</b> to it and then removed the original strings, it is <b>fit,</b> despite the fact that when he attached the second set they were superfluous? This indicates that even if one attaches ritual fringes to a garment when there is no obligation to attach them, the ritual fringes are fit.
<b>Rava said:</b> This does not present a difficulty, because <b>now</b> that he adds a second, unnecessary set of ritual fringes and <b>is</b> liable <b>for</b> violating the <b>prohibition of adding</b> to a mitzva (see Deuteronomy 13:1), <b>is</b> it <b>not</b> considered <b>an action?</b>
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this: From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> Rabbi Zeira is discussing a case where the <b>person intended to add</b> to the original set of ritual fringes? <b>Perhaps</b> Rabbi Zeira is discussing a case where <b>he intended to nullify</b> the original strings, <b>and</b> therefore <b>there is no prohibition of adding</b> to a mitzva, and <b>there is an action.</b>
With regard to the issue of affixing ritual fringes to a garment that already has ritual fringes, the Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> White and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if they are affixed <b>to a cloak</b> that is <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>A cloak</b> that is <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a cloak <b>that is not of the size</b> necessary to require the affixing of ritual fringes, that is difficult: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a cloak that</b> is large enough for <b>a minor</b> to <b>cover his head and most of his</b> body <b>with</b> it,

Daf 41a

<b>and an adult goes out</b> in public <b>on occasion</b> while wearing <b>it,</b> it is <b>required</b> to have <b>ritual fringes.</b> But if it is <b>not</b> large enough for <b>a minor</b> to <b>cover his head and most of his</b> body <b>with</b> it, then <b>even if an adult goes out</b> in public <b>on occasion</b> while wearing <b>it,</b> it is <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes. <b>And so too with regard to diverse kinds,</b> i.e., the prohibition against wearing wool and linen together.
<b>And we discussed it: What</b> is meant by: <b>And so too with regard to diverse kinds? If we say</b> that it means: <b>And so too with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds,</b> that if a minor could not cover the majority of his head and body with it, the prohibition of diverse kinds does not apply, that is difficult: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 9:2): <b>There is no</b> exemption <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> for clothing that an adult would not wear even <b>occasionally</b> in public?
<b>And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> in explanation: Rather, the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>And so too with regard to</b> whether a linen <b>cloak</b> is required <b>to</b> have <b>ritual fringes.</b> If the cloak is large enough for a minor to cover his head and most of his body with it, then it requires ritual fringes, and wearing the garment with the ritual fringes is not a violation of the prohibition of diverse kinds. But if the garment is smaller than that, it is prohibited to place ritual fringes on it, due to the prohibition of diverse kinds. Therefore, one cannot explain Shmuel’s statement to mean that a cloak that is exempt from ritual fringes because it is too small is not subject to the prohibition of diverse kinds.
<b>Rather, what</b> is meant by the statement that a cloak that is <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes is not subject to the prohibition of diverse kinds? It is referring to where one <b>affixed</b> ritual fringes <b>to</b> a garment that already had ritual fringes <b>affixed</b> to it. Even though the second set of ritual fringes is superfluous, nevertheless there is no violation of the prohibition of diverse kinds.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Zeira</b> already <b>say this one time</b> when he stated that if one attached ritual fringes to a garment that already had ritual fringes attached to it and he then removed the first set of strings, the garment is fit? The Gemara answers: <b>One was stated from the other by inference,</b> and Rabbi Zeira did not state both statements.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A very long <b>cloak that is folded</b> in half is <b>required</b> to have <b>ritual fringes</b> at the fold. <b>And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>exempt</b> it from ritual fringes at the fold because that is not where the corners of the garment are located. <b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis <b>agree that if he folded it and sewed it,</b> it is <b>required</b> to have ritual fringes at the fold.
The Gemara challenges: If one <b>sewed it,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it is required to have ritual fringes at the fold. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> because it is referring to a case <b>where he fastened it with pins</b> rather than sewing it in the conventional manner.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba bar Huna arrived at the house of Rava bar Rav Naḥman,</b> and <b>he saw that</b> Rava bar Rav Naḥman <b>was wearing a cloak that was folded and</b> that he had <b>affixed strings to it on</b> the corners of <b>the fold.</b> The cloak <b>unfolded, and the string</b> that had been on the corner of the fold now <b>came and settled near his head,</b> i.e., in the middle of the cloak, as the two sides of the cloak were in the front and back of Rava bar Rav Naḥman.
Rabba bar Huna <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Naḥman: <b>This is not</b> the <b>corner</b> of the garment <b>that the Merciful One writes</b> about <b>in the Torah.</b> Rava bar Rav Naḥman <b>went</b> and <b>threw it off,</b> and <b>he covered himself</b> with <b>a different cloak.</b>
Rabba bar Huna <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Naḥman: <b>Do you hold</b> that ritual fringes are <b>an obligation</b> incumbent upon <b>the man?</b> That is not so. Rather, <b>it is an obligation</b> that pertains to every <b>cloak</b> that one owns. Therefore, <b>go</b> and <b>affix</b> ritual fringes <b>to it</b> properly.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rabba bar Huna: It is told of <b>the early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men that <b>once they weaved three</b> fingerbreadths <b>of</b> the length of the garment, <b>they would affix</b> the white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>to</b> the first two corners, even though the garment was not yet ready to be worn. This seems to prove that there is an obligation to affix ritual fringes to all the cloaks in one’s possession, even if he is not currently wearing them. The Gemara rejects this proof: The <b>pious</b> men were <b>different, as they would act stringently with themselves.</b> Therefore, one cannot adduce the actual requirement from their behavior.
The Gemara notes that this <b>disagrees with</b> what <b>an angel</b> said. <b>As an angel found Rav Ketina when he was wearing</b> a linen <b>cloak,</b> which is exempt from ritual fringes. The angel <b>said to him: Ketina, Ketina,</b> if you wear a linen <b>cloak in the summer and a coat [<i>sarbela</i>],</b> which has only two corners and is therefore also exempt from ritual fringes, <b>in the winter, what will become of</b> the <b>ritual fringes of sky-blue wool?</b> As a result, you will never fulfill the mitzva.
Rav Ketina <b>said to him: Do you punish</b> us even <b>for</b> failing to fulfill <b>a positive mitzva?</b> The angel <b>said to him: At a time when there is</b> divine <b>anger</b> and judgment, <b>we punish</b> even for the failure to fulfill a positive mitzva.
The Gemara attempts to draw conclusions from the statement of the angel: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the mitzva of ritual fringes <b>is an obligation</b> incumbent upon the <b>man, that is</b> why Rav Ketina would be <b>deemed liable</b> at a time of divine anger, <b>as he did not affix</b> ritual fringes to his cloak and thereby neglected the obligation incumbent upon him. <b>But if you say</b> that it <b>is an obligation</b> to attach them to every <b>cloak</b> that one owns, since Rav Ketina’s cloaks were not required to have ritual fringes, <b>he was not obligated</b> to attach ritual fringes to them. Why should he be punished in a time of divine anger?
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, what</b> should one assume, that <b>it is an obligation</b> incumbent upon the <b>man?</b> Even so, <b>granted that the Merciful One rendered him obligated when he is wearing a cloak that</b> has four corners and is therefore <b>subject to the obligation</b> of ritual fringes, but <b>when he is wearing a cloak that is not subject to the obligation</b> of ritual fringes, <b>did the Merciful One deem him obligated?</b>
<b>Rather, this</b> is what the angel <b>is saying to</b> Rav Ketina: Are you seeking <b>ploys [<i>tatzdeki</i>] to exempt yourself from</b> performing the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes?</b>
<b>Rav Tovi bar Kisna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Garments</b> that are not being worn but are stored in <b>a box are required</b> to have <b>ritual fringes,</b> because the mitzva pertains to the garment, not the man. <b>But Shmuel concedes in</b> the case of <b>an old man, where</b> the garment <b>was made</b> as a shroud <b>in his honor, that</b> the shroud is <b>exempt. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that one must place ritual fringes on the corners of garments <b>“with which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12). <b>This</b> shroud <b>is not made for</b> the purpose of <b>covering</b> oneself.
The Gemara comments: <b>At that time,</b> i.e., a person’s burial, <b>we certainly affix</b> ritual fringes <b>to</b> the shroud, <b>because</b> otherwise it would be a violation of: <b>“Whoever mocks the poor blasphemes his Maker”</b> (Proverbs 17:5). If we did not place them, it would be mocking the deceased, as if to taunt him that now he is no longer obligated in mitzvot.
§ <b>Raḥava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In the case of <b>a cloak that became torn</b> at one of its corners, if it was torn <b>beyond three</b> fingerbreadths from the edge of the garment, one <b>may sew</b> it. But if it was torn <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, then one <b>may not sew</b> it. There is a concern that he might use the thread with which he sewed the garment for the ritual fringes, in which case the strings would be unfit due to the principle: Prepare it, and not from what has already been prepared.
The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a cloak that became torn</b> at one of its corners, if it was torn <b>beyond three</b> fingerbreadths from the edge of the garment, one <b>may sew</b> it. But if it was torn <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> One <b>may not sew</b> it. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One <b>may sew</b> it.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>agree that one may not bring</b> a piece of cloth, <b>even</b> if it is <b>a square cubit</b> in size, <b>from elsewhere, containing</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings, <b>and attach</b> it <b>to</b> a cloak. This is because one must attach the ritual fringes directly to the corner of the garment, rather than attaching them to a piece of cloth and then attaching that cloth to the garment. <b>And</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis also <b>agree that one may bring</b> white or <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>from elsewhere and attach</b> them <b>to</b> the garment, i.e., one may remove strings from one garment in order to attach them to another garment.

Daf 41b

This is permitted <b>provided that</b> the strings <b>are not broken.</b> The Gemara asks: Should one <b>conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that it is always permitted to <b>untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order to affix them <b>to</b> another <b>garment?</b> The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>Perhaps</b> the ruling of this <i>baraita</i> applies only <b>if</b> the first garment was <b>worn out</b> and no longer wearable.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a cloak that</b> is made <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool,</b> strings of <b>every type of color exempt it,</b> i.e., the ritual fringes that are not <i>tekhelet</i> may be any color <b>except for indigo,</b> a color that is indistinguishable from <i>tekhelet</i>. This indicates that if one attached strings dyed with indigo alongside the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>, the ritual fringes are unfit.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A cloak</b> is <b>exempted only by</b> strings of <b>its own type.</b> In the case of <b>a cloak that</b> is made <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool,</b> one <b>brings sky-blue [<i>tekhelet</i>]</b> strings <b>and something else,</b> i.e., strings of a different color, <b>and attaches</b> them <b>to</b> the cloak. <b>And he may not bring</b> strings dyed with <b>indigo</b> along with the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>. <b>But if he brought</b> strings dyed with indigo together with the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>, the ritual fringes are <b>fit.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> because <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that holds that the ritual fringes are fit after the fact, it is referring <b>to a cloak that has</b> only <b>four strings,</b> two of <i>tekhelet</i> and two of indigo. <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that holds that the ritual fringes are unfit after the fact, it is referring <b>to a cloak that has eight strings,</b> four of <i>tekhelet</i> and four of indigo. In this case, the Sages were concerned that one would take the four indigo strings from this garment and use them in another garment, thinking that they were <i>tekhelet</i>.
The Gemara asks: Should <b>you conclude from</b> the fact that the Sages were concerned lest one take the indigo strings from this garment for use in another garment that in general <b>one may untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order <b>to</b> affix them to another <b>garment?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> their concern was <b>that if</b> one <b>did</b> transfer the strings, he might mistake indigo for <i>tekhelet</i>, but it is not permitted to transfer the strings <i>ab initio</i>.
<b>It was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav says: One may not untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order <b>to</b> affix them to another <b>garment. And Shmuel says: One may untie</b> them <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> and affix them <b>to</b> another <b>garment.</b>
The Gemara cites additional disputes between Rav and Shmuel: <b>Rav says: One may not light from</b> one Hanukkah <b>lamp to</b> another Hanukkah <b>lamp. And Shmuel says: One may light from</b> one Hanukkah <b>lamp to</b> another Hanukkah <b>lamp.</b>
Rabbi Shimon rules that it is permitted to drag items on Shabbat despite the possibility that one might thereby create a furrow in the ground. Creating a furrow is a labor prohibited on Shabbat, but since he does not intend to create the furrow, and it is not certain that a furrow will be created, dragging the item is permitted. <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to dragging</b> items on Shabbat. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to dragging</b> items on Shabbat.
<b>Abaye said:</b> In <b>all</b> halakhic <b>matters of the Master,</b> Rabba, <b>he conducted himself in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, except these three where he conducted himself in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b> He ruled that <b>one may untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order to affix them <b>to</b> another <b>garment, and one may light from</b> one Hanukkah <b>lamp to</b> another Hanukkah <b>lamp, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to dragging</b> items on Shabbat.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A person may drag a bed, chair, or bench</b> on the ground on Shabbat, <b>provided that he does not intend to make a furrow</b> in the ground. Even if a furrow is formed inadvertently, one does not need to be concerned.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> would <b>give</b> his garments containing ritual fringes <b>to a laundryman</b> and was not concerned that the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i> might become detached and that the laundryman would replace them with strings dyed with indigo. <b>Rav Ḥanina</b> would <b>form a bundle</b> with his ritual fringes so that they would not become detached while they were being laundered. <b>Ravina</b> would tuck <b>them</b> into a pocket he formed on the garment and <b>sew</b> the cover of the pocket in order to protect the ritual fringes.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How many strings does one place</b> on a garment? <b>Beit Shammai say: Four</b> strings are inserted into the hole in the garment, so that there are eight strings hanging down altogether, <b>and Beit Hillel say: Three</b> strings are inserted into the garment.
<b>And how much should be hanging [<i>meshulleshet</i>]</b> beyond the knots and windings? <b>Beit Shammai say: Four</b> fingerbreadths, <b>and Beit Hillel say: Three</b> fingerbreadths. <b>And</b> the <b>three</b> fingerbreadths <b>that Beit Hillel say</b> should be hanging are each <b>one-fourth of a handbreadth [<i>tefaḥ</i>] of any</b> average <b>person.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <b>handbreadth of the Torah</b> is <b>four</b> fingerbreadths if measured <b>by</b> the <b>thumb; six</b> fingerbreadths if measured <b>by</b> the <b>smallest</b> finger; and <b>five</b> if measured <b>by</b> the <b>third,</b> i.e., the middle, finger.
<b>Rav Huna says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is: One must attach <b>four</b> strings <b>within four</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, <b>and</b> they should <b>hang</b> down <b>four</b> fingerbreadths beyond the knots and windings. <b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> One must attach <b>three</b> strings <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, and they should <b>hang</b> down <b>three</b> fingerbreadths beyond the knots and windings.
<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one must attach <b>four</b> strings <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, and they should <b>hang</b> down <b>four</b> fingerbreadths beyond the knots and windings.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> ritual fringes <b>have</b> a required <b>measure? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That they prepare for themselves <b>strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). <b>Strings</b> are <b>nothing other than</b> what <b>emerges</b> from the corner of the garment, <b>and</b> the term <b>strings</b> indicates <b>only</b> that there must be strings of <b>any length. And</b> it <b>already</b> occurred that <b>the elders of Beit Shammai and the elders of Beit Hillel ascended to the attic of Yoḥanan ben Beteira, and</b> they discussed the matter and <b>said: Ritual fringes have no measure. Similarly, a <i>lulav</i> has no measure.</b>
<b>What,</b> does this <b>not</b> mean that ritual fringes <b>have no</b> required <b>measure at all?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b>

Daf 42a

the <i>baraita</i> means that ritual fringes <b>do not have a maximum measure,</b> i.e., the strings can be as long as one wants; <b>however, they do have a minimum measure,</b> and if the strings are shorter than this measure they are not fit. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> in a case <b>similar to it,</b> where it is taught that <b>a <i>lulav</i> has no measure,</b> is it possible <b>that it also has no measure whatsoever?</b>
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 29b): <b>A <i>lulav</i> that has three handbreadths</b> in length, <b>sufficient</b> to enable one <b>to wave with it,</b> is <b>fit</b> for use in fulfilling the mitzva? This indicates that if the <i>lulav</i> is less than the measure, it is not fit. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that a <i>lulav</i> <b>has no maximum measure, but it does have a minimum measure. So too,</b> ritual fringes <b>have no maximum measure, but they have a minimum measure.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That they prepare for themselves <b>strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). The term <b>strings [<i>tzitzit</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other than strings that hang down [<i>anaf</i>], and so it states</b> in the verse: <b>“I was taken by a lock [<i>betzitzit</i>] of my head”</b> (Ezekiel 8:3). <b>And Abaye says: And</b> one is <b>required to separate</b> the ritual fringes <b>like a gentile’s lock</b> of hair, part of which is braided and the rest of which is allowed to hang loose.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>affixed</b> the ritual fringes <b>to</b> the tip of <b>the corner or to the border [<i>gadil</i>],</b> they are <b>fit. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov disqualifies</b> them <b>in both</b> cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ritual fringes must</b> be inserted into a hole above the corner and <b>hang down onto the corner</b> of the garment, <b>as it is stated: “On the corners of their garments”</b> (Numbers 15:38)? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> one <b>must distance</b> the hole through which the ritual fringes are inserted into the garment the length of <b>a full thumb joint</b> from the edge of the garment.
The Gemara notes: <b>And it was necessary</b> to state the ruling <b>of Rav Pappa</b> (41b) that the ritual fringes must be inserted into a hole within three fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, <b>and it was</b> also <b>necessary</b> to state the ruling <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov.</b> This is <b>because if</b> the location of the hole was taught only <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pappa, I would say</b> that his ruling that the hole must be <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment was to teach <b>that one may not distance</b> the hole from the edge of the garment by <b>more</b> than this amount, <b>but the closer</b> the hole is to the edge of the garment, <b>the better.</b> Consequently, <b>it was necessary</b> to include the statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>
<b>And if</b> the location of the hole was taught only <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov, I would say</b> that his ruling that it must be <b>a full thumb joint</b> away from the edge of the garment was to teach <b>that one may not</b> situate the hole <b>closer</b> than that to the edge of the garment, <b>but the further</b> he places it, <b>the better.</b> Therefore, both statements were <b>necessary.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina and Rav Samma were sitting before Rav Ashi. Rav Samma saw that the corner of Ravina’s cloak was torn and</b> therefore the hole through which the ritual fringes were inserted was <b>less than</b> the <b>full</b> length of <b>a thumb joint</b> from the edge of the garment. Rav Samma <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold in accordance with that</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov</b> that the hole must be at least the length of a thumb joint from the edge of the garment? Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Samma: It <b>was stated</b> that this distance is required <b>at the time</b> when the ritual fringes are <b>made.</b> If the corner tears later, causing the hole to be closer to the edge of the garment, the ritual fringes remain fit.
Rav Samma <b>became embarrassed</b> because he had asked his question based on a mistaken assumption. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Samma: <b>Do not be upset</b> that Ravina is a greater scholar than you are; <b>one of them,</b> i.e., the Sages of Eretz Yisrael, <b>is like two of us,</b> i.e., the Sages of Babylonia.
§ With regard to attaching ritual fringes to a garment, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov would affix four</b> strings to the garment, <b>and he would</b> first <b>fold them</b> in half <b>and</b> then <b>insert them</b> at the point of the folds <b>into</b> the hole of <b>the garment,</b> so that on one side there were eight strings and on the other side there were four loops. He would then take the eight strings <b>and loop them</b> through the four loops and pull them tight, thereby attaching them to the garment. The Gemara explains that <b>he held</b> that <b>we require eight</b> strings when they are initially placed <b>in the garment, in order that there be twisted cord</b> and <b>“twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), i.e., four doubled strings, <b>at the place,</b> i.e., the time, when he creates the <b>loose hanging string.</b>
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti would affix eight</b> strings <b>that are sixteen</b> strings after they are placed in the hole of the garment and half of each string hangs down on each side, <b>and he would not loop them</b> as Rav Aha bar Ya’akov did. <b>Mar, son of Ravina, would prepare</b> ritual fringes <b>like ours,</b> placing four strings through the hole and allowing both ends of each string to hang down, thereby forming eight.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman found Rav Adda bar Ahava affixing strings</b> to a garment <b>and reciting the blessing</b> that concludes: <b>To prepare ritual fringes [<i>tzitzit</i>].</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava: <b>What</b> is this <b><i>tzitzi</i></b> sound that <b>I hear? This is what Rav says: Ritual fringes do not require a blessing</b> when one attaches them to the garment.
With regard to this statement of Rav, the Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Huna died, Rav Ḥisda went into</b> the study hall <b>to raise a contradiction</b> from one statement <b>of Rav to</b> another statement <b>of Rav,</b> as follows: <b>Did Rav</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>ritual fringes do not require a blessing</b> when one attaches them to the garment? <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>ritual fringes</b> attached <b>by a gentile</b> are <b>unfit?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Speak unto the children of Israel</b> and command them <b>that they prepare for themselves strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). The Sages derive from here that <b>the children of Israel shall prepare</b> ritual fringes, <b>but the gentiles shall not prepare</b> ritual fringes.
The Gemara asks: <b>But what</b> is the <b>contradiction</b> between these two statements of Rav? <b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Ḥisda held</b> that in the case of <b>any mitzva</b> for <b>which</b> the necessary item is <b>fit</b> when produced <b>by a gentile,</b> if it is produced <b>by a Jew, he does not need to recite a blessing.</b> Conversely, <b>any mitzva</b> for <b>which</b> the necessary item is <b>unfit</b> when produced <b>by a gentile,</b> if it is produced <b>by a Jew, he needs to recite a blessing</b> when he produces the item.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> this an established <b>principle? But</b> what about <b>circumcision, which is valid</b> if performed <b>by a gentile, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a city in which there is no Jewish physician, and in which there is an Aramean,</b> i.e., a gentile, <b>physician and a Samaritan physician,</b> it is preferable that the <b>Aramean circumcise</b> the Jewish boys of the city <b>and</b> the <b>Samaritan not circumcise</b> them; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is preferable that the <b>Samaritan</b> circumcise the boys <b>and</b> the <b>Aramean not</b> circumcise them. Nevertheless, all agree that a circumcision performed by a gentile is valid.
<b>And</b> despite the fact that circumcision performed by a gentile is valid, when it is performed <b>by a Jew, he must recite a blessing, as the Master said: The one who circumcises</b> a child <b>says: Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, <b>Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and has commanded us concerning circumcision.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Is there reason</b> to resolve the contradiction <b>according to</b> anyone <b>but Rav? Rav</b> himself <b>invalidates</b> circumcision performed by a gentile, <b>as it was stated: From where</b> is it derived <b>that circumcision</b> performed <b>by a gentile</b> is <b>not valid? Daru bar Pappa says in the name of Rav:</b> This is derived from the verse: “And God said unto Abraham: <b>And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you, and your seed after you throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). The verse indicates that only the descendants of Abraham may perform circumcision.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the doubled verb in the verse: <b>“Must be circumcised [<i>himmol yimmol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 17:13), which he interprets to mean: Only <b>one who is circumcised [<i>hammal</i>] may circumcise [<i>yamul</i>]</b> others.
The Gemara notes that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>sukka</i> supports</b> the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, who holds that when an item used for a mitzva can be created by a gentile, a Jew who creates it does not recite a blessing. And the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>phylacteries is a conclusive refutation of his</b> opinion.
The Gemara explains: <b>A <i>sukka</i> is fit</b> even if it was built <b>by a gentile, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a booth</b> built by <b>gentiles, a booth</b> built by <b>women, a booth for domesticated animals, a booth</b> built by <b>Samaritans, a booth of any sort,</b> each is <b>fit</b> for use as a <i>sukka</i>, <b>provided that it is roofed in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.</b>
<b>And</b> if a <i>sukka</i> was built <b>by a Jew, he is not required to recite a blessing</b> upon its construction, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who constructs a <i>sukka</i> for himself recites: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who has given us life, sustained us, and brought us to this time.</b> When <b>he comes to sit in</b> the <i>sukka</i>, <b>he recites: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us to reside in the <i>sukka</i>.</b> The Gemara notes that the <i>baraita</i> indicates that he recites a blessing at the time of construction, <b>whereas he does not recite a blessing</b> including the words: <b>To construct a <i>sukka</i>,</b> which confirms the opinion of Rav Ḥisda.
By contrast, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>phylacteries</b> is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> Rav Ḥisda’s opinion. <b>Phylacteries are unfit</b> when written <b>by a gentile, as it is taught</b> by <b>Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rava,</b>

Daf 42b

<b>of Pashronya: A Torah scroll, phylacteries, or <i>mezuzot</i> that were written by a heretic, a Samaritan, a gentile,</b> a Canaanite <b>slave, a woman, a minor, or a Jewish apostate [<i>meshummad</i>] are unfit, as it is stated: “And you shall bind them</b> for a sign on your arm…<b>and you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:8–9). From this juxtaposition, one can derive the following: <b>Anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>binding</b> the phylacteries, i.e., one who is both obligated and performs the mitzva, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the class of people who may <b>write</b> Torah scrolls, phylacteries, and <i>mezuzot</i>; and <b>anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>binding is not</b> included <b>in</b> the class of people who may <b>write</b> sacred texts.
<b>And</b> despite the fact that phylacteries written by a gentile are unfit, <b>a Jew</b> who writes them <b>does not have to recite a blessing. As Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, sent</b> a ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: On phylacteries of the arm</b> one <b>says</b> the blessing: <b>Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, W<b>ho has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us to don phylacteries. On phylacteries of the head</b> one <b>says</b> the blessing: <b>Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, <b>Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us concerning the mitzva of phylacteries.</b> The implication of this is that one recites blessings only when he dons the phylacteries, <b>whereas</b> when he writes the phylacteries he <b>does not recite a blessing: To prepare phylacteries.</b>
<b>Rather, isn’t this the reason</b> for the distinction between different mitzvot: For <b>any mitzva whose performance is the completion of</b> the <b>mitzva, such as circumcision, even though it is valid</b> when performed <b>by a gentile,</b> when it is performed <b>by a Jew he must recite a blessing. But</b> for <b>any mitzva where the performance of</b> a particular act <b>is not the completion of</b> the <b>mitzva, such as</b> writing <b>phylacteries,</b> where one does not complete the mitzva until he dons them, <b>even though it is not valid</b> when performed <b>by a gentile,</b> when it is performed <b>by a Jew he does not need to recite a blessing.</b>
<b>And with regard to</b> reciting a blessing when one attaches <b>ritual fringes</b> to a garment, the Sages <b>disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is an obligation</b> pertaining to the <b>cloak.</b> Therefore, when one attaches the ritual fringes he is completing the mitzva, and he should recite a blessing: To prepare ritual fringes. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Naḥman, citing Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is an obligation</b> incumbent upon <b>the man.</b> Consequently, the mitzva is not complete until he wears the garment, and he should not recite a blessing when he attaches the ritual fringes to the garment.
<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> about gentiles attaching ritual fringes to a garment <b>in this manner,</b> citing Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav that the ritual fringes are invalid. Consequently, Rav Ḥisda raises a contradiction between this ruling and another ruling of Rav.
<b>We teach it in this way,</b> according to which there is no contradiction: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that if <b>ritual fringes</b> are attached to a garment <b>by a gentile</b> they are <b>valid?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “Speak unto the children of Israel</b> and command them <b>that they prepare for themselves [<i>lahem</i>] strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). From the fact that the verse does not merely state: That they prepare [<i>ve’asu</i>], but rather states “<i>ve’asu lahem</i>,” which can be translated as: That they prepare for them, the indication is that even <b>others,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>shall prepare</b> ritual fringes <b>for them.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one prepared</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> threads that protrude from the fabric like <b>thorns [<i>kotzim</i>], or</b> if he prepared them <b>from threads [<i>nimin</i>]</b> that were used to sew the garment and remain attached to it, <b>or from the strings [<i>geradin</i>]</b> that hang from the bottom of a garment, the ritual fringes are <b>unfit,</b> as one must attach ritual fringes to a garment for the sake of the mitzva. But if he prepared ritual fringes <b>from swatches</b> of wool that were not spun for the sake of the mitzva, they are <b>fit.</b>
Rav Yehuda continues: <b>When I stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rav <b>before Shmuel,</b> he <b>said</b> to me: <b>Even</b> ritual fringes tied <b>from swatches</b> of wool that were not spun for the sake of the mitzva are <b>unfit,</b> as <b>we require the spinning</b> of the string to be <b>for the sake of</b> the mitzva.
The Gemara notes that this dispute <b>is like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If one took phylacteries and <b>coated them</b> with <b>gold or patched them</b> with the <b>skin of a non-kosher animal,</b> then <b>they are unfit.</b> But if one patched them with the <b>skin of a kosher animal,</b> then <b>they are fit, and</b> this is so <b>even though he did not prepare</b> the skin <b>for their sake,</b> i.e., for the sake of its use in a mitzva. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even</b> if he patched them with the <b>skin of a kosher animal they are unfit, until he prepares them for their sake.</b>
§ <b>Abaye said to Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yehuda: How do you dye this sky-blue wool</b> to be used for ritual fringes? Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>We bring blood of a <i>ḥilazon</i> and</b> various <b>herbs and put them in a pot</b> and boil them. <b>And</b> then <b>we take a bit</b> of the resulting dye <b>in an egg</b> shell <b>and test it by</b> using it to dye <b>a wad</b> of wool to see if it has attained the desired hue. <b>And</b> then <b>we throw</b> away <b>that egg</b> shell and its contents <b>and burn the wad</b> of wool.
The Gemara comments: <b>Learn from</b> this statement <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Learn from it</b> that wool that was dyed for the purpose of <b>testing</b> the dye and not for use as ritual fringes is <b>unfit</b> for ritual fringes. Consequently, one burns the wad of wool so that no one will use it for ritual fringes. <b>And learn from it that we require dyeing for the sake of</b> the mitzva. <b>And learn from it</b> that using dye for <b>testing renders</b> all the dye in that vessel <b>unfit.</b> Therefore, some of the dye is removed from the pot before it is tested.
The Gemara challenges: The <i>halakha</i> that wool dyed for the purpose of <b>testing</b> the dye is <b>unfit is</b> the same as the requirement of <b>dyeing for the sake of</b> the mitzva. It is only because the sky-blue strings must be dyed for the sake of the mitzva that wool dyed as a test is unfit for use as ritual fringes, so why are these stated as two <i>halakhot</i>? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The statement about learning three <i>halakhot</i> <b>employs</b> the style known as: <b>What is the reason,</b> and it means: <b>What is the reason</b> that wool that was dyed for the purpose of <b>testing</b> is <b>unfit?</b> It is <b>because we require dyeing for the sake of</b> the mitzva.
The Gemara notes that the <i>halakha</i> that using the dye for testing renders all the dye in the pot unfit is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <i>Tekhelet</i> dye that was used for <b>testing</b> is <b>unfit, as it is stated</b> concerning the priestly vestments: “And you shall make the robe of the ephod <b>entirely of blue [<i>kelil tekhelet</i>]”</b> (Exodus 28:31), which indicates that the dye must be used exclusively for this purpose, i.e., this must be the first item it is being used to dye. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says: Even a second appearance</b> caused by the dye <b>is fit,</b> meaning even if it is the second time that the dye is being used, it is still fit. <b>As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And scarlet wool [<i>ushni tola’at</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:4), which is interpreted to mean that this may be the second [<i>sheni</i>] usage of the dye.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is no</b> reliable method of <b>testing sky-blue wool, and</b> therefore <b>it may be purchased only from an expert. There is</b> a method of <b>testing phylacteries</b> to ensure they were written properly, <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>they may be purchased only from an expert. There is</b> a method of <b>testing Torah scrolls and <i>mezuzot</i>, and they may be purchased from anyone.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there no</b> method for <b>testing sky-blue wool? But didn’t Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, test it</b> to ensure it was dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>? The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the test, which was carried out <b>with</b> items whose names contain the letters <b><i>gimmel</i>, <i>shin</i>,</b> or <b><i>mem</i>.</b> He would <b>bring alum clay [<i>megavya gila</i>], and water of fenugreek [<i>shavlilta</i>], and urine [<i>meimei raglayim</i>]</b>

Daf 43a

that was <b>forty days old.</b> He would <b>soak</b> the sky-blue wool <b>in</b> this solution <b>from night until morning.</b> If <b>its color would fade [<i>ipparad ḥazutei</i>],</b> the sky-blue wool was determined to be <b>unfit,</b> as it was not dyed with <i>tekhelet</i> derived from a <i>ḥilazon</i>. If <b>its color would not fade,</b> the sky-blue wool was determined to be <b>fit.</b>
<b>And Rav Adda said before Rava in the name of Rav Avira: One brings hard [<i>arkesa</i>] leavened barley</b> dough <b>and bakes</b> the sky-blue wool <b>in it.</b> If the color of the sky-blue wool <b>changes for the better,</b> meaning that the process intensifies the color of the sky-blue wool, then it is <b>fit.</b> If the color of the sky-blue wool changes for the <b>worse,</b> i.e., it fades, then it is <b>unfit. And your mnemonic</b> is: <b>Change</b> reveals <b>falsehood</b> and <b>change</b> reveals <b>truth.</b> All of this indicates that it is possible to test whether sky-blue wool has been dyed with real <i>tekhelet</i>, contrary to the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> does it mean <b>when it says: There is no</b> reliable method of <b>testing</b> sky-blue wool? It means that there is no way to test whether it was dyed for the sake of the mitzva or <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>testing</b> the dye.
The Gemara relates that <b>Mar,</b> a Sage <b>from Mashkhei, brought sky-blue</b> wool <b>in the years</b> when <b>Rav Aḥai</b> was a preeminent Sage. <b>They tested it in</b> the manner described by <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, and its color faded.</b> They then tested it <b>in</b> the manner described by <b>Rav Adda and</b> the color <b>changed for the better.</b>
The Sages <b>thought</b> that the sky-blue wool should be <b>deemed unfit</b> because it did not pass the first test. <b>Rav Aḥai said to them: But</b> how could it be that <b>this</b> wool <b>is not <i>tekhelet</i>,</b> as it failed one of the tests, <b>and is</b> also <b>not indigo,</b> as it passed the other? This is impossible, because it must be one or the other. <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that these <b><i>halakhot</i> were stated together.</b>
He explains: In a case <b>where we tested</b> the wool <b>in</b> the manner described <b>by Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda,</b> and <b>its color did not fade,</b> it is <b>fit</b> and requires no further testing. If <b>its color faded,</b> then <b>we test it in</b> the manner described <b>by Rav Adda, with hard leavened</b> barley dough. If the color <b>changed for the better</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if the color changed <b>for the worse</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>They sent</b> a message <b>from there,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael: These <b><i>halakhot</i> were</b> in fact <b>stated together,</b> as explained by Rav Aḥai.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Mani was exacting and purchased</b> sky-blue wool <b>in accordance with the stringencies of the <i>baraita</i></b> cited earlier, i.e., that wool dyed as a test is unfit for ritual fringes, and that therefore one should purchase sky-blue wool for ritual fringes only from an expert. <b>A certain elder said to him: This is what your early predecessors did, and their businesses were successful.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who purchases a cloak with ritual fringes from the marketplace,</b> if he purchased it <b>from a Jew it retains its presumptive status</b> that it is fit for the mitzva. If he purchased it <b>from a gentile,</b> then if he purchased it <b>from a merchant</b> it is presumed to be <b>fit,</b> as the merchant would want to maintain his credibility and would therefore purchase the sky-blue strings only from a reliable source. But if he purchased it <b>from</b> a gentile who is <b>an ordinary</b> person rather than a professional merchant, the sky-blue strings are <b>unfit,</b> as the seller presumably dyed them himself.
<b>And even though</b> the Sages <b>said: A person is not permitted to sell a cloak with ritual fringes to a gentile until he unties</b> and removes <b>its ritual fringes,</b> it is permitted to purchase such a cloak from a gentile merchant, as it is assumed that the merchant acquired the cloak from a Jew who ignored this <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the prohibition against selling a cloak with ritual fringes to a gentile? The Gemara answers: <b>Here they interpreted</b> that it is prohibited <b>because</b> of the concern that the gentile will visit <b>a prostitute</b> and observers will think that he is a Jew. Alternatively, <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is prohibited <b>lest</b> a Jew mistake the gentile for a Jew and <b>accompany him on a journey</b> thinking that he is also Jewish, due to his ritual fringes, <b>and</b> the gentile might then <b>kill him.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda would affix</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>to the garment [<i>pirzuma</i>] of his wife. And every morning</b> he would <b>recite the blessing: To wrap ourselves in</b> garments with <b>ritual fringes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> he would <b>affix</b> ritual fringes to his wife’s garments, it is apparent that <b>he holds</b> that the obligation of ritual fringes is <b>a positive mitzva that is not time-bound,</b> and therefore women are also obligated in it. But if that is his opinion, <b>why</b> did <b>he recite the blessing</b> on ritual fringes <b>each and every morning?</b> In order for the mitzva to not be time-bound, it must apply at night, in which case a new blessing should not be recited in the morning.
The Gemara answers: Rav Yehuda was acting <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>phylacteries, every time one dons them he recites the blessing over them,</b> even several times in one day; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> he should have <b>also</b> recited a blessing <b>every time</b> that he took the cloak off and put it back on, and not merely once a day in the morning. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda was a modest man and he did not remove his cloak the entire day.</b> The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way is it <b>different from the morning,</b> i.e., why did he recite a blessing in the morning? The Gemara answers: He recited the blessing in the morning <b>when he changed from a nighttime garment to a daytime garment.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, Israelites, converts, women, and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves. Rabbi Shimon deems women exempt, because</b> the mitzva of ritual fringes <b>is a positive, time-bound mitzva, and women are exempt</b> from <b>every positive, time-bound mitzva.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? As, if priests, Levites, and Israelites were exempt</b> from the mitzva, <b>who</b> then <b>is to be obligated?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill the mitzva, as <b>it may enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together. You shall prepare yourself twisted cords</b> upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:11–12), only <b>one who is not permitted to wear diverse kinds is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes.</b> With regard to <b>these priests, since diverse kinds are permitted for them</b> when they perform the Temple service, as the belt of the priestly vestments contains diverse kinds, <b>they should not be obligated</b> in the mitzva of ritual fringes.
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>although</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds is <b>permitted</b> for them <b>at the time</b> when they perform the Temple <b>service, when</b> it is <b>not the time of</b> the Temple <b>service</b> it is <b>not permitted,</b> and therefore priests are obligated in the mitzva of ritual fringes.
The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Shimon deems women exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to ritual fringes it is stated: “And it shall be unto you for a fringe, <b>that you may look upon it</b> and remember all the commandments of the Lord” (Numbers 15:39). The term “that you may look” <b>excludes a nighttime garment,</b> as it is dark at night and it is therefore difficult to see.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One may ask: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse serves to <b>exclude a nighttime garment? Or is it</b> to <b>exclude only the garment of a blind person,</b> who is also unable to see his ritual fringes? The <i>tanna</i> explains: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Of your covering, <b>with which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), the <b>garment of a blind person is mentioned</b> as being included, as the verse already stated: “Of your covering,” and did not need to state: “With which you cover yourself.” If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the exclusion: <b>“That you may look upon it”?</b> It must <b>exclude a nighttime garment.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see</b> that led you <b>to include the garment of a blind person</b> from the phrase: “With which you cover yourself,” <b>and to exclude a nighttime garment</b> from the phrase: “That you may look upon it,” rather than including a nighttime garment in the obligation and excluding the garment of a blind person? The Gemara answers: <b>I include the garment of a blind person, which is visible to others,</b> even though the blind person himself cannot see it, <b>and I exclude a nighttime garment, which is not visible</b> even <b>to others.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Shimon,

Daf 43b

<b>what do they do with,</b> i.e., how do they interpret, <b>this</b> verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12)? The Gemara answers that the Rabbis <b>require</b> it <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“on the four corners of your garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12) indicates that one is required to attach ritual fringes to a garment that has <b>four</b> corners, <b>but not</b> to one that has <b>three</b> corners.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that a garment with <b>four</b> corners is obligated <b>but not</b> a garment with <b>three</b> corners? <b>Or is it</b> teaching <b>only</b> that a garment with <b>four</b> corners is obligated <b>but not</b> a garment that has <b>five</b> corners? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “With which you cover yourself,”</b> a garment <b>with five</b> corners <b>is thereby mentioned</b> in the verse as being obligated. Then <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“On the four</b> corners of your garment”? It teaches that this obligation is limited to a garment that has <b>four</b> corners, <b>but not</b> to one that has <b>three</b> corners.
The Gemara asks: <b>But what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> a garment <b>with five</b> corners <b>and to exclude</b> a garment <b>with three</b> corners, rather than including a garment with three corners and excluding a garment with five corners? The Gemara answers: <b>I include</b> a garment <b>with five</b> corners, <b>as five includes four, and I exclude</b> a garment <b>with three</b> corners, <b>as three does not include four.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that a five-cornered garment is required to have ritual fringes? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the seemingly extraneous word: “With <b>which [<i>asher</i>]</b> you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this word? The Gemara answers: <b>They do not learn</b> any new <i>halakhot</i> from the word <b>“which [<i>asher</i>].”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> phrase: <b>“That you may look upon it”</b> (Numbers 15:39), from which Rabbi Shimon derives that a nighttime garment is exempt? The Gemara answers: <b>They require it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember”</b> (Numbers 15:39), teaches that one should <b>see this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>and remember another mitzva that is contingent on it. And which</b> mitzva <b>is that? It is</b> the mitzva of <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. As we learned</b> in a mishna (Berakhot 9b): <b>From when may one recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning? From when</b> one can <b>distinguish between</b> the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>and</b> the <b>white</b> strings of his ritual fringes.
<b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“that you may look upon it and remember”</b> teaches that one should <b>see this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>and remember another mitzva that is adjacent to it</b> in the Torah. <b>And which</b> mitzva <b>is that? It is the mitzva of diverse kinds</b> of wool and linen, <b>as it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together. You shall prepare yourself twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11–12).
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:39). This indicates that <b>once a person is obligated in this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes, <b>he is obligated in all of the mitzvot.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that ritual fringes are <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva,</b> and women are exempt from it. Only men are obligated in all mitzvot, including positive, time-bound mitzvot, just as they are obligated in the mitzva of ritual fringes.
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord”;</b> this teaches that <b>this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>is equivalent to all the mitzvot</b> of the Torah.
<b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember</b> all the commandments of the Lord <b>and do</b> them.” This teaches that <b>looking</b> at the ritual fringes <b>leads to remembering</b> the mitzvot, and <b>remembering</b> them <b>leads to doing</b> them. <b>And Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai says: Anyone who is diligent in this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>merits receiving the Divine Presence.</b> It is <b>written here: “That you may look upon it [<i>oto</i>]”</b> (Numbers 15:39), <b>and it is written there: “You shall fear the Lord your God; and Him [<i>oto</i>] shall you serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). Just as <i>oto</i> in that verse is referring to the Divine Presence, so too in this verse it is referring to the Divine Presence.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish people are beloved, as the Holy One, Blessed be He, surrounded them with mitzvot:</b> They have <b>phylacteries on their heads, and phylacteries on their arms, and ritual fringes on their garments, and a <i>mezuza</i> for their doorways. Concerning them David said: “Seven times a day I praise You, because of Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:164). This alludes to the two phylacteries, the four ritual fringes, and the <i>mezuza</i>, which total seven.
<b>And when David entered the bathhouse and saw himself standing naked, he said: Woe to me that that I stand naked without</b> any <b>mitzva. But once he remembered the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision that was in his flesh his mind was put at ease,</b> as he realized he was still accompanied by this mitzva. <b>After he left</b> the bathhouse, <b>he recited a song about</b> the mitzva of circumcision, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“For the leader, on the <i>Sheminith</i>: A Psalm of David”</b> (Psalms 12:1). This is interpreted as a psalm <b>about circumcision, which was given</b> to be performed <b>on the eighth [<i>bashemini</i>]</b> day of the baby’s life.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Anyone who has phylacteries on his head, phylacteries on his arm, ritual fringes on his garment, and a <i>mezuza</i> on his doorway is strengthened</b> from <b>all</b> sides <b>so that he will not sin, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). This is interpreted as an allusion to the three mitzvot of phylacteries, ritual fringes, and <i>mezuza</i>. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that fear Him, and delivers them”</b> (Psalms 34:8). This is interpreted to mean that the angel of the Lord surrounds those who fulfill the mitzvot and saves them from sin.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What is different about <i>tekhelet</i> from all</b> other <b>types of colors</b> such that it was chosen for the mitzva of ritual fringes? It is <b>because <i>tekhelet</i> is similar</b> in its color <b>to</b> the <b>sea, and</b> the <b>sea is similar to</b> the <b>sky, and</b> the <b>sky is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated:</b> “And they saw the God of Israel; <b>and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness”</b> (Exodus 24:10), indicating that the sky is like a sapphire brickwork. <b>And it is written: “The likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26).
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say:</b> The <b>punishment for</b> not attaching <b>white</b> strings is <b>greater than the punishment for</b> not attaching <b>sky-blue</b> strings, despite the fact that the sky-blue strings are more important. Rabbi Meir illustrates this with <b>a parable: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a king of flesh and blood who said to his two subjects</b> that they must bring him a seal. The king <b>said to one</b> of them: <b>Bring me a seal of clay, and he said to</b> the other <b>one: Bring me a seal of gold. And both of them were negligent and did not bring</b> the seals. <b>Which of them</b> will have <b>a greater punishment? You must say</b> that it is <b>this</b> one <b>to whom he said: Bring me a seal of clay, and</b> despite its availability and low cost, he <b>did not bring</b> it.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A person is obligated to recite one hundred blessings every day, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And now, Israel, what [<i>ma</i>] does the Lord your God require of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:12). Rabbi Meir interprets the verse as though it said one hundred [<i>me’a</i>], rather than <i>ma</i>.
The Gemara relates that <b>on Shabbat and Festivals,</b> when the prayers contain fewer blessings, <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, made an effort to fill</b> this quota of blessings <b>with</b> blessings on <b>spices [<i>be’isparmakei</i>] and sweet fruit,</b> of which he would partake in order to recite extra blessings.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A man is obligated to recite three blessings every day</b> praising God for His kindnesses, and <b>these</b> blessings <b>are: Who did not make me a gentile; Who did not make me a woman;</b> and <b>Who did not make me an ignoramus.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov heard his son reciting the blessing: Who did not make me an ignoramus.</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>said to him:</b> Is it <b>in fact</b> proper to go <b>this far</b> in reciting blessings? Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov’s son <b>said to him: Rather, what blessing</b> should one <b>recite?</b> If you will say that one should recite: <b>Who did not make me a slave, that is</b> the same as <b>a woman;</b> why should one recite two blessings about the same matter? Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov answered: Nevertheless, <b>a slave</b>

Daf 44a

is <b>more lowly</b> than a woman, and therefore it is appropriate to recite an additional blessing on not having been born a slave.
§ <b>The Sages taught: This <i>ḥilazon</i>,</b> which <b>is</b> the source of the sky-blue dye used in ritual fringes, has the following characteristics: <b>Its body resembles the sea, its form resembles</b> that of <b>a fish, it emerges once in seventy years, and with its blood one dyes</b> wool <b>sky-blue</b> for ritual fringes. It is scarce, and <b>therefore it is expensive.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: There is no mitzva,</b> however <b>minor, that is written in the Torah, for which there is no reward given in this world; and in the World-to-Come I do not know how much</b> reward is given. <b>Go and learn from</b> the following incident concerning <b>the mitzva of ritual fringes.</b>
There was <b>an incident involving a certain man who was diligent about the mitzva of ritual fringes.</b> This man <b>heard that there was a prostitute in</b> one of <b>the cities overseas who took four hundred gold coins as her payment. He sent her four hundred gold coins and fixed a time to</b> meet with <b>her. When his time came, he came and sat at the entrance</b> to her house.
<b>The maidservant of</b> that prostitute <b>entered and said to her: That man who sent you four hundred gold coins came and sat at the entrance. She said: Let him enter. He entered. She arranged seven beds for him, six of silver and one of gold. Between each and every one</b> of them there was <b>a ladder</b> made <b>of silver, and the top</b> bed was the one that was made <b>of gold.</b>
<b>She went up and sat naked on the top</b> bed, <b>and he too went up</b> in order <b>to sit naked facing her.</b> In the meantime, <b>his four ritual fringes came and slapped him on his face. He dropped down and sat himself on the ground, and she also dropped down and sat on the ground. She said to him:</b> I take an oath by the <b><i>gappa</i> of Rome that I will not allow you</b> to go <b>until you tell me what defect you saw in me.</b>
<b>He said to her:</b> I take an oath by <b>the Temple</b> service <b>that I never saw a woman as beautiful as you. But</b> there is <b>one mitzva</b> that <b>the Lord, our God, commanded us, and its name is ritual fringes, and in</b> the passage where <b>it</b> is commanded, <b>it is written twice: “I am the Lord your God”</b> (Numbers 15:41). The doubling of this phrase indicates: <b>I am the one who will punish</b> those who transgress My mitzvot, <b>and I am the one who will reward</b> those who fulfill them. <b>Now,</b> said the man, the four sets of ritual fringes <b>appeared to me as</b> if they were <b>four witnesses</b> who will testify against me.
<b>She said to him: I will not allow you</b> to go <b>until you tell me: What is your name, and what is the name of your city, and what is the name of your teacher, and what is the name of the study hall in which you studied Torah? He wrote</b> the information <b>and placed</b> it <b>in her hand.</b>
<b>She arose and divided all of her property,</b> giving <b>one-third</b> as a bribe <b>to the government, one-third to the poor, and she took one-third</b> with her <b>in her possession, in addition to those beds</b> of gold and silver.
<b>She came to the study hall of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> and <b>said to him: My teacher, instruct</b> your students <b>concerning me and</b> have them <b>make me a convert.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to her: My daughter, perhaps you set your sights on one of the students</b> and that is why you want to convert? <b>She took</b> the <b>note</b> the student had given her <b>from her hand and gave it to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>He said to her: Go take possession of your purchase.</b>
<b>Those beds that she had arranged for him in a prohibited</b> fashion, <b>she</b> now <b>arranged for him in a permitted</b> fashion. The Gemara completes its point about the reward of mitzvot and points out how this story illustrates the concept: <b>This is the reward given to him in this world, and</b> with regard <b>to the World-to-Come, I do not know how much</b> reward he will be given.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> In the case of <b>a borrowed cloak, for</b> the first <b>thirty days it is exempt from ritual fringes; from then on</b> it is <b>obligated.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>That</b> distinction <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who resides in a guesthouse [<i>pundaki</i>] in Eretz Yisrael, or one who rents a house outside of Eretz Yisrael, for</b> the first <b>thirty days</b> he is <b>exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>; from then on</b> he is <b>obligated. But one who rents a house in Eretz Yisrael</b> must <b>affix a <i>mezuza</i> immediately, due to</b> the <b>settlement of Eretz Yisrael.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: Absence of the <b>phylacteries of</b> the <b>arm does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of the phylacteries of the head, and absence of the phylacteries of the head does not prevent fulfillment of the mitzva of the phylacteries of the arm. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one has</b> the other phylacteries, but they are not with him or he is unable to wear them for some reason. <b>But</b> if <b>he does not have</b> the other phylacteries at all, then their absence <b>does prevent</b> the fulfillment of the mitzva to don the phylacteries that he has.
Later on, the students <b>said to him:</b> Do <b>you</b> still <b>say</b> that? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to them: No, rather</b> I would say the opposite: Concerning <b>one who does not have</b> the ability to fulfill <b>two mitzvot, should he also not perform</b> the <b>one mitzva</b> that he does have the ability to fulfill? The Gemara asks: <b>And what did he hold initially</b> when he said not to don one of the phylacteries in the absence of the other? The Gemara answers: He held that it was due to a rabbinic <b>decree, lest he be negligent</b> and not try to acquire the phylacteries that he lacks.
<b>Rav Sheshet says: Anyone who does not don phylacteries violates eight positive mitzvot.</b> This is referring to the mitzva to don phylacteries of the arm and head, each of which is mentioned in four different passages (Exodus 13:9; Exodus 13:16; Deuteronomy 6:8; Deuteronomy 11:18).
<b>And anyone who does not have ritual fringes on his garments violates five positive mitzvot.</b> This is because the mitzva of ritual fringes is stated four times in the primary passage concerning ritual fringes in Numbers: “That they prepare for themselves strings…and they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread. And it shall be to you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord” (Numbers 15:38–39). An additional command appears in the verse: “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords” (Deuteronomy 22:12).
<b>And any priest who does not ascend the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction <b>violates three positive mitzvot</b> expressed in the verses: “So you shall bless the children of Israel; you shall say to them” (Numbers 6:23), and: “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:27).
<b>Anyone who does not have a <i>mezuza</i> in his doorway violates two positive mitzvot,</b> stated in the verses: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), and: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 11:20).
<b>And Reish Lakish says: Anyone who dons phylacteries lives</b> a <b>long life, as it is stated:</b>

Daf 44b

<b>“The Lord is upon them, they will live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; and have me recover, and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). This is interpreted as referring to those who don phylacteries, which contain the name of the Lord, on their heads; as a result, they will live, be healed and merit long life.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna returns to discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of meal offerings, which are the central theme of this tractate. The absence of <b>the fine flour and the oil</b> for the meal offering accompanying burnt offerings and peace offerings <b>does not prevent</b> libation of <b>the wine, and</b> the absence of <b>the wine</b> for libation <b>does not prevent</b> sacrifice of the flour and the oil. Failure to perform some of <b>the placements</b> of blood <b>on the external altar does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the other</b> placements, as even if the priest performed only one placement of blood, the offering effects atonement after the fact.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning the additional offerings sacrificed on <i>Sukkot</i> and the Eighth Day of Assembly states: <b>“And their meal offering and their libations</b> for the bulls, for the rams and for the lambs” (Numbers 29:18). This indicates that after the animal is sacrificed, one must <b>bring</b> the <b>meal offering and then bring</b> the <b>libations. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that since the verse states: “To bring an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, <b>an animal offering, and libations,</b> each on its own day” (Leviticus 23:37), one must <b>bring</b> the <b>animal offering and then bring</b> the <b>libations,</b> and only then bring the meal offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also, isn’t it written: “And their meal offering and their libations,”</b> indicating that the meal offering precedes the libations? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> in order <b>to</b> teach that once the animals have been sacrificed during the day, <b>their meal offering and their libations</b> may be offered even <b>at night, and</b> similarly, <b>their meal offering and their libations</b> may be offered even <b>the next day.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>the Rabbis also, isn’t it written: “An animal offering, and libations,”</b> indicating that the libations immediately follow the animal offering and precede the meal offering? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary to</b> teach that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Ze’eiri, as Ze’eiri says:</b> The <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings <b>are consecrated only through the slaughter of the animal offering.</b> This means that once the animal is slaughtered, the libations that were set aside to be brought with that animal offering cannot be diverted to accompany a different animal offering.
The Gemara points out that both opinions remain difficult: <b>But Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi should <b>also require</b> the phrase “an animal offering, and libations” <b>to</b> teach that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Ze’eiri. And the Rabbis</b> should <b>also require</b> the phrase “and their meal offering and their libations” <b>to</b> indicate that <b>their meal offering and their libations</b> may be offered even <b>at night, and their meal offering and their libations</b> may be offered even <b>the next day.</b>
The Gemara offers a different explanation of the dispute in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rather, this is the reasoning of the Rabbis, as it is written</b> in the verse: “To bring an offering made by fire to the Lord, <b>a burnt offering, and a meal offering,</b> an animal offering, and libations, each on its own day.” The Rabbis derive from this that the meal offering should be offered immediately following the animal burnt offering. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also, isn’t it written: “A burnt offering, and a meal offering”?</b>
<b>Rather, with regard to</b> libations that <b>accompany an animal offering, everyone agrees that</b> the <b>meal offering</b> should be brought <b>and afterward</b> the <b>libations</b> should be brought, <b>as it is written: “A burnt offering, and a meal offering.” When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> meal offerings and libations that are <b>brought by themselves. The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> when meal offerings and libations <b>accompany offerings,</b> the <b>meal offerings</b> are brought <b>and then</b> the <b>libations</b> are brought, it can be derived that when they are brought <b>by themselves also,</b> first the <b>meal offering</b> is brought <b>and then</b> the <b>libations</b> are brought.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi holds that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>there,</b> in the case of meal offerings and libations that accompany an animal offering, that the meal offering is burned on the altar before the wine libation is poured on the altar. This is <b>because since</b> the altar <b>has started</b> to <b>eat,</b> i.e., consume, the animal offering, one must first <b>complete the entire matter of</b> the altar’s <b>eating,</b> including the meal offering. The pouring of the wine on the altar is likened more to drinking than to eating. <b>But</b> when the meal offering and the libations are brought <b>by themselves,</b> the <b>libations are</b> considered <b>preferable, because</b> the <b>song</b> of the Levites <b>is recited over them.</b> Consequently, the pouring of the libations precedes the burning of the meal offering on the altar.
§ The mishna teaches: Failure to perform some of <b>the placements</b> of blood <b>on the external altar does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the other</b> placements, as even if the priest performed only one placement, the offering effects atonement after the fact.
Apropos this statement, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to all</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood is to be <b>placed on the external altar that</b> if <b>one placed their</b> blood <b>with one</b> act of <b>placement,</b> as opposed to the two or four that are required depending upon the offering, <b>that</b> the offering has nevertheless <b>effected atonement</b> after the fact, i.e., one has fulfilled his obligation to bring the offering? <b>As it is stated: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar of the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Failure to sacrifice one of <b>the bulls, the rams, the sheep, or the goats</b> of the additional offerings brought on Festivals <b>does not prevent</b> the sacrifice of <b>the others. Rabbi Shimon says: If</b> the Temple treasurers <b>had</b> sufficient funds for the <b>numerous bulls</b> that are required to be sacrificed on that day <b>but they did not</b> also <b>have</b> sufficient funds for the accompanying <b>libations,</b> they should rather <b>bring one bull and</b> its <b>libations, and they should not sacrifice all of them without libations.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>these bulls,</b> rams, <b>and sheep</b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>on which</b> festival are they offered? <b>If we say</b> that these are the offerings <b>of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, this is difficult: <b>It is written with regard to those</b> days that their offerings must be brought: <b>“According to the ordinance”</b> (see, e.g., Numbers 29:18), and: <b>“According to their ordinance”</b> (Numbers 29:33). This indicates that no deviation from the Torah’s prescription is possible.
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to the two bulls, one ram, and seven sheep <b>of the New Moon and <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> as mentioned in <b>the book of Numbers</b> (28:11, 27).

Daf 45a

The Gemara asks: The mishna mentioned <b>rams,</b> in plural; <b>on which</b> festival are multiple rams offered? <b>If</b> the mishna is referring to the additional offerings sacrificed <b>on those</b> days of the new moon and <i>Shavuot</i> as prescribed in the book of Numbers, these offerings include only one <b>ram</b> and not two. And <b>if</b> it is referring to the two rams <b>of <i>Shavuot</i></b> that accompany the two loaves, as prescribed <b>in Leviticus,</b> a term of <b>being is written about them</b> in the verse: “They shall be a burnt offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:18). This term indicates that the offerings must be sacrificed exactly as prescribed in order to be valid. Consequently, one may not sacrifice fewer than two rams.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to the two rams <b>of <i>Shavuot</i></b> that are prescribed <b>in Leviticus, and this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> Failure to sacrifice the <b>rams</b> that accompany the two loaves, as prescribed <b>in Leviticus, does not prevent</b> the sacrifice of the <b>ram</b> of the additional offering prescribed <b>in the book of Numbers.</b> Similarly, failure to sacrifice the <b>ram</b> of the additional offering, prescribed <b>in the book of Numbers, does not prevent</b> the sacrifice of the <b>rams</b> that accompany the two loaves, as prescribed <b>in Leviticus.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if that is the explanation, then when the mishna mentions <b>bulls</b> and sheep it means <b>that even</b> the bulls or sheep of the additional offering prescribed in the book of Numbers <b>do not prevent each other</b> from being sacrificed, i.e., the inability to sacrifice one of the bulls or sheep does not prevent one from sacrificing the rest. <b>But</b> when the mishna mentions <b>rams, it is the</b> rams mentioned <b>here</b> in Leviticus <b>that do not prevent</b> sacrifice of the rams mentioned <b>there,</b> in Numbers, and vice versa; but the failure to sacrifice one of <b>those</b> rams in Leviticus <b>does prevent</b> sacrifice of the other. Consequently, although the mishna mentions bulls, rams, and sheep together, the <i>halakha</i> is not the same with regard to these different animals.
The Gemara responds: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>teaches each statement</b> individually, i.e., the <i>halakha</i> applies to each of the animals listed in a different manner.
§ The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the offerings sacrificed on the New Moon: The verse states: <b>“And on the day of the new moon, a young bull without blemish; and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish”</b> (Ezekiel 46:6) The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Why</b> does <b>the verse state “a bull”</b> when the verse in the Torah requires two bulls, as it is stated: “And on your New Moons you shall present a burnt offering to the Lord: Two young bulls, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without blemish” (Numbers 28:11)?
The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Since</b> it <b>is stated in the Torah</b> with regard to the offering of the New Moon: “Two young <b>bulls,”</b> one might think that it is not acceptable to bring fewer than two bulls under any circumstances. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>did not find two</b> bulls, <b>he brings one?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “A young <b>bull,”</b> in the singular, to teach that even if one has only one bull it should be sacrificed.
The <i>baraita</i> discusses the continuation of the verse in Ezekiel, which mentions <b>“six lambs.” Why</b> does <b>the verse state</b> only six lambs when the verse in the Torah requires seven? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Since it is stated in the Torah</b> with regard to the offering of the New Moon: <b>“Seven</b> lambs,” one might think that it is not acceptable to bring fewer than seven lambs under any circumstances. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>did not find seven</b> lambs, <b>he should bring six? Therefore, the verse</b> in Ezekiel <b>states: “Six</b> lambs,” to teach that in the absence of all seven lambs one should sacrifice six.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if he did not find six</b> lambs, <b>he should bring five;</b> and that if he did not find <b>five</b> lambs, <b>he should bring four;</b> and that if he did not find <b>four</b> lambs, <b>he should bring three;</b> and that if he did not find <b>three</b> lambs, <b>he should bring two; and</b> that if he could not find even two lambs, he should bring <b>even one</b> lamb? Therefore, <b>the</b> next <b>verse</b> in Ezekiel <b>states: “And for the lambs as his means suffice”</b> (Ezekiel 46:7), indicating that one should bring however many lambs one is able to bring.
The Gemara asks: <b>But once this is written, why do I</b> need the previous verse to state <b>“six lambs,”</b> indicating that if one does not have seven lambs he should bring six? The Gemara answers: It teaches <b>that</b> although the minimal obligation is satisfied with even one lamb, nevertheless, <b>to the degree that it is possible to seek</b> more lambs, <b>we seek</b> them.
The Gemara presents another <i>halakha</i> derived from these verses: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> failure to slaughter some of the required two bulls and seven sheep of the additional offering on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>prevents</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the others?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “They shall be”</b> (Numbers 28:31); the term “they shall be” indicates that the offerings must be brought precisely as prescribed.
§ The Gemara discusses the meaning of another difficult verse in Ezekiel: <b>“So says the Lord God: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish; and you shall purify [<i>veḥitteita</i>] the Sanctuary”</b> (Ezekiel 45:18). The Gemara asks: Since this verse speaks of the first of Nisan, which is a New Moon, why does it state <b>“you shall purify [<i>ḥitteita</i>],”</b> which indicates the sacrifice of a sin offering [<i>ḥatat</i>], when in fact each of the two the bulls sacrificed on the New Moon <b>is a burnt offering</b> (see Numbers 28:11)? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This passage</b> is indeed difficult, and in the <b>future Elijah</b> the prophet <b>will interpret it.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> It is possible to explain that this verse is not referring to the additional offerings sacrificed on the New Moon but rather to the offerings of the <b>inauguration</b> that <b>they sacrificed</b> later <b>in the days of Ezra, similar to</b> the offerings <b>that were sacrificed</b> during the period of inauguration of the Tabernacle <b>in the days of Moses.</b> When the Temple service was restored in the Second Temple, the Jewish people observed eight days of inauguration, initiating the priests in the Temple service, from the twenty-third of Adar through the New Moon of Nisan. During these eight days, they offered a bull for a sin offering in addition to the offerings of the inauguration, just as had been done at the inauguration of the Tabernacle (see Leviticus 9:2).
The Gemara comments that <b>this</b> discussion with regard to the interpretation of the verse in Ezekiel <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: This passage</b> is indeed difficult, but in the <b>future Elijah</b> the prophet <b>will interpret it. Rabbi Yosei said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: This verse is referring to the offerings of the <b>inauguration</b> that <b>they sacrificed</b> later <b>in the days of Ezra, similar to</b> the offerings <b>that were sacrificed</b> during the period of inauguration <b>in the days of Moses.</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: <b>May your mind be at ease, as you have put my mind at ease</b> with this interpretation of the verse.
§ The Gemara discusses the meaning of another difficult verse in Ezekiel: <b>“The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it be fowl or beast”</b> (Ezekiel 44:31). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it</b> only the <b>priests who may not eat</b> an unslaughtered animal carcass or an animal that was torn and now has a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], <b>but</b> an ordinary <b>Jew may eat</b> them? In fact, these items are prohibited for consumption by all. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This passage</b> is indeed difficult, but in the <b>future Elijah</b> the prophet <b>will interpret it.</b>
<b>Ravina said</b> that it <b>was necessary for</b> the verse to emphasize that these prohibitions apply to <b>priests</b> for the following reason: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since pinching is permitted with regard to</b> priests, therefore an animal <b>carcass or a <i>tereifa</i> should also be permitted</b> for them. A bird sin offering is killed by a priest pinching the nape of its neck. This is not a valid method of slaughter and would generally render a bird or animal an unslaughtered carcass, yet the priests are permitted to partake of the bird sin offering. Consequently, one might think that the prohibitions against eating an animal carcass or a <i>tereifa</i> in general do not apply to priests. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that these prohibitions apply to priests as well.
§ The Gemara discusses the meaning of another difficult verse in Ezekiel: <b>“And so shall you do on the seventh of the month for every one that errs, and for him that is simple; so shall you make atonement for the house”</b> (Ezekiel 45:20). The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the expression “on the <b>seventh</b> of the month”? There are no special offerings that are sacrificed on the seventh day of any month.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The verse must be reinterpreted as referring to the bull for an unwitting communal sin, which is brought when the majority of the Jewish people have sinned as a result of following a mistaken ruling of the Sanhedrin. <b>These</b> seven alluded to in the verse are <b>seven tribes who sinned.</b> In such a case, a bull for an unwitting communal sin is brought <b>even though</b> the number of individuals who sinned <b>are not the majority of the congregation.</b> Because the majority of the individuals in the majority of the tribes have sinned, it is considered a sin of the congregation and not sins of many individuals.
Similarly, the word <b>“month [<i>ḥodesh</i>]”</b> is to be interpreted as meaning that a bull for an unwitting communal sin is brought <b>if</b> the court <b>innovated [<i>ḥiddeshu</i>]</b> a new <i>halakha</i> contradicting the Torah, e.g., if <b>they said</b> that eating forbidden <b>fat</b> is <b>permitted.</b> The continuation of the verse: <b>“For every one that errs, and for him that is simple,” teaches that</b> the Sanhedrin is <b>liable</b> to sacrifice the bull for unwitting communal sin <b>only for a matter</b> that was <b>hidden</b> from the Sanhedrin, i.e., about which the Sanhedrin issued a mistaken ruling, and <b>accompanied by unwitting action</b> by the majority of the community, who relied on the mistaken ruling.
The Gemara concludes the discussion of specific difficult verses in Ezekiel with the following general statement: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: That man is remembered for good, and Ḥanina ben Ḥizkiyya is his name. As were it not for him, the book of Ezekiel would have been suppressed</b> and not included in the biblical canon, <b>because</b> various details of <b>its contents</b> appear to <b>contradict statements of the Torah. What did</b> Ḥanina ben Ḥizkiyya <b>do? He brought up</b> to his upper story <b>three hundred jugs [<i>garbei</i>] of oil</b> for light so that he could study even at night, <b>and he sat</b> isolated <b>in the upper story and</b> did not move from there until <b>he homiletically interpreted</b> all of those verses in the book of Ezekiel that seemed to contradict verses in the Torah.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If</b> the Temple treasurers <b>had</b> sufficient funds for the <b>numerous bulls</b> that are required to be sacrificed on that day but they did not also have sufficient funds for the accompanying libations, they should rather bring one bull and its libations, and they should not sacrifice all of them without libations.
Concerning this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs as his means suffice, and a <i>hin</i> of oil to an ephah”</b> (Ezekiel 46:7). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Is the measure of</b> the meal offering accompanying <b>bulls and rams the same,</b> as stated in this verse that it is an ephah for each? In fact, this is not the <i>halakha</i>, as the meal offering accompanying a bull is three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour (see Numbers 15:9), whereas the meal offering accompanying a ram is only two-tenths of an ephah (see Numbers 15:6).
<b>Rather,</b> the verse teaches <b>that if</b> the Temple treasurers <b>had</b> sufficient funds for the <b>numerous bulls</b> that are required to be sacrificed on that day <b>but they did not</b> also <b>have</b> sufficient funds for the accompanying <b>libations, they should bring one bull and its libations, and they should not sacrifice all of them without libations. And</b> similarly, <b>if</b> the Temple treasurers <b>had</b> sufficient funds for

Daf 45b

the <b>numerous rams</b> t hat are required to be sacrificed on that day <b>and they did not</b> also <b>have</b> sufficient funds for the <b>ephah,</b> i.e., the prescribed measure, of flour <b>for</b> all of the rams, <b>they should bring one ram and its ephah</b> of flour, <b>and they should not sacrifice all of them without their ephahs</b> of flour.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On <i>Shavuot</i> there is an obligation to sacrifice burnt offerings, a sin offering, and peace offerings together with the offering of the two loaves. The burnt offerings consists of a bull, two rams, and seven sheep. A goat is brought for the sin offering. Two sheep are brought as peace offerings and waved together with the two loaves. Failure to sacrifice <b>the bull, the rams, and the sheep,</b> which are all brought as burnt offerings, <b>and the goat</b> that is brought as a sin offering, <b>does not prevent</b> the bringing of <b>the</b> two <b>loaves,</b> and they are sacrificed nevertheless. Failure to bring <b>the</b> two <b>loaves does not prevent</b> sacrifice of the accompanying animal offerings.
Failure to bring <b>the</b> two <b>loaves prevents</b> sacrifice of <b>the</b> accompanying peace offering of two <b>sheep, but</b> failure to sacrifice <b>the</b> two <b>sheep does not prevent</b> the bringing of <b>the</b> two <b>loaves;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas says: No, rather</b> the opposite is true. Failure to sacrifice <b>the</b> peace offering of two <b>sheep prevents</b> the bringing of <b>the</b> two <b>loaves, but</b> failure to bring <b>the</b> two <b>loaves does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the</b> accompanying peace offering of two <b>sheep. As we found that when the Jewish people were in the wilderness</b> for <b>forty years</b> after the exodus from Egypt, <b>they sacrificed</b> the two <b>sheep</b> as a peace offering on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>without</b> the two <b>loaves,</b> as the two loaves may be brought only from wheat grown in Eretz Yisrael after the Jewish people entered the land. <b>Here too,</b> whenever wheat is unavailable, <b>they</b> should <b>sacrifice</b> the two <b>sheep</b> without the two <b>loaves.</b> However, the two loaves are not sacrificed without the peace offering of two sheep.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas</b> that failure to sacrifice the two sheep prevents the bringing of the two loaves but failure to bring the two loaves does not prevent sacrifice of the accompanying peace offering of two sheep, <b>but the reason</b> for that ruling <b>is not in accordance with his statement.</b>
<b>As all</b> the offerings that must be sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>that</b> are <b>stated in the book of Numbers</b> (see 28:27), i.e., two bulls, one ram, and seven sheep as additional offerings and a goat as a sin offering, were <b>sacrificed</b> when the Jewish people were <b>in the wilderness. But all</b> the offerings <b>stated in Leviticus</b> (see 23:18–20), i.e., the offerings accompanying the two loaves, were <b>not sacrificed</b> when the Jewish people were <b>in the wilderness.</b> Not only were the two loaves not sacrificed, but the accompanying offerings, including the peace offering of the two sheep, were also not sacrificed, because it was only <b>when they arrived in Eretz</b> Yisrael that <b>these</b> additional offerings <b>and those</b> offerings accompanying the two loaves <b>were sacrificed.</b> Neither the additional offerings of <i>Shavuot</i> nor the two loaves, and the offerings that accompany them, were sacrificed in the wilderness, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas.
Rather, <b>for what</b> reason <b>do I</b> nevertheless <b>say that the sheep should be sacrificed without</b> the <b>loaves,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the sheep permit themselves,</b> as the sprinkling of their blood and the burning of the portions consumed on the altar renders it permitted to partake of their meat. <b>And</b> why are <b>the loaves not</b> sacrificed <b>without the sheep?</b> It is <b>because there is no</b> item <b>to permit</b> the loaves, as the loaves are permitted only after the sheep are sacrificed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches the <i>halakhot</i> of the sacrifices that generally accompany the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i> in a case when the two loaves are not available. The Gemara cites a relevant <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse that mandates these offerings states: “And you shall sacrifice with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bull, and two rams” (Leviticus 23:18). The phrase <b>“and you shall sacrifice with the bread”</b> indicates that it is <b>obligatory</b> to sacrifice these burnt offerings <b>with the loaves</b> of bread, and if the loaves are not available, then these offerings are not sacrificed. The continuation of the verse: <b>“Seven lambs without blemish,”</b> teaches that the lambs are sacrificed <b>even if there are no loaves</b> available.
<b>If so,</b> that the animal offerings may be sacrificed even without loaves, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “with the bread”?</b> It <b>teaches that they were not obligated to</b> sacrifice <b>the sheep before they were obligated to</b> sacrifice <b>loaves,</b> i.e., they became obligated to sacrifice all of these offerings only when they entered Eretz Yisrael. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Tarfon.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the <b>sheep mentioned here</b> in Leviticus, which accompany the two loaves, <b>are the very same ones mentioned in the book of Numbers</b> (see 28:27), in the passage prescribing the additional offerings. You must <b>say when you reach</b> the <b>bulls and rams</b> that are enumerated in the two passages that the offerings mentioned in one <b>are not those</b> mentioned in the other, as the number of bulls and rams are not equal. Whereas in Leviticus the verse requires the sacrifice of one bull and two rams, in Numbers the verse requires the sacrifice of two bulls and one ram. <b>Rather,</b> the two passages are referring to different offerings. <b>These</b> mentioned in Numbers <b>come</b> upon the altar <b>for their own sake, and those</b> mentioned in Leviticus <b>come</b> upon the altar <b>for the sake of</b> the two <b>loaves.</b>
It is therefore <b>found</b> that the offerings <b>that are mentioned in the book of Numbers were sacrificed</b> even when the Jewish people were <b>in the wilderness</b> and could not bring the offering of the two loaves, <b>but</b> the offerings <b>that are mentioned in Leviticus were not sacrificed in the wilderness,</b> due to the fact that the two loaves could not be sacrificed in the wilderness.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps the bulls and rams</b> mentioned in Numbers <b>are not those</b> mentioned in Leviticus, <b>but the sheep</b> mentioned in Numbers <b>are</b> the same as <b>those</b> mentioned in Leviticus. The Gemara explains: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that these</b> bulls and rams <b>are different,</b> it is apparent that <b>those</b> sheep <b>are also different</b> offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>But from where</b> is it proven <b>that</b> the <b>bulls and rams</b> in Numbers <b>are different</b> offerings than the bulls and rams mentioned in Leviticus? <b>Perhaps</b> they are actually the same offerings, and <b>this</b> is what <b>the Merciful One is saying: If</b> you <b>want, sacrifice a bull and two rams,</b> as the verse states in Leviticus; and <b>if</b> you <b>want, sacrifice two bulls and one ram,</b> as the verse states in Numbers. The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the order of</b> the offerings <b>is different</b> in the two passages, as the verse in Leviticus mentions the sheep, then the bull, and then the rams, whereas the verse in Numbers mentions the bulls, then the ram, and then the sheep, one may <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>they are different</b> offerings.
§ The mishna teaches: Failure to bring <b>the</b> two <b>loaves prevents</b> sacrifice of <b>the</b> accompanying peace offering of two <b>sheep,</b> but failure to sacrifice the two sheep does not prevent the bringing of the two loaves; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Akiva?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>He derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> based upon a verbal analogy between two verses. One verse states: “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs; <b>they shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> holy to the Lord for the priest” (Leviticus 23:20). The term “they shall be” indicates that it is essential that the offering be brought precisely as commanded, but it is unclear whether this is referring to the loaves or to the sheep brought as peace offerings. This is clarified by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two loaves of waving of two tenth parts of an ephah; <b>they shall be [<i>tihyena</i>]</b> of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17).
The verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as there</b> the requirement that it be done as prescribed is referring to the <b>loaves</b> rather than the sheep, <b>so too here</b> it is referring to the <b>loaves</b> rather than the sheep. Consequently, failure to bring the loaves prevents sacrifice of the sheep, but failure to sacrifice the sheep does not prevent the bringing of the loaves.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how did Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas,</b> who holds that failure to sacrifice the sheep prevents the bringing of the loaves but failure to bring the loaves does not prevent sacrifice of the sheep, derive his ruling? <b>He derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> through a verbal analogy between the verse: <b>“They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> holy to the Lord for the priest,” and the verse that states, concerning the seven sheep brought as burnt offerings: <b>“They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> a burnt offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:18). <b>Just as there</b> the requirement that it be done as prescribed is referring to the <b>sheep, so too here</b> it is referring to <b>sheep</b> rather than loaves.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> according to Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas also, we should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> based upon a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b><i>tihyena</i></b> as Rabbi Akiva does, and conclude that <b>just as there</b> it is referring to the <b>loaves, so too here</b> it is referring to the <b>loaves.</b> The Gemara responds: It is preferable to <b>derive</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>yihyu</i> from</b> a verbal analogy using the identical form <b><i>yihyu</i>, and</b> one should <b>not derive</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>yihyu</i> from</b> a verbal analogy using the term <b><i>tihyena</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there whether or not the words are identical? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> which applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week likewise applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. Certainly, if the <i>halakha</i> can be derived via a verbal analogy with the words <i>veshav</i> and <i>uva</i>, the even slighter difference in form between <i>yihyu</i> and <i>tihyena</i> should not prevent the application of a verbal analogy.
The Gemara answers: <b>This matter</b> applies only <b>when there are no</b> terms that are <b>identical to it. But where there are</b> terms that are <b>identical to it, we derive</b> the verbal analogy <b>from</b> terms <b>identical to it</b> rather than from the terms that are not precisely identical. Consequently, it is preferable to derive the meaning of the term <i>yihyu</i> from the identical term rather than from <i>tihyena</i>.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let Rabbi Akiva also derive</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>yihyu</i> from</b> a verbal analogy to the identical term <b><i>yihyu</i>,</b> as Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas does. The Gemara responds: Rabbi Akiva holds that it is preferable to <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>an item that</b> is given as <b>a gift to the priest,</b> such as the loaves or the sheep brought as peace offerings, which are the subject of Leviticus 23:20, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>an item that</b> is also <b>a gift to the priest,</b> i.e., the two loaves, which are the subject of Leviticus 23:17. This is <b>to the exclusion of these</b> seven sheep that are mentioned in Leviticus 23:18, <b>which are burnt offerings</b> and wholly consumed by the altar, and are not a gift to the priest. Consequently, it is preferable to derive the meaning of the term <i>yihyu</i> in verse 20 from the term <i>tihyena</i> in verse 17, rather than from the term <i>yihyu</i> in verse 18.
The Gemara presents an alternative explanation for the basis of their divergent opinions: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that they <b>disagree about the</b> interpretation of the <b>verse itself: “They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>] holy to the Lord for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:20). <b>Rabbi Akiva holds: Which item is entirely</b> given <b>to the priest? You must say</b> that <b>it is</b> the loaves of <b>bread.</b> Therefore he concludes that the word <i>yihyu</i> is referring to the loaves of bread, and if they are not sacrificed, the two sheep cannot be sacrificed as peace offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas</b> respond to this? He would say: <b>Is it</b> in fact <b>written: They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>] holy for the priest,</b> in which case one should interpret it as Rabbi Akiva does? <b>It is written</b> in the verse: <b>“They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>] holy to the Lord for the priest.”</b> Therefore, it should be understood in the following manner: <b>Which item is partially</b> given <b>to the Lord and partially</b> given <b>to the priest? You must say</b> that <b>it is</b> the <b>sheep,</b> which are sacrificed as a peace offering, part of which is burned on the altar and part of which is consumed by the priests. Consequently, the word <i>yihyu</i> should be understood as referring to the sheep, and if they are not sacrificed, the two loaves cannot be sacrificed either.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this? He would say: <b>Is it</b> in fact <b>written: They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>] holy for the Lord and for the priest? It is written</b> in the verse: “They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>] holy <b>to the Lord for the priest.”</b> Therefore, it should be understood to mean that it is given to the Lord, and it is then given by Him entirely to the priests, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: The Lord acquired it</b> initially <b>and</b> then <b>gave it to the priest.</b>
§ With regard to the dispute in the mishna about whether failure to sacrifice the two sheep as peace offerings prevents the bringing of the two loaves or vice versa, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everyone concedes</b>

Daf 46a

<b>that if</b> they <b>became bound to each other</b> and then one of them became lost, <b>that</b> the lost item <b>prevents</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the other,</b> i.e., the remaining item is unfit and must be burned. Rabbi Yoḥanan clarifies: <b>And what is</b> it that establishes <b>their bond?</b> It is the <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep. If the loaves existed at the time of the slaughter, then the loaves and sheep are sanctified as one unit. Consequently, if one of them is lost, the other is unfit and must be burned.
With regard to the establishment of the bond between the loaves and the sheep, <b>Ulla said</b> that the Sages <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>raise a dilemma:</b> Does <b>waving</b> of the sheep and loaves before the sheep are slaughtered <b>establish a bond</b> between the sheep and the loaves, such that if one is lost the other becomes unfit, <b>or does it not establish a bond</b> between them?
The Gemara asks: Why is there a dilemma about this issue? <b>Resolve it from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>establishes a bond</b> between sheep and the loaves. On can conclude <b>by inference</b> that <b>waving,</b> which precedes the slaughter, <b>does not establish a bond</b> between them.
The Gemara answers: It is with regard to the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan itself</b> that Ulla <b>raises the dilemma:</b> Is it <b>obvious to Rabbi Yoḥanan that slaughter establishes a bond</b> between them <b>but waving does not establish a bond</b> between them? <b>Or perhaps it is obvious to him</b> that <b>slaughter</b> establishes a bond between them, <b>but he is uncertain</b> as to whether or not <b>waving</b> establishes a bond between them. According to the second possibility, the reason that he mentioned slaughter is that he was certain about it. The Gemara notes that the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ḥanina said to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: But when it is written: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:20), it is <b>written</b> immediately <b>after</b> the verse mentions <b>waving, and</b> nevertheless Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva disagree,</b> based on this phrase, about whether the loaves can be brought without the sheep or the sheep can be sacrificed without the loaves. This indicates that the waving does not establish a bond between these two items.
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, replied to Rabbi Yehuda bar Ḥanina: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that one can infer the <i>halakha</i> based upon the placement of the phrase: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest,” is this phrase referring to the time <b>after waving but not after</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep? After all, the verse speaks of giving them to the priest, which is done after the sheep have been slaughtered. How then did Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva disagree concerning this verse?
<b>Rather, what do you have to say</b> concerning this verse? It must be <b>referring</b> to a time <b>before</b> the slaughter, <b>and what</b> is meant by: <b>“They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest”?</b> It means <b>an item that is ultimately</b> given <b>to the priest. Here too,</b> one can explain that the verse is referring to a time before the waving, and it means <b>an item that is ultimately</b> given <b>to the priest.</b> The issue of whether or not waving establishes a bond between the sheep and loaves therefore remains an open question.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it so that <b>slaughter establishes a bond</b> between them? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i> concerning a thanks offering, which consists of an animal offering accompanied by forty loaves. The <i>baraita</i> states: If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves broke before he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, <b>he should bring another loaf and slaughter</b> the thanks offering.
But if one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves broke once he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, it is not possible to bring another loaf because the loaves of a thanks offering are sanctified through the slaughter of the animal, which has already taken place. Consequently, <b>the blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat</b> should <b>be eaten, but he has not fulfilled his vow</b> to bring a thanks offering, <b>and the loaves are</b> all <b>unfit.</b>
If one of its accompanying loaves broke after <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> on the altar, the loaves are not deemed unfit and the individual has fulfilled his vow to bring a thanks offering. <b>He separates</b> the four loaves for the priest <b>from the whole</b> loaves <b>for the broken</b> loaf. The priest receives whole loaves and not the broken one.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves left</b> the confines of the walls of Jerusalem <b>before he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, it is not unfit because the loaves were not yet sanctified by the slaughter. Therefore, <b>he brings it</b> back <b>into</b> the city <b>and slaughters</b> the thanks offering.
If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves left</b> the confines of the walls of Jerusalem <b>once he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, the loaves are rendered unfit. Consequently, <b>the blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat</b> should <b>be eaten, but he has not fulfilled his vow</b> to bring a thanks offering <b>and the loaves are</b> all <b>unfit.</b> If one of the loaves left the confines of the walls of Jerusalem after <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> on the altar, the remainder of the offering is fit, and <b>he separates</b> the four loaves for the priest <b>from the</b> ones <b>that</b> remained <b>inside</b> the city <b>for the loaf that</b> went <b>outside</b> the walls of the city.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves became impure before he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, <b>he brings another loaf and slaughters</b> the thanks offering. But if one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves became impure once he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, then <b>the blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat</b> should <b>be eaten, and he has fulfilled his vow</b> to bring a thanks offering. This is due to the fact <b>that the frontplate effects acceptance of</b> offerings that are <b>impure.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the loaf</b> that became impure <b>is unfit,</b> as the frontplate effects acceptance of the offering but does not render impure items pure.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: If one of its accompanying loaves became impure after <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> on the altar, <b>he separates</b> the four loaves that are given to the priest <b>from the</b> loaves that remained <b>pure for the impure</b> loaf.
The Gemara comes to its question: <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>slaughter establishes a bond</b> between the sheep and the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>, and similarly between the animal offering and the loaves of a thanks offering, then in the cases where a loaf became unfit after the animal was slaughtered but before the blood was sprinkled, <b>since</b> the animal and the loaves <b>bonded with each other through the slaughtering,</b> once the <b>loaf became unfit, the thanks offering should also become unfit.</b> Consequently, the blood of the offering should not be sprinkled on the altar and the meat should not be eaten, contrary to what is stated in the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara answers: The <b>thanks offering is different, as the Merciful One called it a peace offering,</b> as the verse states: “The sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving” (Leviticus 7:13). Consequently, <b>just as a peace offering is sacrificed without loaves, so too a thanks offering</b> can be <b>sacrificed without loaves.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: If you say</b> that <b>waving establishes a bond</b> between the loaves and the sheep, then in a case where <b>the loaves were lost</b> after the waving,

Daf 46b

the <b>sheep are lost</b> as well, i.e., they cannot be sacrificed, and one must bring different loaves and sheep. Similarly, if the <b>sheep are lost</b> after the waving, <b>the loaves are</b> thereby <b>lost</b> as well, since a bond was established between them by means of the waving.
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>waving does not establish a bond</b> between the loaves and the sheep, then one can raise the following dilemma: If one <b>brought loaves and sheep and they were waved, and</b> then <b>the loaves were lost and</b> he <b>brought other loaves</b> to replace the original loaves, does <b>that</b> second set of <b>loaves require waving</b> with the sheep, as it has not yet been waved? <b>Or does it not require waving,</b> as the accompanying sheep have already been waved with the original loaves, and the sheep are the subject in the verse that serves as the source of the requirement of waving (see Leviticus 23:20)?
Rabbi Yirmeya clarifies the dilemma: In a case where the <b>sheep were lost</b> after the waving, <b>do not raise the dilemma, as</b> in this case <b>they certainly require waving,</b> because the primary obligation of waving is mentioned with respect to the sheep, and these sheep have not yet been waved. <b>When should you raise the dilemma?</b> You should raise it in a case where <b>the loaves were lost</b> after the waving.
<b>And according to</b> the opinion <b>of</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas,</b> who holds that failure to sacrifice the sheep prevents one from sacrificing the loaves, <b>do not raise the dilemma, as he says</b> that the <b>sheep are primary.</b> Consequently, since the sheep have been waved, there is no need to repeat the waving. <b>When should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva,</b> who holds that failure to bring the loaves prevents one from sacrificing the sheep, <b>as he says</b> that the <b>loaves are primary.</b> According to his opinion, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning the loaves that are brought as replacements?
On the one hand, one might say that <b>since the loaves are primary</b> and this set of loaves has not yet been waved, <b>it requires waving. Or</b> on the other hand, <b>perhaps</b> one should say that <b>since its permitting factors are</b> the <b>sheep,</b> and they were already waved, the new set of loaves <b>does not require waving.</b> The Gemara concludes that the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Abaye said to Rava: What is different</b> about the <b>two sheep</b> brought as peace offerings together with the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>, such <b>that their</b> slaughter <b>sanctifies the loaves</b> (see 47a), <b>and</b> according to Rabbi Yoḥanan failure to sacrifice them once they have been slaughtered <b>prevents</b> the bringing of the loaves; <b>and what is different</b> about the <b>seven sheep, the bull, and</b> the two <b>rams</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i> as an additional offering, such <b>that their</b> slaughter <b>does not sanctify</b> the <b>loaves, and</b> failure to sacrifice them <b>does not prevent</b> the bringing of the loaves?
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: The reason for the distinction is <b>because</b> the two sheep and the loaves brought as peace offerings <b>are bound to each other through the waving.</b> This is not so with regard to the additional offerings, which are not waved with the loaves. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a thanks offering</b> and its loaves, which are not waved together, <b>they are not bound to each other through waving, and</b> nevertheless the slaughter of the animal offering <b>sanctifies</b> the loaves <b>and</b> failure to sacrifice the animal offering <b>prevents</b> the bringing of the loaves. This indicates that the waving is not the critical factor.
<b>Rather,</b> the reason for the distinction is that the two sheep brought as peace offerings are <b>comparable to a thanks offering. Just as a thanks offering is a peace offering, so too</b> the two sheep are <b>also a peace offering.</b> Consequently, just as the slaughter of the thanks offering sanctifies the accompanying loaves, and failure to sacrifice the animal prevents one from bringing the loaves, the same applies with regard to the sheep peace offerings and loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>Are</b> the two sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> and the thanks offering really <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the thanks offering, <b>there are no other animal offerings</b> brought <b>with it.</b> But <b>here,</b> in the case of the offerings brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>where there are other animal offerings</b> brought <b>with it, let these</b> peace offerings <b>and those</b> additional offerings <b>sanctify</b> the loaves. Why is it only the sheep brought as peace offerings that sanctify the loaves?
<b>Rather,</b> the reason for the distinction is that the two sheep brought as peace offerings are <b>comparable to a nazirite’s ram,</b> which is sacrificed as a peace offering when he completes his term of naziriteship, in addition to a lamb that he sacrifices as a burnt offering, a female lamb that he brings then as a sin offering, and the nazirite loaves (see Numbers 6:14–15). <b>Just as</b> in the case of a <b>nazirite’s ram, even though there are other offerings</b> brought with it, nevertheless <b>it is</b> the slaughter of the <b>peace offering that sanctifies</b> the nazirite loaves and <b>not</b> the slaughter of <b>anything else, here too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is no different,</b> and it is specifically the slaughter of the peace offerings that sanctifies the loaves.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> in the case of the offerings of the nazirite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it is specifically the slaughter of the peace offering that sanctifies the loaves? The Gemara answers: This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a verse stated with regard to the offerings of the nazirite: <b>“And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread”</b> (Numbers 6:17). This verse, which connects the ram and the loaves, <b>teaches that the basket</b> of the nazirite loaves <b>comes</b> as <b>an obligation for the ram,</b> which is a peace offering, <b>and the slaughter of the ram sanctifies</b> the loaves. <b>Therefore,</b> if the slaughter was unfit, e.g., in a case where <b>he slaughtered</b> the ram <b>not for the sake of</b> a peace offering, <b>the loaves were not sanctified.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Akiva failure to sacrifice the two sheep brought as peace offerings does not prevent sacrifice of the loaves. Consequently, if there are no sheep, the loaves are sacrificed by themselves. Concerning this <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>the two loaves</b> are <b>brought by themselves, they should be waved.</b> They should then be left overnight so that <b>their form decays,</b> i.e., they become disqualified, <b>and they are</b> then <b>brought out to the place of burning,</b> like any disqualified offering.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this is difficult: <b>If</b> the loaves are <b>brought</b> and waved in order <b>to be eaten, let</b> the priests <b>eat them</b> rather than burn them. <b>If</b> they are <b>brought</b> only <b>to be burned, let</b> the priests <b>burn them immediately. Why are they</b> left overnight so that they undergo <b>a decay of form,</b> i.e., become disqualified?
<b>Rabba said: Actually,</b> the loaves are <b>brought</b> and waved in order <b>to be eaten.</b> Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that they not be eaten out of concern <b>lest sheep become available to</b> the nation <b>the following year, and they</b> might <b>say: Didn’t we eat the loaves without</b> any accompanying <b>sheep last year [<i>eshtakad</i>]? Now too, we will eat</b> the loaves without sacrificing sheep.
<b>And they will not know that</b> the reason they were permitted to eat the loaves without sacrificing sheep <b>last year</b> is that <b>there were no sheep,</b> and therefore the two loaves <b>permitted themselves</b> to be eaten, i.e., they could be eaten without the sacrifice of the sheep. But <b>now that there are sheep, it is</b> the sacrifice of <b>the sheep that permits</b> the loaves to be eaten. Since loaves brought without sheep are fit by Torah law and may not be eaten due to rabbinic decree, they may not be burned until they become disqualified by remaining overnight.
<b>Rabba said: From where do I say</b> this, i.e., what is the source for my statement? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:4): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>ben Bukhri testified</b> before the Sages <b>in Yavne: Any priest who contributes his</b> half-<b>shekel is not</b> considered <b>a sinner,</b> despite the fact that he is not obligated to do so.
Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>That is not</b> the case, <b>rather, any priest who does not contribute his</b> half-<b>shekel</b> is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated in this mitzva like all other Jews. <b>But the priests</b> who do not contribute the half-shekel <b>interpret this</b> following <b>verse to their own</b> advantage in order to excuse themselves from the mitzva.
The verse states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). Those priests claim as follows: <b>Since the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat, brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the shewbread</b> placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, which are all meal offerings, <b>are ours,</b> then if we contribute half-shekels we will have partial ownership of these communal offerings, as they are purchased with the half-shekels. <b>How,</b> then, <b>can they be eaten?</b> They would then be regarded as priests’ meal offerings, which must be wholly burned.
Rabba discusses this mishna: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>these two loaves? If we say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> they are <b>brought with the animal offering,</b> i.e., the two sheep brought as peace offerings, why shouldn’t the loaves be eaten? <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>priests cannot volunteer</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering and its loaves and eat them?</b> Just as the loaves that accompany a thanks offering may be eaten, even if brought by a priest, the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to the two loaves when they accompany sheep brought as peace offerings.
<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the two loaves are <b>brought by themselves,</b> and the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the priests claimed: <b>How</b> can <b>they be eaten? Apparently,</b> in principle the loaves <b>come to be eaten,</b> but due to rabbinic decree they are not eaten and are left overnight until their form decays.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba in response: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna can be interpreted as referring <b>to</b> loaves <b>brought with the animal offering,</b> and therefore it does not prove that when the two loaves are brought by themselves they may be eaten. <b>And as for that which</b> is <b>difficult for you</b> based <b>on</b> the case of <b>a thanks offering and its loaves,</b> the resolution is that the <b>loaves of a thanks offering are not called a meal offering,</b> and therefore even when a priest brings a thanks offering, the loaves may be eaten. By contrast, <b>the two loaves</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>are called a meal offering, as it is stated</b> with regard to the two loaves: “Also in the day of the first fruits, <b>when you bring a new meal offering to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:26). Therefore, the priests held that if they would donate half-shekels, the two loaves would not be permitted to be eaten.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> a different response to Rabba’s proof: <b>Actually,</b> when the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> are brought by themselves <b>they come to be burned,</b> i.e., they may not be eaten. <b>And this is the reason that we do not burn them</b> until the following day: It is <b>because one may not burn consecrated</b> items <b>on a Festival.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is</b> the burning of the two loaves <b>comparable</b> to the burning of other consecrated items, such that the loaves may not be burned right away for this reason? <b>There,</b> in the case of other consecrated items, <b>this is not their mitzva,</b> i.e., they are supposed to be eaten, but if they become disqualified they must be burned. Conversely, <b>here,</b> in the case of the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> that are brought by themselves, <b>where this is their mitzva,</b> i.e., they are supposed to be burned, <b>let</b> the priests <b>burn them</b> on the Festival, <b>just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case <b>of the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur,</b> which are burned on Yom Kippur despite the fact that it is a Festival.
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The reason the loaves are left overnight is due to a rabbinic <b>decree</b> not to burn them immediately, <b>lest sheep become available to</b> the nation <b>afterward,</b> i.e., later in the day, in which case the loaves could be waved with them and then eaten. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: That <b>works out well</b> for the <b>entire time</b> period when <b>they</b> may be <b>sacrificed,</b> i.e., until the afternoon daily offering is sacrificed. But <b>after that, let them burn</b> the loaves immediately and not wait until the next day. Rav Yosef replied: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that teaches</b> that the loaves must be left until <b>their form decays?</b> It means that they must be left until <b>the form of their sacrifice</b> has passed, i.e., until after the time when the sheep could be sacrificed.
<b>Rava said</b> that there is a different response to Rabba’s proof: When the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> are brought by themselves, by Torah law <b>they come to be eaten, but</b> due to rabbinic <b>decree</b> they are not eaten and are left overnight until they are disqualified. The reason for the decree is <b>due to</b> that <b>which Rabba</b> said, i.e., due to the concern that the following year sheep will be available and nevertheless the nation will bring the two loaves without sheep. <b>But</b> the proof that by Torah law the loaves may be eaten is <b>not from</b> Rabba’s line of <b>reasoning,</b> i.e., from the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i>; <b>rather,</b> it is <b>from a verse.</b>
<b>And Rava said</b> by way of explanation: <b>From where do I state</b> this <i>halakha</i>? From the fact <b>that it is written</b> with regard to the two loaves: <b>“You shall bring out of your dwellings</b> two <b>loaves of waving</b> of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, <b>for first fruits to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>Just as first fruits</b> are brought <b>by themselves,</b> without an accompanying animal offering, <b>so too the two loaves</b> are brought <b>by themselves</b> when there are no sheep available. <b>And</b> learn <b>from this</b> comparison to first fruits that <b>just as first fruits</b> are brought <b>to be eaten, so too the two loaves</b> are <b>also</b> brought <b>to be eaten,</b> even in the absence of the sheep brought as peace offerings.

Daf 47a

§ The Gemara cites further discussion of the two sheep and the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> two <b>sheep</b> of <b><i>Shavuot</i> consecrate the</b> two <b>loaves</b> that accompany them <b>only by</b> means of their <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the sheep <b>for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> as the peace offerings that are supposed to be sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and</b> then the priest <b>sprinkled their blood</b> on the altar <b>for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> then <b>the loaves are consecrated.</b> But if <b>one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are not consecrated.</b> If <b>one slaughtered them for their</b> own <b>sake and he sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are</b> partially <b>consecrated, but they are not</b> fully <b>consecrated.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> The loaves are <b>never consecrated</b> at all <b>until one slaughters</b> the offerings <b>for their</b> own <b>sake and sprinkles their blood for their</b> own <b>sake.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the slaughtering of the sheep partially consecrates the loaves even without the sprinkling of the blood?
The Gemara answers: It is based on the fact <b>that it is written</b> concerning the ram brought by the nazirite when he completes his naziriteship: <b>“And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of peace offerings to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread”</b> (Numbers 6:17). Since the verse uses the word <i>zevaḥ</i>, which also means slaughter, and the verse then makes reference to the loaves, <b>that is to say that</b> it is specifically the <b>slaughter</b> that <b>consecrates</b> the loaves that accompany the offering. Similarly, the slaughter of the sheep brought as peace offerings on <i>Shavuot</i> consecrates the accompanying two loaves, as the <i>halakha</i> of the loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> is derived from that of the loaves of the nazirite.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the slaughtering and sprinkling of the blood together consecrate the loaves? The Gemara answers: He derives it from the term: <b>“He shall offer,”</b> which he understands to mean that the loaves are not consecrated <b>until</b> the priest <b>performs all of the actions</b> included in the sacrificial rites of that offering, including the sprinkling of the blood.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also, isn’t it written: “He shall offer,”</b> which indicates that the loaves are consecrated only once the blood has been sprinkled on the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it were <b>written: A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] he shall offer,</b> it would be <b>as you are saying</b> that he should slaughter it and then perform a further action, i.e., sprinkling the blood, in order to consecrate the loaves. <b>Now that it is written: “He shall offer</b> the ram for <b>a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>],”</b> it should be understood as: <b>By what</b> means <b>should he offer</b> the ram in order to consecrate the loaves? <b>By</b> means of <b>slaughtering [<i>zeviḥa</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, isn’t it written: “A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>],”</b> indicating that slaughtering alone consecrates the loaves? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> expression <b>for</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>everyone,</b> including Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>concedes that the loaves must be</b> in existence <b>at the time of the slaughter.</b>
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> that if one slaughtered the sheep for their own sake and sprinkled their blood not for their own sake, then the loaves are partially <b>consecrated, but they are not</b> fully <b>consecrated? Abaye says:</b> The loaves are <b>consecrated</b> by means of the slaughtering, <b>but</b> their consecration is <b>not complete. Rava says:</b> The loaves are fully <b>consecrated</b> by means of the slaughtering, <b>but</b> they are <b>not</b> thereby <b>permitted</b> to be eaten.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> Everyone concedes that the loaves may not be eaten as a result of this slaughtering. The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is the ability <b>to transfer</b> sanctity to <b>their redemption</b> money. <b>According to Abaye,</b> who holds that the loaves are not completely consecrated, they <b>do not transfer</b> sanctity to <b>their redemption</b> money if one tries to redeem them for money. <b>According to Rava,</b> who holds that the loaves are completely consecrated, they <b>transfer</b> sanctity to <b>their redemption</b> money.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rava,</b> who holds that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the loaves are completely sanctified, <b>that is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</b> But <b>according to Abaye, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b>
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is <b>with regard to</b> whether the loaves are <b>rendered unfit by</b> means of <b>leaving</b> the Temple courtyard after the slaughtering of the offering. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the loaves are rendered unfit if they leave the courtyard. According to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who holds that the loaves are not consecrated, they are not rendered unfit if they leave the courtyard.
§ The Gemara continues the discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, concerning the consecration of the two loaves by means of the slaughter and sprinkling of the blood of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba:</b> In the case of a communal peace offering of two <b>sheep</b> that accompany the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i> that one slaughtered for their sake but</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for their sake,</b> concerning <b>those</b> accompanying <b>loaves, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to eating</b> them?
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it was raised <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, doesn’t he say</b> that <b>it is</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>that consecrates the loaves?</b> Consequently, if the blood was not properly sprinkled, it is clear that the loves are unfit and may not be eaten. And <b>if</b> it was raised <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>both according to</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye and according to</b> that of <b>Rava,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that the loaves <b>are consecrated but are not permitted</b> to be eaten.
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the question was asked <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>. As the father of Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>the two loaves left</b> the Temple courtyard <b>between</b> the <b>slaughtering</b> of the offering <b>and</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood, <b>and</b> then the priest <b>sprinkled the blood of</b> the <b>sheep</b> with the intent that their meat would be eaten <b>beyond their</b> designated <b>time,</b> the sheep are rendered <i>piggul</i>. With regard to the loaves, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The loaves do not</b> become prohibited <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>. Rabbi Akiva says: The loaves do</b> become prohibited <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet said: These <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva, both <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said:</b> The <b>slaughtering consecrates</b> the loaves by itself. Consequently, if the loaves are taken out of the Temple courtyard after the sheep are slaughtered, the loaves become disqualified.
<b>But</b> they disagree as to the following: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>says</b> that <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>is not effective with regard to</b> offerings that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard. Since the loaves left the courtyard before the sprinkling of the blood, the intent of the priest while sprinkling the blood that the offering be eaten outside of its designated time does not render the loaves <i>piggul</i>. <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>is effective with regard to</b> offerings that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard. Therefore, the intent of the priest while sprinkling the blood that the offering be eaten outside of its designated time renders the loaves <i>piggul</i>, even though they left the courtyard.

Daf 47b

<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 6b): In the case of <b>sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity that left</b> the Temple courtyard <b>before the sprinkling of the blood, Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The sprinkling of the blood is completely ineffective with regard to these portions, and therefore one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing them. And</b> if <b>one</b> eats <b>them, he is not liable due to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> of partaking of sacrificial meat while one is <b>ritually impure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The sprinkling is effective and therefore, one is liable for <b>misusing them. And</b> if <b>one</b> eats <b>them he is liable due to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> of partaking of sacrificial meat while one is <b>ritually impure.</b>
The Gemara now concludes the dilemma that Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak raised before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: According to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to eating the loaves when the sheep were slaughtered for their own sake, but their blood was sprinkled not for their sake?
The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the dilemma: Should one say that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that sprinkling</b> the blood of the sheep in a manner that renders it <b><i>piggul</i> renders</b> the loaves <b><i>piggul</i>, like the meat</b> of the offering, despite the fact that the loaves were disqualified <b>by leaving</b> the courtyard of the Temple, it can be derived that <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>not for its own sake also permits the loaves</b> to be eaten, just as it permits the meat of the sheep to be eaten? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is only <b>to</b> be <b>stringent</b> that <b>we say</b> that sprinkling the blood is effective with regard to loaves that have left the Temple courtyard, but <b>we do not say</b> this in order <b>to</b> be <b>lenient,</b> e.g., to render the loaves permitted to be eaten.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> understanding of the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer. <b>From where</b> do we know that <b>they disagree</b> in a case <b>where</b> the loaves <b>are outside</b> the courtyard at the time of the sprinkling?
<b>Perhaps in</b> a case <b>where</b> the loaves <b>are</b> still <b>outside</b> the courtyard <b>everyone agrees that sprinkling</b> the blood <b>is not effective with regard to</b> offerings that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and they disagree in</b> a case <b>where</b> the loaves left the courtyard and <b>one then brought them</b> back into the courtyard before the sprinkling. <b>As Rabbi Eliezer holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said:</b> The <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>consecrates</b> the loaves, <b>and</b> therefore the loaves <b>became disqualified by leaving</b> the courtyard after the sheep were slaughtered. Consequently, even if they were brought back into the courtyard before the sprinkling of the blood they cannot become <i>piggul</i> because they have already been disqualified for a different reason.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> The <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>does not consecrate</b> the loaves at all before the sprinkling of the blood. Since the loaves were not yet consecrated, <b>they do not become disqualified by leaving</b> the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is this</b> interpretation of the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer? It does not fit what they say. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said:</b> The <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>consecrates</b> the loaves, <b>that is what Rabbi Akiva</b> means when he <b>says that</b> the loaves <b>are consecrated by</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>and</b> then the <b>sprinkling</b> that was done with the intent to consume the offering after its appointed time <b>comes and renders</b> the loaves <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>
<b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Akiva holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> The <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>does not consecrate</b> the loaves without the sprinkling of the blood, <b>does sprinkling</b> with an intent that renders the sheep <b><i>piggul</i></b> actually <b>consecrate</b> the loaves?
<b>But doesn’t Rav Giddel say</b> that <b>Rav says: Sprinkling</b> with an intent that renders an offering <b><i>piggul</i> does not cause</b> items <b>to</b> become subject to the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>and it does not remove</b> items <b>from</b> being subject to the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property?
Rav explains: The <i>halakha</i> that it <b>does not cause</b> items <b>to</b> become subject to the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property applies <b>with regard to sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity.</b> The prohibition against misusing consecrated property applies to: “The sacred items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). Consequently, it does not apply to offerings of lesser sanctity, as the meat is the property of those who brought the offering, and the sacrificial portions are disqualified by the sprinkling performed with improper intent.
<b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>it does not remove</b> items <b>from</b> being subject to the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property applies <b>with regard to meat of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> such as a sin offering, a guilt offering, or a communal peace offering. Since the sprinkling of the blood was not valid, the meat, which would have become permitted for the priests to eat, retains the status of “the sacred items of the Lord,” and the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property still applies.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>Wasn’t that which Rav Giddel</b> says that <b>Rav says conclusively refuted?</b> Consequently, one cannot ask a question based on this statement.
§ The Gemara cites another dilemma concerning the sheep and loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> In a case of the two <b>sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> that one slaughtered for their own sake,</b> thereby establishing a bond between the sheep and the loaves, <b>and the loaves were</b> then <b>lost,</b> if the blood of the sheep would be sprinkled for their sake, the meat would not be permitted to be eaten because the loaves were lost. That said, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether the priest may <b>sprinkle their blood not for their own sake</b> but rather for the sake of a peace offering in order <b>to permit</b> the <b>meat</b> of the sheep <b>to be eaten?</b>
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Do you have anything that is not fit</b> if the sacrificial rites are performed <b>for its own sake, and</b> yet it is <b>fit</b> if the sacrificial rites are performed <b>not for its own sake?</b> This is certainly not a logical option. Rabbi Yirmeya responded: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> precedent for this? <b>But there is</b> the <b>Paschal offering before midday</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>which is not fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>for its own sake,</b> as it is before the proper time for the Paschal offering, <b>and</b> yet it is <b>fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>not for its own sake</b> but rather for the sake of a peace offering.
Rabbi Zeira replied: <b>This is what I</b> was <b>saying: Do you have anything that was fit</b> to be sacrificed <b>for its own sake,</b> like these sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> that were slaughtered before the loaves were lost, <b>and was</b> then <b>rejected from</b> being sacrificed <b>for its own sake,</b> like these sheep when the loaves were lost, <b>and is not fit</b> if it is sacrificed <b>for its own sake, and</b> yet it is <b>fit</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its own sake?</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya responded: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> precedent for this? <b>But there is</b> the <b>Paschal offering,</b> which was fit to be sacrificed for its own sake during its designated time, and <b>after its</b> designated <b>time, during</b> the <b>rest of the days of the year before midday,</b> it is not fit to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering but it is fit to be sacrificed as a peace offering.
Rabbi Zeira replied: <b>This is what I</b> was <b>saying: Do you have anything that was fit</b> to be sacrificed <b>for its own sake,</b> like the two sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> that were slaughtered before the loaves were lost, <b>and it was slaughtered for its own sake, and was</b> then <b>rejected from</b> being sacrificed <b>for its own sake,</b> like the two sheep when the loaves were lost, <b>and it is not fit</b> if it is sacrificed <b>for its own sake, and</b> yet it is <b>fit</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its own sake?</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya responded: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> precedent for this? <b>But there is</b> the <b>thanks offering,</b> as the Gemara (46a) states that if the thanks offering was slaughtered and then its accompanying loaves broke into pieces and thereby became disqualified, the blood should be sprinkled for the sake of a peace offering rather than a thanks offering, and then the meat may be eaten. Yet, if the blood was sprinkled for the sake of a thanks offering, the meat would not be permitted to be eaten.
Rabbi Zeira answered: The <b>thanks offering is different, as the Merciful One called it a peace offering</b> (see Leviticus 7:13). Just as a peace offering is sacrificed without loaves, so too a thanks offering may sometimes be sacrificed without loaves. Therefore, the loss of the loaves does not render the thanks offering disqualified, and this case is not comparable to the case of the two sheep and two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>.
§ The Gemara cites another discussion concerning the sheep and loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>slaughtered</b> the <b>two sheep</b> as required but they were accompanied <b>by four loaves</b> rather than the requisite two loaves, <b>he draws two of</b> the loaves from the four <b>and waves them</b> together with the sheep,

Daf 48a

<b>and the rest</b> of the loaves <b>are</b> permitted to be <b>eaten through redemption. The Sages said</b> the following <b>before Rav Ḥisda: This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the slaughter of the sheep grants the loaves inherent sanctity, and in this case two of the loaves have inherent sanctity but it is not known which ones.
<b>As, if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>since he says</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>consecrates</b> the loaves with inherent sanctity, when the <i>baraita</i> states <b>that he redeems</b> the loaves, <b>where</b> does he redeem them?
The process of redemption would be to place all four loaves in front of him and state that whichever two of the loaves do not have inherent sanctity are redeemed for money. <b>If he redeems them outside</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>since it is written:</b> “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering <b>before the Lord,</b> with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20), <b>he disqualifies</b> the two loaves that possess inherent sanctity <b>by</b> causing them to <b>leave</b> the courtyard, at which point they are no longer “before the Lord.” Conversely, <b>if</b> he redeems them <b>inside</b> the courtyard, once the two loaves that do not possess inherent sanctity are redeemed, he violates the prohibition against <b>bringing non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> them: <b>Actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> one <b>redeems</b> the loaves <b>inside</b> the courtyard. Nevertheless, it is not considered to be a violation of the prohibition against bringing non-sacred items into the courtyard because the <b>non-sacred</b> loaves <b>came</b> into the courtyard <b>by themselves,</b> i.e., they were already there when they became non-sacred and were not actively brought into the courtyard in their non-sacred state.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this very case: <b>When he redeems</b> the loaves, <b>he</b> may <b>redeem them only outside</b> of the courtyard? This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s claim that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi one redeems the loaves inside the courtyard.
Rav Ashi answered: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is certainly</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, because if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, when he brings the loaves outside the courtyard <b>he thereby disqualifies them by</b> causing them to <b>leave</b> the courtyard.
§ <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Let us say</b> that the <i>baraita</i>, which states that if the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> are slaughtered with four loaves instead of two, two of the four are invested with inherent sanctity, <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan that was stated</b> with regard to <b>a thanks offering that one slaughtered</b> accompanied <b>by eighty loaves</b> rather than the required forty. In that case, <b>Ḥizkiyya says: Forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Not</b> even <b>forty of</b> the <b>eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> dispute that <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>concedes</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the individual bringing the offering <b>said: Let forty of</b> the <b>eighty</b> loaves <b>be consecrated, that</b> forty <b>are consecrated? Here too,</b> one can say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one said: Let two of the four</b> loaves <b>be consecrated.</b>
§ The Gemara cites another discussion concerning the sheep and loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If <b>one slaughtered four sheep</b> for <i>Shavuot</i>, rather than the required two, accompanied <b>by two loaves,</b> he <b>draws two of</b> the sheep out of the four <b>and sprinkles their blood not for the sake</b> of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>. He then sprinkles the blood of the other sheep for the sake of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>.
<b>As, if you do not say</b> to do <b>this,</b> but rather require him to first sprinkle the blood of two of the sheep for their own sake, then <b>you have caused the loss</b> of <b>the latter</b> two sheep. Since they were previously fit to have their blood sprinkled on the altar for the sake of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>, and were disqualified from this status when the blood of the other two sheep was sprinkled for that purpose, they are no longer fit to have their blood sprinkled even for the sake of a different offering.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata: <b>And does</b> the court <b>say to a person: Arise and sin in order that you may gain?</b> Is it proper for the priest to sprinkle the blood of the first pair not for their own sake so that the second pair will remain fit?
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 77a) that <i>tanna’im</i> disagree concerning this matter? The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>the limbs of a sin offering,</b> whose flesh is eaten by priests and may not be burned on the altar, <b>that were intermingled with the limbs of a burnt offering,</b> which are burned on the altar, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The priest <b>shall place</b> all the limbs <b>above,</b> on the altar, <b>and I view the flesh</b> of the limbs <b>of the sin offering above</b> on the altar <b>as though they are</b> pieces of <b>wood</b> burned on the altar, not an offering. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One should wait until <b>the form of</b> all the intermingled limbs <b>decays and they will</b> all <b>go out to the place of burning</b> in the Temple courtyard, where all disqualified offerings of the most sacred order are burned.
Rabbi Yoḥanan continued: According to your opinion, <b>why</b> do the Rabbis say that the mixture is burned? <b>Let</b> the court <b>say</b> to the priest instead: <b>Arise and sin</b> by burning all the limbs on the altar, including the limbs of the sin offering, <b>in order that you may gain</b> by performing the mitzva of sacrificing the limbs of the burnt offering.
Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata answered Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>We do say: Arise and sin with a sin offering in order that you may gain with regard to a sin offering,</b> since it is the same type of offering. Similarly, one may sin with regard to the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> in order to gain with regard to the other sheep brought for the same offering. <b>We do not say: Arise and sin with a sin offering in order that you may gain with regard to a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, the Rabbis prohibit burning the limbs of the sin offering on the altar in order to allow for the burning of the limbs of the burnt offering.
Rabbi Yoḥanan asked Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata: <b>And does</b> the court actually <b>say:</b> Arise and sin in order that you may gain in a case where the sin and the gain are <b>with regard to one matter? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a case of the two <b>sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> where one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, or where he slaughtered them either before their time,</b> i.e., before <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>or after their time,</b> that <b>the blood shall be sprinkled,</b> although it shall be sprinkled for the sake of a peace offering, <b>and the meat shall be eaten.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan continued: <b>And if</b> the Festival <b>was</b> on <b>Shabbat, one may not sprinkle</b> the blood, the sacrificial portions may not be burned on the altar, and the meat may not be eaten. This is because the improper slaughter of the sheep disqualified them as communal offerings, whereas individual offerings may not be sacrificed on Shabbat. <b>But if</b> the priest nevertheless <b>sprinkled</b> the blood of these sheep on Shabbat, the offering <b>is accepted</b> in that it is permitted <b>to burn</b> its sacrificial <b>portions</b> on the altar <b>in the evening,</b> after the conclusion of Shabbat, and then the meat may be eaten.
Rabbi Yoḥanan concluded his proof: <b>But</b> according to your opinion, <b>why</b> is it not permitted to sprinkle the blood on Shabbat? <b>Let</b> the court <b>say: Arise</b> and <b>sin</b> by sprinkling the blood of these offerings <b>in order that you may gain</b> by being able to burn their sacrificial portions in the evening and then eat their meat.
Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata answered: <b>We do say: Arise and sin on Shabbat in order that you may gain on Shabbat. We do not say: Arise and sin on Shabbat in order that you may gain on a weekday.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>with regard to two</b> separate <b>matters</b> the court does <b>not say</b> that one should sin with regard to one in order to gain with regard to other? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:9): In the case of <b>a barrel of</b> wine that is <b><i>teruma</i> that broke in the upper</b> section of a <b>winepress, and in the lower</b> section of the winepress there is <b>non-sacred, impure</b> wine, and the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will flow into the lower press and become impure, <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> both <b>concede that if one is able to rescue</b> even <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of</b> the wine that is <i>teruma</i> in a pure vessel so that it retains its <b>ritual purity, he</b> should <b>rescue</b> it, even if, in the process, the rest of the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will mix with the non-sacred wine. This will cause the owner a financial loss, because the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will become impure, causing the entire mixture to become prohibited for consumption.
<b>But if not,</b> i.e., one cannot save any of the wine that is <i>teruma</i>, e.g., if one does not have any pure vessels in which to collect it, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b>

Daf 48b

The <i>teruma</i> wine should be allowed to <b>descend and become impure</b> on its own, ruining the non-sacred wine in the lower press, <b>but one</b> should <b>not render it impure through</b> his direct <b>action</b> by catching it in an impure vessel, even though catching it would prevent the wine that is <i>teruma</i> from mixing with his impure, non-sacred wine. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> Since the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will become impure in any event, <b>one</b> may <b>even render it impure through</b> his direct <b>action</b> in order to save his non-sacred wine. This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehoshua it is permitted to sin with regard to one matter, i.e., the wine that is <i>teruma</i>, in order to gain with regard to another matter, i.e., the non-sacred wine.
The Gemara responds: It <b>is different there,</b> in the case of the wine, <b>because</b> the wine that is <i>teruma</i> <b>is going to</b> become <b>impure</b> in any event. Consequently, his action is not considered a sin, and this is not a case of sinning with regard to one matter in order to gain in another.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>When Rav Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he reported traditions that he learned in Eretz Yisrael, and <b>he taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a case of the two <b>sheep</b> of <b><i>Shavuot</i> where one slaughtered them not in accordance with their mitzva,</b> e.g., he slaughtered them for the sake of a different offering, they are <b>disqualified; and</b> they should be left overnight until <b>their form decays</b> and they attain the status of leftover sacrificial meat, <b>and</b> then <b>they are brought out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> to Rav Yitzḥak: The <b>Master,</b> i.e., Rav Yitzḥak, <b>who compares</b> the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>to a sin offering</b> because they are juxtaposed in a verse (see Leviticus 23:19), <b>teaches:</b> The sheep are <b>disqualified,</b> like a sin offering that was slaughtered not for its own sake. By contrast, the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Levi, who derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an obligatory peace offering,</b> e.g., the two sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a voluntary peace offering, teaches</b> that the two sheep remain <b>valid</b> offerings, just as a voluntary peace offering remains valid even if it is slaughtered for the sake of a different offering.
<b>As Levi teaches: And</b> with regard to the <b>other peace offerings of a nazirite that one slaughtered not in accordance with their mitzva,</b> they are <b>valid</b> offerings like voluntary peace offerings, <b>but they do not satisfy the obligation of the owner</b> to bring the required nazirite peace offerings. <b>And</b> these offerings <b>are eaten for</b> only <b>one day and one night,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> concerning the peace offerings of nazirite, and not for two days and one night like voluntary peace offerings. They <b>require neither bread nor</b> the <b>foreleg,</b> unlike the required peace offering of a nazirite.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Yitzḥak from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where one is obligated to sacrifice as <b>a guilt offering</b> an animal <b>in its</b> first <b>year,</b> which the Torah calls a lamb, <b>and</b> instead he <b>brought</b> an animal <b>in its second</b> year, which is considered a ram; or if he is obligated to sacrifice as a guilt offering an animal <b>in its second</b> year <b>and he brought</b> an animal <b>in its</b> first <b>year;</b> the offerings are <b>disqualified.</b> They are to be left overnight until <b>their form decays, and are brought out to the place</b> designated for <b>burning.</b>
<b>But</b> in the case of <b>the burnt offering of a nazirite,</b> i.e., the lamb that is sacrificed when he completes his naziriteship; <b>or the burnt offering of a woman after childbirth,</b> i.e., the lamb she sacrifices on the forty-first day after giving birth to a son or on the eighty-first day after giving birth to a daughter; <b>or the burnt offering of a leper,</b> i.e., the lamb that is sacrificed after he is purified; in all of these cases if the animals <b>were in their second year</b> instead, <b>and one slaughtered them,</b> the offerings are <b>valid.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>The principle of the matter</b> is: <b>Any</b> animal <b>that is valid as a voluntary burnt offering is</b> also <b>valid as an obligatory burnt offering, and any</b> animal <b>that is disqualified as a sin offering is</b> also <b>disqualified as a guilt offering, except for</b> an offering that was sacrificed <b>not for its own sake,</b> which is disqualified in the case of a sin offering but not a guilt offering. This demonstrates that the <i>halakhot</i> of obligatory burnt offerings are derived from those of voluntary burnt offerings, despite the fact that the burnt offering of a nazirite is juxtaposed to the sin offering of a nazirite (see Numbers 6:14) and the burnt offering of a leper is juxtaposed to the sin offering of a leper (see Leviticus 14:19). Similarly, the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>, which are obligatory peace offerings, should be derived from the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to voluntary peace offerings, and not from the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to a sin offering as Rav Yitzḥak holds.
The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>tanna</i>,</b> who taught this <i>baraita</i>, <b>is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Levi</b> cited earlier, who holds that if one slaughters a sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> not for its own sake, it is nevertheless valid.
The Gemara discusses the opinion of Rav Naḥman, who maintains that the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Levi holds that a sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> slaughtered not for its own sake is valid because he derives its <i>halakha</i> from that of a voluntary peace offering. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what Levi teaches to the contrary, <b>as Levi teaches: The guilt offering of a nazirite,</b> i.e., the lamb he brings on the eighth day after becoming impure through contact with a corpse, <b>and the guilt offering of a leper,</b> i.e., the lamb he brings at the completion of his purification, <b>that one slaughtered not for their sake are valid, but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b>
If <b>one slaughtered them</b> when the <b>time had not yet</b> arrived <b>for</b> their <b>owners</b> to sacrifice these offerings, <b>or they were in their second year</b> instead of their first year <b>and one slaughtered them,</b> they are <b>disqualified.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>But if it is so</b> that Levi derives the <i>halakhot</i> of an obligatory offering from those of a voluntary one, <b>let him derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the guilt offering <b>from</b> that of the <b>peace offering,</b> in which case the guilt offerings should be valid even if they were in their second year. The Gemara answers: Levi <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning an obligatory <b>peace offering from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning a voluntary <b>peace offering,</b> but <b>he does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a guilt offering from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a peace offering.</b>
The Gemara further challenges the statement of Rav Naḥman: <b>But if</b> Levi <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an obligatory <b>peace offering from</b> that of a voluntary <b>peace offering, let him</b> similarly <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>guilt offering from</b> that of another <b>guilt offering.</b> He should derive that <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper</b> are valid even if the animal is in its second year <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a guilt offering for robbery and a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property, which are supposed to be a ram in its second year. <b>Or,</b> if one brought a lamb in its first year as <b>a guilt offering for robbery or a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property, Levi should derive that it is valid <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper,</b> which are lambs in their first year.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: One can derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an item that is</b> prepared <b>not in its valid manner,</b> e.g., the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> that were slaughtered not for their own sake, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to another <b>item that is</b> prepared <b>not in its valid manner,</b> e.g., a voluntary peace offering slaughtered not for its own sake. <b>But one cannot derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an item that is</b> prepared <b>not in its valid manner,</b> e.g., the guilt offering of a nazirite or a leper that is sacrificed when it is in its second year, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an item that is</b> prepared <b>in its valid manner,</b> e.g., a guilt offering for robbery or for misuse of consecrated property that is sacrificed when it is in its second year.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> can one <b>not</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to disqualified offerings from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to fit offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> an item that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard and was thereby disqualified <b>that if</b> it nevertheless <b>ascended</b> upon the altar <b>it shall not descend?</b> It is derived from the fact <b>that</b> an item that <b>left is valid</b> for sacrifice <b>on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> Here, the <i>baraita</i> derives the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an disqualified offering from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a fit offering.

Daf 49a

The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the phrase: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering [<i>ha’ola</i>]:</b> It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning” (Leviticus 6:2), a seemingly superfluous general phrase which is interpreted homiletically to <b>include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that any item that ascends [<i>ola</i>] upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. The verse is the actual source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely in support of this ruling. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> does not contradict the opinion of Rav Shimi bar Ashi.
§ The Gemara cites another discussion concerning the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav:</b> In a case of <b>the</b> two <b>sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> where one slaughtered them for the sake of rams</b> and not for their own sake, <b>they are valid</b> offerings, <b>but they do not satisfy the obligation of the owner,</b> i.e., the community, to sacrifice these offerings. <b>Rav said to</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana: That is not so; rather, the sheep <b>certainly satisfy</b> the obligation of the community.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: The statement of Rav is reasonable in</b> a case where <b>one thought</b> that they were <b>rams</b> when he slaughtered them, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>slaughtered them for the sake of lambs.</b> In such a case, it makes sense that they satisfy the community’s obligation <b>since</b> the <b>lambs were slaughtered for the sake of lambs.</b>
<b>But</b> in a case where <b>he thought</b> that they were <b>rams</b> when he slaughtered them, <b>and</b> therefore <b>slaughtered them for the sake of rams,</b> they do <b>not</b> satisfy the community’s obligation, even though they were actually lambs. This is due to the fact that the <b>erroneous uprooting</b> of the status of an offering <b>constitutes uprooting,</b> despite the fact that it was done in error. <b>But Rabba said:</b> The <b>erroneous uprooting</b> of the status of an offering <b>does not constitute uprooting.</b>
<b>Rava said: We raise an objection to our</b> own ruling concerning this <b><i>halakha</i></b> from that which was taught in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 54a): In a case of <b>priests who disqualified</b> an offering <b>through improper intention in the Temple,</b> by expressing, while sacrificing the offering, the intention to eat it after the appropriate time, if they did so <b>intentionally, they are liable</b> to pay the value of the offering to its owner, who must now bring another offering. It follows, <b>therefore,</b> that if the priests did so <b>unintentionally they are exempt. And</b> it <b>is taught concerning this</b> case in a <i>baraita</i>: Even though they slaughtered it with improper intent unintentionally, <b>their</b> act of <b>improper intention</b> renders the offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> despite the fact that they are exempt from paying damages.
<b>What are the circumstances</b> in which this is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a case where the priest <b>knew that</b> the offering <b>was a sin offering,</b> which is eaten for only one day and one night, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>he intended</b> the offering to be <b>for the sake of a peace offering,</b> which is eaten for two days and one night, and thereby his intention was that it be eaten after its appropriate time, is <b>this</b> considered <b>an unintentional</b> act by the priests? Certainly <b>they were</b> acting <b>intentionally.</b>
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where the offering was a sin offering, which is eaten for only one day and one night, and the priest <b>thought that it was a peace offering and</b> therefore <b>he intended</b> the offering to be <b>for the sake of a peace offering,</b> which is eaten for two days and one night, and thereby his intention was that it be eaten after its appropriate time? <b>And</b> with regard to this case the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: Their</b> act of <b>improper intention</b> renders the offering <b><i>piggul</i>. Apparently,</b> this proves that the <b>erroneous uprooting</b> of the status of an offering <b>constitutes uprooting,</b> contrary to the ruling of Rabba.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: There is no objection from this <i>baraita</i>, because <b>actually</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>knew that it</b> was <b>a sin offering and</b> nevertheless <b>he intended</b> the offering to be <b>for the sake of a peace offering,</b> and his uprooting was done intentionally. Nevertheless, the <i>baraita</i> refers to the priests as acting unintentionally because it is referring to circumstances <b>where</b> the priest <b>says,</b> i.e., he mistakenly thinks, that it is <b>permitted</b> to sacrifice the offering with this intent.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> to Rabba’s opinion that erroneous uprooting of the status of an offering does not constitute uprooting. A <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All meal offerings</b> from which <b>the handful was removed not for their sake are</b> entirely <b>valid, and have</b> even <b>satisfied the obligation of the owner,</b> unlike animal offerings slaughtered not for their sake, which do not satisfy the obligation of the owner.
This is <b>because meal offerings are not similar to animal offerings. As,</b> in the case of <b>one who removes a handful</b> from a meal offering prepared in a shallow <b>pan for the sake of</b> a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan, its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is a shallow-<b>pan</b> meal offering and not a deep-pan meal offering. Since a meal offering prepared in a shallow pan is hard and one prepared in a deep pan is soft, his intention is plainly false. Similarly, if one removes a handful from <b>a dry</b> meal offering, the meal offering of a sinner, which has no oil, <b>for the sake of</b> a meal offering <b>mixed</b> with oil, his intention is plainly false, as <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is <b>a dry</b> meal offering.
<b>But with regard to animal offerings</b> this <b>is not so.</b> There is <b>one</b> mode of <b>slaughter for all of</b> the offerings, <b>one</b> mode of <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>for all of them,</b> and <b>one</b> mode of <b>sprinkling for all of them.</b> Since the only factor that distinguishes between one type of offering and another is the intention of the individuals involved in its sacrifice, their intention is significant. Consequently, if one of the sacrificial rites is performed for the sake of the wrong type of offering, the offering does not satisfy its owner’s obligation.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> to which Rabbi Shimon is referring? <b>If we say</b> that he is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>knew that</b> the meal offering <b>was</b> prepared in a shallow <b>pan, and</b> nevertheless <b>he removed a handful</b> from it <b>for the sake of</b> a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan,</b> then although <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> that it was prepared in a shallow pan, <b>what of it?</b> In any case <b>he is</b> consciously <b>uprooting</b> its status as a shallow-pan meal offering, changing it to a deep-pan meal offering by means of his intention when he removes the handful.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>thought it was</b> a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan and</b> therefore <b>removed a handful for the sake of</b> a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan, but he was mistaken,</b> as it was actually a meal offering prepared in a shallow pan? <b>It is</b> specifically <b>here,</b> in this case, that Rabbi Shimon rules that the offering remains valid, <b>since its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is a shallow-pan meal offering, which indicates <b>that in general, erroneous uprooting</b> of the status of an offering <b>constitutes uprooting,</b> contrary the ruling of Rabba.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Zeira, in response to his objection: This objection to Rabba’s opinion is inconclusive, because one can explain that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>knew that</b> the meal offering <b>was</b> prepared in a shallow <b>pan, and</b> nevertheless <b>he removed a handful for the sake of</b> a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan.</b>
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said</b> in your question: Although <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is prepared in a shallow pan, <b>what of it,</b> i.e., since he is consciously uprooting its identity, how can it satisfy its owner’s obligation? Abaye answers that <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says: The Merciful One disqualifies</b> an offering due to improper <b>intent that is not recognizably</b> false, i.e., when the physical properties of the offering itself do not prove that the intent is mistaken. <b>The Merciful One does not disqualify</b> an offering due to improper <b>intent that is recognizably</b> false. Consequently, if one removes a handful from a shallow-pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, even if he did so consciously, the offering remains valid and satisfies the owner’s obligation.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Failure to sacrifice <b>the daily offerings does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the additional offerings, and</b> likewise, failure to sacrifice <b>the additional offerings does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the daily offerings. And</b> failure to sacrifice some of <b>the additional offerings</b> on a day when more than one is sacrificed, e.g., if it was both Shabbat and the New Moon, <b>does not prevent</b> sacrifice of the <b>other</b> additional offerings. If the priests <b>did not sacrifice a lamb in the morning</b> as the daily offering, nevertheless, <b>they should sacrifice</b> a lamb <b>in the afternoon</b> as the daily offering, as failure to sacrifice one daily offering does not prevent sacrifice of the other. In all of these cases, if they failed to sacrifice one offering, they should still sacrifice the other.
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: When</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply? It applies <b>at a time when</b> the failure to sacrifice the daily morning offering was because <b>they were</b> prevented from sacrificing it due to <b>circumstances beyond their control or</b> they failed to sacrifice it <b>unwittingly. But if</b> the priests acted <b>intentionally and did not sacrifice a lamb in the morning</b> as the daily offering, <b>they should not sacrifice</b> a lamb <b>in the afternoon</b> as the daily offering.
Incense was burned twice a day, half a measure in the morning and half a measure in the afternoon. If <b>they did not burn</b> the half-measure of <b>incense in the morning, they should burn</b> the half-measure <b>in the afternoon.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: And</b> in such a case, <b>the entire</b> measure <b>was sacrificed in the afternoon.</b> The reason for the difference between the daily offerings and the incense is <b>that</b> the daily service on a new <b>golden altar is initiated only with</b> the burning of <b>the incense of the spices</b> in the afternoon, at which time they would burn a full measure. <b>And the</b> daily service on a new <b>altar of the burnt offering,</b> on which the daily offerings were sacrificed, is initiated <b>only with the daily morning offering. And</b> use of a new <b>Table</b> was initiated <b>only with</b> the arrangement of <b>the shewbread on Shabbat, and</b> use of a new <b>Candelabrum</b> was initiated <b>only with</b> the kindling <b>of its seven lamps in the afternoon.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the daily offerings and the additional offerings each do not prevent fulfillment of the mitzva with the other. Concerning this, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda:</b> In the case of <b>a community that did not have</b> the resources to sacrifice both <b>the daily offerings and the additional offerings, which of them takes precedence</b> over the other?
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> to which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin is referring? <b>If we say</b> that he is referring to a case where the choice is between <b>the daily offerings of that day and the additional offerings of that</b> same <b>day,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that <b>the daily offerings are given preference, as</b> the sacrifice of the daily offerings <b>is</b> more <b>frequent</b> than the sacrifice of the additional offerings, which are sacrificed only on special occasions, <b>and</b> the daily offerings are also <b>sanctified.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin must be referring to a case where they have enough animals for the daily offerings of today and also for either <b>the daily offerings for tomorrow or the additional offerings for today.</b> In such a case, are <b>the daily offerings given preference since</b> their sacrifice is more <b>frequent? Or perhaps the additional offerings are given preference because they are</b> considered more <b>sanctified</b> because they are sacrificed on a holy day.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: The resolution to this dilemma can be derived from that which <b>you learned</b> in the mishna: Failure to sacrifice <b>the daily offerings does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the additional offerings, and</b> likewise, failure to sacrifice <b>the additional offerings does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the daily offerings. And</b> failure to sacrifice some of <b>the additional offerings does not prevent</b> sacrifice of the <b>other</b> additional offerings.
<b>What are the circumstances</b> to which the mishna is referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a case where the Temple treasury <b>has</b> all of the animals necessary for both offerings, <b>and</b> the only question is <b>in</b> terms of sacrificing one <b>before</b> the other, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that no</b> sacrifice <b>should precede</b> the sacrifice of the <b>daily offering of morning?</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: It is derived from that which <b>the verse states:</b> “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; <b>and he shall lay the burnt offering in order on it,</b> and shall cause the fats of the peace offering to go up in smoke upon it” (Leviticus 6:5).
<b>And Rava says</b> in explanation of this derivation in the <i>baraita</i> that the term <b>“the burnt offering,”</b> with the definite article, is referring to <b>the first burnt offering</b> of the day, which is the daily offering. Consequently, one may not sacrifice the additional offerings before the daily offering.

Daf 49b

<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he does not have</b> a sufficient number of animals for both offerings. <b>And if</b> it is referring to the offerings <b>of that day, why</b> does the mishna say that failure to sacrifice one does not prevent sacrifice of the other? Since the daily offering is more <b>frequent</b> and it is sanctified, <b>and</b> the additional offerings are <b>sanctified</b> but are less frequent than the daily offering, the <b>frequent</b> offering <b>are given preference.</b> Consequently, failure to sacrifice the daily offering should prevent the sacrifice of the additional offerings.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where the Temple treasury does not have enough animals for both the additional offerings of today and the daily offering <b>of tomorrow, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that failure to sacrifice one does <b>not prevent</b> one from sacrificing <b>the other? Evidently, they are equal</b> and he may sacrifice whichever offering he chooses. This would resolve Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin’s dilemma.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: That is not a valid resolution of the dilemma, as one can claim that <b>actually,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where they have</b> enough animals for all the offerings, <b>and</b> the mishna is referring to the issue of sacrificing one <b>before</b> the other. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which</b> poses <b>a difficulty for you</b> based upon the <i>baraita</i> that states that <b>no</b> sacrifice <b>should precede</b> the sacrifice of the daily offering of the morning, that <i>baraita</i> <b>is merely</b> stating <b>the mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin’s dilemma based upon a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 13a): One maintains <b>no fewer than six lambs that</b> have been <b>inspected</b> and found to be unblemished <b>in the Chamber of the Lambs, sufficient for Shabbat and for the two festival days of Rosh HaShana</b> that in some years occur adjacent to it.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> it is referring to a case where the Temple treasury <b>has</b> enough animals for all of the offerings that should be brought, six lambs are not enough, as <b>there are many</b> lambs sacrificed for <b>daily offerings and additional offerings</b> on those three days. In total, twenty-two lambs are required: Two each day for the daily offerings, two for the additional offering of Shabbat, seven for the additional offering of Rosh HaShana, and seven for the additional offering of the New Moon.
<b>Rather, is it not that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where the Temple treasury <b>does not have</b> enough animals for all of the offerings, and it is teaching that the animals that he does have are utilized for the daily offerings of all three days rather than for the additional offering of Shabbat on the first of the three days? Consequently, one may <b>conclude from it</b> that the <b>daily offerings</b> of tomorrow <b>are given preference</b> over the additional offerings of today.
The Gemara replies: <b>No,</b> this is not a valid proof, as one can claim that <b>actually,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the Temple treasury <b>has</b> enough animals for all of the offerings of the three days, <b>and this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying</b> when it mentions six lambs: One maintains for use as daily offerings <b>no fewer than six lambs that</b> have been <b>inspected</b> and found to be unblemished <b>in the Chamber of the Lambs four days prior to</b> their <b>slaughter.</b> Lambs sacrificed as other offerings do not have to be inspected four days prior to being slaughtered. <b>And</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Bag Bag says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the daily offering requires inspection four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter? The verse states</b> with regard to the daily offering: <b>“You shall observe [<i>tishmeru</i>] to sacrifice to Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2), <b>and elsewhere,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, the verse <b>states:</b> “On the tenth day of this month they shall take for them every man a lamb…<b>and you shall keep it [<i>mishmeret</i>] until the fourteenth day</b> of this month” (Exodus 12:3–6).
Consequently, it is derived by means of a verbal analogy that <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>there,</b> the Paschal offering <b>requires inspection four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> from the tenth of the month to the fourteenth, <b>so too here,</b> the daily offering <b>requires inspection four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> This is not a requirement that pertains to all offerings; it is stated specifically with regard to the Paschal offering and extended by means of a verbal analogy to the daily offering.
§ The Gemara cites a discussion pertaining to the mishna cited earlier. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to <b>these six</b> inspected lambs that must always be kept in the Chamber of Lambs, there ought to <b>be seven, as there is</b> a need for another lamb for the daily offering <b>of the morning of the third</b> day <b>of the week,</b> since it cannot be inspected on Shabbat or the subsequent festival days of Rosh HaShana, and therefore should be inspected and kept beforehand.
Rav Ashi responded to Ravina: <b>According to your reasoning</b> the correct number is not seven, but rather <b>it is eight; as there is</b> also the daily offering <b>of the afternoon of Shabbat eve</b> that should also be counted.
Ravina replied: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> because the mishna <b>is saying that after he sacrificed</b> the daily offering of the afternoon there must be six inspected lambs.

Daf 50a

The Gemara asks: <b>In any case,</b> the question stands: Why does the mishna say six lambs when, in fact the number required <b>is seven?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the <i>tanna</i> is</b> speaking <b>generally,</b> referring to how many inspected lambs are required throughout the year. <b>And what</b> did he mean by his statement: <b>Sufficient for Shabbat and for the two festival days of Rosh HaShana?</b> It is <b>merely</b> intended as <b>a mnemonic,</b> to help one remember that there must be enough lambs for the daily offering of three days.
According to this the language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as</b> it <b>teaches: Sufficient for Shabbat</b> and for the two festival days of Rosh HaShana, <b>and it does not teach</b> that there must be six lambs <b>for Shabbat and for the two festival days of Rosh HaShana,</b> which would have indicated that these lambs are meant to actually be sacrificed on those days. The Gemara concludes that in fact one can <b>learn from</b> the language of the mishna that this is the correct interpretation.
§ The mishna teaches: If the priests <b>did not sacrifice a lamb in the morning</b> as the daily offering, nevertheless, they should sacrifice a lamb in the afternoon as the daily offering. If they did not burn the half-measure of incense in the morning, they should burn the half-measure in the afternoon. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: And</b> in such a case, <b>the entire</b> measure <b>was sacrificed in the afternoon, as</b> the daily service on a new <b>golden altar is initiated only with</b> the burning of <b>the incense of the spices</b> in the afternoon, at which time they would burn a full measure. The Gemara asks: <b>Who mentioned anything about</b> the <b>initiation</b> of the Temple vessels, i.e., what is its relevance to the mishna?
The Gemara answers that the mishna <b>is incomplete, and this is</b> what <b>it is teaching:</b> If <b>they did not sacrifice a lamb</b> for the daily offering <b>in the morning, they should not sacrifice</b> a lamb in <b>the afternoon. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the service of a new <b>altar had not</b> yet <b>been initiated,</b> since it must first be initiated with the daily offering of the morning. <b>But</b> if the service of <b>the altar had</b> already <b>been initiated,</b> then <b>they should sacrifice</b> the lamb of the daily offering in <b>the afternoon</b> even though they did not sacrifice the lamb of the morning offering.
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: When</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply? It applies <b>at a time when</b> the failure to sacrifice the daily morning offering was because <b>they were</b> prevented from sacrificing it due to <b>circumstances beyond their control or</b> they failed to sacrifice it <b>unwittingly. But if</b> the priests acted <b>intentionally and did not sacrifice a lamb in the morning</b> as the daily offering, <b>they should not sacrifice</b> a lamb <b>in the afternoon</b> as the daily offering. By contrast, if <b>they did not burn</b> the half-measure of <b>incense in the morning, they should burn</b> the half-measure <b>in the afternoon</b> regardless of the circumstances.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that if the lamb of the daily offering of the morning was not sacrificed and the service of a new altar had not yet been initiated, then the lamb of the afternoon is also not sacrificed? The Gemara explains that it is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; <b>and the second lamb you shall offer in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 29:39). This verse teaches that <b>the second</b> lamb of the daily offering is sacrificed <b>in the afternoon, but</b> if it is <b>the first</b> one to be sacrificed, it may <b>not</b> be sacrificed <b>in the afternoon.</b>
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the service of a new <b>altar had not</b> yet <b>been initiated,</b> since it must first be initiated with the offering of the morning. When the verse refers to the first or second offering, it means the first or second offering ever sacrificed on the altar. <b>But</b> if the service of <b>the altar had</b> already <b>been initiated,</b> then <b>even</b> if it is <b>the first</b> to be sacrificed that day, it should be sacrificed <b>in the afternoon.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: When</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply? It applies <b>at a time when</b> the failure to sacrifice the daily morning offering was because <b>they were</b> prevented from sacrificing it due to <b>circumstances beyond their control or</b> they failed to sacrifice it <b>unwittingly. But if</b> the priests acted <b>intentionally and did not sacrifice a lamb in the morning</b> as the daily offering, <b>they should not sacrifice</b> a lamb <b>in the afternoon</b> as the daily offering. By contrast, if <b>they did not burn</b> the half-measure of <b>incense in the morning, they should burn</b> the half-measure <b>in the afternoon</b> regardless of the circumstances.
The Gemara asks: Does it make sense that <b>because the priests sinned</b> by intentionally failing to sacrifice the morning daily offering, <b>the altar</b> should be entirely <b>idle? Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying: They,</b> the priests who deliberately failed to sacrifice the morning daily offering, <b>should not sacrifice</b> the afternoon daily offering; <b>but other</b> priests <b>should sacrifice</b> it.
By contrast, if the priests acted intentionally and <b>did not burn</b> the <b>incense in the morning,</b> even those same priests <b>may burn</b> it in the <b>afternoon.</b> The reason for this is <b>that since</b> burning the incense <b>is uncommon and causes</b> those who do so to become <b>wealthy,</b> it is <b>dear to the</b> priests, <b>and they will not be negligent</b> in the performance of this rite.
§The mishna teaches that if they did not burn the half-measure of incense in the morning, they should burn the half-measure in the afternoon. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: And</b> in such a case, <b>the entire</b> measure <b>was sacrificed in the afternoon.</b> The reason for the difference between the daily offerings and the incense is <b>that</b> the daily service on a new <b>golden altar is initiated only with</b> the burning of <b>the incense of the spices of the afternoon,</b> at which time they would burn a full measure. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The service of a new golden altar is initiated <b>with</b> the burning of <b>the incense of the spices of the morning?</b> The Gemara answers: The question of whether the incense of the morning or the afternoon initiates the service of a new golden altar <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> It <b>stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> should be <b>in accordance with the one who says</b> that it was initiated <b>with the incense of the spices of the afternoon, as it is written</b> with regard to the golden altar: “And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices; <b>every morning, when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn it.</b> And when Aaron lights the lamps at dusk, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:7–8).
The fact that ashes are removed from the lamps of the Candelabrum in the morning indicates that the lamps had been lit previously, since <b>if</b> the priest had <b>not performed the lighting</b> of the lamps the previous <b>evening, from where</b> would the ashes be <b>removed in the morning?</b> This proves that the Candelabrum must have been lit for the first time in the evening. Since the verse states: “When Aaron lights the lamps at dusk, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the Lord,” it must be that the incense was burned for the first time in the evening.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that the service of a new golden altar is initiated <b>with</b> the burning of <b>the incense of the spices of the morning,</b> from where is this <i>halakha</i> derived? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the initiation of <b>the altar of the burnt offering. Just as there,</b> the service of a new altar of the burnt offering is initiated <b>by</b> means of the <b>daily offering of the morning</b> rather than the afternoon, <b>so too here,</b> the service of a new golden altar is initiated <b>by</b> means of the burning of <b>the incense of the spices of the morning.</b>
§The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> use of a new <b>Table</b> was initiated <b>only with</b> the arrangement of <b>the shewbread on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does the mishna mean to indicate that if the shewbread was placed on the Table <b>on a weekday it is</b> merely that the use of a new Table <b>is not initiated, but</b> the shewbread <b>is sanctified?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that the shewbread is sanctified only when it is placed on the Table on Shabbat.
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>teaches us this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>itself, that the initiation</b> of the use of a new Table <b>and the sanctification of</b> the shewbread when it is placed on <b>the Table</b> occur only <b>on Shabbat.</b> This is <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> with regard to the initiation of the use of a new Candelabrum: <b>And</b> use of a new <b>Candelabrum</b> was initiated <b>only with</b> the kindling <b>of its seven lamps in the afternoon.</b>
§The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> relating to the burning of incense. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is incense that was offered for an individual</b> rather than the community <b>on the external altar,</b> and not on the golden altar as usual; <b>and this was a provisional edict,</b> permitted temporarily for that time only. The Gemara clarifies: To <b>what</b> case is the <i>baraita</i> referring? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is referring to the incense brought <b>by the</b> tribal <b>princes</b> at the inauguration of the Tabernacle (see Numbers, chapter 7).
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to the incense of <b>an individual, is it</b> only <b>on the external altar that</b> it is <b>not</b> generally permitted to be burned, <b>but</b> an individual <b>may sacrifice</b> incense <b>on the inner altar,</b> as indicated by the <i>baraita</i>? <b>And furthermore, on the external altar, is it</b> only an <b>individual who may not</b> sacrifice incense, <b>but the community may sacrifice</b> incense on the external altar?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> contrary to those two inferences: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an individual may voluntarily donate and bring</b> incense <b>similar to</b> the incense brought by the tribal princes to the Temple as <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>and I</b> will <b>read with regard to</b> this incense, as in the case of other gift offerings: <b>“That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:24). Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> concerning the inner altar: <b>“You shall bring no strange incense thereon”</b> (Exodus 30:9). This indicates that an individual may not sacrifice incense even on the inner altar.
One <b>might</b> have thought that only <b>an individual may not bring</b> a gift of incense on the inner altar, <b>as</b> an individual <b>does not bring his obligatory</b> offering <b>similar to this</b> gift of incense, i.e., since an individual is never obligated to sacrifice incense, he may not voluntarily sacrifice incense either;

Daf 50b

<b>but a community may bring</b> incense as a gift offering, <b>as</b> the community <b>does bring its obligatory</b> offering <b>similar to this,</b> i.e., since the community is obligated to sacrifice incense it can also voluntarily sacrifice incense. Therefore, <b>the verse states: You shall not bring [<i>lo ta’alu</i>]</b> strange incense thereon” (Exodus 30:9). The fact that the verse formulates the prohibition with the plural word <i>ta’alu</i> indicates that even the community may not sacrifice incense as a voluntary gift offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that the community <b>may not bring</b> a gift offering of incense <b>on the inner altar, but</b> it <b>may bring</b> incense <b>on the external altar.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the sacred place; according to all that I have commanded you shall they do”</b> (Exodus 31:11). This teaches that one <b>has</b> the right to do <b>only that which is stated with regard to the matter,</b> without deviation. Consequently, incense may sacrificed only by the community, only when there is an obligation to sacrifice it, and it must be burned only on the inner altar. This contradicts the implication of the previously cited <i>baraita</i> that it is permitted to burn the incense of an individual on the golden altar or the incense of a community on the outer altar.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is not problematic. The <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows. <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that <b>the community</b> may not sacrifice incense <b>on the external altar, as we have not found</b> a precedent for it. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is not necessary</b> to state that <b>an individual</b> may not sacrifice incense <b>on the inner altar, as we have not found</b> a precedent for it. <b>But</b> it is necessary to state that it is <b>even</b> prohibited for <b>an individual</b> to sacrifice incense <b>on the external altar,</b> despite the fact <b>that we have</b> ostensibly <b>found</b> a precedent for it <b>in</b> the case of <b>the</b> tribal <b>princes;</b> as that <b>was a provisional edict</b> and therefore cannot serve as a precedent.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The twelve loaves of <i>matza</i> prepared from a tenth of an ephah of flour of the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest did not come</b> from the house of the High Priest <b>in halves. Rather,</b> the High Priest <b>brings</b> from his house <b>a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of flour (see Leviticus 6:13) <b>and divides it</b> in half, and he <b>sacrifices half in the morning and half in the afternoon.</b>
In the case of a High <b>Priest who brings</b> and sacrifices <b>half in the morning and dies, and they appointed another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead,</b> the replacement High Priest <b>should neither bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>from his house nor</b> sacrifice the remaining <b>half of</b> the <b>tenth of an ephah of</b> his <b>predecessor. Rather, he brings</b> from his house <b>an entire tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and divides it</b> in half, <b>sacrifices half, and</b> the other <b>half</b> is not sacrificed and <b>is lost. Consequently, two halves</b> of a tenth of an ephah <b>are sacrificed,</b> one-half of what was brought by each priest, <b>and</b> the other <b>two halves are lost.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, commenting on the verse: “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord on the day when he is anointed: The tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). <b>If</b> the verse had <b>stated: A meal offering</b> perpetually, <b>half</b> in the morning and half in the evening; <b>I would have said</b> that the High Priest <b>brings half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the morning and sacrifices</b> it, and then he brings <b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the afternoon and sacrifices</b> it.
Since <b>the verse states: “Half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), it teaches that <b>he sacrifices half of a complete</b> tenth of an ephah. <b>How so?</b> The High Priest <b>brings</b> from his house <b>a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour, <b>and divides it</b> in half, <b>and sacrifices half in the morning and half in the afternoon.</b>
In a case where the <b>half of</b> a tenth of an ephah that was supposed to be offered in <b>the afternoon became impure or was lost</b> after the High Priest sacrificed the first half in the morning, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>from his house and sacrifice</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening,”</b> which teaches that <b>he brings half of a complete</b> tenth of an ephah.
<b>How so?</b> The High Priest <b>brings a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour <b>from his house and divides it</b> in half, <b>and he sacrifices half, and</b> the other <b>half</b> is not sacrificed and <b>is lost. Consequently, two halves</b> of a tenth of an ephah <b>are sacrificed,</b> the half that was sacrificed in the morning from the original tenth of an ephah, and half of the replacement tenth of an ephah, <b>and</b> the other <b>two halves are lost.</b>
In the case of a High <b>Priest who sacrificed half in the morning and died, and they appointed another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the second High Priest <b>should bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>from his house</b> and sacrifice it, <b>or</b> that he should sacrifice the remaining <b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>of the first</b> High Priest. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And half of it in the evening,”</b> which teaches that he <b>brings and sacrifices half of a complete</b> tenth of an ephah.
<b>How so?</b> The replacement High Priest <b>brings a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour <b>from his house and divides it</b> in half, <b>and he sacrifices</b> half, <b>and half</b> is not sacrificed and <b>is lost. Consequently, two halves</b> of a tenth of an ephah <b>are lost,</b> half of the tenth of an ephah brought by each priest, <b>and</b> the other <b>two halves are sacrificed.</b>
§ With regard to the two halves of a tenth of an ephah that are lost, <b>a <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., a Sage who recited <i>baraitot</i>, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>the half</b> that was not sacrificed by the <b>first</b> High Priest, who died, <b>and the half</b> brought but not sacrificed by the <b>second</b> High Priest who replaced him, <b>their form should decay,</b> i.e., they should be left overnight so they become disqualified, <b>and</b> then they should be <b>brought out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>Granted,</b> the half that was not sacrificed by the <b>first</b> High Priest should be left overnight before it is burned, because it was initially <b>fit for sacrifice</b> before the first High Priest died. <b>But</b> with regard to the half that was not sacrificed by the <b>second</b> High Priest, <b>why</b> must <b>it</b> be left overnight so that its <b>form decays?</b> It was <b>brought to be lost from the outset,</b> i.e., when the full tenth of an ephah was brought it was known that only half would be sacrificed and half would be lost. Consequently, it is unnecessary to leave it overnight before burning it.
Rav Naḥman continued: <b>Who is</b> the one <b>who said</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to you? It was the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabba bar Avuh, who says:</b> All disqualified offerings, <b>even <i>piggul</i>,</b> which is disqualified by Torah law, <b>require decay of form</b> before they are burned.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabba bar Avuh and hold that <i>piggul</i> does not require decay of form. Nevertheless, <b>since at the time when</b> the second High Priest <b>divides the</b> two halves, <b>if he wants</b> he can <b>sacrifice this</b> half, <b>and if he wants</b> he can <b>sacrifice that</b> other half, both halves are considered <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed and may not be burned until they are left overnight.
§ The Gemara cites that which <b>was stated</b> further about the griddle-cake offering: <b>How are the griddle-cake</b> offerings of <b>the High Priest prepared?</b> The verse seems to prescribe a variety of methods of preparation: “On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, you shall bring it in; and baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] of the meal offering shall you sacrifice for a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:14). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>bakes it</b> in an oven <b>and afterward he fries it</b> in a pan. <b>Rabbi Asi</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>fries it</b> in a pan <b>and afterward he bakes</b> it in an oven.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: It stands to reason in accordance with my</b> opinion because the verse states: “And baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] of the meal offering.” The word for <b>baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>]</b> should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>],</b> i.e., before being fried. <b>Rabbi Asi said: It stands to reason in accordance with my</b> opinion because the word <i>tufinei</i> should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are already <b>partially cooked [<i>te’afena na</i>],</b> i.e., after being fried.
This dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word for baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are already <b>partially cooked [<i>te’afena na</i>]. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>]. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The word <i>tufinei</i> is plural, indicating that the pieces <b>should be baked extensively,</b> i.e., more than once. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei <b>accepts</b> the opinion that the pieces should be baked when they are already <b>partially cooked, and he</b> also <b>accepts</b> the opinion that they should be baked when they are <b>beautiful.</b> Therefore the offering should first be baked, then fried, then baked again.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (96a): Concerning the twelve loaves of <b>the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, of which six are sacrificed in the morning and six in the evening, <b>their kneading, and forming of their</b> loaves, <b>and their baking are</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> all labors involved in those actions <b>override Shabbat.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> i.e., that these actions override Shabbat, derived? <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The verse says <b><i>tufinei</i>,</b> meaning that when it is already <b>baked it must</b> still <b>be beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>]. And if</b> one would <b>bake it yesterday,</b> on the eve of Shabbat, <b>it</b> would become <b>swollen [<i>inshefa</i>]</b> and no longer beautiful. <b>Rav Yosef objects to this:</b> If the purpose of baking them on Shabbat is to ensure they remain fresh, <b>say that</b> the loaves should be baked before Shabbat and <b>covered with greens</b> to preserve them.
The Gemara cites another explanation of why the preparation of these loaves overrides Shabbat. A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “On a griddle it <b>shall be made</b> with oil” (Leviticus 6:14), which teaches that it shall be made under all circumstances, <b>even on Shabbat.</b> Similarly, this phrase <b>“shall be made”</b> teaches that it should be made <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>
<b>Abaye said</b> that there is a different explanation: The <b>verse states: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually”</b> (Leviticus 6:13);

Daf 51a

this teaches that the <i>halakha</i> of the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>is like</b> that of <b>the meal offering</b> that is a component <b>of the daily offerings.</b> The daily offerings override Shabbat, as the verse says: “This is the burnt offering of every Shabbat, beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof” (Numbers 28:10). Therefore, preparing the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest likewise overrides Shabbat.
<b>Rava said</b> that the basis for it overriding Shabbat is the fact that the verse states: <b>“On a griddle”</b> (Leviticus 6:14), which <b>teaches that</b> the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>requires a vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>if he had baked it the previous day</b> rather than on Shabbat, it would be <b>disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight,</b> since the loaves had already been consecrated in a service vessel. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava: “On a griddle” teaches that</b> the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>requires a vessel.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The continuation of the verse states: “It shall be made <b>with the oil.”</b> The fact that the verse makes reference to “the oil” rather than just oil indicates that one is supposed <b>to add</b> extra <b>oil to it,</b> but <b>I do not know how much</b> oil to add.
Therefore <b>I</b> must <b>deduce</b> as follows: <b>It is stated here,</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Oil,” and it is stated there, with regard to the meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings: “A tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a <i>hin</i> of beaten <b>oil”</b> (Exodus 29:40). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the meal offering brought with the libations, the amount of oil required is <b>three <i>log</i> per tenth</b> of an ephah of flour; <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, one brings <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>per tenth</b> of an ephah of flour.
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way: It is stated here,</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Oil,” and it is stated with regard to</b> the <b>voluntary meal offering:</b> “And when anyone brings a meal offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour <b>oil</b> upon it” (Leviticus 2:1). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering, one brings <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour (see 88a); <b>so too here,</b> one brings <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour.
The <i>baraita</i> analyzes these two possibilities: <b>Let us see to which</b> case <b>it is</b> more <b>similar,</b> i.e., which is a better comparison to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest. Perhaps <b>we</b> should <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which has characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>tav</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>tet</i>, from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering brought with libations, which also has the characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>tav</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>tet</i>.</b> These characteristics are that they are <b>frequent [<i>tadir</i>],</b> as these offerings are sacrificed twice daily; they are <b>brought [<i>ba’ah</i>] as an obligation;</b> they <b>override Shabbat;</b> and they <b>override impurity [<i>tuma</i>].</b>
<b>And we should not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which has the characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>tav</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>tet</i>, from</b> the voluntary meal offering, which <b>does not</b> have the characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>tav</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>tet</i>.</b>
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way: We</b> should <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which has the characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>yod</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>lamed</i>, from</b> the voluntary meal offering, which also has the characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>yod</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>lamed</i>,</b> which stand for the following <i>halakhot</i>: Each of these offerings may be brought by <b>an individual [<i>yaḥid</i>];</b> each is <b>brought for [<i>biglal</i>] its own sake,</b> rather than accompanying another offering; they are not accompanied by <b>wine [<i>yayin</i>]</b> for a libation; and they require <b>frankincense [<i>levona</i>].</b>
<b>And we should not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which has the characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>yod</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>lamed</i>, from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the meal offering brought with libations, <b>which does not</b> have the characteristics represented by the letters <b><i>yod</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>lamed</i>.</b> Consequently, the comparisons in both directions are equally compelling.
The <i>baraita</i> continues its determination of how much oil is brought with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> “This is the offering of Aaron…the tenth part of an ephah of <b>fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>],</b> half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). The fact that the verse makes reference to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest as <i>tamid</i> teaches that <b>it is in</b> the same category as <b>the meal offering</b> component <b>of the daily offerings [<i>temidin</i>]. Just as the meal offering</b> component <b>of the daily offerings</b> requires <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>so too this</b> griddle-cake offering of the High Priest requires <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse <b>adds</b> to the amount of <b>oil</b> that is required <b>here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, <b>and</b> it similarly <b>adds</b> to the amount of <b>oil</b> that is required <b>there,</b> in the case of the <b>meal offering</b> that accompanies the sacrifice of <b>sheep. Just as there,</b> in the case of the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of sheep, <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil are required <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil are required <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour.
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way:</b> The verse <b>adds</b> to the amount of <b>oil</b> that is required <b>here,</b> and it similarly <b>adds</b> to the amount of <b>oil</b> that is required in the case of <b>the meal offering</b> that accompanies the sacrifice of <b>bulls and rams. Just as there,</b> in the case of the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of bulls and rams, <b>two <i>log</i></b> of oil are required <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, <b>two <i>log</i></b> of oil are required <b>for</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour.
With regard to these two possibilities, <b>let us see to which</b> case <b>it is</b> more <b>similar,</b> i.e., which is a better comparison to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest. Perhaps <b>we</b> should <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which is <b>a meal offering that comes</b> in the amount of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>from</b> the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of sheep, which is also <b>a meal offering that comes</b> in the amount of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour. <b>And we should not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a meal offering that comes</b> in the amount of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a meal offering that comes</b> in the amount of <b>two or three tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, such as the meal offerings that accompany the sacrifice of bulls and rams.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the beginning of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it contains an internal contradiction. First <b>you said</b> that the expression <b>“with the oil”</b> stated in the verse concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest serves <b>to add</b> extra <b>oil,</b> which indicates that more than the basic amount of one <i>log</i> of oil is required. <b>And then it teaches: It is stated here,</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Oil,” and it is stated with regard to</b> the <b>voluntary meal offering</b> that it must be brought with <b>“oil.”</b> The <i>baraita</i> suggests that just as one <i>log</i> of oil is brought with the voluntary meal offering, so too one <i>log</i> is brought with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest.
In answer to this question, <b>Abaye said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that the term <b>“with the oil”</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest serves <b>to add</b> extra oil? <b>It is Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that three <i>log</i> of oil are required, as derived from the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of sheep. <b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>If it were not stated.</b> If the verse had not indicated by the term “with the oil” that extra oil is required, it would have been possible to derive from the voluntary meal offering that only one <i>log</i> is required. <b>And who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>responds</b> to Rabbi Shimon’s <b>derivation</b> and suggests that in fact the amount of oil can be derived from the case of the voluntary meal offering? It is <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be understood differently: The <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who derives that three <i>log</i> of oil are required in the griddle-cake offering based upon the amount required in the meal offering component of the daily offerings.
<b>And</b> with regard to the possibility of deriving that only one <i>log</i> is required, as in the voluntary meal offering, <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying:</b> The term <b>“with the oil”</b> stated with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest comes <b>to add</b> more <b>oil to it</b> than the single <i>log</i> required for the voluntary meal offering. <b>As, if</b> the purpose of that term were merely <b>to establish</b> the basic fact that the offering must include <b>oil,</b> a verse is <b>not needed</b> to teach that. <b>Since it is written with</b> respect to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“On a griddle [<i>maḥavat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:14), it is <b>comparable to a pan [<i>maḥavat</i>] meal offering,</b> which requires oil.
<b>Or</b> perhaps the purpose of the verse is <b>to establish only</b> that the offering must include <b>oil,</b> and it is necessary to teach that <b>because if the Merciful One had not stated: “With the oil,” I would say: Let it be like</b> the <b>meal offering of a sinner,</b> which does not include oil.
Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>then said: Let it even be</b> that the purpose of the verse is <b>to establish only</b> that <b>it</b> requires <b>oil,</b> and even so one can <b>arrive</b> at the conclusion that three <i>log</i> are required due to the <b>derivation</b> based upon the verbal analogy from the meal offering brought with the libations that accompany animal offerings. <b>But</b> although Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, attempts to <b>employ</b> this <b>derivation he is unsuccessful,</b> as there is a counter-indication from another verbal analogy to the voluntary meal offering. Therefore, Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>needed</b> to derive the <i>halakha</i> from the <b>verse: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), <b>as Rabbi Yishmael,</b> son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>concluded his statement</b> in the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Rabba said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be understood differently: The <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>If it were not stated.</b>
<b>And this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying:</b> The term <b>“with the oil”</b> serves <b>to add</b> extra <b>oil to it. As, if</b> the purpose of that term were merely <b>to establish</b> that the offering must include <b>oil,</b> a verse is <b>not needed</b> to teach that. <b>Since it is written with</b> respect to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“On a griddle [<i>maḥavat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:14), it is <b>comparable to a pan [<i>maḥavat</i>]</b> meal offering, which requires oil. <b>And</b> even <b>if</b> the verse <b>had not stated: “With the oil,” I have</b> a manner of <b>derivation</b> for the fact that more than one <i>log</i> of oil is required, based upon a verbal analogy.
<b>But</b> although Rabbi Shimon attempts to <b>employ</b> this <b>derivation he is unsuccessful,</b> as there is a counter-indication from another verbal analogy, <b>and</b> therefore the term <b>“with the oil” is needed</b> to teach that more than one <i>log</i> of oil is required. Nevertheless, this teaches only that more oil than usual is required, but the specific amount still must be clarified. Rabbi Shimon <b>then said: Let</b> the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>be like the meal offering</b> that accompanies the sacrifice of <b>bulls and rams,</b> which require two <i>log</i> of oil per ephah of flour.
Rabbi Shimon <b>then said: We</b> should <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i>

Daf 51b

with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which is <b>a meal offering that comes</b> in the amount of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, from the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of sheep, which is also a meal offering that comes in the amount of a tenth of an ephah of flour, and not from a meal offering that is brought in the amount of two or three tenths of an ephah of flour.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>they did not appoint another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead, from whose</b> property <b>was</b> the griddle-cake offering brought and <b>sacrificed? Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is brought and sacrificed <b>from</b> the property <b>of the community. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is brought and sacrificed <b>from</b> the property <b>of the heirs</b> of the High Priest. <b>And</b> for the duration of the period until a new High Priest was appointed, the griddle-cake offering <b>was sacrificed</b> as <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah of fine flour.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where the <b>High Priest died and they did not appoint another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead, from where</b> is it derived <b>that his</b> griddle-cake <b>meal offering should be sacrificed from</b> the property <b>of the heirs</b> of the High Priest? <b>The verse states</b> in reference to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it”</b> (Leviticus 6:15).
One <b>might</b> have thought that the heirs should <b>sacrifice it in halves</b> as the High Priest does. Therefore <b>the verse states “it,”</b> teaching that they should sacrifice <b>all of</b> the tenth of an ephah <b>and not half of it;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The continuation of the verse: <b>“It is a statute forever [<i>olam</i>]</b> to the Lord,” teaches that in this case of a High Priest who has died and has not yet been replaced, the offering is brought <b>from</b> the property <b>of the world [<i>olam</i>],</b> i.e., the community. The end of the verse: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke</b> to the Lord,” teaches <b>that</b> although it is brought by the community and not by a priest, <b>the entire</b> tenth of an ephah <b>should be sacrificed</b> and not eaten.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did that</b> verse: <b>“And the anointed priest</b> that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it,” <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Yehuda derived from it?
<b>That</b> verse <b>is needed for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord in the day when he is anointed”</b> (Leviticus 6:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse speaks of the offering in the singular, it means that <b>Aaron and his sons should sacrifice one offering.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: “Which they shall offer to the Lord,”</b> in plural, teaching that <b>Aaron</b> sacrifices an offering <b>by himself</b> as the High Priest, <b>and his sons</b> sacrifice offerings <b>by themselves</b> as ordinary priests. When the verse refers to <b>“his sons,” these are the ordinary priests.</b> Each priest must bring a griddle-cake offering as an offering of initiation when he begins his service.
<b>Do you say</b> that this is referring to the offering of initiation of <b>ordinary priests, or is it</b> referring <b>only</b> to the griddle-cake offering of the <b>High Priests? When</b> the verse <b>states</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons</b> shall offer it; it is a statute forever to the Lord; it shall be wholly made to smoke to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:15), the griddle-cake offering of the <b>High Priest is thereby mentioned. How do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“his sons”</b> in Leviticus 6:13? <b>These are the ordinary priests,</b> and the verse is referring to their offering of initiation. Consequently, verse 15 is referring to the basic obligation of the High Priest to bring the griddle-cake offering, rather than referring to a case of a High Priest who died.
The Gemara answers: The verse teaches both the basic obligation of the High Priest to bring the griddle-cake offering daily and the fact that when he dies his heirs must bring the offering until a new High Priest is appointed. <b>If</b> it were <b>so</b> that the verse is teaching only that the heirs of a High Priest who died must bring the griddle-cake offering until a new High Priest is appointed, <b>let the verse</b> merely <b>write: The anointed priest that shall be in his stead, his sons shall offer. What</b> is the need to say: <b>“From among</b> his sons”? <b>Learn from</b> the fact that verse uses this term that <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the verse.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Shimon,</b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> that it should be entirely sacrificed from the phrase: “It shall be wholly made to smoke,” <b>do</b> with <b>that</b> word <b>“it,”</b> from which Rabbi Yehuda derives this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> it <b>to</b> teach that in the case of <b>a High Priest who died</b> after bringing the first half of his griddle-cake offering, <b>and</b> then <b>they appointed another</b> High Priest <b>in his stead,</b> the replacement High Priest <b>should neither bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>from his house nor</b> sacrifice the remaining <b>half of the tenth of an ephah of the first</b> High Priest, i.e., his predecessor.
The Gemara asks: <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the expression: <b>“And half of it”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), as discussed on 50b; the word “and,” which is added by the letter <i>vav</i> at the beginning of the word, is expounded to mean that the replacement High Priest must bring a complete tenth of an ephah of fine flour. The Gemara answers: He did not derive the <i>halakha</i> from there because <b>he does not expound</b> the extra letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in that word, as he holds that its addition is not significant.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that if the High Priest dies and a new one has not yet been appointed the griddle-cake offering is brought by the previous High Priest’s heirs, <b>do</b> with <b>that</b> phrase: <b>“It is a statute forever</b> to the Lord,” from which Rabbi Shimon derives that it is brought from communal resources? The Gemara answers: It teaches that the <b>statute</b> requiring the High Priest to sacrifice the griddle-cake offering <b>is to</b> apply <b>forever.</b>
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the griddle-cake <b>meal offering of the High Priest</b> mentioned <b>above is</b> included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and</b> that the voluntary <b>meal offering</b> of the <b>ordinary priest</b> mentioned <b>below is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16).
<b>From where</b> is it derived that one is mandated <b>to apply what is said about that</b> verse <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> verse <b>to that</b> one? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“Wholly,”</b> and the verse uses the word <b>“wholly”</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of a priest, in order <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering of the High Priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:16).
<b>Just as here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering, it is included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke,” so too there,</b> the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest is included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>It shall be wholly made to smoke. And just as there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest, the verse comes <b>to place a prohibition on its consumption, so too here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering of the High Priest, the verse comes <b>to place a prohibition on its consumption.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that in a case where the High Priest died and a new one has not been appointed, the requirement that the griddle offering be brought <b>from</b> the property <b>of the community is by Torah law,</b> as indicated by the fact that he derives this <i>halakha</i> from a verse?
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:6) that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The court instituted seven ordinances</b> with regard to the financial aspects of offerings and consecrations; <b>and this</b> ordinance, namely, that the cost of the libations accompanying the sacrifice of a found animal is borne by the public, <b>is one of them.</b> These are the other ordinances: In the case of <b>a gentile who sent his burnt offering from a country overseas,</b> and <b>he sent with it</b> money for the purchase of the <b>libations</b> that must accompany it, the libations <b>are sacrificed at his</b> expense. <b>And if</b> the gentile did <b>not</b> cover the cost of the libations, it is a condition of the court that the libations are <b>sacrificed at the public’s</b> expense, with funds taken from the Temple treasury.
<b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a convert who died</b> without heirs <b>and left</b> animals that he had designated as <b>offerings, if he has the libations,</b> i.e., if he also had set aside libations or money for that purpose, the libations <b>are sacrificed from his</b> estate. <b>And if</b> he did <b>not</b> do so, the libations <b>are sacrificed from public</b> funds.
<b>And</b> another ordinance: <b>It is a stipulation of the court</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest who died, and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead, that his</b> griddle-cake <b>meal offering</b> would be <b>sacrificed from public</b> funds. Rabbi Shimon then enumerates three additional ordinances. In any case, it is clear from this mishna that Rabbi Shimon holds that this <i>halakha</i> concerning the offering of a High Priest who died is a rabbinic ordinance, rather than Torah law.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in response: In fact, Rabbi Shimon holds that this <i>halakha</i> is by Torah law. But in fact, there <b>were two ordinances</b> that were enacted concerning this matter.
Initially, they acted in accordance with that which is prescribed <b>by Torah law,</b> and if a High Priest died and a new High Priest had not yet been appointed in his stead, his griddle-cake meal offering would be sacrificed <b>from public</b> funds. <b>Once they saw that the</b> funds in the <b>chamber</b> of the Temple treasury were being <b>depleted,</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that</b> the payment for the offering <b>should be collected from the</b> previous High Priest’s <b>heirs. Once they saw that</b> the heirs <b>were negligent in</b> the matter and did not bring the offering, <b>they</b> revoked the previous ordinance and <b>established it in accordance with</b> the <i>halakha</i> as it is <b>by Torah law,</b> that it is brought from public funds.
§ The Gemara cites the continuation of the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i> (7:7): <b>And</b> the court enacted an ordinance <b>with regard to the</b> red <b>heifer that one is not</b> liable to bring an offering <b>for misusing</b> consecrated property if he derives benefit <b>from its ashes.</b> The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state that this is an ordinance of the court, when in fact <b>it is by Torah law? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a red heifer: <b>“It is a sin offering”</b> (Numbers 19:9), which <b>teaches</b> that a red heifer is treated like a sin offering in that <b>one</b> is liable for <b>misusing it.</b> The fact that it states: <b>“It</b> is a sin offering” indicates that if one derives benefit from <b>it,</b> the animal itself, he is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property,

Daf 52a

but if one derives benefit <b>from its ashes, one is not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. It is clear from the <i>baraita</i> that by Torah law one is not liable for misuse of consecrated property if he derives benefit from the ashes of a red heifer.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response: In fact, this <i>halakha</i> is by Torah law, but <b>there were two ordinances</b> that were enacted concerning this matter. <b>By Torah law,</b> if one derives benefit from <b>it,</b> the animal itself, he is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, but if he derives benefit <b>from its ashes</b> he is not liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. <b>Once</b> the Sages <b>saw that</b> people <b>were treating</b> the ashes of the heifer <b>disrespectfully, and making</b> salves <b>for their wounds from it, they decreed</b> that it is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property and one may not derive benefit from it.
<b>Once they saw that</b> as a result of this decree people <b>were refraining from</b> sprinkling it in cases where there was <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether or not an individual was impure and required <b>sprinkling, they</b> revoked the decree and <b>established it in accordance with</b> the <i>halakha</i> as it is <b>by Torah law,</b> that one is not liable for misusing the ashes of a red heifer.
§ The Gemara cites a dispute between Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda that is similar to the one cited earlier. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is a need to sacrifice the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> brought if the Sanhedrin issues an erroneous halakhic ruling concerning a prohibition for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> and the majority of the community acts upon it, <b>or the goats</b> brought if the Sanhedrin issues an erroneous ruling permitting <b>idol worship</b> and the majority of the community acts on it, <b>a new collection</b> of funds is organized <b>for them.</b> The funds are not taken from the collection of the Temple treasury chamber, unlike other communal offerings. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The funds for these sacrifices <b>come from the collection of the chamber.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>the opposite,</b> i.e., that the first opinion cited above is that of Rabbi Shimon and the second is that of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>Which of</b> the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>the later</b> one and therefore the more accurate and authoritative version of their opinions?
<b>The Sages said</b> the following <b>before Rav Ashi: Let</b> us <b>say</b> that <b>the first</b> <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>is the later</b> one, <b>as we have heard that Rabbi Shimon is concerned about</b> the possibility of <b>negligence.</b> Just as Rabbi Shimon was concerned above that the heirs of the High Priest would not provide the funds for the griddle-cake offering, it is reasonable to assume that he would be concerned that people would not contribute to a new collection, and therefore the funds are taken from the collection of the chamber.
<b>Rav Ashi said to</b> the Sages: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that <b>the latter</b> <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>is the later</b> and more authoritative one. <b>When Rabbi Shimon</b> expressed that he <b>is concerned about</b> the possibility of people acting with <b>negligence,</b> that was only with regard to <b>a matter that does not provide them with atonement,</b> e.g., the griddle-cake offering of the deceased High Priest. But <b>Rabbi Shimon is not concerned about</b> the possibility of <b>negligence with regard to a matter that does provide them with atonement,</b> e.g., these sin offerings.
The Gemara asks, in light of the fact that the discussion above was inconclusive: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it;</b> which <i>baraita</i> is later and more authoritative?
<b>Rabba Zuti said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning the daily sacrifice: “Command the children of Israel, and say to them: <b>My food that is presented to Me for offerings made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to Me, you shall observe to sacrifice to Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2), serves <b>to include</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin and the goats of idol worship.</b> This teaches <b>that</b> the funds for these offerings <b>come from the collection of the chamber;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b> This proves that it is Rabbi Shimon who holds that these sacrifices are brought from the collection of the chamber.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> for the duration of the period until a new High Priest is appointed, the griddle-cake offering <b>was sacrificed</b> as <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah of fine flour. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> Does the mishna mean that <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah is offered in the <b>morning and</b> another <b>complete</b> tenth of an ephah is offered <b>in the afternoon,</b> because this offering is sacrificed twice a day and is not divided in half when it is not brought by the High Priest himself? <b>Or</b> does it <b>perhaps</b> mean that <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah is sacrificed in the <b>morning and</b> the offering is <b>canceled in the afternoon?</b>
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution to this dilemma from that which is taught in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 31b) describing the order of the nine priests who brought the limbs of the daily offering up to the ramp of the altar, both in the morning and in the afternoon: The <b>eighth</b> priest carries <b>the griddle-cake</b> offering of the High Priest. <b>And if it were so that</b> the offering is <b>canceled in the afternoon,</b> then <b>sometimes</b> one would <b>not find the eighth</b> priest carrying <b>the griddle-cake</b> offering. <b>What are the circumstances</b> when there would be no eighth priest? In a case <b>where the High Priest died</b> after he brought his griddle-cake offering in the morning <b>and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another</b> High Priest <b>in his stead.</b> Therefore, it must be that a complete tenth of an ephah was also brought for the afternoon offering.
<b>The Sages stated</b> this proof <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya rejected it and <b>said:</b> Those <b>foolish Babylonians, because they dwell in</b> a low-lying and therefore <b>dark land, they state <i>halakhot</i> that are dark,</b> i.e., erroneous.
<b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which the same mishna <b>teaches:</b> The <b>seventh</b> priest carries <b>the fine flour</b> for the meal offering component of the daily offering and <b>the ninth</b> priest carries <b>the wine</b> for the libations that accompany the daily offering, is it <b>also</b> the case <b>that they are never canceled?</b>
That is not correct, as it is derived from the verse <b>“Their meal offering and their libations”</b> (Numbers 29:18) that these items may be sacrificed even <b>at night,</b> despite the fact that the daily offering they accompany must be sacrificed during the day. Similarly, the phrase <b>“their meal offering and their libations”</b> indicates that these items may be sacrificed even <b>the next day</b> (see 44b). Under those circumstances there would not have been fine flour and wine brought by the seventh and nine priests at the time of the daily offering.
<b>Rather,</b> one must explain that the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>what if,</b> and is speaking only about the typical case. <b>So too</b> with regard to Rava’s proof from the mishna, it is not compelling because the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>what if</b> the High Priest dies and a successor has not yet been appointed.
The Sages then <b>brought</b> Rabbi Yirmeya’s analysis <b>before Rava.</b> Rava initially <b>said</b> to them: <b>You state our inferior</b> statements, which can be refuted, <b>before</b> the Sages of Eretz Yisrael, but <b>you do not state our superior</b> statements <b>before them?</b>
<b>And Rava then said</b> to them: <b>This</b> statement, that the griddle-cake offering is sacrificed twice a day even if there is no High Priest, is <b>also</b> one of <b>our superior</b> statements, as <b>the verse states</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>],</b> half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). This teaches that the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>is like the meal offering</b> component of the <b>daily offerings [<i>temidin</i>]</b> and must be sacrificed in the morning and the afternoon, even if the High Priest died and was not yet replaced.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: If the High Priest died and was not yet replaced, <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah is sacrificed in the <b>morning and</b> another <b>complete</b> tenth of an ephah is sacrificed <b>in the afternoon.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Abba Yosei ben Dostai and the Rabbis disagree</b> as to the amount of frankincense brought with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest.
<b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai says:</b> The High Priest <b>separates two handfuls of frankincense for</b> his griddle-cake offering each day; one <b>handful</b> for his <b>morning</b> offering <b>and</b> one <b>handful</b> for his <b>afternoon</b> offering. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The High Priest <b>separates one handful</b> of frankincense each day <b>for</b> his griddle-cake offering. He divides it in half and brings <b>half a handful</b> for his <b>morning</b> offering <b>and half a handful</b> for his <b>afternoon</b> offering.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> they <b>disagree? Abba Yosei ben Dostai holds</b> that since <b>one does not find</b> a case where the Torah explicitly states that <b>half a handful is sacrificed,</b> he brings a complete handful for each offering. <b>And the Rabbis hold that</b> since <b>one does not find</b> a case where <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>requires two handfuls</b> of frankincense, he brings only one handful and divides it between the two offerings.
Having discussed the quantity of frankincense that is generally brought with the griddle-cake offering, the Gemara now addresses a case where the High Priest died. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> In the case of <b>a High Priest who died and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another in his stead,</b>

Daf 52b

<b>according to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that generally one handful of frankincense is divided between the morning and afternoon offerings, <b>is the</b> amount of <b>frankincense doubled or not? Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> in this case <b>its fine flour is doubled,</b> as a complete tenth of an ephah of fine flour is sacrificed in both the morning and evening, <b>its frankincense</b> is also <b>doubled? Or perhaps that which</b> the verse <b>reveals,</b> i.e., that a complete tenth of an ephah is sacrificed in the morning and afternoon, <b>it reveals,</b> and <b>that which</b> it <b>does not reveal,</b> it <b>does not reveal;</b> and therefore, since the verse does not indicate that the amount of frankincense is doubled, only one handful is brought.
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>oil</b> of the griddle-cake offering in a case where the High Priest died and was not yet replaced, <b>both</b> according <b>to Abba Yosei ben Dostai and</b> according <b>to the Rabbis?</b> Is the required amount three <i>log</i>, as it is when the High Priest brings the griddle-cake offering, or is the amount of oil doubled just as the amount of fine flour is doubled?
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma concerning the quantity of frankincense that is brought in this case, based upon a mishna (106b): <b>There are five</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a handful.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the frankincense sacrificed with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest is not included in this number, because only half a handful of frankincense is sacrificed at one time. <b>And if it is so</b> that when there is no High Priest a complete handful is brought in the morning and in the afternoon, then <b>sometimes you find</b> that there are <b>seven</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to a handful.
The Gemara rejects this proof: The <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>what if</b> the High Priest died, and is speaking only about a typical case. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa was sitting and teaching this <i>halakha</i>. Rav Yosef bar Shemaya said to Rav Pappa: But</b> the mishna does list the case of <b>one who</b> intentionally <b>offers up</b> the <b>handful</b> from a meal offering <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, who is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. This <b>is</b> not a standard case but rather a case of <b>what if, and</b> nevertheless it <b>is taught</b> in the mishna. Accordingly, Rava’s proof is valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a <b>High Priest who died and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another in his stead, a complete</b> tenth of an ephah of fine flour is brought for the griddle-cake offering in the <b>morning and</b> another <b>complete</b> tenth of an ephah is brought <b>in the afternoon. And one separates two handfuls</b> of frankincense <b>for it,</b> and sacrifices one <b>handful</b> with the <b>morning</b> offering <b>and</b> one <b>handful</b> with the <b>afternoon</b> offering. <b>And</b> one <b>separates three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for it,</b> and brings <b>a <i>log</i> and a half</b> with the <b>morning</b> offering <b>and a <i>log</i> and a half</b> with the <b>afternoon</b> offering.
The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is different</b> about <b>its frankincense</b> such <b>that it is doubled</b> in the case where the High Priest died, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>its oil</b> such <b>that it is not doubled?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai, who said:</b> The <b>griddle-cake</b> offering of the <b>High Priest generally requires two handfuls. And</b> therefore when the <i>baraita</i> requires two handfuls of frankincense in the case where the High Priest died and another has not yet been appointed, the <b>frankincense is not</b> being <b>doubled and the oil is</b> also <b>not doubled.</b> Therefore, three <i>log</i> of oil are required, as usual.
<b>And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> according <b>to Abba Yosei ben Dostai</b> the requisite <b>oil is not doubled,</b> one can conclude that <b>also</b> according <b>to the Rabbis its frankincense and its oil are not doubled.</b>
This discussion in the Gemara began with Rabbi Yoḥanan presenting the dispute between Abba Yosei ben Dostai and the Rabbis, and it concludes with his ruling concerning their dispute. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan state</b> a principle that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna,</b> and <b>we learned</b> in the unattributed mishna cited earlier: <b>There are</b> only <b>five</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a handful.</b> Since the mishna does not list the fact that a handful of frankincense is offered twice daily with the griddle-cake offering, how can Rabbi Yoḥanan accept that opinion?
The Gemara answers: <b>They are</b> different <b><i>amora’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> One said that Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in accordance with Abba Yosei ben Dostai, and one said that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with an unattributed mishna.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal offerings come</b> to be offered as <b><i>matza</i>,</b> with care taken to prevent leavening, <b>except for</b> ten loaves of <b>leavened bread</b> among the forty loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering, and</b> the meal offering of <b>the two loaves</b> that are brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>as they come</b> to be offered as <b>leavened bread.</b>
The Sages disagree as to the manner in which those meal offerings are leavened. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>the leaven</b> added to the dough to facilitate leavening, <b>one separates [<i>bodeh</i>]</b> part of the flour <b>for</b> the meal offerings <b>from within</b> the flour of the meal offerings themselves, causes it to become leaven, <b>and leavens</b> the meal offerings with it.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: That is also not the optimal</b> manner in which to fulfill the mitzva, as aged leaven is a more effective leavening agent. <b>Rather, one brings the leaven</b> from another, aged, dough <b>and places it into the measuring</b> vessel, <b>and</b> then he adds flour until he <b>fills the measuring</b> vessel, to ensure the appropriate measure of a tenth of an ephah of flour. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>That too</b> is inappropriate, as in that manner the meal offering <b>will</b> either be <b>lacking</b> the requisite measure <b>or</b> be <b>greater</b> than the required measure, as the Gemara will explain.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Perida raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ami: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to all the meal offerings that they come</b> to be offered as <b><i>matza</i>?</b> Rabbi Ami was puzzled by this question, and replied: What do you mean when you say: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? Concerning every meal offering <b>with regard to which it is written</b> explicitly in the Torah that it comes as <i>matza</i>, <b>it is written with regard to it,</b> and therefore the dilemma does not arise. And concerning any meal offering where <b>it is not written</b> explicitly <b>with regard to it</b> that it must be <i>matza</i>, nevertheless <b>it is written with regard to it:</b>

Daf 53a

<b>“And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord in front of the altar…And that which is left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat; it shall be eaten as <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Leviticus 6:7–9). These verses demonstrate that there is a general requirement that meal offerings must be brought as <i>matza</i>. Rabbi Perida <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>I do not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to the source of the <b>mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>, as that is clearly derived from these verses. <b>Where I raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the source that indicates this requirement is <b>indispensable,</b> i.e., that if one violated the mitzva and brought a meal offering not as <i>matza</i> the offering is not valid.
Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> Rabbi Perida: <b>With regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the requirement that meal offerings must come as <i>matza</i> is <b>indispensable, it is also written: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>but</b> rather must come as <b><i>matza</i>.</b> This additional verse indicates that even after the fact, if a meal offering was not made as <i>matza</i> it is not valid.
Rav <b>Ḥisda objects to this: But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“It shall not be baked as leavened bread,”</b> i.e., fully leavened, <b>but</b> it can be brought even if it has been leavened slightly with <b>leavening [<i>siur</i>]</b> dough. Although it does not have the status of leavened bread and is therefore not prohibited by the verse, it also does not have the status of <i>matza</i>.
The Gemara analyzes Rav Ḥisda’s objection, as there is a dispute among the Sages with regard to the definition of <i>siur</i> (see <i>Pesaḥim</i> 48b). According to Rabbi Meir, <i>siur</i> is dough at the beginning of the leavening process, when its surface has become pale. Conversely, Rabbi Yehuda maintains that <i>siur</i> is dough that has been leavened to the point that it has cracks that look like the antennae of locusts. In this light, the Gemara inquires: This <b><i>siur</i>,</b> mentioned by Rav Ḥisda in his suggested interpretation of the verse, is in accordance <b>with whose</b> opinion? <b>If</b> he is referring to <i>siur</i> as defined <b>by Rabbi Meir,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> Rav Ḥisda’s objection does not arise, as Rabbi Yehuda maintains this <b>is full-fledged <i>matza</i>.</b> And <b>if</b> Rav Ḥisda is referring to <i>siur</i> as defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> Rav Ḥisda’s objection does not arise either, as Rabbi Meir holds that it <b>is full-fledged leavened bread.</b>
Furthermore, <b>if</b> Rav Ḥisda is referring to <i>siur</i> as defined <b>by Rabbi Meir,</b> then even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> himself the objection does not arise. The reason is that <b>from</b> the fact that Rabbi Meir rules <b>that</b> one who eats this <i>siur</i> on Passover <b>is flogged for it,</b> this indicates that <b>it is</b> deemed <b>full-fledged leavened bread. Rather,</b> Rav Ḥisda’s objection arises with regard to leavening dough as defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that this dough is not considered full-fledged leavened bread.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> also <b>objects to</b> Rabbi Ami’s explanation: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse can be interpreted as follows: <b>“It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” but</b> one may bring a meal offering that has been <b>boiled,</b> as this is not leavened bread; although it is also not <i>matza</i>. The Gemara asks: This <b>boiled</b> dough, <b>what is it?</b> It is <b>poached [<i>revikha</i>],</b> as described in the verse: “In a pan it shall be made of oil, when it is soaked [<i>murbekhet</i>]” (Leviticus 6:14). If so, there is no need to derive the <i>halakha</i> of boiled dough from the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread.” <b>If</b> it is a meal offering that must be <b>poached, it is</b> explicitly <b>written with regard to it</b> that it must be <b>poached. And</b> if it is a meal offering that is not to be poached, <b>it is not written with regard to it</b> that it is <b>poached.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” indicates that with regard to a meal offering <b>about which it is written</b> explicitly that it must be <b>poached,</b> it is a <b>mitzva that</b> it be <b>poached, and</b> with regard to a meal offering <b>about which it is not written</b> that it must be <b>poached,</b> the one who brings the offering can decide: <b>If he wants, let him bring</b> it <b>poached,</b> and <b>if he wants, let him bring</b> it as <b><i>matza</i>.</b> Accordingly, Rabbi Ami’s proof from the verse is inconclusive.
<b>Ravina</b> also <b>objects to</b> Rabbi Ami’s explanation: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse: <b>“It shall not be baked as leavened bread,”</b> serves <b>to determine</b> that this <b>man</b> who brings a meal offering as leavened bread <b>is</b> liable <b>for</b> violating <b>a mere prohibition, but</b> the meal offering itself is <b>not invalid.</b>
All these objections indicate that the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” can be interpreted in ways other than that suggested by Rabbi Ami. Accordingly, the Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that all meal offerings not brought as <i>matza</i> are not valid? The Gemara answers: We derive it <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> discussing a verse concerning meal offerings: “It shall be of <b><i>matza</i>”</b> (Leviticus 2:5): One <b>might</b> have thought that it is only <b>a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i> for a meal offering to be of <i>matza</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be,”</b> which indicates that <b>the verse established it</b> as <b>an obligation,</b> i.e., if the meal offering was not brought as <i>matza</i> it is not valid.
§ <b>Rabbi Perida raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabbi Ami: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to all the meal offerings</b> that must be brought as <i>matza</i> <b>that they are kneaded with lukewarm</b> water so that the dough will be baked well, as only a small amount of oil is added, <b>and</b> that <b>one must watch over them</b> to ensure <b>that they do not</b> become <b>leavened</b> while kneading and shaping them? Shall <b>we derive this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the prohibition concerning leavened bread on the festival of <b>Passover, as it is written: “And you shall watch over the <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:17), which indicates that one must watch over any dough that is supposed to be made into <i>matza</i>, to ensure that it does not become leavened?
Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> Rabbi Perida: The <i>halakha</i> of meal offerings is not derived from Passover, as <b>it is written in</b> the context of a meal offering <b>itself: “It shall be [<i>tehiye</i>] of <i>matza</i>”</b> (Leviticus 2:5), which can be read as meaning: <b>Preserve [<i>haḥaye</i>]</b> <i>matza</i>, i.e., preserve the <i>matza</i> as it is, and do not let it become leavened.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you</b> already <b>derive</b> from the term “it shall be” that the requirement that a meal offering must be made as <i>matza</i> <b>is indispensable?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that this term serves to teach only one <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the verse write: It is <i>matza</i>. What</b> is the reason that it writes: <b>“It shall be</b> of <i>matza</i>”? <b>Learn from it two</b> conclusions, both that the requirement that it be made as <i>matza</i> is indispensable and that one must watch over the <i>matza</i> to ensure that it does not become leavened.
§ The Gemara relates an incident that involves the aforementioned Rabbi Perida. <b>The Sages said to Rabbi Perida:</b> The Sage <b>Rabbi Ezra,</b> who is of especially fine lineage, <b>a grandson of Rabbi Avtolus, who</b> in turn <b>is a</b> tenth-generation descendant <b>of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who is a</b> tenth-generation descendant <b>of Ezra</b> the Scribe, <b>is standing</b> and waiting <b>at the gate</b> of the house and seeks entry. Rabbi Perida <b>said</b> to the Sages: <b>What is</b> the need for <b>all this</b> detail about Rabbi Ezra’s lineage?
Rabbi Perida elaborated: <b>If he is a man of Torah</b> study, he is <b>worthy</b> of entry on his own account, regardless of his ancestors. And <b>if he is</b> both <b>a man of Torah</b> study <b>and a man of lineage,</b> he is also <b>worthy</b> of entry. <b>But if</b> he is <b>a man of lineage and not a man of Torah,</b> better for <b>fire to devour him</b> than for him to enter my house. In this case, his lineage is to his detriment, as it highlights his failure to become a Sage like his ancestors. The Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Perida: Rabbi Ezra <b>is a man of Torah</b> study. Rabbi Perida <b>said to them:</b> If so, <b>let him enter and come.</b>
When Rabbi Ezra entered his house, Rabbi Perida <b>saw that</b> Rabbi Ezra’s <b>mind was troubled</b> with embarrassment at having to wait outside. Therefore, Rabbi Perida taught a homily to comfort Rabbi Ezra. <b>He began and said</b> an interpretation of the verse: <b>“I have said to the Lord: You are my Lord; I have no good but in You [<i>tovati bal alekha</i>]”</b> (Psalms 16:2). Rabbi Perida interpreted: <b>The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, give me credit, as I made Your</b> Name <b>known in the world,</b> as indicated by the phrase: “You are my Lord.”
God <b>said to</b> the congregation of Israel: <b>I give no credit to you [<i>tovati bal alekha</i>].</b> God explained: <b>I give credit only to</b> the three Patriarchs, <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who</b> were the <b>first who made My</b> Name <b>known in the world, as it is stated: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent [<i>ve’addirei</i>] in whom is all My delight”</b> (Psalms 16:3). The holy in the earth are the Patriarchs, in whom God delights. In this manner Rabbi Perida alluded to the importance of the ancestors of the Jewish people, including Ezra the Scribe, from whom Rabbi Ezra was descended.
<b>When</b> Rabbi Ezra <b>heard</b> Rabbi Perida <b>say</b> the word: <b>Excellent [<i>addir</i>],</b> he too <b>began</b> a homily, one that plays with different forms of this term, <b>and said: Let the <i>Addir</i> come and exact punishment for the <i>addirim</i> from the <i>addirim</i> in the <i>addirim</i>.</b>
Rabbi Ezra explained this statement: With regard to <i>Addir</i> in the phrase: <b>Let the <i>Addir</i> come, this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord on high is mighty [<i>addir</i>]”</b> (Psalms 93:4). In the phrase: <b>And exact punishment for the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Jews, as it is stated: “The excellent [<i>ve’addirei</i>] in whom is all My delight”</b> (Psalms 16:3). In the phrase: <b>From the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Egyptians, as it is written</b> with regard to the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“The mighty [<i>addirim</i>] sank as lead in the waters”</b> (Exodus 15:10). In the phrase: <b>In the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the waters, as it is stated: “Above the voices of many waters, the mighty [<i>addirim</i>] breakers of the sea”</b> (Psalms 93:4).
Rabbi Ezra stated another, similar, homiletic interpretation: <b>Let <i>yadid</i>, son of <i>yadid</i>, come and build <i>yadid</i> for <i>yadid</i> in the portion of <i>yadid</i>, and let <i>yedidim</i> achieve atonement through it.</b>
Rabbi Ezra explained this statement: With regard to <i>yadid</i> in the phrase: <b>Let <i>yadid</i>, this is King Solomon, as it is written</b> after Solomon’s birth: <b>“And He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Yedidya, for the Lord’s sake”</b> (II Samuel 12:25).

Daf 53b

In the phrase: <b>Son of <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is Abraham, as it is written: “What has My beloved [<i>lididi</i>] to do in My house”</b> (Jeremiah 11:15). This verse is referring to Abraham, as will be explained. In the phrase: <b>And build <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is the Temple, as it is written: “How lovely [<i>yedidot</i>] are Your tabernacles”</b> (Psalms 84:2). And with regard to the term in the phrase: <b>For <i>Yadid</i>, this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “Let me sing of my Beloved [<i>lididi</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 5:1).
<b>In the portion of <i>yadid</i>; this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin,</b> in whose territory the Temple was built, <b>as it is stated</b> that Moses blessed Benjamin in the following terms: <b>“Of Benjamin he said: The beloved [<i>yedid</i>] of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:12). <b>And let <i>yedidim</i> achieve atonement through it; these</b> <i>yedidim</i> <b>are the Jewish people, as it is written</b> with regard to them: <b>“I have given the dearly beloved [<i>yedidut</i>] of My soul into the hand of her enemies”</b> (Jeremiah 12:7).
Rabbi Ezra stated another, similar homily: <b>Let the good one come and receive the good from the Good for the good ones.</b> He explained: <b>Let the good one come; this</b> good <b>is Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“And when she saw him that he was a goodly child”</b> (Exodus 2:2). <b>And receive the good; this</b> good <b>is</b> the <b>Torah, as it is written</b> about the Torah: <b>“For I give you a good doctrine;</b> do not forsake my Torah” (Proverbs 4:2). <b>From the Good; this is</b> referring to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord is good to all”</b> (Psalms 145:9). <b>For the good ones; these</b> good ones <b>are the Jews, as it is written</b> with regard to them: <b>“Do good, Lord, to the good ones”</b> (Psalms 125:4).
Rabbi Ezra stated yet another homily structured in a similar manner. <b>Let this one come and receive this from this One for this people.</b> He explained: <b>Let this one come; this is</b> referring to <b>Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“For as for this Moses, the man</b> who brought us up out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 32:1). <b>And receive this; this is</b> referring to the <b>Torah, as it is written: “And this is the Torah which Moses set</b> before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44). <b>From this One; this is</b> referring to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <b>For this people; these</b> people <b>are the Jews, as it is stated</b> about them: <b>“This people that You have gotten”</b> (Exodus 15:16).
§ It was stated above that the verse: “What has My beloved to do in My house,” is a reference to Abraham. The Gemara homiletically interprets the complete verse and the one after it: “What has My beloved to do in My house, seeing that she has performed lewdness with many, and the hallowed flesh is passed from you? When you do evil, then you rejoice. The Lord called your name a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit; with the sound of a great tumult He has kindled fire upon it, and its branches are broken” (Jeremiah 11:15–16). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: At the time when the</b> First <b>Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, found Abraham standing in the Temple. He said to</b> Abraham: <b>“What has My beloved to do in My house?”</b>
Abraham <b>said to</b> God: <b>I have come over matters</b> concerning <b>my children,</b> to discover why God is destroying the Temple and exiling them from Eretz Yisrael. God <b>said to</b> Abraham: The reason is that <b>your children sinned, and</b> therefore they are being <b>exiled</b> from the land. Abraham <b>said to</b> God: <b>Perhaps they sinned unwittingly,</b> and they do not deserve such a terrible punishment. God <b>said to</b> him: <b>“Seeing that she has performed lewdness [<i>hamzimmata</i>],”</b> i.e., her evil actions were intentional. Abraham further <b>said to</b> God: <b>Perhaps</b> only <b>a minority</b> of Jews <b>sinned,</b> and the rest of the people should be spared punishment. God <b>said to</b> him: <b>“With many,”</b> i.e., the majority of the people are culpable.
Abraham continued to contend: Even so, <b>You should have remembered</b> the merit of the <b>covenant of circumcision,</b> which would have protected them from retribution. God <b>said to</b> him: <b>“And the hallowed flesh is passed from you,”</b> as they neglected the mitzva of circumcision. Abraham persisted and <b>said to</b> God: <b>Perhaps if You would have waited for them, they would have returned in repentance.</b> God <b>said to</b> him: <b>“When you do evil then you rejoice.”</b> That is, it is proper for them to be punished without delay, and they should not be given time to repent, since when they sin and are not punished they rejoice and live at ease, and rather than repent they are encouraged to do more evil.
Once all his arguments had been refuted, Abraham <b>immediately placed his hands on his head</b> in an act of mourning, <b>and was screaming and crying. And</b> he <b>said to</b> God: Is it <b>conceivable, Heaven forbid,</b> that the Jewish people <b>have no</b> further opportunity for <b>remedy? A Divine Voice emerged and said to him</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“The Lord called your name a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit.” Just as</b> with regard to <b>this olive tree, its final</b> purpose is fulfilled <b>at its end,</b> when its fruit is picked, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the Jewish people, their final</b> purpose will be fulfilled <b>at their end,</b> i.e., they will ultimately repent and return to Me.
The Gemara analyzes the last part of the same verse: <b>“With the sound of a great tumult [<i>hamulla</i>] He has kindled fire upon it, and its branches [<i>daliyyotav</i>] are broken”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: From the sound of the words [<i>milleihen</i>] of the spies</b> that Moses sent to Eretz Yisrael and who brought back an evil report, <b>the branches of the Jewish people were broken. As Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The spies said a serious statement at that moment: “They are stronger than us”</b> (Numbers 13:31). <b>Do not read</b> the phrase as: “Stronger <b>than us [<i>mimmenu</i>],”</b> but <b>rather</b> read it as: Stronger <b>than Him [<i>mimmennu</i>],</b> meaning <b>that even the Homeowner,</b> God, <b>is unable to remove His belongings from there, as it were.</b> The spies were speaking heresy and claiming that the Canaanites were stronger than God Himself.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Ḥinnana, objects to this</b> interpretation. <b>This</b> phrase: <b>“With the sound of a great tumult [<i>hamulla</i>],”</b> is problematic according to your claim that it is a reference to the words of the spies. According to your interpretation, <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>With the sound of a word [<i>mila</i>]. Rather,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya interprets this phrase in accordance with the earlier explanation that these verses are referring to Abraham’s discussion with God at the time of the destruction of the Temple. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham: I heard your voice, and I took pity [<i>ḥamalti</i>] on</b> the Jewish people and will punish them less harshly. <b>I</b> had previously <b>said</b> that the Jews <b>will be subjugated by four kingdoms:</b> Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome, and <b>each and every one</b> of these kingdoms will subjugate them <b>for the measure</b> of time I had originally set for their subjugation to all <b>four kingdoms</b> put together.
But <b>now</b> that you have prayed for them, the Jewish people will be subjugated to <b>each one</b> of these four kingdoms only for the amount of time <b>stipulated for</b> each one separately. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that God said the following to Abraham: <b>I</b> initially <b>said</b> that these kingdoms will rule over the Jews <b>one after the other,</b> each of them for a separate period. <b>Now</b> I decree that their dominion shall occur <b>simultaneously</b> in different geographical regions, which will shorten the overall duration of the subjugation.
The verse in Jeremiah compares the Jewish people to an olive tree: “The Lord called your name a leafy olive tree.” <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Why were the Jewish people likened to an olive tree?</b> It is <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as the leaves of an olive tree never fall off, neither in the summer nor in the rainy season, so too, the Jewish people will never be nullified, neither in this world nor in the World-to-Come. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why were the Jewish people likened to an olive tree?</b> It is <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as an olive tree brings forth its oil only by</b> means of <b>crushing</b> and breaking, <b>so too, the Jewish people,</b> if they sin, <b>return to good</b> ways <b>only by means of suffering.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>the leaven</b> added to the dough to facilitate leavening, <b>one separates</b> part of the flour <b>for</b> the meal offerings <b>from within</b> the flour of the meal offerings themselves <b>and leavens</b> the meal offerings with it. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that one brings the leaven from another, aged, dough. The Rabbis subsequently questioned Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, claiming that according to his ruling the measure of the meal offering would be lacking or would be greater than required. The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Lacking or greater?</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> If the <b>leavening dough</b> that was brought from elsewhere is <b>stiff,</b> as its flour was mixed with a small amount of water, and it is relatively small in volume, when this stiff leaven is measured with the fine flour, the amount of fine flour for the meal offering <b>is found</b> to be <b>greater</b> than <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah when <b>the measuring</b> vessel is filled. This is because it will be necessary to add more flour to make up for the small volume of leavening dough. Conversely, if the leavening dough is <b>soft,</b> i.e., its flour was mixed with a larger amount of water, its volume will be larger than it should be, which will mean that the measuring vessel will be filled with less fine flour than normal, and the amount of flour <b>is found</b> to be <b>lacking.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with the interpretation of Rav Ḥisda: Why does it matter if the leavening dough is stiff or soft? <b>Ultimately, when</b> the one preparing the meal offering <b>measures</b> the leaven brought from elsewhere together with the fine flour used for the meal offering, <b>he measures</b> and reaches the requisite amount <b>of a tenth</b> of an ephah, as the measure is full either way.
<b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say:</b> In order to achieve the appropriate measure it is necessary to know how much flour the substance contained before water was added and it became dough. The reason is that <b>one measures</b> the tenth of an ephah <b>in accordance with</b> the amount there <b>was</b> of the flour of the leavening dough before it was mixed with water, together with the fine flour of the meal offering, and not in accordance with their present volume.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even according to the opinion of Rabbis, who hold that Rabbi Yehuda’s method may not be used because the amount might be lacking or be greater than it should be, <b>let him take a little</b> fine flour <b>from</b> the tenth of an ephah after it has been measured and found to be the requisite amount, <b>and leaven it</b> thoroughly <b>outside</b> the rest of the dough, <b>and</b> afterward <b>bring it and knead it together with</b> the rest of the dough. In this way it is possible to bring leaven from the outside and to be certain that the meal offering contains exactly the correct measure. The Gemara answers: One cannot proceed in this manner, due to a rabbinic <b>decree.</b> The reason for this decree is that people who would see this practice might mistakenly think that the leavened portion was not part of the original fine flour, and <b>perhaps they will come to bring</b> leavening dough for their meal offerings <b>from elsewhere,</b> i.e., leavening dough that has not been consecrated for the meal offering.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not leaven</b> the meal offerings that come as leavened bread

Daf 54a

<b>with</b> the juice of <b>apples,</b> as the dough will not leaven properly. It was <b>said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel</b> that <b>one may leaven</b> these meal offerings with juice from apples, as this is considered proper leavening. The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Kahana would teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the name <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon,</b> not in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel.
The Gemara analyzes this dispute. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:2): In the case of <b>an apple</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>that one mashed and placed in</b> non-sacred <b>dough, and</b> the juice of the apple <b>leavened</b> the dough, <b>this</b> dough <b>is prohibited</b> to be consumed by anyone who may not partake of <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara reiterates the question: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>Shall we say</b> that it <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel,</b> who maintains that the juice of apples causes the dough to leaven properly, <b>and not</b> in accordance with the ruling of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the majority opinion that disputes this ruling? The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. Granted,</b> the Rabbis hold <b>that</b> dough leavened by the juice of apples does <b>not become full-fledged leavened bread,</b> but <b>in any event it becomes hardened [<i>nukshe</i>]</b> leaven. Consequently, dough leavened by the juice of <i>teruma</i> apples is prohibited to non-priests.
§ On the previous <i>amud</i> the Gemara cited the opinion of Rabba and Rav Yosef that measuring the flour in the leavening dough must be performed before water is added. The Gemara discusses this matter further. <b>Rabbi Ila says:</b> Of all the meal offerings, <b>you do not have</b> a meal offering <b>whose removal of</b> the <b>handful is more difficult than</b> that of <b>the meal offering of a sinner.</b> This particular meal offering is dry, as no oil is added to it. Therefore, it is very difficult to remove precisely a handful, as when the priest takes a handful with his thumb and little finger, a large amount of flour is apt to fall out. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says:</b> The removal of the handful in the case of the meal offering of a sinner is no more difficult than its removal in other meal offerings. The reason is that although the Torah prohibited the addition of oil to <b>the meal offering of a sinner,</b> nevertheless the priest <b>may knead it in water, and</b> it is <b>fit</b> to be offered.
The Gemara analyzes this dispute. <b>Let us say</b> that these <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree about this: As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, <b>holds that one measures</b> meal offerings <b>as they are,</b> in their current state, after they have been mixed into a dough. Therefore it is permitted to perform the removal of the handful after water has been added, at which point it is not a particularly difficult rite to perform. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ila, <b>holds that one measures</b> meal offerings <b>as they were</b> before they were mixed with water, when they were still flour. Therefore, if one were to add water before measuring he might add too much, which would cause the dough to be too soft and the measure of the offering too large, or conversely, if he were to add too little water the dough would be stiff and too small in volume. Either way, the handful will not contain the correct amount of flour, and therefore no water may be added.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> as <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>one measures</b> meal offerings <b>as they</b> currently <b>are. And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree: As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, <b>holds: What</b> is the meaning of <b>“dry”</b> written in the verse discussing a meal offering: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry” (Leviticus 7:10)? It means <b>dry of oil,</b> but one may add water. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ila, <b>holds</b> that the meal offering of a sinner must be <b>dry of all substances,</b> i.e., it may not contain even water.
§ The question concerning whether a meal offering is to be measured in its current, mixed state or as it was before it was mixed relates to a fundamental issue that also arises in other areas of <i>halakha</i>. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:8): <b>Meat of a calf that swelled</b> due to cooking, as the volume of calf flesh increases when it is cooked in water, <b>or meat of an old</b> animal <b>that shrank</b> due to cooking, which is what happens to meat of this type, are to be <b>measured as they are</b> in order to determine if they are the volume of an egg-bulk, in which case they can contract ritual impurity and transfer impurity of food to other items.
The Sages disagree as to the meaning of: Measured as they are. <b>Rav, Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> all <b>say</b> that it means the items are to be <b>measured as they are</b> currently, after having been cooked. <b>Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Reish Lakish</b> all <b>say</b> it means they are to be <b>measured according to</b> their volume <b>as they are,</b> before having been cooked. In other words, even if the meat of a calf is the volume of an egg-bulk after it was cooked, if it was less than this before cooking it cannot contract ritual impurity. Conversely, even if the meat of an old animal was less than an egg-bulk after cooking, if it was an egg-bulk before it was cooked it can contract ritual impurity.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>meat of a calf that</b> came into contact with a source of ritual impurity but that <b>was not of</b> a volume equivalent <b>to</b> the minimum <b>measure</b> for contracting impurity, i.e., an egg-bulk, if it was then cooked, <b>and</b> as a result it <b>swelled</b> until <b>it stood at</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for ritual impurity, this meat is <b>pure with regard to the past, but</b> can become <b>impure</b> and render other items impure <b>from here on.</b> In other words, the previous contact with a source of impurity did not render the meat impure, as it was of insufficient volume at the time. This indicates that the status of an item with regard to ritual impurity depends on its volume at the current moment.
The Gemara answers: It is possible that by Torah law this meat is in fact not susceptible to ritual impurity even from here on, as the <i>halakha</i> defines it by its volume prior to cooking. Nevertheless, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that it is impure <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>And similarly,</b> the same principle applies <b>to an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>], and similarly with regard to</b> food <b>left over from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>].</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing <i>halakhot</i> that apply <b>by Torah law, this is</b> why the cases of <b><i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i> are</b> included in the <i>baraita</i>, as they also apply by Torah law. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> in the <i>baraita</i> apply <b>by rabbinic law, are there <i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i> by rabbinic law?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is not referring to the prohibitions of <i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i>. Rather, it means the following: <b>And similarly,</b> the same principle applies <b>with regard to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b><i>piggul</i>, and similarly with regard to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b><i>notar</i>.</b> There is a rabbinic decree that meat which is <i>piggul</i> or <i>notar</i> imparts impurity to one’s hands even if the meat itself was not impure. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that if the meat is at least the volume of an egg-bulk after it was cooked, it renders the hands impure in this manner.
The Gemara explains that this statement is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> the concepts of <b>impurity</b> imparted by <b><i>piggul</i> and impurity</b> imparted by <b><i>notar</i></b> apply <b>by rabbinic law, the Sages did not institute</b> a stringency to <b>such an extent,</b> making items that were less than the requisite volume until they were cooked contract and impart forms of impurity that apply <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> does apply to those forms of ritual impurity.
The Gemara continues to analyze this dispute. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>meat</b> of <b>an old</b> animal <b>that</b> initially <b>was</b> of a volume equivalent <b>to</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for contracting ritual impurity and became impure, after which it was cooked <b>and</b> as a result <b>shrank</b> until it was <b>less than</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for contracting impurity, it is considered <b>impure with regard to</b> items that touched it in <b>the past,</b> when it was large enough, <b>and</b> it is <b>pure</b> with regard to items that it may touch <b>from here on.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the current state of the item is decisive.
<b>Rabba said,</b> in explanation of the dispute between the <i>amora’im</i>: <b>Anywhere,</b> i.e., with regard to any item, <b>that was initially of</b> a volume equivalent to the requisite measure, <b>but now it is not of</b> such a volume, the <i>halakha</i> is determined according to the item’s current volume, and <b>it is not of</b> the requisite volume. Conversely, <b>anywhere,</b> i.e., with regard to any item, <b>that initially was not of</b> the requisite measure <b>but now it is of</b> sufficient volume, the item contracts impurity <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

Daf 54b

<b>When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>where</b> the food initially <b>had</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for ritual impurity, <b>and it shrank</b> until it was less than this measure, <b>and</b> subsequently it <b>again swelled</b> to the requisite measure for contracting impurity. The dispute is <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon, and Reish Lakish, <b>holds: There is disqualification with regard to a ritual matter,</b> including impurity. In other words, if at a certain point the food was less than the requisite measure it becomes entirely disqualified from contracting ritual impurity, even if it subsequently swells again. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rav, Rav Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds: There is no disqualification with regard to a ritual matter.</b> Even if at a certain stage the food lost its ability to contract impurity, if it later swells it can once again become impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there one who says</b> that <b>there is disqualification with regard to ritual matters? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:6): In the case <b>of an egg-bulk</b> of a ritually impure <b>food that one placed in the sun and</b> that therefore <b>shrank</b> to less than an egg-bulk; <b>and similarly</b> in the case of <b>an olive-bulk</b> of flesh <b>of a corpse,</b> or <b>an olive-bulk of an animal carcass, or a lentil-bulk of a creeping animal,</b> all of which impart impurity; <b>or an olive-bulk</b> of <b><i>piggul</i>, or an olive-bulk</b> of <b><i>notar</i>, or an olive-bulk</b> of forbidden <b>fat,</b> if any of these were placed in the sun and shrank, they <b>are pure,</b> i.e., they do not impart impurity to other items, <b>and one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for them due to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b>
The mishna continues: If, after they shrank in the sun, one took these foods and <b>placed them in the rain,</b> as a result of which <b>they</b> again <b>swelled</b> to the minimum volume for ritual impurity, <b>they are impure,</b> as was the case before they shrank. This applies to the impurity of a corpse, the impurity of an animal carcass, and the impurity of foods, <b>and one is</b> also <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for them due to <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> This demonstrates that the food is not permanently disqualified. Therefore, <b>the refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>there is disqualification with regard to ritual matters</b> is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute over whether food is to be measured in its current volume or according to its initial volume. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 4:2): <b>One may separate <i>teruma</i></b> and tithes from fresh <b>figs for dried figs,</b> which have shrunk and are now smaller than they were when they were fresh. In other words, one may designate fresh figs as <i>teruma</i> and tithe to exempt the dried figs, despite the difference between these two types of figs. This separation may be performed only <b>by number,</b> e.g., ten fresh figs for ninety dried figs. One may not set aside this <i>teruma</i> by volume, i.e., by separating fresh figs with a volume of one-tenth of the measure of dried figs. The reason is that the volume of the fresh figs is greater than that of the dried figs, so he would set aside fewer fresh figs than he would if he calculated by number.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>one measures</b> food items <b>as they were</b> initially, then since when the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> began, the volume of the dried figs was the same as the fresh ones, then it is <b>well;</b> the amount of figs to be separated as <i>teruma</i> should be calculated based on number, disregarding their current volume. <b>But if you say</b> that foods are to be measured <b>as they</b> currently <b>are,</b> then since the volume of the dried figs is smaller than that of the fresh figs, he will separate a larger amount than necessary, and <b>this</b> case is an example of one who <b>increases</b> his <b>tithes.</b>
<b>And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Demai</i> 8:10): In the case of <b>one who increases</b> his <b>tithes,</b> i.e., he designates more than one-tenth of the produce as tithe, the remainder of <b>his produce is rendered fit</b> for consumption, as it has been properly tithed. <b>But his tithes are ruined,</b> as the amount over one-tenth is not tithe, and it was not itself tithed, so it remains untithed produce. If so, how can the fresh figs be considered proper <i>teruma</i> and tithes in this case?
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> will you claim; that one measures foods <b>as they were</b> initially? If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: One may separate tithes from <b>dried figs for</b> fresh <b>figs</b> only <b>by measure</b> of volume, i.e., dried figs that are one-tenth of the volume of the fresh figs. One may not separate by number, as this would result in fewer dried figs than separation by volume.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that one measures foods <b>as they are</b> currently, it is <b>well. But if you say</b> that one measures foods <b>as they were</b> initially, when the dried figs were fresh, it should be enough to set aside a smaller number of dried figs corresponding to the fresh ones. Since the <i>baraita</i> instructs him to separate a larger number of dried figs than required, this too <b>is</b> an example of <b>one who increases</b> his <b>tithes.</b>
Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> cannot serve as proof for either opinion. Since the two statements of the <i>baraita</i> appear contradictory, it must be that this <i>baraita</i> is actually not discussing tithes, which must be separated according to a precise measure. <b>Rather, here we are dealing with standard <i>teruma</i>.</b> By Torah law there is no fixed measure for standard <i>teruma</i>; a single kernel of grain exempts the entire crop. The Sages established a range of measures: One-fortieth for a generous gift, one-fiftieth for an average gift, and one-sixtieth for a miserly gift. Accordingly, one who wishes to give generously should give slightly more than the exact measure. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is speaking of one who wishes to separate <i>teruma</i> <b>generously, and</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where he also gives more than necessary, <b>it</b> is also referring to one who wishes to separate his <i>teruma</i> <b>generously.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, say the last clause: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Father,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei, <b>would set aside ten dried figs that</b> were <b>in a vessel for ninety</b> fresh figs <b>that</b> were <b>in a basket. And if</b> this <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>standard <i>teruma</i>,</b> then with regard to this mention of <b>ten</b> dried figs, <b>what is its purpose?</b> This proportion was greater by orders of magnitude than even the amount of a generous gift established by the Sages.
<b>Rather, here we are dealing with <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> which the Levite separates from his tithe and gives to a priest. This <i>teruma</i> is one-tenth of the first tithe. <b>And</b> this ruling <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Elazar ben Gomel. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Elazar ben Gomel says</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And your <i>teruma</i> [<i>terumatkhem</i>] shall be reckoned to you</b> as though it were the grain of the threshing floor” (Numbers 18:27), that in using a plural term of the word “your,” <b>the verse speaks about two <i>terumot</i>. One is standard <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., the grain of the threshing floor, <b>and</b> the other <b>one is <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b> The verse equates these two <i>terumot</i>.
Abba Elazar ben Gomel explains: <b>Just as standard <i>teruma</i> is taken by estimate,</b> as there is no requirement for the amount separated to be measured precisely; <b>and</b> it can be taken <b>by thought,</b> as one is not required to physically separate it before consuming the remaining produce, <b>so too, <i>teruma</i> of the tithe may be taken by estimate</b>

Daf 55a

<b>and by thought. And</b> this comparison also teaches that <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>standard <i>teruma</i></b> one should give <b>generously, so too,</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe</b> one should give <b>generously.</b> Therefore, one who separates <i>teruma</i> of the tithe from fresh figs for dried figs should do so generously, e.g., ten fresh figs for ninety dried ones, as though the volume of the dried figs was as large as that of fresh ones.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And from this</b> statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, one can cite a proof for the opinion that food is to be measured in accordance with its initial size. As <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Father would set aside ten dried figs that</b> were <b>in a vessel for ninety</b> fresh figs <b>that</b> were <b>in a basket. Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we say</b> one measures food items <b>as they were</b> initially, it is <b>well,</b> as Rabbi Yosei apparently considers the dried figs set aside as tithes as though they were still fresh figs. <b>But if you say</b> that one measures foods <b>as they are</b> in their current state, then in a case where one separates ten dried figs for ninety fresh figs <b>they are less</b> than the requisite amount, as the volume of ten dried figs is less than the volume of ten fresh figs. This indicates that the measure of the food is determined according to its initial state.
The Gemara answers that one cannot extrapolate from the example of dried figs to other cases. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> the following reason for that particular <i>halakha</i>: <b>Dried figs are different, since one can boil</b> dried figs in water <b>and return them to</b> their previous state; in other words, <b>as they were</b> when they were fresh. Consequently, one may separate them for fresh figs as though they too were fresh. One cannot extrapolate from here a principle with regard to other items.
§ The Gemara discusses the possibility of separating fresh figs as <i>teruma</i> for dried ones. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may separate <i>teruma</i></b> from fresh <b>figs for dried figs</b> by number, e.g., ten fresh figs for ninety dried ones, <b>in a place where they are accustomed to make</b> fresh <b>figs</b> into <b>dried figs,</b> and therefore the fresh figs can be preserved by processing them into dried figs. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> set aside <i>teruma</i> from <b>dried figs for</b> fresh <b>figs even in a place where they are accustomed to make</b> fresh <b>figs</b> into <b>dried figs.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: One may separate <i>teruma</i></b> from fresh <b>figs for dried figs in a place where they are accustomed to make</b> fresh <b>figs</b> into <b>dried figs.</b> This indicates that <b>in a place where they are accustomed</b> to make dried figs, <b>yes,</b> one may set aside <i>teruma</i> in this manner. But <b>in a place where they are not accustomed</b> to make dried figs, one may <b>not</b> separate from fresh figs for dried ones, as the fresh figs are liable to spoil before they can be used.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where there is a priest</b> present, and the owner of the produce can give him the <i>teruma</i> without delay, then even in <b>a place where he is not accustomed</b> to make dried figs, <b>why</b> may he <b>not</b> set aside fresh figs for dried ones? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): In <b>a place where there is a priest</b> present, the owner of the produce <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from the</b> best-quality produce? In this case, the fresh figs are superior in quality to the dried ones, despite the fact that dried figs last longer.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where there is no priest</b> present, and by the time a priest is found the fresh figs might spoil. If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> set aside <i>teruma</i> from <b>dried figs for</b> fresh <b>figs even in a place where they are accustomed to make</b> fresh <b>figs</b> into <b>dried figs. And if</b> this is referring to a situation <b>where there is no priest</b> present, <b>why</b> may one <b>not</b> set aside dried figs, which can be preserved for a lengthy period, for fresh ones? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the same mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): In <b>a place where there is no priest</b> present, the owner of the produce <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from that which will endure,</b> not from the best-quality produce? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that this clause is referring to a situation <b>where there is a priest</b> present.
The Gemara challenges: If so, <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> addresses a case <b>where there is no priest</b> present, whereas <b>the latter clause</b> addresses a case <b>where there is a priest</b> present. The Gemara explains: <b>Yes, the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> addresses a case <b>where there is no priest</b> present, and <b>the latter clause</b> addresses a case <b>where there is a priest</b> present.
<b>Rav Pappa said: Learn from</b> this discussion that <b>we exert</b> ourselves <b>and interpret the mishna according to two reasons,</b> i.e., two different situations in accordance with the opinion of one <i>tanna</i>, <b>but we do not interpret</b> it as being in accordance with the opinions <b>of two <i>tanna’im</i>.</b> An interpretation that maintains a single authorship of a mishna is preferable even if it requires explaining the mishna as discussing two different situations.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal-offerings</b> that come as <i>matza</i> <b>are</b> to be <b>kneaded with lukewarm</b> water so that the dough will bake well, as only a small amount of oil is added. <b>And one must watch over them</b> to ensure <b>that they do not</b> become <b>leaven</b> while kneading and shaping them, <b>and if</b> a meal offering or even only <b>its remainder becomes leaven, one violates a prohibition, as it is stated: “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven;</b> as you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). <b>And one is liable</b> to be flogged <b>for kneading</b> the meal offering, <b>and for shaping</b> it, <b>and for baking</b> it, if the meal offering becomes leaven.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that one who allows the remainder of a meal offering to become leavened violates a prohibition. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said: The verse states: “It shall not be baked with leaven.</b> I have given it as <b>their portion</b> of My offerings made by fire” (Leviticus 6:10). This section of the verse can be read as a single sentence, to indicate: <b>Even their portion</b> of meal offerings, i.e., the remainder eaten by priests after the removal of the handful to be burned on the altar, <b>shall not be baked with leaven.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>this</b> verse <b>come for this</b> purpose? It cannot, as <b>it is necessary</b> as the source for a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“It shall not</b>

Daf 55b

<b>be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Isn’t</b> this requirement <b>already stated</b> earlier: <b>“No</b> meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord <b>shall be made with leaven;</b> as you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11)? Rather, the phrase “it shall not be baked with leaven” serves to teach a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>Since</b> the prohibition concerning leaven <b>is</b> first <b>stated</b> in general terms: <b>Shall not be made with leaven,</b> without specification, one <b>might</b> have thought that one who causes a meal offering to become leaven <b>will be liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes <b>for all of</b> his actions, i.e., kneading, shaping, and baking the dough. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall not be baked</b> with leaven,” which teaches that one who causes a meal offering to become leaven is liable separately for baking it, and for each stage of its preparation.
The <i>baraita</i> explains this derivation: <b>Baking</b> leaven <b>was</b> included <b>in the general</b> prohibition incorporating all of the stages involved in preparing the meal offering. <b>Why</b> did <b>it emerge</b> from the generalization to be mentioned explicitly? It emerged in order <b>to compare</b> the other stages <b>to it: Just as</b> the act of <b>baking is notable</b> in <b>that it is a single,</b> i.e., separately defined, <b>action, and one is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for it by itself</b> if the dough is leaven, <b>so too, I will include</b> the other stages of the preparation of a meal offering, i.e., <b>kneading it and shaping it,</b> and conclude that one is liable separately for each of these actions if the dough is leavened.
<b>And</b> the same applies to <b>any single action involved in</b> the preparation of a meal offering. This statement serves <b>to include</b> the act of <b>smoothing</b> the surface of the dough with water. The reason this act is included is that although it is not a significant stage in the preparation of the dough, <b>it is a single,</b> independent <b>action, and</b> therefore <b>one is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for it by itself.</b> This <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that one cannot derive the prohibition against allowing the remainder of a meal offering to become leavened from the verse: “It shall not be baked with leaven,” as this verse is the source of a different <i>halakha</i>. If so, from where is that prohibition derived?
The Gemara answers: The verse: “It shall not be baked with leaven,” is required for the principle stated earlier. <b>We say</b> that the prohibition against allowing the remainder of a meal offering to become leavened is derived <b>from</b> the subsequent phrase: “I have given it as <b>their portion</b> of My offerings made by fire” (Leviticus 6:10). The remainder is the portion of the meal offering eaten by the priests.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> once it has been determined that the term “their portion” teaches the prohibition against leavening the remainder of a meal offering, one can <b>say</b> this <b>entire</b> section of the verse <b>comes</b> only <b>for this</b> purpose, which would mean that there is no source for the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable separately for each stage of the preparation of a meal offering with leaven.
The Gemara answers: One cannot say that this teaches only the prohibition against leavening the remainder of a meal offering, as <b>if so, let</b> the verse <b>write: Their portion shall not be baked with leaven. What</b> is meant by the fact that the verse stated it in a different order: <b>“Shall not be baked with leaven.</b> I have given it as <b>their portion”?</b> This indicates that one should <b>learn from this two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, i.e., that there is a prohibition against leavening the remainder of a meal offering and that one is liable to receive a separate set of lashes for each stage of preparation performed with leavened dough.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the act of <b>baking</b> is different, <b>as the Merciful One specified it</b> in the Torah, and therefore <b>one should be liable</b> to receive <b>one</b> set of lashes for baking the dough. As for the <b>other</b> stages in the preparation of a meal offering, i.e., kneading, shaping, and smoothing, which are not explicitly stated in the verse, <b>let him be liable</b> to receive <b>one</b> set of lashes <b>for all of them.</b> The Gemara answers that this cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, <b>because</b> baking <b>is something that was included in a generalization but emerged from the generalization</b> in order <b>to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i>. According to a hermeneutic principle, a case of this kind <b>did not emerge to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> only <b>about itself, but</b> rather it <b>emerged to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>about the entire generalization,</b> in this case, about all the other stages in the preparation of a meal offering.
The Gemara further challenges: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the phrase: <b>Shall not be made</b> with leaven, is <b>a generalization,</b> as it does not mention any specific acts, and the phrase: <b>“It shall not be baked</b> with leaven,” is <b>a detail,</b> as it specifies one particular stage of the preparation; and there is another standard hermeneutic principle: When there is <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization</b> is referring <b>only</b> to <b>that which</b> is specified <b>in the detail.</b> In this case, that would mean that <b>baking, yes,</b> is included in this prohibition, but <b>other matters,</b> e.g., kneading and shaping, are <b>not</b> included.
<b>Rabbi Aptoriki said:</b> That hermeneutic principle is not relevant here, <b>because</b> this <b>is</b> a case of <b>a generalization and a detail that</b> appear in the Torah <b>distanced from one another,</b> as the phrase: Shall not be made with leaven (Leviticus 2:11), is far from the expression: “It shall not be baked with leaven” (Leviticus 6:10). <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> instance of <b>a generalization and a detail that</b> appear in the Torah <b>distanced from one another, one cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from <b>them by</b> analyzing them as <b>a generalization and a detail.</b>
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava raises an objection, and some say</b> that this objection is <b>unattributed [<i>kedi</i>]: And</b> is it correct that in the case of <b>a generalization and a detail that</b> appear in the Torah <b>distanced from one another, one cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from <b>them by</b> analyzing them as <b>a generalization and a detail? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a goat brought by a king as a sin offering: The verse states: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat, <b>and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:24). <b>Where is the burnt offering slaughtered? On the northern</b> side of the Temple courtyard, as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:11). <b>This</b> sin offering of a king must consequently <b>also</b> be slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And do you learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here? But isn’t it already stated:</b> “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin offering: <b>In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered</b> before God; it is most holy” (Leviticus 6:18)? If so, <b>to what</b> purpose <b>was this singled out?</b> Why does the Torah state explicitly that the sin offering of the king requires slaughter in the north? The <i>baraita</i> answers: It is <b>to fix</b> a place <b>for it,</b> that this is the only place where a sin offering may be slaughtered, teaching <b>that if he did not slaughter it in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>he has disqualified it</b> even after the fact.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>singled out for this</b> purpose, to teach that even after the fact a sin offering slaughtered anywhere other than in the north is disqualified? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> to teach <b>that this</b> goat sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north, but no other</b> goat sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north.</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states</b> elsewhere: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin offering, <b>and slaughter the sin offering in the place of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:29), and <b>this established a paradigm for all sin offerings, that they require</b> slaughter in the <b>north.</b> Therefore, the additional verse stated with regard to the sin offering of a king teaches that if he did not slaughter it in the north it is disqualified.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. The <b>reason</b> that all sin offerings must be slaughtered in the north is <b>that the Merciful One wrote: “And slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering,”</b> from which it can be inferred that if <b>not for this</b> verse <b>I would say that</b> only <b>this</b> sin offering, the male goat brought by a king, <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north, but no other</b> type of sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north. What is the reason</b> for this? After all, the verse: “In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered,” appears to be referring to all types of sin offerings.
<b>Isn’t</b> it <b>because</b> this verse <b>is a generalization and a detail,</b> as the verse first generalizes about all sin offerings, and then the verse concerning the sin offering of a king: “And slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering,” is a detail, as it is referring to a specific sin offering? <b>And even though</b> the verse concerning sin offerings and the verse concerning the sin offering of a king are <b>distanced from one another,</b> nevertheless <b>we</b> would <b>derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from <b>them by</b> means of the principle of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b> This appears to disprove the explanation of Rabbi Aptoriki.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> claim raised by Rav Adda bar Ahava: Is <b>this a generalization and a detail? It is</b> in fact <b>a detail and a generalization,</b> as the verse: “And slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:24), appears in the Torah earlier than the verse: “In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered the sin offering shall be slaughtered” (Leviticus 6:18). A hermeneutic principle states that in this case <b>the generalization adds to the detail, and includes all matters.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the reason that if not for the specific textual derivation we would have thought that only a sin offering brought by a king requires slaughter in the north is that the word <b>“it,”</b> which is an exclusion, is <b>difficult for the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, as it is unclear what this term serves to exclude. <b>And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Or</b> perhaps the verse <b>is</b> teaching that <b>only this</b> sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north, but no other</b> type of sin offering <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north, as the Merciful One writes “it,”</b> which is an exclusion. Therefore, the additional verse: “And slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering,” teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies to all burnt offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives it from</b> the phrase: <b>“And slaughter the sin offering</b> in the place of the burnt offering,” <b>to exclude what</b> does the term <b>“it”</b> serve? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude</b> the case that emerges from the following discussion, summarized by the <b>mnemonic: Nahshon; and slaughter; bird; on Passover.</b>
The Gemara explains the first suggestion: <b>It,</b> the goat sin offering of a king, is slaughtered <b>in the north, but</b> the <b>goat</b> offered by <b>Nahshon,</b> prince of the tribe of Judah, was <b>not</b> slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Tabernacle. He, along with all the other princes of the tribes, brought offerings to inaugurate the altar and the Tabernacle, as recorded in the Torah (see Numbers, chapter 7). The sin offerings brought at this time were unique because they were not brought to atone for any sin. The term “it” teaches that even though they had some characteristics of a sin offering, the offerings of the princes did not require slaughter in the north.
The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the sin offerings of the princes <b>are included in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands, they are also included in</b> the requirement to be slaughtered in the <b>north.</b> Therefore, the term “it” <b>teaches us</b> that there was no requirement of slaughter in the north for the goats brought as sin offerings by Nahshon and the other princes.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the animal <b>itself</b> applies to the goats offered by Nahshon and the other princes? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering of a king: <b>“And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat,</b> and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The verse could have stated: Upon its head. The reason it adds “of the goat” is <b>to include</b> the <b>goat</b> brought as a sin offering by <b>Nahshon in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b>

Daf 56a

The term “of the goat” serves <b>to include</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as communal sin offerings for <b>idol worship in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering.
<b>Ravina objects to this:</b> This <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says that the offering of Nahshon was included in the requirement of placing hands on the head of the animal. But <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, what is there to say?</b> Why should the Torah write the term “it,” since there is no reason to assume that it would require slaughter in the north?
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina:</b> And <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda as well,</b> why not say that for <b>that which it was included,</b> i.e., placing hands on the head of an animal, <b>it was included; and</b> for <b>that which it was not included,</b> i.e., slaughter in the north, <b>it was not included.</b> Why would one think that the obligation to slaughter in the north applies to the offering of Nahshon merely because the requirement of placing hands applies to that offering?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>had the verse not excluded</b> the offerings of the princes <b>I would say</b> that one could <b>derive</b> the requirement for slaughter in the north <b>via a paradigm</b> from all other sin offerings, <b>if so,</b> one could also <b>derive</b> the requirement for <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an animal <b>itself via</b> the same <b>paradigm. Rather,</b> the reason that the requirement of placing hands cannot be derived via a paradigm is that <b>we do not learn</b> the requirements of the sin offering of Nahshon, which was for the <b>time</b> of the inauguration of the Tabernacle alone, <b>from</b> the requirements of sin offerings applicable to all <b>generations. So too,</b> the requirement of slaughter in the north cannot be derived via a paradigm because <b>we do not learn</b> the requirements of the sin offering of Nahshon, which was for the <b>time</b> of the inauguration of the Tabernacle alone, <b>from</b> the requirement of sin offerings applicable to all <b>generations.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the term “it” stated with regard to the sin offering of a king serves to teach that <b>it</b> must be slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>but the one who slaughters</b> it does <b>not</b> need to stand <b>in the north</b> when he slaughters. The offering would be valid even if he were to stand in the south of the courtyard and use a long knife to slaughter the animal that is positioned in the north.
The Gemara challenges this: The <i>halakha</i> of the one who slaughters has already been <b>derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Aḥiyya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Aḥiyya says:</b> The verse states with regard to the burnt offering: <b>“And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward</b> before God” (Leviticus 1:11). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the exclusionary term “it”?
He explains: <b>Since we have found</b> that the priest <b>stands in the north and collects</b> the blood from the neck of the animal <b>in the north, and if he stood in the south and collected</b> the blood <b>in the north</b> the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this is <b>so also</b> with regard to <b>this</b> one who slaughters the offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall slaughter <b>it,”</b> to teach that <b>it,</b> the animal, must be <b>in the north, but the one who slaughters</b> does <b>not</b> have to be standing <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard when he slaughters the animal. The question returns: What is derived from the exclusionary term “it” stated with regard to the sin offering of a king?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the term “it” stated with regard to the sin offering of a king serves to teach that <b>it,</b> a goat brought as a sin offering, must be slaughtered <b>in the north, but a bird</b> brought as an offering does <b>not</b> need to be killed <b>in the north.</b> It might <b>enter your mind to say: Let it be derived</b> that a bird must be killed in the north by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sheep,</b> as follows: <b>Just as</b> is the case for <b>a sheep</b> brought as a burnt offering, <b>that</b> the Torah <b>did not fix</b> that <b>its</b> slaughter must be performed by <b>a priest,</b> yet nevertheless it <b>fixed</b> that <b>its</b> slaughter must be in the <b>north,</b> with regard to <b>a bird</b> brought as an offering, for <b>which</b> the Torah <b>did fix</b> that <b>its</b> slaughter must be performed by <b>a priest, is it not logical that</b> the Torah <b>should</b> also <b>fix its</b> slaughter in the <b>north?</b> Therefore, the verse states “it,” to exclude a bird from the requirement of being killed in the north.
The Gemara questions the logical inference. One cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> of a bird offering from the <i>halakha</i> of a sheep offering, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about a sheep offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the Torah <b>fixed</b> the requirement that <b>it</b> be slaughtered with <b>a utensil,</b> i.e., a knife. By contrast, a bird is killed by the priest pinching the nape of its neck with his fingernail, without a utensil. Therefore, the term “it” cannot serve to counter this derivation. If so, there is no reason to think that a bird should also have to be killed in the north, and the term “it” is not necessary to exclude this possibility.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the term “it” stated with regard to the sin offering of a king serves to teach that <b>it,</b> the goat of the king, is slaughtered <b>in the north, but</b> the <b>Paschal offering</b> is <b>not</b> slaughtered <b>in the north.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: The <i>halakha</i> that the <b>Paschal offering</b> need not be slaughtered in the north is not derived from the term: “It,” but rather it is <b>derived as</b> stated by <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a Paschal offering requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north. And this</b> can be derived through <b>a logical inference: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a burnt offering,</b> for <b>which</b> the Torah <b>did not fix a time for its slaughter</b> yet <b>fixed</b> that <b>it</b> requires slaughter in the <b>north,</b> with regard to <b>a Paschal offering,</b> for <b>which</b> the Torah <b>fixed a time for its slaughter,</b> i.e., it must be slaughtered in the afternoon of the fourteenth day of Nisan, <b>is it not logical that</b> the Torah <b>would fix</b> that <b>it</b> must be slaughtered in the <b>north?</b> Therefore, the verse states “it,” to exclude the Paschal offering from the requirement of slaughter in the north.
The Gemara questions the logical inference. One cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> of a Paschal offering from the <i>halakha</i> of a burnt offering, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the Torah teaches that <b>it is entirely</b> burned on the altar. This is not so with regard to a Paschal offering.
The Gemara continues: If you would suggest learning a logical inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sin offering,</b> which is not entirely burned upon the altar yet is slaughtered only in the north, this too can be refuted. As <b>what</b> is notable <b>about a sin offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it</b> has the power to <b>atone for</b> those sins <b>liable for</b> punishment by <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>],</b> which is not so with regard to a Paschal offering.
The Gemara continues: If you would suggest learning a logical inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a guilt offering,</b> which is not entirely burned, does not atone for those sins liable for punishment by <i>karet</i>, and is slaughtered only in the north, this too can be refuted. As <b>what</b> is notable <b>about a guilt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> which is not so with regard to a Paschal offering. The Gemara adds: Having noted this distinction between a guilt offering and a Paschal offering, one can say that for <b>all of</b> the three offerings the <i>halakha</i> of a Paschal offering cannot be derived <b>from</b> them <b>either, since</b> each of them is <b>an offering of the most sacred order.</b>
The Gemara returns to the earlier inference: <b>Rather,</b> the term “it” teaches <b>as we said initially: It,</b> i.e., the animal, must be standing <b>in the north, but</b> the <b>one who slaughters</b> the animal does <b>not</b> have to stand <b>in the north. And that</b> which is <b>difficult for you,</b> that <b>we derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Aḥiyya,</b> is in fact not difficult. The derivation <b>of Rabbi Aḥiyya</b> from the term “it” <b>does not come to exclude</b> one who <b>slaughters</b> from the requirement to slaughter <b>in the north,</b> since that is known already from the term “it” stated with regard to the sin offering of a king. <b>Rather, this is what</b> Rabbi Aḥiyya <b>is saying:</b> The <b>one who slaughters</b> the animal does <b>not</b> have to stand <b>in the north, but</b> by inference, the one who <b>collects</b> the blood from the neck of the animal must stand <b>in the north.</b>
The Gemara questions this inference: The <i>halakha</i> that the one who <b>collects</b> the blood from the neck of the animal must stand in the north is derived <b>from</b> the fact that the Torah could have written: The priest <b>shall take,</b> and instead writes: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take”</b> (Leviticus 4:34). The Gemara explains: This <i>tanna</i> <b>does not learn</b> anything from this distinction between: The priest <b>shall take,</b> and: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take.”</b> Since he does not agree with this derivation, he must therefore derive the requirement to collect the blood while standing in the north from a different verse.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one is liable</b> to be flogged <b>for kneading</b> the meal offering, <b>and for shaping it, and for baking it,</b> if the meal offering becomes leaven. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> If one <b>baked</b> a meal offering as leaven he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>one for shaping</b> the dough <b>and one for baking it.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But you said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> the act of baking is <b>notable</b> in <b>that it is a single action and one is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for it by itself;</b> this indicates that one receives one set of lashes for baking a meal offering as leavened bread, not two.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> statement of the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that one receives a single set of lashes for baking, is referring to a case <b>where he shaped</b> the dough <b>and he,</b> the same person, also <b>baked</b> it. Since he already incurred liability to receive lashes for shaping the dough before he baked it, he is not liable again for shaping when he bakes it. <b>That</b> statement of Rav Pappa, that one who bakes the dough is liable to receive two sets of lashes, is referring to a situation <b>where another</b> person <b>shaped</b> the dough <b>and gave</b> the shaped dough <b>to him, and he baked</b> it. Although the one who shaped it is liable to receive lashes for the act of shaping, nevertheless, the one who bakes it is liable to receive two sets of lashes, as his act of baking also completed the shaping of the dough.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the leavening of a meal offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bekhorot</i> 3:6): In the case of an unblemished <b>firstborn</b> kosher <b>animal</b> whose <b>blood</b> circulation is <b>constricted,</b> a condition that can be healed only through bloodletting, <b>one may let</b> the animal’s <b>blood</b> by cutting it <b>in a place where</b> the incision <b>does not cause</b> a permanent <b>blemish. But one may not let</b> the animal’s <b>blood</b> by cutting it <b>in a place where</b> the incision <b>causes</b> a permanent <b>blemish,</b> as it is prohibited to intentionally cause a blemish in a firstborn animal; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: One may even let</b> the animal’s blood by cutting it <b>in a place where</b> the incision <b>causes</b> a permanent <b>blemish, provided that he does not slaughter</b> the animal <b>on</b> the basis <b>of that blemish,</b> even though in general, a firstborn animal may be slaughtered once it develops a permanent blemish. The Rabbis maintain that in this case, since he caused the blemish himself, he may not slaughter it until it develops a different, unrelated blemish. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b>

Daf 56b

The animal <b>may even be slaughtered on</b> the basis <b>of that blemish. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the firstborn would <b>die</b> if its blood is not let, <b>one may not let its blood</b> at all.
The Gemara discusses similar cases, including examples involving meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All</b> of the Sages who disagree as to whether one may let the blood of a firstborn animal whose blood circulation is constricted <b>concede that one who leavens</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> another had already <b>leavened</b> it is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for the additional leavening, <b>as it is written:</b> “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord <b>shall be made with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 2:11), <b>and</b> it is also stated: <b>“It shall not be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10). This indicates that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a meal offering.
Similarly, everyone agrees <b>that one who castrates</b> an animal <b>after one who castrates</b> it <b>is liable, as it is written: “Those whose testicles are bruised, or crushed, or detached, or cut,</b> shall not be offered to the Lord, and you shall not do this in your land” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>If one is liable</b> when the seminal vesicles <b>are cut,</b> then when the testicles <b>are detached</b> altogether is he <b>not all the more so</b> liable? <b>Rather,</b> this verse serves to <b>include</b> one who <b>detaches</b> the testicles <b>after</b> one who <b>cuts</b> the seminal vesicles, to indicate <b>that he is liable.</b> Apparently, one is liable for castrating an animal that is already sterilized.
These Sages <b>disagree only with regard to one who inflicts a blemish on</b> an already <b>blemished</b> animal, such as one whose blood circulation is constricted. <b>Rabbi Meir maintains</b> that as the verse states: “It shall be perfect to be accepted; <b>there shall be no blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21), this categorical statement includes even the infliction of a blemish on an offering that is already blemished. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that the phrase <b>“it shall be perfect to be accepted”</b> indicates that the prohibition against inflicting a blemish applies only to an animal that is currently perfect, i.e., unblemished, and can therefore be accepted, meaning that it is suitable to be sacrificed upon the altar. If the animal is already blemished, there is no prohibition against inflicting an additional blemish upon it.
The Gemara analyzes this dispute. <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> from the phrase “there shall be no blemish in it,” <b>isn’t it written also: “It shall be perfect to be accepted”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> only an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> i.e., an animal that was born with a blemish. In such a case, there is no prohibition to inflict an additional blemish on it. But if the animal was initially unblemished and later developed a blemish, it is prohibited to inflict another blemish upon it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: There is no need to exclude an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> as <b>it is merely like a palm tree,</b> i.e., it is an item that can never attain the status of an animal consecrated as an offering. Therefore, it is obvious that the prohibition against inflicting a blemish does not apply to this animal.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Meir maintains that the phrase “it shall be perfect to be accepted” serves <b>to exclude disqualified consecrated animals,</b> to teach that <b>after their redemption,</b> when they become non-sacred, the prohibition against inflicting a blemish does not apply to them any longer. This exclusion is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>shear</b> disqualified consecrated animals <b>or</b> use them for <b>labor</b> even after they have been redeemed and are non-sacred, perhaps <b>let</b> it <b>also be prohibited</b> to inflict <b>a blemish upon them.</b> Consequently, this verse <b>teaches us</b> that there is no prohibition against inflicting a blemish upon these animals.
The Gemara analyzes the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis as well,</b> who base their opinion on the phrase: “It shall be perfect to be accepted,” <b>isn’t it written: “There shall not be any blemish in it,”</b> which indicates an expansion of the prohibition against inflicting a blemish? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“There shall not be any blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only that it may not have a blemish</b> caused directly by human action. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not cause</b> a blemish to be inflicted <b>upon it</b> indirectly <b>by means of other</b> agents, e.g., <b>that one may not place dough or</b> pressed <b>figs on its ear so that a dog will come and take it,</b> thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? <b>The verse states: “Any blemish.” It says: “Blemish,” and it says “Any blemish”;</b> the word “no” serves to teach that one may not cause a blemish indirectly.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the leavening of a meal offering. <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> If one <b>placed leaven,</b> i.e., dough that has leavened to such an extent that it is no longer used as food but as a leavening agent for other dough, <b>on top of</b> the <b>dough</b> of a meal offering, <b>and he went and sat himself</b> down to wait, meaning that he performed no other action, <b>and</b> the dough then <b>leavened of its own</b> accord, he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for it.</b> This is <b>similar to</b> performing a prohibited <b>action on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara questions this comparison: <b>And is one liable</b> for performing a prohibited <b>action on Shabbat</b> in <b>a case like this? But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b>

Daf 57a

that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of one who <b>placed meat on top of coals</b> on Shabbat, if he subsequently <b>turned over</b> the meat to its other side, so that both sides were roasted, he is <b>liable</b> for cooking on Shabbat. But if he <b>did not turn over</b> the meat he is <b>exempt,</b> as the meat is considered cooked only if both sides were roasted. If so, the same should apply to one who places leaven on the dough of a meal offering: He should be liable only if he turns the dough over. This contradicts the ruling of Rabbi Ami.
<b>Rava said: What</b> does Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>as well,</b> mean <b>when he says:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for it, similar to performing a prohibited action on Shabbat? He means that one who places leaven on the dough of a meal offering, even if he does not turn it over, is similar <b>to</b> one who performs a prohibited <b>action of roasting on Shabbat,</b> meaning that he is similar to one who turned over the roasting food on the coals.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of one who <b>placed meat on top of coals</b> on Shabbat, if he subsequently <b>turned over</b> the meat he is <b>liable</b> for cooking on Shabbat, and if he <b>did not turn over</b> the meat he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say</b> that this was a situation <b>where if</b> he does <b>not turn over</b> the meat it would <b>not cook,</b> then it is <b>obvious</b> that if he does not turn it over he is exempt. <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to a case <b>where</b> even <b>if</b> he <b>does not turn over</b> the meat it would nevertheless <b>cook.</b> But if so, <b>why isn’t he liable</b> for merely placing the meat on the coals, despite the fact that he did not turn it over?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where if</b> he does <b>not turn over</b> the meat it would <b>cook on one side</b> only partially, roughly one-third of the ordinary process of cooking, <b>like the food of ben Derosai. And</b> now <b>that he turns it over,</b> it <b>cooks on both sides like the food of ben Derosai. And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us that any</b> meat roasted <b>on</b> only <b>one side like the food of ben Derosai is nothing,</b> i.e., this is not a violation of the prohibited labor of cooking on Shabbat. If it was roasted on both sides like the food of ben Derosai this is classified as cooking, and he is liable for cooking on Shabbat.
The Gemara continues to discuss the case of meat roasted on one side on Shabbat. <b>Rava says: And if</b> a quantity of that meat equivalent in volume <b>to a fig-bulk was</b> fully <b>roasted on one side</b> of the meat and the roasted area was <b>in one spot</b> on the piece of meat, while the rest of the meat remained raw, he is <b>liable</b> for cooking on Shabbat. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> It can be inferred from Rava’s statement that if the fig-bulk of meat that was roasted was <b>in one spot, yes,</b> he is liable, whereas if the amount of the fig-bulk <b>was</b> distributed <b>over two or three</b> separate <b>spots</b> he is <b>not</b> liable. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 102b): <b>One who drills</b> a hole of <b>any</b> size <b>is liable</b> for the labor of building or the labor of striking a blow with a hammer to complete the production process of a vessel?
The Gemara analyzes that mishna: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the mishna is referring to one who drills a hole <b>in one spot</b> alone, why is he liable? <b>For what</b> purpose is a hole <b>of any size,</b> which includes a very small hole, <b>fit</b> to be used? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to one who drills holes <b>in two or three</b> different <b>spots,</b> and the reason he is liable is <b>that</b> these holes <b>are fit to</b> be <b>joined?</b> Builders who require a large hole will often start by drilling a few small holes which they later enlarge and join together. By the same logic, if the meat was roasted in a few spots he should be liable, as these can join together. The Gemara answers: <b>No; actually</b> the mishna is referring to one who drills <b>in</b> only <b>one spot,</b> as one can say <b>that</b> the hole <b>is fit as an entrance [<i>levava</i>] for</b> the placement of the tooth of <b>a key [<i>aklida</i>],</b> which is very small.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of this discussion: <b>Rava says: Even</b> if the fig-bulk of the meat that was fully roasted on only one side was distributed <b>over two or three</b> separate <b>spots,</b> he is liable for cooking on Shabbat. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna <b>as well: One who drills</b> a hole of <b>any</b> size is <b>liable. What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the hole is <b>in one spot</b> alone, why is he liable? <b>For what</b> purpose is a hole <b>of any size fit</b> to be used? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to one who drills holes <b>in two or three</b> different <b>spots,</b> and the reason he is liable is <b>that</b> these holes <b>are fit to</b> be <b>joined?</b> Similarly, in the case discussed by Rava, one is liable for the cooking of the meat in a few different spots which can join together. The Gemara answers: <b>No; actually</b> the mishna is referring to one who drills <b>in</b> only <b>one spot,</b> as one can say <b>that it is fit as an entrance for</b> the placement of the tooth of <b>a key.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to discussing the prohibition against leavening a meal offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning the deep-pan meal offering, the verse states: “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven; for any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). The term “meal offering” is apparently superfluous, and therefore the <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>Nothing that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven, I would say: I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>handful</b> removed from the meal offering for burning on the altar <b>alone</b> is included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall not be made with leaven,”</b> as only the handful is burned on the altar.
<b>From where</b> is it derived that one is liable for the leavening of <b>a meal offering</b> whose handful has not yet been removed? <b>The verse states: “Meal offering,”</b> to teach that the prohibition includes a meal offering before the removal of its handful. The Gemara asks: Since this verse is stated in the context of the deep-pan meal offering, <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is liable for leavening the <b>other meal offerings,</b> which are not mentioned in this passage? Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive phrase: <b>“No meal offering,”</b> to apply this <i>halakha</i> to other meal offerings.
The <i>baraita</i> continues to expound the verse. The phrase: <b>“That you shall bring to the Lord,”</b> indicates that this prohibition applies only to <b>a fit</b> meal offering, <b>but not</b> to a <b>disqualified</b> meal offering, e.g., a meal offering that was taken outside the Temple or that was rendered ritually impure. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that <b>one who leavens a fit</b> meal offering is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes, <b>but</b> one who leavens <b>a disqualified meal offering</b> is <b>exempt.</b>
With regard to the ruling that the prohibition against leavening does not apply to a disqualified meal offering, <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>leavened</b> a meal offering when it was fit, <b>and</b> subsequently someone removed the meal offering and it <b>emerged</b> from the Temple courtyard and was thereby disqualified, <b>and he again leavened it, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable for the second leavening as well? The Gemara explains the possibilities: Does one say that <b>since</b> it <b>emerged it is disqualified in</b> accordance with the status of a sacred item that <b>emerges</b> from its permitted area, <b>and</b> therefore <b>when he again leavens it he is not liable for it due to</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> one who already <b>leavened</b> it?
<b>Or perhaps, since</b> one already <b>leavened</b> the meal offering, from this point forward the <b>disqualification</b> of a sacred item that <b>emerges</b> from its permitted area <b>is ineffective with regard to</b> removing it from the prohibition against leavening, as the prohibition against emerging from the Temple itself applies only to a fit meal offering. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when he again leavens it he is liable for it due to</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening</b> a meal offering <b>after one who</b> already <b>leavened</b> it. No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Mari raises</b> another <b>dilemma</b> concerning the leavening of a meal offering. If a priest <b>leavened</b> a meal offering while standing <b>at the top of the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the possibilities: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “No meal offering <b>that you shall bring</b> to the Lord shall be made with leaven” (Leviticus 2:11), which indicates that this prohibition applies only to a meal offering that has not yet been brought to the Lord, i.e., to the altar. <b>And</b> therefore, as <b>this</b> meal offering <b>has</b> already been <b>brought</b> to the top of the altar, even though it has not yet been burned, perhaps it is not included in the prohibition.
<b>Or perhaps</b> any offering whose <b>burning has not yet</b> been performed <b>is considered like</b> one whose <b>action</b> of sacrifice <b>has not yet</b> been performed, despite the fact that it has already been brought to the top of the altar. If so, this meal offering is included in the prohibition against leavening. No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives from</b> the phrase: <b>“No meal offering,”</b> that the prohibition includes even a meal offering before the removal of its handful, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“That you shall bring,”</b> in the same verse? The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you shall bring,”</b> in order <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany certain animal offerings such as burnt offerings, peace offerings, and the sin offerings and guilt offerings of a leper <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b> Unlike the standard meal offerings, from which a handful is removed, these are entirely burned upon the altar, and the additional derivation is necessary to include them in the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include the shewbread in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b>
The Gemara clarifies these opinions: With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the Gemara asks: How is it possible to leaven <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations?</b> This type of meal offering is kneaded only with olive oil, which <b>is</b> a type of <b>fruit juice,</b>

Daf 57b

<b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>fruit juices do not leaven</b> dough. <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili would say:</b> Even though the oil of <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> is plentiful, sometimes one might also <b>knead</b> a meal offering <b>with</b> some <b>water,</b> if he considers it necessary to add it, <b>and</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If so, it is possible for this meal offering to leaven due to the water, and therefore the verse: “That you shall bring,” teaches that the prohibition against leavening also applies to this type of meal offering.
The Gemara asks: With regard to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, the vessel into which a tenth of an ephah of flour for baking the <b>shewbread is</b> placed in <b>is a measuring</b> vessel for <b>dry</b> items, <b>and we have heard that Rabbi Akiva said:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items were <b>not consecrated</b> as service vessels. This means the shewbread becomes consecrated only when it is placed on the Table in the Sanctuary, after it has been baked. If so, at this stage, the prohibition against leavening is not relevant.
In answer to this question, the Gemara states that <b>Rabbi Reuven sent</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, in which he cited a statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is the</b> correct <b>version [<i>hetze’ah</i>] of</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>, and</b> one should <b>reverse</b> the names of the Sages in it: The phrase <b>“that you shall bring”</b> serves <b>to include the shewbread in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b> Consequently, there is no contradiction between Rabbi Akiva’s statement here and his statement with regard to measuring vessels for dry items.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili is the one who maintains that the measuring vessels for dry items were consecrated, <b>follows [<i>ve’azda</i>] his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> stated elsewhere. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and one of the students of Rabbi Yishmael</b> both <b>said the same thing. And who is</b> that student of Rabbi Yishmael? It is <b>Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the consecration of the Tabernacle and its vessels before their inauguration: “And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all its vessels, and the altar and all its vessels, <b>and had anointed them and sanctified them”</b> (Numbers 7:1). <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items, e.g., oil, and wine for libations, were <b>anointed</b> and thereby consecrated <b>both on</b> the <b>inside and on</b> the <b>outside.</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items, such as the flour for meal offerings, <b>were anointed</b> and consecrated only <b>on</b> the <b>inside, but were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items <b>were anointed on</b> the <b>inside and were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside,</b> whereas the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>were not anointed at all.</b> Rabbi Yonatan cites a proof for his opinion: <b>You can know</b> that the measuring vessels for dry items were not consecrated at all, <b>because</b> it is taught that these vessels <b>do not consecrate</b> items placed inside them. <b>As it is written: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts of a ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven, for first produce to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>When</b> are <b>they</b> considered consecrated <b>to the Lord?</b> Only <b>after they are baked</b> with leaven. This demonstrates that when the flour is placed into the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel the meal offering is not yet consecrated.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the interpretation of the word “them” in the phrase: “And sanctified <b>them”</b> (Numbers 7:1). Both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that the term “them” serves to exclude something from the anointing and consecration, but they disagree over what is excluded. <b>Rabbi Yoshiya maintains</b> that <b>“them”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the consecration of the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items on the <b>outside,</b> i.e., only the inside of the vessels is consecrated. <b>And Rabbi Yonatan maintains</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>are non-sacred,</b> i.e., not consecrated at all, <b>and</b> therefore <b>it is not necessary</b> for the <b>verse to exclude</b> them. <b>Where it was necessary</b> for the <b>verse to exclude</b> something, it was with regard to <b>measuring</b> vessels used for <b>liquid</b> items, to teach that they are consecrated only on the inside but not <b>on</b> the <b>outside.</b>
The Gemara asks: Since the dispute between Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan concerns the <i>halakha</i> of measuring vessels for dry items, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say also,</b> as he did with regard to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Yoshiya: <b>Rabbi Akiva and one of the students of Rabbi Yishmael</b> both <b>said the same thing, and who is</b> that student? <b>Rabbi Yonatan.</b> The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say this <b>due to</b> the fact that their opinions <b>are not the same with regard to measuring</b> vessels used for <b>liquid</b> items: Rabbi Akiva maintains that these vessels are consecrated both on the inside and on the outside, whereas Rabbi Yonatan rules that they are consecrated only on the inside.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> How can it be suggested, according to the opinion that the measuring vessels for dry items were not consecrated, that the shewbread is consecrated only when it is placed on the Table? <b>But</b> before that <b>there is</b> the stage in which the dough is placed into the <b>receptacle [<i>bisa</i>]</b> in which it is kneaded. Since this vessel <b>is</b> used for <b>liquid</b> items, the dough should be consecrated at that point. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: This is referring to a case <b>where he kneaded</b> the dough <b>on top of</b> a flat <b>leather spread [<i>katavliyya</i>],</b> which does not sanctify the dough.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>that which Rabbi Yonatan said to</b> Rabbi Yoshiya as proof of his opinion, that <b>you can know</b> that it is so, <b>as</b> it is taught that these vessels <b>do not consecrate</b> items placed inside them, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoshiya <b>say to him</b> in refutation of his claim: This is referring to a case <b>where he measured</b> the flour for the two loaves <b>in</b> a vessel used for measuring <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, but it was a vessel <b>that</b> was <b>non-sacred,</b> and it is for this reason that the loaves are not consecrated.
The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted,</b> one can say that the shewbread was kneaded on a leather spread rather than in <b>a receptacle,</b> as <b>the Merciful One does not write</b> in the Torah <b>that one should</b> specifically <b>use a receptacle to knead</b> the shewbread. Therefore, <b>when one kneads</b> the dough of a meal offering <b>on top of a leather spread, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. But</b> in the case of the two loaves whose flour was measured in a vessel used for measuring <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>since the Merciful One states</b> explicitly to <b>use</b> a vessel of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and measure with it,</b> can it be suggested that the one preparing the meal offering should <b>leave aside</b> the <b>consecrated</b> vessel for <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and measure with a non-sacred</b> vessel for <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah?
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who offers up</b> outside the Temple courtyard a portion <b>of the meat of a sin offering, or</b> a portion <b>of the meat of a guilt offering, or</b> a portion <b>of the meat of offerings of the most sacred order, or</b> a portion <b>of the meat of offerings of lesser sanctity, or</b> a portion <b>of the surplus of the <i>omer</i> offering, or</b> a portion <b>of the leftover of the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat, <b>or the shewbread, or the remainder of meal offerings, that</b> in all these cases <b>he</b> violates <b>a prohibition,</b> although these items are not meant to be sacrificed on the altar?
The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states: “For any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 2:11). The extra term “of it” teaches that <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> has already had some part <b>of it</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not burn,</b> stated in that verse explicitly with regard to honey and leaven.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the two loaves and the shewbread, is there</b> some part <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A portion of every offering is sacrificed on the altar, <b>except for the two loaves and the shewbread, as no</b> part <b>of them</b> is burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire?</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> Although <b>no</b> part <b>of</b> the two loaves or the shewbread <b>themselves</b> is burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire,</b> nevertheless, they are included in the prohibition against offering them up to the altar, since they are not viewed as independent entities but rather as parts of larger offerings. The two loaves accompany the sheep sacrificed as burnt offerings on Shavuot, and are permitted for consumption only once those sheep have been burned on the altar. Similarly, the shewbread is permitted for consumption only after the bowls of frankincense that were on the Table with it have been burned on the altar.
§ The Gemara discusses the prohibition against offering up on the altar parts of offerings after their sacrificial portions have already been burned. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who brings up</b> any part <b>of any of</b> the items listed in the <i>baraita</i> <b>onto the ramp</b> leading to the altar, but not to the altar itself, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable</b> and <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: After the verse: “As any leaven and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord,” the next verse states: “As an offering of first fruits you may bring them to the Lord, but they shall not come up to <b>the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma” (Leviticus 2:12). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to an item that is brought on the <b>altar. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies if it is brought to the <b>ramp</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “But they shall not come up to the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma,” to be accepted, and the ramp is the means to ascend to the altar.
<b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that one who brings up parts to the ramp is <b>exempt? As the verse states:</b> “For any <b>leaven, and</b> any <b>honey,</b> you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord. <b>As an offering of first produce you may bring them</b> to the Lord, but they shall not come up to the altar for a pleasing aroma” (Leviticus 2:11–12).
The Gemara explains: The term <b>“them”</b> indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those offerings that come from leaven or honey and which are called: “An offering of first produce.” This category consists of first fruits, which are brought from dates and other sweet fruit and which are called: “The choicest first fruits of your land” (Exodus 23:19), and the two loaves, which are leaven and are the first meal offerings brought from the new crop each year. In other words, it is with regard to <b>this</b> category <b>that</b> the verse <b>amplifies for you</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>ramp</b> of the altar is considered <b>like</b> the <b>altar</b> itself. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>other items,</b> e.g., the meat of sin offerings and guilt offerings, the ramp of the altar is <b>not</b> treated like the altar itself.

Daf 58a

The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who maintains that the prohibition against bringing leftover portions up to the ramp applies to all of the items listed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>do with this</b> term: <b>“Them,”</b> in the verse: “As an offering of first produce you may bring them” (Leviticus 2:12), from which Rabbi Elazar learns that only first fruits and the two loaves are included in the prohibition?
The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an individual may donate and bring</b> to the Temple <b>a gift</b> offering <b>similar to those</b> two loaves brought by the community, <b>and</b> in support <b>I</b> will <b>read with regard to</b> this offering the verse that deals with other gift offerings: <b>“That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;</b> according to what you have vowed freely to the Lord your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24), which would mean that the offering is consecrated and he must bring it as he declared.
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “As an offering of first produce you may bring.”</b> The phrase: “You may bring,” is written in the plural, meaning that it is addressed to the community. Therefore, it is interpreted to mean: <b>I said to you</b> that <b>a community</b> may consecrate and bring the two loaves, which are an offering of first produce, <b>but an individual</b> may <b>not</b> consecrate and bring two loaves of this nature.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that only <b>an individual may not bring</b> two loaves as a gift offering, <b>as</b> an individual <b>does not bring his obligatory</b> offering in a manner <b>similar to those</b> two loaves, i.e., perhaps specifically an individual, who never has an obligatory offering of two loaves, may not bring two loaves as a gift offering. <b>But</b> the <b>community shall bring</b> two loaves as a gift offering, <b>as</b> the community <b>does bring its obligatory</b> offering in a manner <b>similar to those</b> two loaves. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You may bring <b>them,”</b> to exclude the possibility of a communal gift offering of two loaves. The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And what is there</b> left <b>for you to bring</b> as offerings that come from leaven and honey? <b>The two loaves</b> that comes <b>from leaven, and</b> the <b>first fruits</b> that come <b>from honey,</b> i.e., sweet fruits.
The Gemara asks: <b>And may the two loaves not be sacrificed</b> as communal <b>gift</b> offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “As any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it” (Leviticus 2:11): <b>If it is stated: “Any leaven,” why is it stated: “Any honey”? And if it is stated: “Any honey,” why is it stated: “Any leaven”?</b> In other words, why is it necessary for the verse to repeat the inclusive term “any,” from which it is derived that offering an insufficient quantity of honey or leaven is included in the prohibition? The <i>baraita</i> answers: Both of these terms had to be stated, <b>because there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to leaven that is not</b> applicable <b>to honey, and there is</b> another <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to honey that is not</b> applicable <b>to leaven.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: In the case of <b>leaven,</b> although it may not be sacrificed on the altar, <b>its general</b> prohibition <b>was permitted</b> in certain circumstances <b>in the Temple,</b> as the two loaves and the bread of the thanks offering, i.e., the four loaves of the thanks offering that were eaten by the priests, are leavened bread. By contrast, with regard to <b>honey,</b> there are <b>no</b> circumstances in which <b>its general</b> prohibition <b>was permitted in the Temple.</b>
There is a <i>halakha</i> that applies to honey but not to leaven, as the prohibition concerning <b>honey is permitted</b> in the case <b>of the remainder of meal offerings,</b> meaning that the priests may eat their portion of meal offerings with honey, whereas the prohibition concerning <b>leaven is not permitted</b> in the case <b>of the remainder of meal offerings,</b> since one may not leaven this remainder. The <i>baraita</i> summarizes: <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to leaven that is not</b> applicable <b>to honey, and there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to honey that is not</b> applicable <b>to leaven, it was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to state: “Any leaven,” and it was</b> also <b>necessary</b> for it <b>to state: “Any honey.”</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. When the <i>baraita</i> states concerning <b>leaven that its general</b> prohibition <b>was permitted</b> in certain circumstances <b>in the Temple, what is this? Isn’t</b> this referring to the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> the meal offering of the <b>two loaves may be sacrificed</b> by the community as <b>a gift</b> offering on the altar, as the two loaves of the communal offering themselves were not sacrificed on the altar? This would mean that two loaves may be brought as a gift offering by the community, which contradicts this claim of the previous <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rav Amram said: No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the fact that the two loaves, which were leaven, <b>are brought</b> as an offering <b>with</b> the two lambs, which are brought up onto the altar as communal peace offerings. Since they are brought together, the two loaves and the two lambs are considered a single offering, and the lambs are sacrificed on the altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> in the case of <b>first fruits also,</b> the fruits should be considered part of the offering that was brought with them. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:5): As for <b>the fledglings that</b> were placed <b>on top of the baskets</b> that contained the first fruits brought to the Temple, <b>they would</b> sacrifice these as <b>burnt offerings, and the baskets</b> themselves <b>that were in the possession</b> of those bringing the first fruits would <b>be given to the priests.</b> Accordingly, with regard to honey as well, its general prohibition was permitted in certain circumstances, as these first fruits containing honey are included with the sacrifice of burnt offerings. The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> fledglings <b>came</b> only <b>to decorate</b> the <b>first fruits,</b> despite the fact that they were later sacrificed as burnt offerings. Bringing the fledglings is not obligatory, and therefore cannot be considered part of the same offering as first fruits.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the prohibition against bringing leftover parts of offerings up to the altar after the sacrificial parts have been burned. <b>Rami bar Ḥama asked Rav Ḥisda:</b> With regard to <b>one who offers up on the altar</b> some <b>of the meat of a bird</b> sacrificed as <b>a sin offering,</b> which is meant to be eaten by the priests, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable to receive lashes for this action?
The Gemara clarifies the possibilities: <b>The Merciful One states</b> with regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> has already had some portion <b>of it</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar that one who sacrifices any leftover part of it violates the prohibition. <b>And</b> as <b>no</b> part <b>of this</b> bird sacrificed as a sin offering is burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar, is he therefore exempt? <b>Or perhaps, any</b> item <b>that is called an offering</b> is included in the prohibition, <b>and</b> since <b>this</b> bird is <b>also called an offering,</b> one is liable. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rami bar Ḥama: <b>Any</b> item <b>that is called an offering</b> is included in the prohibition, <b>and this</b> bird sacrificed as a sin offering is <b>also called an offering.</b>
The Gemara notes: Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Only <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> has already had some portion <b>of it</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar is included in the prohibition: Do not burn. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Any</b> item <b>that is called an offering</b> is included in this prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> concerns the case discussed earlier, of one who brings some of <b>the meat of a bird sin offering</b> up to the altar. Rabbi Akiva maintains that he is liable, as it is called an offering, whereas Rabbi Eliezer holds that he is exempt, as no portion of it is burned on the altar.
<b>Rav said:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> concerns the <b><i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper, as Levi teaches:</b> Concerning the consecrated items given to priests as gifts, the verse states: <b>“Every offering of theirs</b>…shall be most holy for you and for your sons” (Numbers 18:9). The phrase “every offering” serves <b>to include the <i>log</i> of oil of a leper.</b> This oil is not burned on the altar. Nevertheless, Rabbi Akiva would deem one who brings some of this <i>log</i> up to the altar liable, as it is called an offering, whereas Rabbi Eliezer would deem him exempt, since no part of it is burned in the fire.
§ The Gemara returns to the discussion about the prohibition against sacrificing leaven. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the Torah states with regard to <b>leaven: Do not burn</b> it (see Leviticus 2:11), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one who burns <b>all of it</b> is liable, as will be explained. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one who burns only <b>part of it</b> is also included in the prohibition? <b>The verse states: “Any [<i>kol</i>]</b> leaven,” which serves to include such a case. The <i>baraita</i> adds: This <i>halakha</i> has been derived only with regard to leaven in a pure state; <b>from where</b> is it derived that the same applies to one who sacrifices it in <b>its mixed state,</b> i.e., mixed with another substance? <b>The verse states</b> the additional expression: <b>“As [<i>ki</i>] any</b> leaven.”
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is it saying?</b> What is the meaning of the term: All of it, and the term: Part of it? <b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> When the verse states about <b>leaven: Do not burn</b> it, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this prohibition applies to <b>an olive-bulk</b> of leaven. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this prohibition applies if it is only <b>half an olive-bulk? The verse states: “Any</b> leaven.” Furthermore, <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is liable not only for leaven by itself, but also for leaven in <b>its mixed state? The verse states: “As any</b> leaven.”
<b>Rava said</b> that there is a different interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> When the verse states about <b>leaven: Do not burn</b> it, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this prohibition applies to the entire <b>handful</b> that is removed from the meal offering. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this prohibition applies to <b>half</b> of the <b>handful? The verse states: “Any</b> leaven.” Furthermore, <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is liable not only for leaven by itself, but also for <b>its mixed state? The verse states: “As any</b> leaven.”
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>what</b> principle <b>do</b> Abaye and Rava <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye holds: There is</b> such an entity as <b>a handful</b> that is <b>less than</b> the volume of <b>two olives.</b>

Daf 58b

<b>And</b> Abaye consequently maintains that <b>there is</b> such a matter as a halakhically significant <b>burning</b> of a handful even if it is <b>less than</b> the volume of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> It follows that the phrase “any leaven” teaches that if one sacrificed less than an olive-bulk of a handful that was leaven, he is liable.
<b>And Rava says: There is no</b> such entity as <b>a handful</b> that is <b>less than</b> the size of <b>two olives,</b> and consequently the mitzva not to burn leaven is referring initially to a full handful of two olive-bulks. <b>And</b> Rava holds that <b>there is no</b> such matter as a halakhically significant <b>burning</b> of a handful if it is <b>less than</b> the volume of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> Therefore, one cannot derive from the phrase “as any leaven” that one can be liable for sacrificing leaven of less than one olive-bulk. Instead, the phrase must be referring to a case where half the handful is leaven.
§ The Gemara discusses another dispute between Abaye and Rava on this topic: <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who offers up</b> a mixture made <b>of leaven and of honey on the altar, Rava says:</b> He is flogged with four sets of lashes for this act, as the verse: “As any leaven and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11), includes four separate prohibitions. He <b>is flogged</b> one set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>leaven, and he is flogged</b> a second set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>honey,</b> and <b>he is flogged</b> a third set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>mixtures of leaven, and</b> he is flogged a fourth set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>mixtures of honey.</b>
<b>Abaye says: One is not flogged for a general prohibition,</b> i.e., a single mitzva in the Torah that includes many different prohibited acts. Since all these actions are covered by the prohibition: “You shall not burn,” it is considered a general prohibition, for which one is not flogged.
The Gemara cites a dispute between the Sages with regard to the opinion of Abaye. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Abaye concedes that <b>in any event</b> the offender is <b>flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes for sacrificing leaven, and he is also flogged a second set of lashes for sacrificing honey, as these are not considered general prohibitions. Since the phrase: “You shall not burn,” is referring to both leaven and honey, it is as though it were written: You shall not burn leaven; you shall not burn honey.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Abaye maintains that the offender <b>is not even flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes, <b>as the prohibition</b> he transgressed <b>is not specific</b> to one matter, <b>like the prohibition against muzzling.</b> The principle that one is liable to be flogged for violating a prohibition is derived from the juxtaposition of the mitzva: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain” (Deuteronomy 25:4), with the verses that mention lashes. It is inferred from this juxtaposition that one is not liable to be flogged for violating prohibitions whose circumstances are not similar to that of muzzling, e.g., a general prohibition that is not referring to one specific action.

Daf 59a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> four types of meal offerings: Those <b>that require</b> both <b>oil and frankincense,</b> those that require <b>oil but not frankincense,</b> those that require <b>frankincense but not oil,</b> and those that require <b>neither frankincense nor oil.</b>
The mishna elaborates: <b>And these</b> are the meal offerings that <b>require</b> both <b>oil and frankincense: The fine-flour meal offering,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon” (Leviticus 2:1); <b>the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a pan</b> (see Leviticus 2:5–6); <b>the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan</b> (see Leviticus 2:7–10); <b>and the</b> meal offering baked in an oven, which can be brought in the form of <b>loaves or</b> in the form of <b>wafers</b> (see Leviticus 2:4).
Additional meal offerings that require both oil and frankincense are <b>the meal offering of priests; the meal offering of the anointed priest,</b> i.e., the griddle-cake offering brought by the High Priest every day, half in the morning and half in the evening; <b>the meal offering of a gentile; a meal offering</b> brought <b>by women;</b> and <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering</b> (see Leviticus 23:15).
<b>The meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> that accompany burnt offerings and peace offerings <b>requires oil but does not require frankincense. The shewbread requires frankincense but does not require oil.</b>
<b>The two loaves</b> brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> (see Leviticus 23:17), <b>the meal offering of a sinner, and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>require neither oil nor frankincense.</b> The two loaves do not require oil or frankincense because these additions are not mentioned with regard to it. The meal offering of a sinner does not require them, as it is written: “He shall not put oil upon it, neither shall he give any frankincense upon it; for it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11). With regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>, it is similarly written: “He shall pour no oil upon it, nor give frankincense upon it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance” (Numbers 5:15).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Pappa stated</b> a principle with regard to all the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: <b>Anywhere that we learned</b> in a mishna that one brings a meal offering, <b>we learned</b> that one must bring <b>ten</b> items of the same type, either loaves or wafers. The Gemara explains: This statement of Rav Pappa serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> One who takes a vow to bring a meal offering baked in an oven must bring ten items. If he wishes, he may bring ten loaves or ten wafers, and if he wishes <b>he may bring half</b> of them as <b>loaves and</b> the other <b>half</b> as <b>wafers.</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> do so; all ten must be of the same type.
§ The mishna teaches that the <i>omer</i> meal offering requires both oil and frankincense. With regard to this meal offering, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall put oil upon it</b> and lay frankincense upon it; it is a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:15). From this it can be inferred: One must put oil specifically “upon it,” <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>oil upon the shewbread.</b>
<b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: Could <b>this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> to conclude that the shewbread should require oil? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>And if the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> that accompany burnt offerings and peace offerings, <b>which does not require frankincense,</b> nevertheless <b>requires oil,</b> then with regard to <b>the shewbread,</b> for which the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent in <b>that</b> it <b>requires frankincense, is it not logical that</b> it should also <b>require oil?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “upon it,”</b> which indicates that one places <b>oil upon it,</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>oil upon the shewbread.</b>
Similarly, the phrase <b>“and lay frankincense upon it”</b> indicates that one must place <b>frankincense “upon it,” but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>frankincense upon the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations.</b>
<b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: Could <b>this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? And if the shewbread,</b> for <b>which</b> the <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than the meal offering brought with libations in that it <b>does not require oil,</b> nevertheless <b>requires frankincense,</b> then concerning <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations, which</b> does <b>require oil, is it not logical that</b> it should also <b>require frankincense?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “upon it,”</b> to indicate that one places <b>frankincense upon it,</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>frankincense upon the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations.</b>
In the phrase “it is a meal offering,” the term <b>“meal offering”</b> serves <b>to include</b> in the obligation of frankincense the <b>meal offering of the eighth</b> day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. With regard to that offering the verse states: “And a meal offering mixed with oil” (Leviticus 9:4), but it does not mention frankincense. Therefore, the term “meal offering” written in the context of the <i>omer</i> meal offering serves to apply the requirement <b>of frankincense</b> to the meal offering of the eighth day of inauguration. And the term <b>“it is”</b> in the same phrase serves <b>to exclude the two loaves</b> sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, to indicate <b>that they will require neither oil nor frankincense.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>halakhot</i> stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> that the phrase: “And you shall put <b>oil upon it,”</b> teaches that one places oil upon the <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>oil on the shewbread.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: Why does the <i>baraita</i> conclude that this verse excludes the shewbread? One can <b>say</b> instead: <b>“Upon it”</b> you shall place <b>oil, but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>oil on the meal offering of priests.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>the meal offering of priests should be included</b> in the requirement of oil, <b>as</b> the meal offering of priests is similar in many ways to the <i>omer</i> meal offering that is the subject of the verse. The Gemara details the points of similarity between the two types of meal offerings: Both are prepared from <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, whereas each of the twelve loaves of the shewbread is prepared from two-tenths of an ephah. Furthermore, both are kneaded and consecrated in a service <b>vessel,</b> whereas the shewbread is not consecrated in a service vessel but rather is baked in an oven in the Temple courtyard.
Thirdly, both the meal offering of priests and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are sacrificed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary on the outer altar, whereas the shewbread is placed on the Table inside the Sanctuary. <b>And</b> in both cases the <i>halakha</i> of a change in <b>form</b> applies, i.e., if they were left overnight without being sacrificed they are disqualified, whereas the shewbread is left on the Table for a week. Furthermore, in both cases there is the obligation of <b>bringing</b> the meal offering <b>near</b> to the lower part of the altar, at the southwest corner, an obligation that does not apply to the shewbread.
<b>And</b> finally, some portion of both the meal offering of priests and the <i>omer</i> meal offering is placed in the <b>fire,</b> as the handful of the <i>omer</i> meal offering is sacrificed, while the entire meal offering of a priest is burned on the altar. By contrast, the shewbread is not sacrificed on the altar at all. In total, there are therefore six points of similarity between the meal offering of priests and the <i>omer</i> meal offering, all of which are not shared by the shewbread. Consequently, the requirement of oil stated with regard to the <i>omer</i> meal offering should also apply to the meal offering of priests, not to the shewbread.
The Gemara counters: <b>On the contrary [<i>adderabba</i>],</b> it stands to reason that <b>the shewbread,</b> not the meal offering of priests, <b>should be included</b> in the requirement of oil, <b>as</b> the shewbread has points of similarity with the <i>omer</i> meal offering <b>in that</b> both the shewbread and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are <b>communal</b> meal offerings, whereas the meal offering of priests is an individual meal offering. Furthermore, they are both <b>obligatory</b> offerings, whereas the meal offering of priests is voluntary. Additionally, both can sometimes be sacrificed in a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> as the prohibition against performing the Temple service in a state of impurity is disregarded in cases involving the public. Like the offering of an individual, the meal offering of priests is not brought in a state of impurity.
Also, there is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> both the shewbread and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are <b>eaten</b> by priests, while the meal offering of priests is entirely burned on the altar. Furthermore, the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]</b> applies to both the shewbread and the <i>omer</i> meal offering, but not to the meal offering of priests. And finally, both the shewbread and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are brought even <b>on Shabbat,</b> as they are communal offerings, whereas the meal offering of priests is not sacrificed on Shabbat. Accordingly, there are also six points of similarity between the shewbread and the <i>omer</i> meal offering. Why, then, isn’t the verse interpreted as including the shewbread in the requirement of oil, and excluding the meal offering of priests?
The Gemara answers: Even so, <b>it stands to reason</b> that one should include the meal offering of priests, as in the same passage that deals with the <i>omer</i> meal offering the verse states: “And when <b>anyone</b> brings a meal offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 2:1). This verse includes all meal offerings of individuals in the <i>halakhot</i> of meal offerings stated in this chapter, including the meal offering of priests.
The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> The phrase: “And lay <b>frankincense upon it”</b> (Leviticus 2:15), teaches that one must place frankincense upon the <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>frankincense upon the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations.</b> The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state that this verse excludes the meal offering brought with libations? One can <b>say:</b> One places <b>frankincense upon</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>but</b> one does <b>not</b> place <b>frankincense upon the meal offering of priests.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>the meal offering of priests should be included</b> in the requirement of frankincense, <b>as</b> the meal offering of priests is similar in many respects to the <i>omer</i> meal offering. The Gemara elaborates: Both are prepared from <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, whereas the libations that accompany meal offerings come in various amounts, depending on the type of animal offering they accompany. Furthermore, in both cases the flour is <b>mixed with a <i>log</i></b> of oil, whereas in the case of the meal offering brought with libations, the amount of oil mixed with the flour depends on the type of animal offering it accompanies.
Additionally, both the meal offering of priests and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are <b>brought near</b> to the altar, a ritual that is not performed with the meal offering brought with libations. And finally, both are sacrificed <b>due to themselves,</b> i.e., they do not accompany any other offering, whereas meal offerings brought with libations accompany animal offerings. There are therefore four points of similarity between the meal offering of priests and the <i>omer</i> meal offering that do not apply to the meal offering brought with libations.
The Gemara counters: <b>On the contrary,</b> it stands to reason that <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> and not the meal offering of priests <b>should be included</b> in the requirement of frankincense. This is <b>because</b> the meal offering brought with libations is similar to the <i>omer</i> meal offering <b>in that</b> both the meal offering brought with libations and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are <b>communal</b> meal offerings, whereas the meal offering of priests is that of an individual.
Furthermore, both the meal offering brought with libations and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are <b>obligatory</b> offerings, while the meal offering of priests is a gift offering. <b>And</b> both may sometimes be sacrificed in a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> as the prohibition against performing the Temple service in a state of impurity is disregarded in cases involving the public; whereas the meal offering of priests must be brought in a state of purity because it is an offering of an individual.
Finally, both are brought even <b>on Shabbat,</b> whereas the meal offering of priests may not be brought on Shabbat. Accordingly, as there are also four points of similarity between the meal offering brought with libations and the <i>omer</i> meal offering, one can ask why the meal offering brought with libations is not included in the requirement of frankincense. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that one should include the meal offering of priests in the requirement of frankincense, as the verse states: <b>“Anyone”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), which is referring to all meal offerings of individuals.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the term: <b>“Meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:15), serves <b>to include</b> the <b>meal offering of the eighth</b> day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle <b>in</b> the requirement of <b>frankincense.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that this term serves <b>to exclude</b> the meal offering of the eighth day from the requirement of frankincense. The Gemara is puzzled by this suggestion: <b>What is this</b> suggestion? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the verse serves <b>to include</b> the meal offering of the eighth day of inauguration in the requirement of frankincense, it works out <b>well.</b> This is because the only reason one could know that the requirement of frankincense applies would be that the <i>halakha</i> of this meal offering, which was brought on one occasion, is derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering that is brought in all generations.
<b>But if you say</b> that the verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the meal offering of the eighth day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle from the requirement of frankincense, <b>why do I</b> need a verse for this purpose? There is a principle that <b>we do not learn</b> the requirements of <b>transitory</b> offerings <b>from</b> the requirement of offerings of later <b>generations.</b> In other words, even without this verse one would not have thought that the requirement of frankincense applies to the meal offering of the eighth day, so there is no need for the verse to exclude this possibility.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the term: <b>“It is”</b> (Leviticus 2:15), serves <b>to exclude the two loaves</b> sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, to indicate <b>that they will require neither oil nor frankincense.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that this serves <b>to exclude the meal offering of priests</b> from the requirements of oil and frankincense. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>the meal offering of priests should be included</b> in these requirements, while the two loaves should be excluded, <b>as</b> the meal offering of priests is similar to the <i>omer</i> meal offering in several respects that do not apply to the two loaves. The Gemara elaborates: Both are prepared from <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, unlike the two loaves, which are prepared from two-tenths.
Furthermore, both are consecrated in a service <b>vessel,</b> unlike the two loaves, which are consecrated by being baked in an oven. Both come as <b><i>matza</i>,</b> whereas the two loaves are leaven. <b>And</b> both come due to <b>themselves,</b> not with any other offering, whereas the two loaves come together with the lambs on <i>Shavuot</i>. With regard to both the meal offering of priests and the <i>omer</i> meal offering, there is an obligation to <b>bring</b> them <b>near</b> to the altar, which does not apply to the two loaves. <b>And</b> finally, they are both placed in the <b>fire</b> atop the altar, whereas the two loaves are not sacrificed on the altar.
The Gemara counters: <b>On the contrary,</b>

Daf 59b

it stands to reason that <b>the two loaves,</b> not the meal offering of priests, <b>should be included</b> in the requirement of oil and frankincense, <b>as</b> the two loaves have points of similarity with the <i>omer</i> meal offering. The Gemara elaborates: The two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are <b>communal</b> meal offerings, whereas the meal offering of priests is a meal offering of an individual. Both are <b>obligatory</b> offerings, whereas the meal offering of priests is a gift offering. Both are sometimes sacrificed in a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> while the meal offering of priests may not be. Also, they are similar in <b>that</b> priests <b>eat</b> the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering, whereas the meal offering of priests is entirely burned upon the altar.
Furthermore, the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>piggul</i></b> applies to the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering, but not to the meal offering of priests. And these offerings are sacrificed even <b>on Shabbat,</b> whereas the meal offering of priests is not. Additionally, both the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering <b>render</b> other items <b>permitted,</b> as the <i>omer</i> meal offering renders permitted the consumption of the new crop and the two loaves render permitted the sacrifice of meal offerings from the new crop; whereas the meal offering of priests does not render anything permitted. And both cases include the requirement of <b>waving,</b> while the meal offering of priests is not waved. In addition, the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering must come from the produce <b>of Eretz</b> Yisrael, whereas the meal offering of priests may consist of produce from outside Eretz Yisrael.
Also, the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering are sacrificed <b>at</b> a fixed <b>time,</b> as the <i>omer</i> meal offering is brought on the day after the first Festival day of Passover and the two loaves are sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>. By contrast, there is no fixed time for a meal offering of priests. Finally, the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering must come from the <b>new</b> crop, whereas the meal offering of priests may be brought from the old crop. <b>And these</b> eleven points of similarity between the two loaves and the <i>omer</i> meal offering <b>are</b> more <b>numerous</b> than the six points of similarity between the meal offerings of priests and the <i>omer</i> meal offering.
The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>it stands to reason</b> that one should include the meal offering of priests in the requirement of oil and frankincense, as in the passage discussing the <i>omer</i> meal offering the verse states: <b>“Anyone.”</b> This verse is referring to all meal offerings of individuals, including meal offerings of priests.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And</b> if one places oil or frankincense on the meal offering of a sinner or on the meal offering of jealousy brought by a <i>sota</i>, he is <b>liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> violating the prohibition against placing <b>the oil by itself, and</b> he is <b>liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> violating the prohibition against placing <b>the frankincense by itself,</b> as these are two separate prohibitions. If <b>one placed oil upon</b> the meal offering <b>he has disqualified it,</b> but if one placed <b>frankincense</b> upon the meal offering <b>he should gather</b> the frankincense and remove <b>it.</b> In this manner, the meal offering can be salvaged.
Furthermore, one violates the prohibition only by placing oil on the meal offering prior to the removal of the handful; if <b>he placed oil on its remainder he does not violate a prohibition.</b> If <b>one placed a vessel</b> with oil <b>on top of a vessel</b> that contains a meal offering of a sinner or a meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>he did not disqualify</b> the meal offering, as the oil was not placed on the meal offering itself.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the meal offering of a sinner is disqualified if oil is placed upon it, but if frankincense is placed upon it he should gather and remove the frankincense. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “He shall place no oil upon it, neither shall he give any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11). The phrase <b>“he shall place no oil upon it”</b> teaches that one may not place oil on the meal offering of a sinner, <b>and</b> that <b>if</b> he did <b>place</b> oil on this meal offering he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> it.
One <b>might</b> have thought that the same applies to the clause: <b>“Neither shall he give any frankincense upon it,” and</b> that <b>if</b> one <b>gave</b> frankincense on this meal offering he has consequently also <b>disqualified</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For</b> it is <b>a sin offering,”</b> from which it is derived that even if one placed frankincense on it, it remains a sin offering, which is not the case if he placed oil upon it. One <b>might</b> have thought the same would <b>also</b> apply <b>with regard to oil</b> placed on a meal offering of a sinner, that in this case as well the meal offering would not be disqualified. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It is</b> a sin offering,” to indicate that although it is still deemed a sin offering when frankincense is placed on it, this is not the case when oil is placed on it.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see</b> to interpret the verse in this manner, <b>to disqualify</b> the meal offering due to the addition <b>of oil but to render</b> it <b>valid</b> with the addition <b>of frankincense,</b> when one could have equally drawn the opposite conclusion? The <i>baraita</i> answers: This interpretation is logical for the following reason: <b>I disqualify</b> it due to the addition <b>of oil, since</b> the oil is absorbed in the flour and it is <b>impossible to gather it</b> and remove it from the meal offering. <b>But I render</b> it <b>valid</b> with the addition <b>of frankincense, as</b> it is <b>possible to gather</b> the frankincense and remove it from the meal offering.
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna raised a dilemma to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If one <b>placed frankincense</b> that had been <b>ground</b> into a fine powder, which cannot be gathered up and removed, <b>on</b> the meal offering of a sinner, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies: Is the reason that a meal offering on which frankincense was placed is generally valid <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b>possible to gather</b> the frankincense, <b>and</b> since in <b>this</b> case it is <b>impossible to gather it</b> the meal offering is disqualified? <b>Or perhaps</b> the reason that the meal offering is usually not disqualified is <b>due to</b> the fact that the dry frankincense <b>is not absorbed</b> by the flour of the meal offering, <b>and</b> therefore, as <b>this</b> ground frankincense is <b>also not absorbed,</b> the meal offering is valid.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from the mishna: <b>And</b> if one placed <b>frankincense</b> upon the meal offering <b>he should gather</b> and remove <b>it,</b> and it is then valid. This indicates that the status of the meal offering depends on whether or not the frankincense can be gathered up. Since ground frankincense cannot be gathered and removed from the flour, the meal offering should be disqualified.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> there are two reasons for this <i>halakha</i> but only one of them is explicitly stated in the mishna, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another. One</b> reason is <b>that</b> the Torah did not disqualify a meal offering upon which an improper item was placed, if that item <b>is not absorbed</b> in the flour. <b>And another</b> reason the meal offering is not disqualified by frankincense is that one can <b>gather</b> up the frankincense and restore the meal offering to its former state.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof, as the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> states: <b>I render</b> it <b>valid</b> with the addition <b>of frankincense, as</b> it is <b>possible to gather</b> the frankincense and remove it from the meal offering. This also indicates that the reason the meal offering is valid is that the frankincense can be gathered up, and since ground frankincense cannot be gathered up the meal offering should be disqualified. The Gemara answers: This is no proof, as <b>here too</b> one can say that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another.</b> The justification he states, that the frankincense can be gathered up, may be in addition to the reason that only a substance that is absorbed by the meal offering disqualifies it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna’s dilemma? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a meal offering of a sinner or a meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>upon which one placed frankincense,</b> he should <b>gather up the frankincense and</b> the meal offering is <b>valid. And if, before he gathered its frankincense,</b> the priest performing the service <b>had intent</b> to sacrifice <b>its</b> handful or eat its remainder <b>either beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>,</b> unlike the usual case of an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]. This is because at the time the priest had the improper intent the meal offering was not valid, as it had frankincense upon it at that time.
<b>And if after he gathered its frankincense</b> the priest <b>has intent</b> to sacrifice <b>its</b> handful or to eat its remainder <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b> But if he had intent to sacrifice its handful or to eat its remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> it is <b><i>piggul</i>, and</b> one who eats it <b>is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for it.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that until the frankincense is removed from the meal offering, the meal offering is disqualified. This proves that the reason a meal offering upon which frankincense has been placed is valid is due to the ability to remove the frankincense, and not because it is not absorbed. This resolves Rabba bar Rav Huna’s dilemma: If ground frankincense is placed on the meal offering of a sinner, the meal offering is disqualified.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that if the priest had improper intent while there was frankincense on the meal offering, the meal offering is disqualified. The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> this meal offering of a sinner that has frankincense on it <b>be</b> like a meal offering on which oil had been poured from <b>a cruse.</b> Such a meal offering is disqualified. <b>Why</b> is it stated that the improper <b>intent disqualifies</b> the meal offering in the case where there is frankincense on it? <b>It is</b> already <b>rejected</b> from its consecrated state by the presence of the frankincense, and therefore the improper intent should have no effect.
<b>Abaye says:</b> Even though the meal offering is disqualified while there is frankincense on it, nevertheless <b>the Merciful One calls it “a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:11) even in that state, and therefore the improper intent has an effect with regard to it. <b>Rava said</b> there is a different explanation: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? It is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian, who does not</b> subscribe to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rejection,</b> but holds that a sacrifice that was rejected temporarily is not rejected entirely.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian says:</b> In the event that the scapegoat of Yom Kippur was lost, <b>even</b> if the <b>blood</b> of its counterpart that is sacrificed to God has already been slaughtered and its blood has been collected <b>in the cup,</b> the blood is not rejected, but rather <b>one brings</b> another scapegoat as <b>its counterpart and pairs it with</b> the goat that has already been slaughtered, and the blood is sprinkled.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that there is a different answer: <b>Any</b> matter <b>that is within one’s power</b> to remedy <b>is not</b> deemed <b>rejected.</b> In this case, since one can gather up the frankincense from the meal offering it is not rejected as an offering, and therefore the priest’s improper intention is significant.
<b>Rav Adda says: It stands to reason</b> that the correct explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ashi, as whom did you hear who accepts</b> the principle of <b>rejected</b> offerings? <b>It is Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62a): <b>And Rabbi Yehuda also says:</b> If <b>the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God was <b>spilled</b> before it was sprinkled, <b>the scapegoat,</b> its counterpart, is left <b>to die.</b> Similarly, <b>if the scapegoat dies, the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>should be spilled.</b> In either case, two other goats must be brought and lots drawn again. This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, when one of the goats dies, the remaining one is rejected.
<b>And yet</b> concerning a case <b>where it is in one’s power</b> to remedy the situation, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> After the Paschal offerings were slaughtered in the courtyard, before the floor was rinsed a priest <b>would fill a cup with the blood</b> of the many offerings brought that day <b>that was</b> now <b>mixed</b> together on the floor, and <b>sprinkle it with a single sprinkling against the base</b> of the altar, i.e., against its north and west sides, where there was a base, as is required for the Paschal offering. This was done in case the blood of one of the offerings had been spilled. The offering would be rendered valid, as some of its blood was now sprinkled on the altar. This indicates that even if the blood of an offering was spilled onto the floor, since a priest has the power to remedy this problem the offering is not rejected.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the placement of oil upon the meal offering of a sinner or the meal offering of jealousy brought by a <i>sota</i>. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed any amount</b> of <b>oil on top of an olive-bulk</b> of <b>a meal offering</b> of a sinner, he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering. The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The verse states: <b>“He shall place</b> no oil upon it” (Leviticus 5:11). This indicates an act of <b>placing</b> that has no minimum amount, and therefore one is liable for <b>any</b> amount of oil. When the verse states <b>“upon it,”</b> this teaches that a meal offering is disqualified by the oil <b>only if it has</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk.
<b>And Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed an olive-bulk of frankincense on top of any amount</b> of <b>a meal offering,</b> he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is written: “Neither shall he give</b> any frankincense upon it” (Leviticus 5:11), which indicates that frankincense disqualifies the meal offering <b>only if there is</b> at least an amount that constitutes <b>giving,</b> which is an olive-bulk. When the verse states <b>“upon it,”</b>

Daf 60a

this <b>is one amplificatory expression after another,</b> one in the context of the oil and the other in the context of the frankincense. And there is a principle that <b>one amplificatory expression after another</b> serves <b>only to restrict.</b> Consequently, the placement of frankincense on any amount of a meal offering of a sinner disqualifies the meal offering.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of the discussion: <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>placed oil</b> of <b>any amount on top of an olive-bulk</b> of <b>a meal offering</b> of a sinner, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies: Since the Torah states with regard to oil: “He shall place no oil upon it,” whereas with regard to frankincense it states: “Neither shall he give any frankincense upon it,” <b>do we require</b> that the <b>placing</b> of the oil must be <b>like</b> the <b>giving</b> of the frankincense, which must be an olive-bulk, <b>or not?</b> No answer was found, and therefore the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>placed oil on the remainder of</b> a meal offering of a sinner or a meal offering of jealousy brought by a <i>sota</i>, he does not violate a prohibition. Concerning this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“He shall place no oil upon it, neither shall he give</b> any frankincense upon it,” one <b>might</b> have thought that this separation into two distinct prohibitions applies only <b>where two priests</b> perform these actions, one of whom places oil on the meal offering while the other puts frankincense. Perhaps in this case each of them is separately liable to receive lashes, but if one priest put both oil and frankincense on a meal offering, one might have thought he receives only one set of lashes.
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Upon it,”</b> with regard to both the oil and the frankincense, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of</b> the <b>meal offering itself, and</b> it is <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>priest</b> who performs the service. Since both prohibited actions can be performed on the same meal offering, an individual who does both is liable to receive two sets of lashes.
Furthermore, one <b>might</b> have thought this verse means <b>one may not</b> even <b>place a vessel</b> containing oil or frankincense <b>on top of a vessel</b> that contains the meal offering, <b>and</b> that <b>if one placed</b> such a vessel on the meal offering <b>he</b> has thereby <b>disqualified</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states “upon it,”</b> which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking about</b> the <b>meal offering itself.</b> One may not place oil or frankincense on the meal offering itself, but it is not prohibited to place a vessel containing oil or frankincense upon a vessel that contains the meal offering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> four categories of meal offerings: Those that <b>require bringing near,</b> a rite that requires the priests to carry the offering in their hands and bring it near the southwest corner of the altar, <b>but do not require waving;</b> those that require both <b>bringing near and waving;</b> those that require <b>waving but not bringing near;</b> and those that require <b>neither waving nor bringing near.</b>
The mishna elaborates: <b>And these</b> are the meal offerings that <b>require bringing near but do not require waving: The fine-flour meal offering; the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a pan; the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan; the</b> meal offering baked in an oven, which can be brought in the form of <b>loaves or</b> in the form of <b>wafers; the meal offering of priests; the meal offering of the anointed priest; the meal offering of gentiles; a meal offering</b> brought <b>by women; and the meal offering of a sinner.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: The meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest do not require bringing</b> of the meal offering <b>near</b> to the altar, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there is no removal of a handful in their</b> sacrifice, <b>and</b> there is a principle that with regard to <b>any</b> meal offering <b>where there is no removal of a handful in their</b> sacrifice, <b>there is</b> also <b>no bringing near.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Pappa stated</b> a principle with regard to all the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: <b>Anywhere that we learned</b> in a mishna that one brings a meal offering, <b>we learned</b> that one must bring <b>ten</b> items of the same type, either loaves or wafers. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us?</b>
The Gemara explains: This statement of Rav Pappa serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> One who takes a vow to bring a meal offering baked in an oven must bring ten items. If he wishes he may bring ten loaves or ten wafers, and if he wishes <b>he may bring half</b> of them as <b>loaves and</b> the other <b>half</b> as <b>wafers.</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> do so; all ten must be of the same type.
§ The mishna teaches that the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon disagree about whether the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest require the ritual of bringing near. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A verse discussing the meal offering prepared in the pan states: “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of these to the Lord, and it shall be drawn near to the priest, and he shall bring it near to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8). <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>And you shall bring that which is made of these to the Lord and it shall be drawn near to the priest and he shall bring it near</b> to the altar, omitting the words: The meal offering, <b>I would say: I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> the <b>handful</b> that is sacrificed on the altar <b>alone requires bringing near.</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies to the entire <b>meal offering? The verse states</b> the superfluous term: “The <b>meal offering,”</b> which indicates that one must bring the entire meal offering to the altar prior to the removal of the handful. The <i>baraita</i> further asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>the meal offering of a sinner? The verse states: “The meal offering.”</b> The addition of the definite article serves to include the meal offering of a sinner.
The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty: Why is a verse necessary to teach that the requirement of bringing near applies to the meal offering of a sinner? <b>But</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> capable of being derived by <b>logical inference.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: The procedure of bringing a meal offering <b>is stated here,</b> in the context of the meal offering of a sinner,

Daf 60b

which is <b>an obligatory meal offering; and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the deep-pan meal offering, which is <b>a voluntary meal offering. Just as a voluntary meal offering requires bringing near, so too an obligatory meal offering,</b> such as the meal offering of a sinner, <b>requires bringing near.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this inference: <b>What</b> is notable about <b>a voluntary meal offering?</b> It is notable in that <b>it requires oil and frankincense</b> upon it, rendering its <i>halakha</i> more stringent than that of the meal offering of a sinner, which does not include oil and frankincense. Therefore, it would be logical to suggest that a voluntary meal offering requires bringing near but the meal offering of a sinner does not. The <i>baraita</i> responds: <b>The meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> i.e., the meal offering of jealousy, <b>can prove</b> that this factor is not decisive, as it does not include oil and frankincense either, and yet it requires bringing near.
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this claim: One cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> of the meal offering of a sinner from the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>, as there is another requirement that applies to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> but not to the meal offering of a sinner: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> It is notable <b>in that it requires waving,</b> whereas the meal offering of a sinner does not. The <i>baraita</i> responds: <b>The voluntary meal offering can prove</b> that waving is not the decisive factor, as a voluntary meal offering does not require waving and yet it requires bringing near.
Therefore, <b>the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point, as <b>the aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case; <b>their common element</b> is <b>that</b> the voluntary meal offering and the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>are equal with regard to</b> the requirement of the <b>removal of a handful, and</b> similarly <b>they are equal with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near. I will also bring</b> the additional case of <b>the meal offering of a sinner, which is equal to them with regard to</b> the requirement of the <b>removal of a handful,</b> and conclude that <b>it should</b> likewise <b>be equal to them with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the <b>common element</b> of the voluntary meal offering and the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>? It is notable <b>in that they are suited to come</b> as the meal offering <b>of a wealthy person</b> just <b>as</b> they are suited to come as the meal offering <b>of a poor person.</b> Shall <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the meal offering of a sinner, which is not suitable to come</b> either as the meal offering <b>of a wealthy person</b> or as the meal offering <b>of a poor person,</b> since a sinner who is not poor does not bring a meal offering but a different offering (see Leviticus 5:6–11)? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), with the addition of the definite article, to include the meal offering of a sinner in the requirement of bringing near.
<b>Rabbi Shimon</b> adds to the logical inference and <b>says</b> that other cases are included in the derivation from the verse, as the term <b>“and you shall bring”</b> serves <b>to include the <i>omer</i> meal offering in</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near</b> to the altar; <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the <i>omer</i> meal offering: <b>“Then you shall bring the <i>omer</i>, the first of your harvest to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:10). Furthermore, <b>“and it shall be drawn near”</b> serves <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i></b> in the requirement <b>of bringing near; and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And draw it near to the altar”</b> (Numbers 5:25).
The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>But</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> capable of being derived <i>a fortiori</i> by <b>logical inference: And if the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which includes a lenient aspect, <b>as it does not require waving,</b> nevertheless <b>requires bringing near,</b> then with regard to <b>the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i>, which does require waving, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that</b> it should <b>require bringing near?</b> The <i>baraita</i> rejects this logical inference, as there is a stringency that applies to the meal offering of a sinner which does not apply to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the meal offering of a sinner?</b> It is notable <b>in that it comes from wheat,</b> whereas the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> comes from barley, an inferior product.
The <i>baraita</i> responds: <b>The <i>omer</i> meal offering can prove</b> that this factor is not decisive, as it also comes from barley, and yet it requires bringing near. Therefore, the same should apply to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>. The <i>baraita</i> rejects this claim: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it requires oil and frankincense,</b> whereas the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> does not. The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The meal offering of a sinner can prove</b> that the requirement of oil and frankincense is not a decisive factor, as the meal offering of a sinner does not require oil and frankincense and yet it requires bringing near.
Consequently, <b>the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point, as <b>the aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case; <b>their common element</b> is <b>that</b> both the <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering of a sinner <b>are equal with regard to</b> the requirement of the <b>removal of a handful, and they are equal with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near. I will also bring</b> the additional case of <b>the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i>, which is equal to them with regard to</b> the requirement of the <b>removal of a handful,</b> and conclude that <b>it should</b> likewise <b>be equal to them with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the <b>common element</b> of the <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering of a sinner? It is notable <b>in that they are</b> both <b>not suited to come</b> as coarse <b>flour,</b> but only as fine flour. Shall <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i>, which is suited to come</b> as coarse <b>flour?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And draw it near,”</b> which serves to include the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> in the requirement of bringing near.
It was stated that Rabbi Shimon derives from the term “and you shall bring” (Leviticus 2:8), written in the context of the deep-pan meal offering, that the <i>omer</i> meal offering is included in the requirement of bringing near. Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The term <b>“and you shall bring”</b> serves <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i> in</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near; and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>: “Then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, <b>and shall bring her offering for her,</b> a tenth of an ephah of barley flour; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor give frankincense upon it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance” (Numbers 5:15).
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering, a verse is not needed</b> to teach that it requires bringing near. The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that no verse is needed for the <i>omer</i> meal offering? It is because this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>by logical inference: And if the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which includes a lenient aspect, <b>as it does not require waving,</b> nevertheless <b>requires bringing near,</b> then with regard to <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering,</b> which includes a stringent aspect, <b>as it</b> does <b>require waving, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that</b> it should <b>require bringing near?</b>
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the meal offering of a sinner?</b> It is notable <b>in that it comes from wheat,</b> whereas the <i>omer</i> meal offering comes from barley. The <i>baraita</i> responds: <b>The meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i> can prove</b> that this factor is not decisive, as it comes from barley and yet it requires bringing near. The same should apply to the <i>omer</i> meal offering. The <i>baraita</i> rejects this claim: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> It is notable <b>in that it comes to clarify</b> whether or not the wife committed the <b>transgression</b> of adultery, <b>as it is</b> described with the phrase: <b>“Bringing iniquity to remembrance,”</b> whereas the omer meal offering does not come to clarify whether or not one transgressed. The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The meal offering of a sinner can prove</b> otherwise, as it does not come to clarify transgression and yet it requires bringing near.
Therefore, <b>the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point, as <b>the aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case; <b>their common element</b> is <b>that</b> both the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> and the meal offering of a sinner <b>are equal with regard to</b> the requirement of the <b>removal of a handful, and they are equal with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near. I will also bring</b> the additional case of <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which is equal to them with regard to</b> the requirement of the <b>removal of a handful,</b> and conclude that <b>it should</b> likewise <b>be equal to them with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near.</b> In this manner the requirement of bringing the <i>omer</i> meal offering near to the altar is derived jointly from the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> and the meal offering of a sinner.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> would you <b>refute</b> this logical inference? In other words, there is no refutation of this claim, and it is therefore unclear why it was necessary for Rabbi Shimon to derive the requirement of bringing near concerning the <i>omer</i> meal offering from the term: “And you shall bring.” The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon refutes</b> the claim in <b>this</b> manner: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the <b>common element</b> of the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> and the meal offering of a sinner? It is notable <b>in that they are common</b> offerings, i.e., they can be brought many times over the course of a year, whereas the <i>omer</i> offering is sacrificed only once a year.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this claim? He maintains that this is not a valid refutation, as <b>on the contrary, this</b> <i>omer</i> meal offering is <b>more common</b> than the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> and the meal offering of a sinner. The <i>omer</i> meal offering is definitely brought once a year, whereas in the case of <b>these</b> offerings, <b>there</b> may be <b>times when you do not find it at all,</b> if no poor sinners come forward and no women are accused of adultery by their husbands.
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Or</b> perhaps when the verse <b>states: “And you shall bring,”</b> this does <b>not</b> serve to teach about the requirement of bringing near <b>but rather</b> is written for a different reason: To indicate <b>that an individual</b> Jew <b>may donate and bring a different</b> kind of <b>meal offering,</b> one made from barley, <b>apart from these</b> five meal offerings, all made from wheat, <b>which</b> the verse mentions <b>with regard to this matter</b> (see Leviticus 2:1–13). The five offerings are the fine-flour meal offering, the meal offering prepared in the pan, the meal offering prepared in the deep pan, and the meal offering baked in the oven, either in the form of loaves or in the form of wafers.
<b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> necessary because the opposite conclusion could otherwise have been derived by <b>logical inference</b> based on juxtaposition: The <b>community brings an obligatory meal offering from wheat,</b> i.e., the two loaves brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and</b> the community also <b>brings an obligatory meal offering from barley,</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering. <b>So too an individual, who brings a meal offering from wheat</b> as a voluntary <b>gift</b> offering, <b>can</b> likewise <b>bring a meal offering from barley</b> as a voluntary <b>gift</b> offering. Therefore, to prevent this inference, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of <b>these</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:8), which teaches: I have <b>nothing other than these</b> five meal offerings as individual meal offerings.
The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty: <b>Or</b> perhaps the verse <b>states “these” not</b> in order to exclude other individual meal offerings <b>but rather to</b> teach a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> one who takes a vow to bring a meal offering and <b>says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering,</b> without specifying a particular type of meal offering, and it teaches <b>that he must bring</b> all <b>five of them.</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>The verse states: “Of these,”</b> which indicates that if the one who took a vow <b>wants, he brings one</b> meal offering, and if he <b>wants, he brings</b> all <b>five of them.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“The meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), this serves <b>to include</b> the <b>other meal offerings, for example the meal offering of gentiles</b> and <b>a meal offering</b> brought <b>by women, with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>bringing near.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include</b> from this verse <b>even the two loaves and the shewbread.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of these,”</b> which indicates that not all meal offerings are included in the requirement of bringing near.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> the <b>other meal offerings</b> in the requirement of bringing near, <b>and to exclude the two loaves and the shewbread</b> from this <i>halakha</i>? One could suggest the opposite conclusion, to include these two offerings while excluding the others. The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include</b> the <b>other meal offerings, as there is</b> a portion <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar, <b>and I exclude the two loaves and the shewbread</b> from the requirement of bringing near, <b>as there is no</b> portion <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar. Rather, they are eaten by the priests in their entirety.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations,</b> which is <b>entirely</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire,</b> by this logic one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it</b> should <b>require bringing near.</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of these to the Lord, <b>and it shall be drawn near</b> to the priest, and he shall bring it near to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8). This indicates that the requirement of bringing near applies only to those meal offerings listed in this chapter, not to the meal offering brought with libations, which is not mentioned.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But didn’t you</b> already <b>derive</b> from the term: “And it shall be drawn near,” that the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> is included in the requirement of bringing near? The <i>baraita</i> answers: As the verse could have stated: <b>And shall be drawn near,</b> and instead it states: <b>“And it shall be drawn near,”</b> this addition serves to exclude the meal offering brought with libations from the requirement of bringing near. The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> the <b>other meal offerings</b> in the requirement of bringing near <b>and to exclude the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> from this requirement?

Daf 61a

The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include</b> from this verse the <b>other meal offerings, as they come due to themselves,</b> i.e., they do not accompany other offerings, <b>and I exclude</b> the <b>meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations, as it does not come due to itself</b> but rather together with an animal offering. The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>But the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest</b> also <b>come due to themselves,</b> and according to this logic one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they</b> too would <b>require bringing near.</b>
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall bring it near</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8), to exclude the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest from the requirement of bringing near. The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty: <b>But that</b> verse <b>is required for its own sake,</b> i.e., to teach the basic <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a meal offering <b>requires bringing near</b> to the altar. The <i>baraita</i> answers: This <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from</b> the fact that the verse could have stated just: <b>“And he shall bring,”</b> and instead it states: <b>“And he shall bring it.”</b>
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> the <b>other meal offerings</b> in the requirement of bringing near <b>and to exclude the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include</b> the <b>other meal offerings, as there is</b> a part <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> of the altar, <b>and they come due to themselves, and there is</b> a part <b>of them</b> given <b>to the priests</b> to eat. <b>And I exclude the two loaves and the shewbread, as there is no</b> part <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire. And</b> I exclude <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations, as it does not come due to itself, and</b> I also exclude <b>the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest, as there is no</b> part <b>of them</b> given <b>to the priests.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states: “And the priest shall take off from the meal offering its memorial-part, and shall make it smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:9). With regard to the phrase: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take off,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought the priest may perform this action even <b>with a vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar. <b>And he shall take off from it his handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:7–8). <b>Just as the taking off that is stated below</b> is performed specifically <b>with the</b> priest’s <b>handful</b> and not with a vessel, <b>so too, the taking off that is stated here</b> must be performed <b>with the</b> priest’s <b>handful,</b> not with a vessel.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> are the items that <b>require waving and do not require bringing near</b> to the altar: <b>The <i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper and his guilt offering</b> itself, as it is written: “And the priest shall take one of the lambs and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:12); <b>and the first fruits, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov; and the sacrificial portions of the peace offerings of an individual and their breast and thigh,</b> as it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they bring with the offerings of the portions consumed by fire, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 10:15).
This requirement applies to peace offerings belonging <b>both</b> to <b>men and</b> to <b>women, by</b> male <b>Jews and not by others.</b> The Gemara will explain this seemingly contradictory statement on 61b. In addition, <b>the two loaves and</b> the accompanying peace offering of <b>two lambs</b> brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> also do not require bringing near but do require waving, as it is written: “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20).
<b>How does one perform</b> this waving? <b>He places the two loaves on top</b> of the <b>two lambs and places his two hands below</b> the loaves and the lambs, <b>extends</b> the offerings to each of the four directions <b>and brings</b> them <b>back,</b> then <b>raises and lowers</b> them, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the waving of the ram of the inauguration of the priests: <b>“Which is waved, and which is heaved up”</b> (Exodus 29:27); i.e., waved back and forth, and heaved up and down. <b>Waving was</b> able to be performed <b>to the east</b> of the altar, <b>but</b> the <b>bringing near</b> of meal offerings had to be done <b>to the west,</b> i.e., the southwest corner of the altar. Also, with regard to all meal offerings, <b>the wavings precede the</b> actions of <b>bringing near.</b>
<b>The <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>require</b> both <b>bringing near and waving.</b> The meal offering of the <i>omer</i> requires waving, as it is written: “And he shall wave the <i>omer</i> before the Lord” (Leviticus 23:11), and likewise with regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> it is written: “And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand and shall wave the meal offering before the Lord” (Numbers 5:25). The requirement of bringing near is derived as explained earlier. <b>The shewbread and the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations require neither bringing near nor waving.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There are <b>three types</b> of offerings that <b>require</b> performance of <b>three mitzvot. Two</b> mitzvot are performed <b>on each and every one</b> of them, <b>but the third</b> mitzva <b>is not</b> performed <b>in their</b> sacrifice, meaning that each of these offerings requires two out of the same three mitzvot, but not necessarily the same two as the others. <b>And these are the</b> three offerings: <b>Peace offerings</b> brought as gift offerings by an <b>individual, communal peace offerings,</b> i.e., the two lambs brought with the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the guilt offering of a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:12–14).
<b>Peace offerings</b> brought by <b>individuals require placing hands</b> on the head of the animals while the animals are still <b>alive, and waving</b> when they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving them</b> while they are <b>alive. Communal peace offerings require waving</b> both while the animals are still <b>alive and</b> after they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>placing hands</b> on them. <b>And the guilt offering of a leper requires placing hands and waving</b> while the animal is still <b>alive, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving</b> it after it is <b>slaughtered.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that both the <i>log</i> of oil that accompanies the guilt offering of a recovered leper and the guilt offering itself require waving. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the priest shall take one of the lambs <b>and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and wave them for a wave offering</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:12). The plural form “them” <b>teaches that</b> the <i>log</i> of oil and the offering <b>require waving,</b> and that this should be performed with both of them <b>together.</b>
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the priest <b>waved this one by itself and that one by itself</b> that he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states,</b> in the singular form: <b>“And sacrifice it for a guilt offering…and wave.”</b> The Gemara inquires: Since parts of this verse are in the singular and parts are in the plural, one <b>might</b> have thought that he should <b>wave</b> both together, <b>and then wave</b> each one separately. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A wave offering,”</b> which indicates that he should perform one waving, <b>but not</b> multiple <b>wavings.</b>
With regard to the phrase: “A wave offering <b>before the Lord,”</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that this teaches that waving can be performed <b>to the east</b> of the altar, as taught in the mishna. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> of a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier in the tractate (19b) <b>say,</b> concerning a verse discussing the bringing near of a meal offering, which states: <b>“Before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 6:7), that one <b>might</b> have thought one brings it <b>to the west</b> of the altar, as this is the side facing the Sanctuary? That <i>tanna</i> proceeds to explain that the phrase: “In front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7), is a reference to the south, where one ascends the altar, and therefore the meal offering must be brought to the southwest corner. This indicates, though, that the expression “before the Lord” is a reference to the west.
The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>This statement,</b> that the expression “before the Lord” is a reference to the west and not to the east, applies only with regard to the <b>meal offering, which is called “a sin offering,”</b> as the verse states: “It is most sacred, like the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and</b> the <b>sin offering requires</b> its remaining blood to be poured out on the <b>base</b> of the altar. Therefore, the meal offering must also be brought to a part of the altar where there is a base, <b>and</b> as the <b>southeast corner</b> of the altar <b>did not have a base,</b> the meal offering must be brought to the southwest corner. In this manner one fulfills both the requirement of “in front of the altar,” i.e., to the south, and the requirement of “before the Lord.” <b>But here,</b> with regard to the <i>log</i> of oil and guilt offering of a leper, <b>we call</b> any side of the altar <b>“before the Lord.”</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The first fruits</b> also require waving, <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> alluded to here? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take</b> the basket from your hand, and place it before the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4). This <b>taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning the first fruits, that they require waving;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> as the verse is not explicitly referring to waving? The Gemara explains: The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy from <b>“hand,”</b> written with regard to first fruits, and <b>from “hand,”</b> written with regard to <b>a peace offering. It is written here,</b> with regard to first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take the basket from your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>and it is written there:</b> offering “He who offers his peace offering to God…<b>his hands shall bring it,</b> the fire of God…to raise it as a waving before God” (Leviticus 7:29–30).

Daf 61b

<b>Just as here,</b> in the case of first fruits, it is the <b>priest</b> who takes the basket in his hand and waves it, <b>so too there,</b> in the case of the peace offering, <b>a priest</b> performs the waving. <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a peace offering, it is the <b>owner</b> who performs the waving, as it is written: “He who offers…his hands shall bring it,” <b>so too here,</b> the <b>owner</b> waves the first fruits. <b>How so;</b> how can the waving be performed by both the priest and the owner? The <b>priest places his hands beneath the hands of the owner and waves</b> the first fruits together with the owner.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>also say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that first fruits require waving is <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> with regard to the verse written in the portion of first fruits: <b>“And you shall place it</b> before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 26:10), the reference is not to the placement of the fruits alongside the altar. Rather, <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving</b> the first fruits. <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> a reference <b>only</b> to <b>actual placement</b> of the first fruits?
He explains: <b>When it states</b> earlier: “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand, <b>and place it</b> before the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>placement</b> alongside the altar <b>is</b> already <b>stated; how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“And you shall place it”? This</b> is a reference to <b>waving.</b> It is therefore clear that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov is not the only <i>tanna</i> who holds that there is a requirement of waving the first fruits, as indicated by the mishna; Rabbi Yehuda also maintains this opinion.
<b>Rava says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna could have said that this <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. He preferred to ascribe this opinion to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, <b>since the verse opened first with</b> the phrase cited by Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov as the source for the requirement of waving the first fruits, as Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov derives this <i>halakha</i> from the verse: “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand” (Deuteronomy 26:4); whereas Rabbi Yehuda derives it from the later verse: “And you shall place it before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> preferred to cite this <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>since his strength</b> in Torah <b>is great,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is invariably in accordance with his opinion.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the sacrificial portions of the peace offerings of an individual,</b> which are consumed on the altar, <b>and their breast and thigh,</b> which are eaten by the priests, require waving. This requirement applies to peace offerings belonging <b>both</b> to <b>men and</b> to <b>women, by</b> male <b>Jews and not by others.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>saying?</b> This statement is apparently self-contradictory, as the mishna first states that offerings brought by women require waving, and then it indicates that the offerings of others, including women, do not require waving.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying: Both</b> with regard to <b>men and</b> with regard to <b>women, their offerings require waving, but</b> the <b>waving itself</b> is performed only <b>by</b> male <b>Jews,</b> i.e., if the owner is a male he waves the offering together with a priest. <b>But</b> in the case of offerings brought <b>by women,</b> the female owner does <b>not</b> participate in the waving, as the priest alone performs the mitzva.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to peace offerings, the verse states: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: He who offers his sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord shall bring his offering out of his sacrifice of peace offerings. His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire. The fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:29–30). From the phrase: “The children of [<i>benei</i>] Israel,” it may be derived that <b>the Jewish people wave</b> their offerings, <b>but gentiles</b> who bring their offerings do not wave them. Furthermore, as the term “<i>benei</i>” can also mean: Sons of, it may be derived that only <b>sons of Israel,</b> i.e., males, <b>wave</b> their offerings, <b>but</b> that <b>women do not wave</b> their offerings.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: We have found that the Torah differentiates between the offering of a Jew and the offering of gentiles</b> and also between the offering of men <b>and the offering of women, with regard to</b> the obligation of <b>placing hands.</b> Placing hands is performed only on offerings of male Jews, not on those brought by gentiles and women. Therefore, one <b>might</b> have thought that a similar distinction should apply to the <i>halakha</i> of waving. <b>Can we</b> therefore <b>differentiate</b> between these different offerings also <b>with regard to waving,</b> and conclude that this requirement also applies only to offerings of male Jews, not those brought by gentiles or women?
Rabbi Yosei explains: <b>No;</b> this conclusion is incorrect, since <b>what</b> is the reason that the Torah <b>differentiates</b> between males Jews on the one hand and gentiles and women on the other hand, <b>with regard to placing hands?</b> The reason is <b>that</b> the case of <b>placing hands</b> is unique, as it is performed only <b>by the owner</b> of the offerings; he cannot appoint an agent to perform this ceremony on his behalf. Therefore, since gentiles and women may not perform this ceremony themselves, it is logical that their offerings are excluded from this requirement.
By contrast, can <b>we differentiate</b> between males Jews on the one hand and gentiles and women on the other hand, <b>with regard to waving</b> as well? <b>Since waving</b> is also performed <b>by priests,</b> there is no reason to distinguish between offerings of male Jews and offerings brought by others, as the priests can wave those on behalf of their owners. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “The children of [<i>benei</i>] Israel”?</b> It means that only <b>the Jewish people wave</b> their offerings, <b>but gentiles</b> who bring their offerings do not wave them. Only <b>sons of [<i>benei</i>] Israel,</b> i.e., males, <b>wave</b> their offerings, <b>but women do not wave</b> their offerings.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the phrase: <b>“The children of Israel,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the requirement of waving applies to <b>the children of Israel,</b> i.e., those who were born Jewish. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>converts and</b> to <b>emancipated</b> Canaanite <b>slaves? The verse states,</b> immediately after that phrase: <b>“He who offers [<i>hammakriv</i>]</b> his sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:29), which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> of waving applies to anyone who brings his offering to the Temple, including converts and emancipated slaves.
The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>Or</b> perhaps this term does <b>not</b> serve to include converts and emancipated Canaanite slaves, but <b>rather this</b> is referring to the priest <b>who sacrifices [<i>hammakriv</i>]</b> the sacrificial portions on the altar? The <i>baraita</i> answers: This term cannot be referring to the priest, as <b>when it states: “His own hands shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord made by fire. The fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30), the requirement of waving by the <b>owner is stated.</b> Since the obligation of the owner to wave is stated in this verse, and the obligation of the priest is derived from the verbal analogy from the term “hand” written with regard to a peace offering, evidently both the owner and the priest must wave the offering. The Gemara asks: <b>How so?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>priest places his hands beneath the hands of the owner and waves</b> the offering together with the owner.

Daf 62a

The Gemara asks: <b>How does</b> one <b>perform</b> the ritual of waving? First he <b>places the sacrificial portions on the palm of the hand, and</b> puts the <b>breast and</b> the <b>thigh on them. And in any place,</b> i.e., with regard to any offering, <b>where there are loaves</b> brought with together with the animal, <b>the loaves</b> are placed <b>on the top.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> is it stated that the loaves must be placed on the top? <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This is stated explicitly <b>with regard to</b> the ram offered at the <b>inauguration</b> of the priests, as the verse states: “And he took the fat, and the tail, and all the fat that was upon the inward, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh. And out of the basket of <i>matzot</i> that was before the Lord he took one <i>matza</i>, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh. And he put it all upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 8:25–27).
The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., from where is it learned, that the sacrificial portions should be placed on the bottom, and the breast and thigh on top of them? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving they shall bring upon the offerings of the fat made by fire, to wave it for a wave offering</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 10:15), which indicates that the breast and thigh are placed on top of the fats, that is insufficient: <b>But isn’t it written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The fat upon the breast he shall bring,</b> that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30)? That verse leads to the opposite conclusion, as it indicates that the fats are to be placed on top of the breast.
<b>Abaye said: That</b> second verse is not referring to the placement of the portions for waving. Rather, it describes their placement <b>when</b> the <b>priest brings</b> the parts of the offering <b>from the slaughtering area</b> in order to be waved. This priest carries the breast and thigh below the fats, <b>and</b> accordingly, when he <b>overturns</b> these parts onto the hand of the priest who will wave them, the fat will be under the breast and thigh.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And they put the fat upon the breasts”</b> (Leviticus 9:20), which also indicates that the fat is to be on top of, not beneath, the breast and thigh? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is referring to the stage <b>when</b> the priest who waved them <b>gives them to another priest,</b> who brings the sacrificial portions up to the altar. Once again the parts are turned over in this exchange, so that the sacrificial fats are on top of the breast. <b>And</b> this third priest then <b>goes and burns</b> the sacrificial portions on the altar.
The Gemara adds: <b>And this teaches us that we require three priests</b> to perform this service: One to bring the parts from the slaughtering area, one to wave them, and a third to burn them upon the altar. The reason why all three acts cannot be performed by a single priest is <b>because it is written: “In the multitude of people is the King’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). If a larger number of priests are involved in the Temple service, this represents greater glory for God. Therefore, it is preferable for the service to be carried out by three priests rather than one.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the two loaves and</b> the accompanying peace offering of <b>two lambs</b> brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> also require waving. With regard to this waving, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall wave them upon the bread of the first fruits</b> for a wave offering before the Lord, upon the two lambs; they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest” (Leviticus 23:20).
One <b>might</b> have thought that the priest who performs the waving must <b>place</b> the <b>lambs on top of the bread</b> for the waving. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “A wave offering before the Lord <b>upon the two lambs,”</b> which indicates that the two loaves must be on top of the lambs. <b>If</b> the verse had stated only: <b>“Upon the two lambs,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought the priest must place the <b>bread on top of the lambs.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Upon the bread of the first fruits,”</b> which indicates that the loaves are to be placed under the lambs for waving.
Consequently, <b>the verse is</b> evenly <b>balanced,</b> as two contradictory conclusions can be derived from it, <b>and I do not know whether</b> the <b>bread</b> should be <b>on top of the lambs, or whether</b> the <b>lambs</b> should be <b>on top of</b> the <b>bread.</b> The <i>baraita</i> resolves the contradiction: <b>Just as we find everywhere</b> that waving is performed that the <b>bread</b> is placed <b>above</b> the other portions, <b>so too,</b> in the case of the two loaves and the two lambs, the <b>bread</b> is placed <b>above</b> the lambs. The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> to ask: <b>Where</b> is it stated that the loaves must be placed on top? <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This is stated explicitly <b>with regard to</b> the ram offered at the <b>inauguration</b> of the priests.
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam</b> disagrees with the previous ruling, and <b>says:</b> It is the <b>lambs</b> that are placed <b>above,</b> and the two loaves underneath them. <b>And how do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Upon the two lambs,”</b> which seems to indicate that the two loaves are to be placed above the lambs and not under them? Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam explains: This verse teaches that the requirement to wave the lambs together with the loaves applies only to the two lambs sacrificed as communal peace offerings on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>to exclude</b> the <b>seven</b> other lambs, brought as burnt offerings, which are not to be waved with the loaves.
<b>Ḥanina ben Ḥakhinai says</b> there is a different answer: The priest <b>places the two loaves between the thighs of</b> the two <b>lambs and waves</b> them. <b>And</b> in this manner <b>it is found</b> that he <b>realizes</b> the meaning of both of <b>these two verses,</b> as the <b>bread is on top of the lambs and</b> the <b>lambs</b> are also <b>on top of the bread. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says,</b> in objection to this opinion: <b>One would not do so,</b> i.e., place bread that had been placed between the thighs of lambs, <b>before a flesh and blood king;</b> should <b>one do so before the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He? Rather, he places</b> the two loaves and the two lambs <b>alongside each other, and waves</b> them together, and thereby fulfills the requirements of the verses in a respectful manner.
The Gemara raises an objection to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>But we require</b> fulfillment of the term <b>“upon [<i>al</i>]”</b> in the verse, either by placing the bread upon the lambs or the lambs upon the bread. In response, <b>Rav Ḥisda says to Rav Hamnuna, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> says <b>to Rav Ḥisda:</b> With this opinion, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that the word <b><i>al</i></b> can mean <b>next to.</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the shewbread, the verse states: <b>“And you shall put pure frankincense upon [<i>al</i>] each row”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: <i>Al</i></b> in this instance means: <b>Next to.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means: <b>Next to? Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> means <b>only actually upon?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>When it says:</b> “And you shall put there the Ark of the Testimony, <b>and you shall place a cover over [al] the Ark with the Curtain”</b> (Exodus 40:3), the word <i>al</i> cannot mean upon, as the Curtain that separated the Sanctuary from the Holy of Holies was hanging near the Ark, not placed on top of it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means <b>next to.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that the two loaves and the two lambs are waved in the following manner: The priest places his two hands below the lambs, <b>extends</b> them to each of the four directions <b>and brings</b> them <b>back,</b> then <b>raises and lowers</b> them. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He extends</b> the lambs <b>and brings</b> them <b>back</b> in order to dedicate them <b>to</b> He <b>to Whom the</b> four <b>directions belong. He raises and lowers</b> them in order to dedicate them <b>to</b> He <b>to Whom the heavens and the earth belong.</b>
<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they taught</b> the idea <b>like this: Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina says: He extends</b> the lambs <b>and brings</b> them <b>back in order to</b> request <b>a halt</b> to <b>harmful winds</b> and storms that come from all directions. Similarly, <b>he raises and lowers</b> them <b>in order to halt harmful dews</b> and rains that come from above.
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rav Avin says: That is to say,</b> i.e., it can be derived from here, that <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> helps <b>prevent calamity, as waving is a non-essential mitzva;</b> even if one failed to wave the loaves he has fulfilled his obligation, <b>and</b> nevertheless waving <b>halts harmful winds and dews. Rava says: And</b> one should conduct himself <b>similarly with a <i>lulav</i></b> on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, i.e., he should extend and bring back and raise and lower the <i>lulav</i>, for the same reasons.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> would <b>extend and bring back</b> the <i>lulav</i> in <b>this</b> manner, <b>and</b> would <b>say:</b> I am hereby shooting <b>an arrow in the eye of Satan,</b> as despite Satan’s best efforts, the Jewish people continue to fulfill mitzvot joyously. The Gemara comments: It <b>is not correct</b> to say this, <b>because</b> this will induce Satan to <b>come to incite</b> the Jewish people to sin. Gloating about his victory over the evil inclination will lead Satan to redouble its efforts to corrupt them.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss <i>halakhot</i> concerning the waving of offerings: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The communal peace offerings,</b> which were brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> and which must be waved while the animals are still alive, also <b>require waving after</b> their <b>slaughter, and their waving</b> after they are slaughtered is to be performed <b>as they are,</b> meaning that the whole animal must be waved, as was done when it was alive; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One does not wave the whole animal; rather, the waving is performed only <b>with</b> the <b>breast and thigh.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis <b>disagree? Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Hamnuna, and some say Rav Hamnuna</b> said <b>to Rav Ḥisda:</b> They <b>disagree with regard to</b> a principle about the application of verbal analogies. One adopts the exegetical principle: <b>Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it,</b> meaning that when one case is derived from another by means of a verbal analogy, all the details of the source case are applied to the second case. The other Sage accepts the principle: <b>Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> meaning that one derives only the specific detail referred to by the verbal analogy, and all other aspects of the source case are not applied to the other case.
The Gemara elaborates: The waving of communal peace offerings is derived from the waving of individual peace offerings through a verbal analogy. <b>The Rabbis maintain: Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it,</b> leading to the conclusion: <b>Just as individual peace offerings require waving after slaughter, so too, communal peace offerings require waving after slaughter. And</b> derive the details <b>from it: Just as there,</b> in the case of individual peace offerings, the waving is performed <b>with</b> the <b>breast and thigh</b> alone, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to communal peace offerings <b>as well,</b> the waving is <b>with</b> the <b>breast and thigh</b> alone.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintains: Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> meaning that the basic <i>halakha</i> of the verbal analogy is accepted: <b>Just as individual peace offerings require waving after slaughter, so too, communal peace offerings require waving after slaughter. But interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place: It is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case of individual peace offerings, that the waving is performed <b>with</b> the <b>breast and thigh</b> alone. <b>But here,</b> in the case of communal peace offerings, the waving is <b>as they are,</b> i.e., the animals are waved whole, <b>as they were when</b> they were <b>alive.</b>

Daf 62b

<b>Rav Pappa said</b> there is a different explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis: <b>Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, agrees that with regard to a verbal analogy, the guiding principle <b>is: Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it. And this is</b> the <b>reason for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling that after the slaughter of the communal peace offering one waves the entire body offering, not just the breast and thigh: It is done here <b>like</b> it is done <b>there,</b> in the case of individual peace offerings: <b>Just as there,</b> one waves the <b>item that is a gift to the priest,</b> as the breast and thigh are given to the priests to eat, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the communal peace offerings, one waves the <b>item that is a gift to the priest.</b> Since the communal peace offerings are given to the priests in their entirety, they are also waved in their entirety.
<b>Ravina said</b> an explanation which is the opposite of Rav Pappa’s: <b>Everyone,</b> even the Rabbis, agrees that the guiding principle is: <b>Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place. And this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one waves only the breast and thigh of communal peace offerings: The verse states with regard to individual peace offerings: “For the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving I have taken from the children of Israel out of their sacrifices of peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as an eternal portion from among the children of Israel” (Leviticus 7:34). The term: <b>“Their</b> sacrifices of <b>peace offerings,”</b> is in the plural, despite the fact that the verse is referring to individual peace offerings. This <b>is an amplification,</b> which teaches that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to communal peace offerings, i.e., that only the breast and the thigh are to be waved.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There are <b>three types</b> of offerings that <b>require</b> performance of <b>three mitzvot. Two</b> mitzvot are performed <b>on each and every one</b> of them, <b>but the third</b> mitzva <b>is not</b> performed <b>in their</b> sacrifice, meaning that each of these offerings requires two out of the same three mitzvot, but not necessarily the same two as the others. <b>And these are the</b> three offerings: <b>Peace offerings</b> brought as gift offerings by <b>an individual, communal peace offerings,</b> i.e., the two lambs brought with the two loaves on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the guilt offering of a leper.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>Peace offerings</b> brought by <b>individuals require placing hands</b> on the head of the animals while the animals are still <b>alive, and waving</b> after they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving them</b> while they are <b>alive. Communal peace offerings require waving</b> both while they are still <b>alive and</b> after they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>placing hands</b> on them. <b>And the guilt offering of a leper requires placing hands and waving</b> it while it is still <b>alive, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving</b> it after it is <b>slaughtered.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual require waving</b> while still <b>alive,</b> as this can be derived <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if communal peace offerings,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than that of individual peace offerings in <b>that they do not require placing hands</b> on the head of offerings while they are <b>alive,</b> nevertheless <b>require waving</b> when <b>alive,</b> then with regard to <b>peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual, which</b> do <b>require placing hands</b> while <b>alive, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that they require waving</b> when <b>alive?</b>
The Gemara answers: This <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not accepted, because <b>the Merciful One excluded</b> peace offerings brought by an individual, as the verse states <b>with regard to communal peace offerings:</b> “And the priest shall wave <b>them</b> with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20). The word <b>“them”</b> serves <b>to exclude peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual</b> from the requirement of waving while the animal is alive.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let communal peace offerings require placing hands,</b> as this can be derived <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if peace offerings</b> brought by an <b>individual,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than that of communal peace offerings in <b>that they do not require waving</b> while <b>alive,</b> nevertheless <b>require placing hands,</b> then with regard to <b>communal peace offerings, which</b> do <b>require waving</b> when <b>alive, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that they require placing hands? Ravina said:</b> This <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not accepted, as it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition from Sinai that there are only <b>two</b> cases of <b>placing hands in communal</b> offerings: The scapegoat on Yom Kippur and the bull brought for an unwitting communal sin.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And let the guilt offering of a leper require waving</b> after the animal has been <b>slaughtered,</b> as this can be derived <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if peace offerings</b> brought by an <b>individual,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than that of the guilt offering of a leper in <b>that they do not require waving</b> when <b>alive,</b> nevertheless <b>require waving</b> after they are <b>slaughtered,</b> then with regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper,</b> which <b>requires waving</b> while <b>alive, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that it</b> also <b>requires waving</b> after it is <b>slaughtered?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excluded</b> the guilt offering of a leper, as the verse states <b>with regard to peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual:</b> “His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring; the breast, to wave <b>it</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30). The word <b>“it”</b> serves <b>to exclude the guilt offering of a leper</b> from the requirement of waving after the animal has been slaughtered.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>five</b> people <b>who brought one offering</b> together, <b>one</b> of them <b>waves</b> the offering <b>on behalf of all of them. And</b> in the case of <b>a woman</b> who brings an offering, the <b>priest waves</b> the offering <b>on her behalf. And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who sends his offerings from overseas,</b> the <b>priest waves</b> them <b>on his behalf.</b>

Daf 63a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who</b> takes a vow to bring a meal offering to the Temple and <b>says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a <i>maḥavat</i>, may not bring</b> one prepared <b>in a <i>marḥeshet</i>.</b> Similarly, if he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a <i>marḥeshet</i>, he may not bring</b> one prepared <b>in a <i>maḥavat</i>.</b> The mishna clarifies: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between a <i>maḥavat</i> and a <i>marḥeshet</i>? A <i>marḥeshet</i> has a cover,</b> whereas <b>a <i>maḥavat</i> does not have a cover;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: A <i>marḥeshet</i> is deep, and</b> due to the large amount of oil, <b>its product</b> is soft because it <b>moves about [<i>roḥashin</i>]</b> in the oil. <b>A <i>maḥavat</i></b> is flat, as the sides of the pan are <b>level</b> with the pan, <b>and</b> due to the small amount of oil, <b>its product is hard.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: As the Torah does not describe the different vessels, <b>what is the reason for</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili, explaining that a <i>marḥeshet</i> has a cover and a <i>maḥavat</i> does not have a cover? <b>If we say</b> that the term <b><i>marḥeshet</i></b> indicates <b>that</b> the offering <b>comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> the sinful <b>musings [<i>raḥashei</i>] of the heart, as it is written: “My heart muses [<i>raḥash</i>] on a goodly matter”</b> (Psalms 45:2), and therefore this meal offering must be prepared in a covered vessel just as the thoughts of the heart are hidden, this interpretation is insufficient. <b>And</b> if we say that the term <b><i>maḥavat</i></b> indicates <b>that</b> the offering <b>comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> transgressions committed with the <b>corners of [<i>ammaḥavo’ei</i>] the mouth, as people say</b> with regard to someone who speaks loudly: He <b>is barking [<i>minbaḥ nevuḥei</i>],</b> and therefore this meal offering must be prepared in an open vessel, this interpretation is also insufficient.
The reason these interpretations are insufficient is that one can also <b>say the opposite,</b> and suggest that the name <b><i>maḥavat</i></b> indicates that the offering must be prepared in a closed vessel, <b>as it comes</b> to atone <b>for the secret</b> musings <b>of the heart, as it is written</b> that Laban said to Jacob: <b>“Why did you flee secretly [<i>naḥbeita</i>]”</b> (Genesis 31:27). Likewise, with regard to <b><i>marḥeshet</i>,</b> one can say that it must be prepared in an open vessel, <b>as it comes</b> to atone <b>for whispers [<i>reḥushei</i>]</b> of the mouth which are heard and revealed, <b>as people say: His lips were whispering [<i>meraḥashan</i>].</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili cannot derive the meanings of the terms <i>marḥeshet</i> and <i>maḥavat</i> from the verses; <b>rather,</b> his interpretation <b>is learned as a tradition.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says</b> that a <i>marḥeshet</i> is deep, whereas a <i>maḥavat</i> is flat. The Gemara explains the reason for this opinion: <b>A <i>marḥeshet</i></b> is <b>deep, as it is written</b> with regard to this meal offering: <b>“And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). The use of the term “in” indicates that this meal offering is prepared inside a vessel, i.e., a deep container. Conversely, <b>a <i>maḥavat</i></b> is flat, with the sides of the pan <b>level</b> with the pan, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to this meal offering: <b>“And on the <i>maḥavat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). The use of the term “on” indicates that it is prepared on the vessel, not inside it. Therefore, a flat vessel is required.
§ The mishna teaches that if one vows: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared in a <i>marḥeshet</i>, he is obligated to bring a meal offering of that type. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a <i>marḥeshet</i>,</b> without using the term: Meal offering, or the preposition: In, in such a case the money for the meal offering <b>should be placed</b> in a safe place <b>until</b> the prophet <b>Elijah comes</b> heralding the Messiah, and clarifies what should be done.
The Gemara elaborates: Beit Shammai <b>are uncertain</b> with regard to the source of the terms <i>marḥeshet</i> and <i>maḥavat</i>, <b>whether</b> the offerings <b>are called</b> these names <b>due to</b> the specific <b>vessel</b> in which each meal offering is prepared, <b>or</b> whether they are called these names <b>due to</b> the manner of <b>their preparation.</b> The significance of this distinction is that if the term <i>marḥeshet</i> is referring to a specific type of vessel, then if one takes a vow: It is incumbent upon me to bring a <i>marḥeshet</i>, he must bring an actual vessel of that type, whereas if the term is referring to the manner of preparation of the meal offering then he is obligated to bring that type of meal offering. Since Beit Shammai are uncertain which is the correct interpretation, they rule that he must wait until the prophet Elijah comes.
<b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that there is no uncertainty about this matter, as <b>there was</b> a particular <b>vessel in the Temple, and its name</b> was <b><i>marḥeshet</i>. And</b> this vessel <b>resembled a type of deep <i>kelabus</i>,</b> which is a vessel with indentations, <b>and when dough is placed inside it,</b> it gets pressed against the indentations and takes their shape. The dough <b>resembles a type of apple of <i>berotim</i></b> trees, <b>or a type of acorn [<i>balutei</i>]</b> of <b>the Greek</b> oak trees. Therefore, one who takes a vow: It is incumbent upon me to bring a <i>marḥeshet</i>, must bring this type of vessel to the Temple as a donation.
<b>And</b> the verse <b>states</b> two different prepositions with regard to these vessels: <b>“And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i> and on the <i>maḥavat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). It does not state simply: And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i> and the <i>maḥavat</i>. Since it seems from the verse that when using the <i>marḥeshet</i> the meal offering is prepared inside the vessel and when using the <i>maḥavat</i> it is prepared on the vessel, <b>evidently they are called</b> these names <b>due to</b> the <b>vessel</b> in which the meal offering is prepared, <b>not due to</b> the manner of <b>their preparation.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering baked <b>in an oven, he may not bring</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> on <b>a small oven [<i>kupaḥ</i>], nor a</b> meal offering <b>baked</b> on roofing <b>tiles, nor</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> in the baking <b>pits</b> of <b>the Arabs. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he so <b>wishes,</b> he may <b>bring</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>.</b>
If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering,</b> without specifying loaves or wafers, <b>he may not bring half</b> the required offering in the form of <b>loaves and</b> the other <b>half</b> in the form of <b>wafers;</b> rather, they must all be of one form or the other. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> this <b>permitted, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both loaves and wafers are written with regard to this meal offering, which indicates that <b>it is one offering</b> of two possible forms.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: “And when you bring a meal offering <b>baked in an oven”</b> (Leviticus 2:4), this emphasizes that it must be prepared in an oven, <b>and not baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>, nor baked</b> on roofing <b>tiles, nor baked</b> in the baking <b>pits</b> of <b>the Arabs,</b> in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In this verse it states <b>“oven,”</b> and it also states <b>“oven”</b> in another verse: “And every meal offering that is baked in the oven” (Leviticus 7:9). Since it is written <b>two times,</b> and these terms are restrictions, one follows the hermeneutical principle that a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression serves only to amplify the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. Consequently, this derivation serves <b>to render fit</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>,</b> and it too is deemed an oven. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The terms <b>“oven”</b> and <b>“oven,”</b> which are written a total of <b>two times,</b> serve to teach two <i>halakhot</i>: <b>One</b> instance teaches <b>that their baking should be in an oven, and</b> the other <b>one</b> teaches <b>that their consecration is in an oven,</b> i.e., meal offerings are not consecrated in service vessels but rather in the oven.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> line of <b>reasoning? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (95b) that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One should <b>always be accustomed to say</b> that <b>the two loaves and the shewbread are valid</b> if they are kneaded, shaped, or baked <b>in</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, and</b> that they <b>are</b> also <b>valid</b> if they are prepared <b>in</b> the place called <b>Beit Pagei,</b> which is outside the walls of the Temple Mount? As these offerings are not disqualified by being taken outside the Temple, evidently they are not consecrated in the oven.
<b>Rava said</b> in response: Rabbi Shimon maintains that the oven does not consecrate meal offerings, and as for his statement in the <i>baraita</i> concerning the two derivations, one should <b>say</b> that the other derivation from the term “oven” teaches <b>that their consecration</b> by the owner <b>must be</b> explicit, i.e., from the outset he must say that he is sanctifying his meal offering <b>for the sake</b> of a meal offering baked in <b>an oven.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering, he may not bring half</b> the required offering in the form of loaves and half in the form of wafers, whereas Rabbi Shimon deems this permitted, as it is one offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in an oven” (Leviticus 2:4). The phrase: <b>“And when you bring,”</b> indicates that this offering is not obligatory. Rather, <b>when you</b> wish you may <b>bring,</b> i.e., the verse teaches how <b>to perform</b> the meal offering baked in an oven as <b>a voluntary matter.</b>
With regard to the term: <b>“A meal offering,” Rabbi Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering, that he must not bring half</b> of the bread in the form of <b>loaves and half</b> in the form of <b>wafers? The verse states: “A meal offering,”</b> which indicates: <b>I told you</b> to bring <b>one offering,</b> i.e., all ten loaves from one type, <b>and not two or three offerings</b> of different types, as allowed by Rabbi Shimon.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda:

Daf 63b

<b>And is it stated</b> with regard to a meal offering baked in an oven: <b>“Offering,”</b> and again: <b>Offering,</b> for a total of <b>two times,</b> once in connection to a meal offering of loaves and once in connection to a meal offering of wafers? If that were the case, it would indicate that these are two types of offerings. But <b>doesn’t it</b> actually <b>say “offering” only one</b> time: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in an oven, it shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4)? <b>And it is stated with regard to this</b> meal offering both <b>loaves and wafers,</b> which indicates that these are two varieties of the same offering.
Rabbi Shimon continues: <b>From now</b> it may be inferred that if one <b>wants to bring</b> ten <b>loaves he may bring</b> ten loaves, and if he prefers to bring ten <b>wafers, he may bring</b> ten wafers, and if he decides that <b>half</b> of them should be <b>loaves and half</b> of them <b>wafers, he may bring</b> it in this manner. <b>And</b> if he brings part as loaves and part as wafers, how does he proceed? He <b>mingles</b> all of <b>them and removes a handful from both of them. And</b> if <b>he removed a handful and</b> it happened that only part <b>of one</b> type, either loaves or wafers, <b>came up in his hand for both of them,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, as they are both part of a single offering.
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering, that he may not bring half</b> of the offering as <b>loaves and half</b> as <b>wafers?</b> He answers: <b>The verse states: “And every meal offering that is baked in an oven, and every one that is made in the deep pan, and on the shallow pan, shall belong to the priest who sacrifices it. And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron,</b> one as well as another” (Leviticus 7:9–10).
The verses juxtapose the meal offering baked in an oven to the meal offering prepared on the pan and the meal offering prepared in the deep pan, and similarly to the meal offering brought as a gift, alluded to by the phrase: “Mixed with oil,” and to the meal offering of a sinner, which is called: “Dry.” This teaches that <b>just as</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>stated below</b> with regard to those meal offerings, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, <b>so too,</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:9), <b>stated above,</b> with regard to the two forms of meal offering baked in an oven, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, and therefore one may not bring part as loaves and part as wafers.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that loaves and wafers are two different types of meal offerings baked in an oven, respond to Rabbi Shimon’s proof? After all, <b>Rabbi Shimon is saying well</b> when he points out that the verse mentions “offering” only once. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda could have <b>said to you: Since it is written: “With oil,”</b> and: <b>“With oil,”</b> in the verse: “It shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4), it is considered <b>as though it is written “offering”</b> and <b>“offering,”</b> and therefore these are deemed two different types of meal offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon maintains that the repetition of the term “with oil” teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>If it were not written “with oil,”</b> and again <b>“with oil,” I would say</b> that a meal offering baked in an oven must be <b>specifically</b> brought <b>half</b> as <b>loaves and half</b> as <b>wafers, and</b> if he wanted to bring only <b>loaves alone or wafers alone,</b> I would <b>say</b> that he may <b>not</b> bring a meal offering in this manner. The repetition of the term “with oil” <b>teaches us</b> that a meal offering baked in an oven can comprise ten loaves, or ten wafers, or a combination of both types.
The Gemara further inquires: The <i>baraita</i> states that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds that loaves and wafers are two different types of meal offerings. The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, is</b> the same as that of <b>his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, whose opinion is also mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. Why is it necessary to cite Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion separately? The Gemara explains: It is necessary to cite the opinion of Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda, because there is a practical difference <b>between</b> his ruling and that of his father; <b>as, if</b> someone transgressed and <b>performed</b> the sacrifice of a meal offering baked in an oven by bringing a mixture of loaves and wafers, according to Rabbi Yehuda the offering is valid after the fact, whereas Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda deems it not valid even after the fact.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> When the day of the sacrifice of the <b><i>omer</i></b> meal offering <b>would</b> occur <b>on Shabbat,</b> the labors performed that would otherwise be prohibited were kept to a minimum, and the one-tenth of an ephah of flour that was <b>brought</b> as an offering was processed <b>from three <i>se’a</i></b> of reaped barley. <b>And</b> if it occurred <b>during the week,</b> the flour was processed <b>from five</b> <i>se’a</i> of reaped barley. <b>And the Rabbis say: Both on Shabbat and</b> during the <b>week,</b> the <i>omer</i> offering <b>would come from three</b> <i>se’a</i> of reaped barley.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, says: On Shabbat</b> the barley <b>was reaped by an individual and with one sickle and with one basket</b> into which the barley was placed; <b>and during the week,</b> it was reaped <b>by three</b> people <b>with three baskets and three sickles. And the Rabbis say: Both on Shabbat and</b> during the <b>week,</b> it was reaped <b>by three</b> people <b>with three baskets and with three sickles.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Rabbi Yishmael and the Rabbis disagree in the mishna with regard to how many <i>se’a</i> of barley were reaped for the <i>omer</i> meal offering on Shabbat. According to Rabbi Yishmael three <i>se’a</i> were reaped when the offering was brought on a Shabbat, and five <i>se’a</i> were reaped when the offering was brought on a weekday. The Rabbis maintain that both during the week and on Shabbat, three <i>se’a</i> were reaped. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> is clear, as they maintain that <b>a select tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>comes from three <i>se’a</i></b> of reaped barley, <b>and</b> therefore <b>there is no difference</b> whether the barley is reaped <b>during the week or</b> whether it is reaped <b>on Shabbat,</b> as a select tenth is required.
<b>Rather,</b> there is a question with regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who differentiates between Shabbat and during the week. <b>What</b> does he <b>hold? If he holds</b> that <b>a select tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>can come only from five</b> <i>se’a</i> of reaped barley, then <b>even on Shabbat</b> five <i>se’a</i> should <b>also</b> be required. And <b>if</b> the select tenth of an ephah of flour <b>can come from</b> even <b>three</b> <i>se’a</i>, then <b>even on a weekday</b> three should suffice.
<b>Rava said: Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that <b>a select tenth</b> of an ephah of flour can come <b>without exertion from five</b> <i>se’a</i>, and <b>with exertion from three.</b> Therefore, <b>on a weekday we</b> reap and <b>bring</b> flour <b>from five</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>as this</b> produces <b>a better</b> final <b>product,</b> since only the highest-quality flour of each <i>se’a</i> is selected. <b>On Shabbat,</b> it is <b>preferable that one</b> should <b>increase</b> the effort involved <b>in one prohibited labor,</b> that <b>of sifting</b> the flour numerous times, <b>and one</b> should <b>not increase</b> the number of prohibited acts involved in performing <b>many prohibited labors,</b> such as reaping and winnowing, which are required for the processing of five <i>se’a</i>.
§ <b>Rabba said: Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, said the same thing. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> when the Paschal offering is sacrificed but not roasted until Shabbat ends, <b>one flays the Paschal offering up to the breast,</b> to enable removal of the parts of the animal that are sacrificed upon the altar on Shabbat, and flays the rest of the animal after Shabbat. Further skinning is only to facilitate eating the animal and therefore it does not override Shabbat. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. And the Rabbis say:</b> One has not performed the obligation properly <b>unless he flays it in its entirety.</b>
The Gemara explains why the statements of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, are the same. <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, say there</b> that <b>anywhere that it is possible</b> to perform the necessary task without an additional action, <b>we do not exert</b> ourselves on Shabbat? <b>Here, too, since it is possible</b> to perform the necessary task without the extra flaying, <b>we do not exert</b> ourselves.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>From where</b> is this conclusion reached? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yishmael states</b> his ruling <b>only here,</b> in the case of reaping three <i>se’a</i> on Shabbat, <b>where there is no degradation of consecrated</b> items. <b>But there, where there is degradation of consecrated</b> items, as the animal will be left half-flayed overnight,

Daf 64a

<b>I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>he holds</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the entire animal should be flayed.
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, states</b> his ruling <b>only there,</b> in the case of the Paschal offering, <b>where the requirements for the Most High,</b> i.e., the Temple service, <b>have been fulfilled, and</b> therefore there is <b>no need to desecrate the Shabbat. But here, where</b> the community must bring a select tenth of an ephah and therefore <b>the requirements for the Most High have not been fulfilled, and it is necessary to desecrate the Shabbat, say</b> that <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that one reaps the same amount of barley on Shabbat as during the week.
<b>Rather, Rabba said: Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, said the same thing. As we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, says: On Shabbat</b> the barley <b>was reaped by an individual with one sickle and with one basket</b> into which the barley was placed; <b>and during the week,</b> it was reaped <b>by three</b> people <b>with three baskets and with three sickles. And the Rabbis say: Both on Shabbat and</b> during the <b>week,</b> it was reaped by three people <b>with three baskets and with three sickles.</b>
The Gemara explains Rabba’s comparison: <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, say there,</b> with regard to the process of gathering the barley, that <b>since it is possible</b> to reap by means of one person, <b>we do not exert</b> ourselves to reap it by means of three? <b>Here, too,</b> Rabbi Yishmael maintains that <b>since it is possible</b> to bring the <i>omer</i> meal offering from three <i>se’a</i> of barley, <b>we do not exert</b> ourselves on Shabbat to bring it from five <i>se’a</i>.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>From where</b> is this conclusion reached? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yishmael states</b> his ruling <b>only here,</b> because <b>there is no</b> greater <b>publicity</b> of the <b>event</b> achieved by using five <i>se’a</i> rather than three. <b>But there,</b> in the case of reaping the barley, where <b>there is</b> greater <b>publicity</b> of the <b>event</b> through the involvement of more people, one can <b>say that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<b>Alternatively,</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, states</b> his ruling <b>only there, as whether one</b> individual <b>or three</b> people reap, the rite <b>is</b> still being <b>performed in its proper manner</b> for <b>the requirement of the Most High. But here, when</b> only three <i>se’a</i> are used, and the rite <b>is not</b> being <b>performed in its proper manner</b> for <b>the requirement of the Most High,</b> as five <i>se’a</i> are usually needed, <b>say that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that on Shabbat the mitzva is performed in the same manner as on a weekday.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Yosei said the same thing. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 21b): <b>Whether</b> the new moon <b>was seen clearly [<i>ba’alil</i>]</b> by everyone <b>or whether it was not seen clearly, one may desecrate the Shabbat</b> in order to testify about its appearance. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If</b> the moon <b>was clearly seen,</b> witnesses <b>may not desecrate the Shabbat for it,</b> as other witnesses located nearer to the court will certainly testify. If these distant witnesses go to court to testify, they will desecrate Shabbat unnecessarily.
The Gemara explains Rav Ashi’s comparison: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yosei say there: Since it is possible</b> to receive testimony about the new moon without further witnesses, <b>we do not exert</b> ourselves and travel on Shabbat? <b>Here, too,</b> Rabbi Yishmael holds that <b>since it is possible</b> to bring the <i>omer</i> meal offering from three <i>se’a</i> of barley, <b>we do not exert</b> ourselves on Shabbat to bring it from five <i>se’a</i>.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yishmael states only here that</b> three <i>se’a</i> are brought on Shabbat, <b>as there is no</b> concern that ultimately <b>you will cause</b> people <b>to stumble in the future</b> and refrain from bringing the <i>omer</i> offering. <b>But there,</b> in the case of witnesses testifying about the new moon, he concedes that all potential witnesses may travel on Shabbat because if not, <b>you will cause them to stumble in the future.</b> People will say: Why should we go to such trouble, as our testimony is unnecessary? Yet at some point they will be needed, and no witnesses will come to the court. Therefore, in that case one can <b>say</b> that Rabbi Yishmael agrees with this reasoning and <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible that <b>Rabbi Yosei states</b> his ruling <b>only there,</b> with regard to the new moon, <b>as this is not a requirement for the Most High, and</b> therefore <b>Shabbat may not be desecrated. But here,</b> as the <i>omer</i> meal offering <b>is a requirement for the Most High, and</b> therefore <b>Shabbat may be desecrated</b> for it, <b>say</b> that Rabbi Yosei holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that on Shabbat the mitzva is performed in the same manner as on a weekday.
§ <b>It was stated</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 5:7): If one mistakenly <b>slaughtered two communal sin offerings,</b> e.g., the goat offerings of a Festival, on a Festival that occurred on Shabbat, <b>and only one was required, Rabba said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ami</b> who said: He is <b>liable for the second,</b> superfluous communal sin offering, <b>but</b> is <b>exempt for the first. And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if he achieved atonement with the second</b> offering, e.g., if the blood of the first offering was spilled after the slaughter of the second. And this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if the first</b> offering <b>was found</b> to be <b>gaunt</b>and thereby disqualified as an offering, which meant that only the second offering was fit.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in a case where the first animal was found to be gaunt, <b>did Rabba</b> really <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabba say</b> that if one <b>had before him two</b> communal <b>sin offerings</b> on Shabbat, <b>one choice</b> animal <b>and one gaunt,</b> and he <b>slaughtered the choice</b> one <b>and then slaughtered</b> the <b>gaunt</b> one, he is <b>liable</b> for the gaunt animal, as it should not have been slaughtered. But if he first slaughtered the <b>gaunt</b> one <b>and subsequently</b> slaughtered the <b>choice</b> animal, he is <b>exempt</b> for slaughtering the choice animal. <b>And moreover,</b> members of the court <b>say to him</b> after he slaughtered the gaunt animal: <b>Bring</b> the <b>choice</b> animal <b>and slaughter</b> it <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> If so, in a case where the first animal was found to be gaunt, he certainly should not be liable for slaughtering the second.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say: Remove [<i>semei</i>]</b> the clause with regard to the <b>gaunt</b> animal <b>from the first</b> statement of Rabba. In other words, Rabba merely said that he is exempt for the slaughter of the first animal; he did not state a ruling about the second animal. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the ruling <b>that</b> he is liable for the slaughter of the second animal <b>was stated</b> by <b>Rabbi Ami,</b> not Rabba.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the <b>first</b> offering is <b>found</b> to <b>be gaunt,</b> i.e., weakened, <b>in its intestines</b> after it was slaughtered, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we follow his intention</b> and hold him accountable, <b>and this man,</b> who was unaware at the time of its slaughter that the first animal was gaunt, <b>intended</b> to transgress the Shabbat <b>prohibition</b> by slaughtering the second offering? <b>Or perhaps we follow his actions</b> and exempt him from liability, as the first offering had been disqualified when he brought the second.
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>Isn’t this</b> the same as a case subject to a disagreement between <b>Rabba and Rava,</b> and in fact both agree that in this case he is liable? <b>As it was stated:</b> If <b>one heard that a child was drowning at sea, and he spread a net to raise fish and</b> the result was that <b>he raised</b> only <b>fish,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for transgressing the Shabbat prohibition of trapping. If he intended <b>to raise fish,</b> and he <b>raised</b> both <b>fish and</b> the <b>child, Rava says:</b> He is <b>liable,</b> as his intention was to transgress a prohibition, <b>and Rabba says:</b> He is <b>exempt,</b> as his act saved a life and was therefore permitted on Shabbat.
The Gemara explains why everyone would agree that one is liable in the case involving two offerings. <b>And Rabba deemed</b> him <b>exempt only there, since</b> the one who spread the net <b>heard</b> that a child had fallen in, and therefore <b>we say that his intention</b> in spreading the net <b>was also to</b> save <b>the child. But</b> had he <b>not heard</b> that the child had fallen in, he would <b>not</b> be exempt. This is comparable to the case of two offerings, where he could not have known before its slaughter that the first animal had weak intestines.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina conclusively: <b>This is</b> subject to the disagreement <b>between Rabba and Rava. As it was stated:</b> If <b>one heard that a child was drowning at sea, and he spread a net to raise fish and</b> the result was that <b>he raised</b> only <b>fish,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for transgressing the Shabbat prohibition of trapping. If he intended <b>to raise fish,</b> and he <b>raised</b> both <b>fish and</b> the <b>child, Rava says:</b> He is <b>liable, and Rabba says:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b> Rav Ashi adds that Rabba did not exempt him because he heard that a child was drowning. Rather, <b>Rabba says</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> because one <b>follows his actions,</b> whereas <b>Rava says</b> that he is <b>liable</b> because one <b>follows his intention.</b> Consequently, the same dispute applies to the case of two offerings.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion concerning performing extra prohibited labor on Shabbat in extenuating circumstances where the desecration of Shabbat is allowed. <b>Rabba says:</b> With regard to a dangerously <b>ill person</b> on Shabbat <b>whom</b> the doctors <b>evaluated</b> as needing <b>to</b> eat <b>one fig</b> to regain his health, <b>and ten men ran and</b> each cut and <b>brought ten figs simultaneously,</b> one each, <b>they are</b> all <b>exempt</b> from liability for transgressing the prohibition of reaping on Shabbat. This applies <b>even</b> in a case where the ten come <b>one after the other,</b> and <b>even</b> if the ill person <b>had already recovered his health by</b> eating <b>the first</b> fig.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> In the case of a dangerously <b>ill person</b> on Shabbat <b>whom</b> the doctors <b>evaluated</b> as needing <b>to</b> eat <b>two figs</b> to regain his health, <b>and there are two figs</b> attached to a tree <b>by two stems [<i>okatzin</i>] and</b> another <b>three figs</b> attached to the tree <b>by one stem, which</b> one <b>of them</b> do <b>we bring?</b> Do <b>we bring two</b> figs, <b>as</b> that is the amount that <b>is fit for him,</b> i.e., this is the number of figs the ill person needs? <b>Or perhaps we bring</b> the <b>three</b> figs, <b>as</b> although he requires only two, this serves to <b>limit</b> the labor of <b>reaping,</b> as the three figs are attached to the tree by a single stem.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>obvious</b> that <b>we bring</b> the <b>three</b> figs,

Daf 64b

<b>as Rabbi Yishmael states only there,</b> in the mishna, that three <i>se’a</i> of barley are reaped on Shabbat, <b>as</b> in that case <b>when</b> one <b>limits</b> the amount available <b>for eating,</b> he likewise <b>limits</b> the amount of <b>reaping. But here, when</b> one <b>limits</b> the amount <b>of eating</b> by bringing the two figs, he also <b>increases</b> the amount of <b>reaping.</b> Therefore is it <b>certain</b> that <b>we bring</b> the ill person the <b>three</b> figs attached by a single stem.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The mitzva of the <i>omer</i> is to bring</b> the barley reaped for the meal offering <b>from</b> fields <b>proximate</b> to Jerusalem. If the barley <b>did not ripen</b> in <b>the</b> fields <b>proximate to Jerusalem, one brings it from any place</b> in Eretz Yisrael. There was <b>an incident where the <i>omer</i> came from Gaggot Tzerifin and</b> the wheat for <b>the two loaves</b> on <i>Shavuot</i> came <b>from the valley of Ein Sokher.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the barley reaped for the <i>omer</i> meal offering should ideally be brought from fields proximate to Jerusalem? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is <b>because</b> the verse states: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the <b>fresh ear [<i>karmel</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:14). This indicates that the grain should be soft and fresh. Consequently it should be brought from close by, not from a place where it might become stale and hardened during a long journey.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the reason is <b>due to</b> the principle that <b>one does not postpone</b> performance of <b>the mitzvot.</b> When presented with the opportunity to perform a mitzva, one should perform it immediately. Therefore, the barley for the mitzva of the <i>omer</i> meal offering in the Temple should be brought from the first crop encountered outside of Jerusalem.
§ The mishna teaches: There was <b>an incident where the <i>omer</i> came from Gaggot Tzerifin</b> and the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i> came from the valley of Ein Sokher. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that provides the background of this event: <b>When the kings of the Hasmonean monarchy besieged each other</b> in their civil war, <b>Hyrcanus was outside of</b> Jerusalem, besieging it, <b>and Aristoblus was inside. On each and every day they would lower dinars in a box</b> from inside the city, <b>and</b> those on the outside <b>would send up</b> animals for them to bring the <b>daily offerings</b> in the Temple.
<b>A certain elderly man was there,</b> in Jerusalem, <b>who was familiar with Greek wisdom. He communicated to</b> those on the outside <b>by</b> using words understood only by those proficient in <b>Greek wisdom. The elderly man said to them: As long as they are engaged with the</b> Temple <b>service, they will not be delivered into your hands.</b> Upon hearing this, <b>on the following day,</b> when <b>they lowered dinars in a box, they sent up a pig to them. Once</b> the pig <b>reached halfway</b> up the <b>wall, it inserted its hooves</b> into the wall and <b>Eretz Yisrael shuddered four hundred parasangs by four hundred parasangs.</b>
When the Sages saw this, <b>they said</b> at <b>that time: Cursed is he who raises pigs, and cursed is he who teaches his son Greek wisdom. And</b> it is <b>with regard to that time</b> of civil war, in which the land was destroyed, that <b>we learned: An incident</b> occurred <b>in which the <i>omer</i>,</b> the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>came from Gaggot Tzerifim, and the two loaves</b> offered on <i>Shavuot</i> came <b>from the valley of Ein Sokher.</b> Since no fresh barley grain was found in the fields immediately surrounding Jerusalem, it had to be brought from these outlying areas.
§ The Gemara relates another tradition with regard to that occasion when the <i>omer</i> came from Gaggot Tzerifin and the two loaves from the valley of Ein Sokher: <b>When it came</b> time to bring the <b><i>omer</i></b> meal offering, <b>they did not know from where</b> they could <b>bring</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> grain, as all the surrounding fields were looted and ruined. The court publicly <b>proclaimed</b> their difficulty. <b>A certain deaf-mute [<i>ḥersha</i>] came</b> forward and <b>stretched out one hand toward a roof,</b> <i>gag</i> in Hebrew, <b>and one hand toward a hut [<i>atzerifa</i>]. Mordekhai said to</b> the Sages: <b>Is there a place that is called Gaggot Tzerifin or Tzerifin Gaggot? They checked and found</b> that there was such a place, and it contained fields of barley from which they were able to bring the <i>omer</i> meal offering.
A similar incident occurred <b>when they needed to bring the two loaves,</b> and <b>they did not know from where to bring</b> the grain. Again the court publicly <b>proclaimed</b> their difficulty, and <b>a certain deaf-mute came</b> forward and <b>stretched out</b> one <b>hand toward his eye [<i>a’eineih</i>] and one hand toward a door latch [<i>assikhera</i>]. Mordekhai said to</b> the Sages: <b>And is there a place that is called: Ein Sokher, or Sokher Ayin? They checked and found</b> that there was such a place, and it contained fields of wheat from which they were able to bring the two loaves.
The Gemara relates another story that demonstrates Mordekhai’s wisdom: Once, <b>a certain three women brought three nests</b> for their obligatory offerings of pairs of pigeons or doves (see Leviticus 15:29). <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> This offering is <b>for my <i>ziva</i>; and one said:</b> This if <b>for my <i>yamma</i>; and</b> the last <b>one said:</b> This is <b>for my <i>ona</i>.</b>
The Sages <b>understood from</b> the first woman’s statement: <b>For my <i>ziva</i>,</b> that she had experienced a discharge of uterine blood when not expecting her menstrual period, which would give her the status of <b>an actual <i>zava</i>.</b> From the second woman’s statement: <b>For my <i>yamma</i>,</b> they understood: <b>My actual <i>yamma</i>,</b> i.e., she was also a <i>ziva</i>, as <i>yam</i> can mean: Sea, or a flow of blood. From the third woman’s statement: <b>For my <i>ona</i>,</b> they came to the conclusion that she needed to bring a sacrifice <b>for her time [<i>ona</i>]</b> of completing her purification process from being a <i>zava</i>. Accordingly, they understood <b>that all</b> these women were obligated to bring <b>one sin offering and one burnt offering.</b>
<b>Mordekhai said to</b> the other Sages: <b>Perhaps</b> the first woman <b>was endangered</b> in the course <b>of</b> her menstrual <b>flow [<i>zov</i>].</b> Similarly, <b>perhaps</b> the second woman <b>was endangered at sea [<i>yam</i>].</b> Finally, <b>perhaps</b> the third woman <b>was endangered through her eye [<i>ayin</i>],</b> as <i>ayin</i> is phonetically similar to <i>ona</i>. According to these explanations, each woman sought to bring a voluntary offering to give thanks to God for being saved from danger. If so, the appropriate offering in each case is not a sin offering, <b>as they are all burnt offerings.</b> It <b>was checked and</b> they <b>found</b> that Mordekhai’s interpretation was in fact correct.

Daf 65a

<b>And this is as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 13b): <b>Petaḥya</b> was responsible <b>for the nests</b> of birds, i.e., the doves or pigeons brought by a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zava</i>, a woman after childbirth, and a leper. These individuals would place the appropriate sum of money into the horn designated for this purpose, and each day Petaḥya oversaw the purchase of birds from that money and their sacrifice in the proper manner. <b>This</b> Sage <b>is Mordekhai;</b> and <b>why was he called Petaḥya,</b> which resembles the word for opening [<i>petaḥ</i>]? The reason is <b>that he would open,</b> i.e., elucidate, difficult <b>topics and interpret them</b> to the people, <b>and</b> because <b>he knew</b> all <b>seventy languages</b> known in that region at the time.
The Gemara asks: What was unique about Petaḥya? <b>All</b> of the members of the <b>Sanhedrin also know</b> all <b>seventy languages. As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> They <b>place on the</b> Great <b>Sanhedrin only</b> men <b>of wisdom, and of</b> pleasant <b>appearance, and of</b> high <b>stature, and of</b> suitable <b>age</b> so that they will be respected. <b>And</b> they must also be <b>masters of sorcery,</b> i.e., they know the nature of sorcery, so that they can judge sorcerers, <b>and</b> they must <b>know</b> all <b>seventy languages</b> in order <b>that the Sanhedrin will not</b> need to <b>hear</b> testimony <b>from the mouth of a translator</b> in a case where a witness speaks a different language.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Petaḥya was unique <b>as</b> he not only knew all seventy languages, but also had the ability to <b>combine</b> various <b>languages and interpret</b> them. <b>This is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written with regard to Mordekhai: “Bilshan”</b> (Nehemiah 7:7). Bilshan is interpreted as another name for Mordekhai, as he would combine [<i>balil</i>] languages [<i>lashon</i>].
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How would they perform</b> the rite of the harvest of the <i>omer</i>? <b>Emissaries of the court</b> would <b>emerge on the eve of the festival</b> of Passover <b>and fashion</b> the stalks of barley into <b>sheaves while</b> the stalks were still <b>attached to the ground, so that it would be convenient to reap</b> them. The residents of <b>all the towns adjacent to</b> the site of the harvest <b>would assemble there, so that it would be harvested with great fanfare.</b>
<b>Once it grew dark,</b> the court emissary <b>says to</b> those assembled: <b>Did the sun set?</b> The assembly <b>says</b> in response: <b>Yes.</b> The emissary repeats: <b>Did the sun set?</b> They again <b>say: Yes.</b> The court emissary next says to those assembled: Shall I reap the sheaves with <b>this sickle?</b> The assembly <b>says</b> in response: <b>Yes.</b> The emissary repeats: With <b>this sickle?</b> The assembly <b>says: Yes.</b> The court emissary then says to those assembled: Shall I place the gathered sheaves in <b>this basket?</b> The assembly <b>says</b> in response: <b>Yes.</b> The emissary repeats: In <b>this basket?</b> The assembly <b>says: Yes.</b>
If the sixteenth of Nisan occurs <b>on Shabbat,</b> the court emissary <b>says to</b> the assembled: Shall I cut the sheaves on <b>this Shabbat?</b> The assembly <b>says</b> in response: <b>Yes.</b> The emissary repeats: On <b>this Shabbat?</b> The assembly <b>says: Yes.</b> The court emissary says to those assembled: <b>Shall I cut</b> the sheaves? <b>And they say to him</b> in response: <b>Cut.</b> The emissary repeats: <b>Shall I cut</b> the sheaves? <b>And they say</b> to him: <b>Cut.</b>
The emissary asks <b>three times with regard to each and every matter, and</b> the assembly <b>says to him: Yes, yes, yes.</b> The mishna asks: <b>Why do I</b> need those involved to publicize each stage of the rite <b>to that extent?</b> The mishna answers: It is <b>due to the Boethusians, as they</b> deny the validity of the Oral Law and <b>would say: There is no harvest of the <i>omer</i> at the conclusion of the</b> first <b>Festival</b> day of Passover unless it occurs at the conclusion of Shabbat. The publicity was to underscore that the sixteenth of Nisan was the proper time for the <i>omer</i> harvest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are the days on which fasting is prohibited, and on some of them eulogizing is prohibited</b> as well: <b>From the New Moon of Nisan until the eighth of</b> the month, the proper sacrifice of <b>the daily offering was established,</b> and therefore it was decreed <b>not to eulogize</b> on these dates. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>from the eighth of</b> Nisan <b>until the end of the festival</b> of Passover, the correct date for the <b>festival of <i>Shavuot</i> was restored,</b> and it was similarly decreed <b>not to eulogize</b> during this period.
The Gemara discusses the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the New Moon of Nisan until the eighth of</b> the month the proper sacrifice of <b>the daily offering was established,</b> and therefore it was decreed <b>not to eulogize</b> on these dates. The Gemara explains <b>that the Sadducees would say: An individual may donate and bring</b> the <b>daily offering,</b> in opposition to the accepted tradition that the daily offering must be brought from communal funds. <b>What</b> verse did the Sadducees <b>expound? “The one lamb shall you offer [<i>ta’aseh</i>] in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer in the afternoon”</b> (Numbers 28:4). Since the verse is in the singular form, the Sadducees maintained that even an individual may donate the daily offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> did the Sages <b>reply</b> to refute the argument of the Sadducees? They cited the verse: “Command the children of Israel, and say to them: <b>My food that is presented to Me for offerings made by fire,</b> of a pleasing aroma unto Me, <b>you shall observe [<i>tishmeru</i>]</b> to offer to Me in its due season” (Numbers 28:2). The term: “You shall observe” is in the plural form, which indicates that <b>all of the</b> daily offerings <b>should come from collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> Since during that period, between the New Moon of Nisan and the eighth of Nisan, the Sages overruled the Sadducees, it was established as a period of rejoicing, and it was prohibited to eulogize on those dates.
The Gemara discusses the next period listed in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the eighth of</b> Nisan <b>until the end of the festival</b> of Passover, the correct date for the <b>festival of <i>Shavuot</i> was restored,</b> and it was similarly decreed <b>not to eulogize</b> during this period. <b>As the Boethusians would say</b> that the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> always occurs <b>after Shabbat,</b> on a Sunday. Their reasoning was that the verse states, with regard to the <i>omer</i> offering and the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> that follows seven weeks later: “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>], from the day that you brought the sheaf [<i>omer</i>] of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete” (Leviticus 23:15). Disregarding the oral tradition, the Boethusians interpreted the phrase “from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>]” literally, as referring to Shabbat, not the Festival day.
At the time, <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai joined</b> the discussion with the Boethusians <b>and said to them: Fools! From where</b> have <b>you</b> derived this? <b>And there was no man who answered him, except for one elderly man who was prattling [<i>mefatpet</i>] at him, and he said: Moses, our teacher, was a lover of the Jewish people and he knew that <i>Shavuot</i> is</b> only <b>one day.</b> Therefore, <b>he arose and established it after Shabbat, in order that the Jewish people would enjoy themselves for two days.</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>recited this verse</b> in response <b>to</b> that old man: <b>“It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the way of Mount Seir”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:2).

Daf 65b

<b>And if Moses, our teacher, was a lover of the Jewish people, why did he delay them in the wilderness forty years?</b> The elderly man <b>said to him: My teacher, you dismiss me with this</b> retort? Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Fool! And will our perfect Torah not be</b> as worthy <b>as your frivolous speech?</b> Your claim can easily be refuted.
Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai cites a proof that <i>Shavuot</i> does not need to occur specifically on a Sunday. <b>One verse states:</b> “Even to the morrow after the seventh week <b>you shall number fifty days;</b> and you shall present a new meal offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and one verse,</b> the preceding one, apparently contradicts this when it <b>states:</b> “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the waving; <b>seven weeks shall there be complete.”</b> Is the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> seven full weeks after Passover, i.e., counting from Sunday through Shabbat seven times; or is it fifty days after Passover?
The Gemara explains: <b>How so,</b> i.e., how can one reconcile these two verses? <b>Here,</b> the verse that mentions seven complete weeks, is referring to a year <b>when the festival</b> of Passover <b>occurs on Shabbat.</b> In such a year, the fifty-day period between Passover and <i>Shavuot</i> contains seven complete weeks, from Sunday through Shabbat. <b>There,</b> the verse that defines the period as fifty days, is referring to a year <b>when the festival</b> of Passover <b>occurs in the middle of the week.</b>
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for several other proofs in refutation of the claim of the Boethusians: That <b>of Rabbi Eliezer: Number; Rabbi Yehoshua: Count; Rabbi Yishmael: From the <i>omer</i>; Rabbi Yehuda: Below.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The previous proof <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Seven weeks <b>you shall number for you;</b> from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). The term “for you” indicates that the <b>counting</b> of the weeks <b>is dependent upon</b> the decision of the <b>court, as they know</b> how to <b>calculate the new</b> months, upon which the date of the Festival depends. Therefore, when the verse states: <b>“The morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:16), it means: <b>The morrow after the Festival,</b> as the determination of Festivals is by the court. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the interpretation that the counting starts after the <b>Shabbat of Creation,</b> i.e., a regular weekly Shabbat, <b>whose counting</b> can be performed <b>by every person,</b> not exclusively by the court.
Citing a different proof, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The <b>Torah said</b> to <b>count days,</b> as it is stated: “A month of days” (Numbers 11:20), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> the <b>month</b> with offerings. And the Torah also said to <b>count days</b> from Passover <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify the festival of <i>Shavuot</i></b> with offerings, as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (Leviticus 23:16). From this comparison, one can learn that <b>just as</b> the start of the counting toward the new <b>month is known</b> even <b>before it comes,</b> as one begins counting toward the following new month on the first day of a month, <b>so too</b> the start of the counting toward <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> is known</b> even <b>before it comes,</b> as one begins counting toward <i>Shavuot</i> on a fixed day of the month.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>And if you say</b> that the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i> always</b> occurs the <b>day after Shabbat, how</b> is the counting toward Shavuot <b>known</b> based on <b>what came before it?</b> If the occurrence of <i>Shavuot</i> depends upon a Shabbat, there would be no specific date after Passover upon which the counting occurs yearly.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> there is another refutation of the Boethusian interpretation. <b>The Torah said: Bring</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering on the festival <b>on Passover and the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i>. Just as there,</b> with regard to the offering on the <b>festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, the two loaves are brought at <b>the beginning of the Festival,</b> as it lasts only one day, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <b>festival</b> of Passover, the <i>omer</i> must be brought at <b>the beginning of the Festival.</b> If the <i>omer</i> were to always be brought on a Sunday, this might occur at the end of the festival of Passover. For example, if Passover started on a Monday, the <i>omer</i> would be brought only on the next Sunday, at the end of the Festival.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says</b> there is yet another refutation. It is <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” above</b> (Leviticus 23:15), with regard to starting the counting of the <i>omer</i>, <b>and</b> it is also <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” below</b> (Leviticus 23:16), with regard to the commencement of the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Just as</b> there, with regard to the <b>festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, it is stated: “Even until the morrow after the seventh week [<i>hashabbat</i>] you shall number fifty days,” <b>and</b> the word <i>shabbat</i> is referring to the <b>beginning of the Festival</b> and it immediately <b>follows</b> the end of the seventh week; <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the bringing of the <i>omer</i>, the word <i>shabbat</i> means <b>Festival,</b> so that the <i>omer</i> offering immediately <b>follows the beginning of the Festival,</b> on the second day of Passover. According to the Boethusians, the commencement of the counting could start well after the beginning of Passover. For example, if Passover occurs on a Sunday, the counting of the <i>omer</i> would start only the following Sunday.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>], from the day that you brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks there shall be complete” (Leviticus 23:15). The phrase: <b>“And you shall count for you,”</b> teaches <b>that</b> the mitzva of counting is not a communal obligation. Rather, <b>there should be a counting by each and every</b> person.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>],</b> this means <b>from the morrow after the festival</b> of Passover. <b>Or</b> perhaps this is <b>not</b> the meaning of the verse, but <b>rather</b> it means <b>after the Shabbat of Creation,</b> i.e., Sunday. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says:</b> This cannot be correct, <b>as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Even until the morrow after the seventh week <b>you shall number fifty days”</b> (Leviticus 23:16). This teaches that <b>all the countings that you count shall be only fifty days.</b>
Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda elaborates: <b>And if you say</b> that the clause: <b>“From the morrow after</b> the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>],” is referring to the <b>Shabbat of Creation, sometimes you will find</b> a count of <b>fifty-one</b> days from the first day of Passover, which is the date that the count began the previous year, until <i>Shavuot</i>; <b>and sometimes you will find fifty-two,</b> or <b>fifty-three,</b> or <b>fifty-four,</b> or <b>fifty-five,</b> or <b>fifty-six.</b> For example, in one year, Passover occurs on Shabbat, and the counting of the <i>omer</i> would start on Sunday, the sixteenth of Nisan, and <i>Shavuot</i> would occur fifty days later. Another year, Passover occurs on a Friday, and the counting starts on Sunday, then the date that <i>Shavuot</i> will occur this year is fifty-one days from the sixteenth of Nisan. If Passover occurs on a Thursday, and the counting begins on the following Sunday, <i>Shavuot</i> will occur fifty-two days from the sixteenth of Nisan.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> That proof <b>is not necessary,</b>

Daf 66a

<b>as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Seven weeks <b>you shall number for you;</b> from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). By using the term “for you,” the verse indicates that the <b>counting</b> of the weeks <b>is dependent upon</b> the decision of the <b>court,</b> as they know how to calculate the new months. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the possibility that the counting starts after the <b>Shabbat of Creation, whose counting</b> can be performed <b>by every person,</b> not only the court.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the verse: “And you shall count for you <b>from the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:15), means <b>from the morrow after the festival</b> of Passover. <b>Do you say</b> it means <b>from the morrow after the festival</b> of Passover, <b>or is it only</b> referring to <b>from the morrow after Shabbat of Creation,</b> i.e., Sunday? <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> in response: <b>Is it stated: From the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>] that is during Passover? No, it is stated only: “From the morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>].”</b> Considering <b>that the entire year is full of <i>Shabbatot</i>, go and</b> try to <b>examine</b> to <b>which Shabbat</b> the verse is referring. How does one know which Shabbat this means? Clearly, then, this “day of rest” is the Festival, not Shabbat.
Rabbi Yosei cites another proof: <b>And furthermore,</b> it is <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” below,</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and</b> it is also <b>stated “<i>shabbat</i>” above</b> (Leviticus 23:15), with regard to starting the counting of the <i>omer</i>. <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the <b>festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, it is stated: “Even until the morrow after the seventh week [<i>shabbat</i>] you shall number fifty days,” <b>and</b> the word <i>shabbat</i> is referring to a time at the <b>beginning of the Festival; so too here,</b> with regard to the bringing of <i>omer</i>, the word <i>shabbat</i> means <b>Festival,</b> and the counting starts <b>near the beginning of the Festival,</b> on the second day of Passover. According to the Boethusians, sometimes the commencement of the counting is well after the start of Passover.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> there is yet another proof: <b>One verse states: “Six days you shall eat unleavened bread”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8), <b>and one verse states: “Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread”</b> (Exodus 12:15). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar explains that there is <b><i>matza</i> that you are unable to eat for</b> all <b>seven</b> days of Passover, due to the prohibition of harvesting and eating <b>from the new</b> crop of grain that ripened before Passover until after the <i>omer</i> offering. But <b>you are able to eat</b> that same <i>matza</i> <b>for six</b> days, although it is <b>from the new</b> crop, as it is permitted after the bringing of the <i>omer</i> offering on the second day of Passover. This resolution of the verses is possible only if the <i>omer</i> offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan, not on any other date.
Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar clarifies another two verses that deal with the counting of the <i>omer</i>: “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest, <b>from the day that you brought</b> the sheaf [<i>omer</i>] of the waving; seven weeks there shall be complete; even until the morrow after the seventh week <b>you shall number</b> fifty days; and you shall present a new meal offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:15–16). One <b>might</b> have thought that although one must <b>harvest and bring</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering on the second day of Passover, the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>he</b> may start to <b>count</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>from whenever he wishes</b> after that day.
Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Seven weeks you shall number for you; <b>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number</b> seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). This verse indicates that the counting should commence upon the reaping of the grain for the <i>omer</i> offering. <b>If</b> one would read just this verse: <b>“From the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that one can <b>harvest and count and</b> then <b>bring</b> the <i>omer</i> offering <b>whenever he wishes.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> other <b>verse states: “From the day that you brought</b> the sheaf of the waving…you shall number fifty days,” indicating that the counting should start on the day the <i>omer</i> offering is brought.
<b>If</b> one would derive the <i>halakha</i> from this verse: <b>“From the day that you brought</b> the sheaf of the waving,” one <b>might</b> have thought that he should <b>harvest and count and bring</b> the <i>omer</i> offering <b>during the day,</b> not on the night of the sixteenth of Nisan. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “From the day that you brought the sheaf of the waving; <b>seven weeks there shall be complete.” When do you find</b> that there are <b>seven complete weeks?</b> You find it <b>at the time when you begin to count from the evening.</b> Only if the counting commences at night, at the start of the sixteenth of Nisan, will the seven weeks of counting be complete, without missing that first evening.
If so, one <b>might</b> have thought that all of the rites of the <i>omer</i> should be at night, and therefore one should <b>harvest and bring</b> the <i>omer</i> offering <b>and</b> start to <b>count at night.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: From the day that you brought</b> the sheaf of the waving. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? Does one start at night or in the day? <b>Harvesting and counting</b> should be performed <b>at night, and</b> the <b>bringing</b> of the <i>omer</i> offering is <b>during the day.</b>
§ The Gemara has presented two <i>baraitot</i> with ten proofs between them countering the Boethusian claim that the counting of the <i>omer</i> begins on the Sunday after Passover. <b>Rava said: For all</b> of the suggested proofs <b>there is</b> a possible <b>refutation except for</b> those of the <b>two last <i>tanna’im</i></b> cited, <b>both in the first <i>baraita</i> and in the second <i>baraita</i>, for which there is no refutation.</b>
Rava elaborates: <b>If</b> one seeks to prove <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> said, that there is a contradiction between two verses, as one indicates that there is an obligation to count fifty days and another that the obligation is to count seven weeks, <b>perhaps</b> this contradiction can be resolved <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Abaye. As Abaye said:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to count days, and</b> it is also <b>a mitzva to count</b> seven <b>weeks.</b> When one counts, he should track both the number of days and the number of weeks.
Rabbi Eliezer derived that the counting is dependent upon the court, not the individual. Therefore, he claimed that when the verse mentions <i>shabbat</i> it must be referring to the Festival, not a regular Shabbat, which does not require a court for its determination. Rabbi Yehoshua derived that just as the counting and sanctifying of the New Moon is performed at a distinct time, so too the counting of the <i>omer</i> and start of <i>Shavuot</i> that follows must occur on a specific date. Rava refutes both of these claims: <b>If</b> the proof is <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> said, granted that their proofs successfully demonstrate that the counting should start after the Festival, not after Shabbat, but <b>from where</b> does one know that it <b>is referring to the first day of the Festival? Perhaps</b> it <b>is referring to the last day of the Festival,</b> i.e., the seventh day of Passover?
Rava now addresses the statements of the final two the <i>tanna’im</i> cited in the first <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the proof given <b>by Rabbi Yishmael</b> from the two loaves that are brought at the beginning of a Festival, <b>and</b> the proof mentioned by <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> from the usage of the word <i>shabbat</i> in connection with <i>Shavuot</i>, Rava said: <b>They have no refutation.</b>
Continuing with the proofs of the <i>tanna’im</i> from the second <i>baraita</i>, Rava said: <b>If</b> one seeks to disprove the Boethusian claim <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> said, that if the counting starts from Shabbat then <i>Shavuot</i> can occur anywhere from fifty to fifty-six days from the date the counting had started the previous year, <b>I would say</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the verse means <b>fifty</b> days <b>excluding these six</b> extra days.
Rava continues: <b>If</b> one seeks to prove <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> said in the second <i>baraita</i>, that the verse indicates that the counting is dependent upon the decision of the court, not an individual, this can too be refuted: <b>From where</b> does one know that it <b>is referring to the first day of the Festival? Perhaps</b> it <b>is referring to the last day of the Festival,</b> the seventh day of Passover?
Rava concludes: The first proof cited by <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> was that if the counting starts the day after a regular Shabbat then it would be impossible to determine which Shabbat is meant. Rabbi Yosei himself <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> is <b>also</b> subject to <b>refutation, and this is</b> why Rabbi Yosei continued and <b>said: Furthermore,</b> and suggested a second proof. As Rava declared, the last two proofs cited in the second <i>baraita</i>, the second proof provided by Rabbi Yosei and the proof of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, stand without refutation.
§ The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> of Abaye’s statement cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to count days, and</b> it is also <b>a mitzva to count weeks.</b> The Gemara notes that in fact <b>the Sages of the study hall of Rav Ashi counted days and they</b> also <b>counted weeks. Ameimar counted days but not weeks.</b> In explanation of his practice, Ameimar <b>said:</b> Since there is no longer an <i>omer</i> offering, the counting <b>is</b> performed only in <b>commemoration of the Temple.</b> Therefore, one does not need to be so scrupulous to count both days and weeks.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After <b>they harvested</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>and placed it in</b> the <b>baskets, they brought it to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. And they would singe in</b> the <b>fire</b> the kernels of barley while they were still on the stalks, <b>in order to fulfill the mitzva of parched</b> grain, as it is written: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire” (Leviticus 2:14). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Prior to parching the kernels, they would remove them from the stalks by <b>beating</b> them <b>with</b> soft, moist <b>reeds and with cabbage stalks,</b> not with sticks, <b>so that</b> the kernels <b>would not be crushed.</b>
<b>They</b> then <b>placed</b> the grain <b>into a hollow vessel [<i>le’abuv</i>], and</b> this <b>vessel was perforated so that the fire would take hold of</b> the grain <b>in its entirety.</b> After parching the kernels, <b>they</b> would <b>spread</b> the kernels <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard and the wind would blow upon</b> the kernels, cooling and drying them. <b>They</b> then <b>placed</b> the kernels <b>in a mill</b> used <b>to</b> grind <b>grits,</b> so that the barley would not be ground so fine that the shell would be mixed with the grain. <b>And they produced from</b> the ground barley <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of barley flour <b>that was sifted through thirteen sifters, and the rest is redeemed and</b> may be <b>eaten by any person. And</b> dough from this barley flour <b>is obligated in</b> the separation of <b><i>ḥalla</i>, and</b> the grain is <b>exempt from the</b> separation of <b>tithe. Rabbi Akiva deems</b> this flour <b>obligated in</b> having <b><i>ḥalla</i> and tithes</b> separated from it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna cited a disagreement between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis as to whether the barley kernels were first singed while they were in their stalks or only after they were beaten and removed from their stalks, when they were placed in a hollow vessel. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). <b>“Grain in the ear”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>grain,</b> i.e., the barley kernel. <b>“Parched [<i>kalui</i>] with fire”;</b> this <b>teaches that the Jewish people would singe it in fire, in order to fulfill the mitzva of</b> bringing <b>parched</b> grain. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b>

Daf 66b

<b>Fire is not</b> the proper interpretation of the <b>term <i>kali</i></b> in the verse. <b>Rather,</b> <i>kali</i> means <b>something else,</b> i.e., the barley was parched inside a receptacle and not directly in the fire. <b>How so? The term <i>kali</i> means only</b> that <b>something else,</b> a vessel made from <b>burnished [<i>kalil</i>]</b> brass was used in the process of parching the grains. <b>How so,</b> i.e., how was this performed? There <b>was a hollow vessel there,</b> in the Temple, which was used <b>for</b> making <b>parched</b> grains. <b>And it was perforated</b> with holes <b>like a sieve, in order to</b> allow <b>the fire to take hold of</b> it <b>in its entirety.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> analyzes the verse: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the <b>ear parched with fire,</b> even <b>groats</b> of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). This indicates that the grain used for the <i>omer</i> offering must be parched with fire, but is unclear if that clause modifies the earlier or later part of the verse. In other words, <b>I do not know if</b> grain in the <b>ear</b> is to be parched before it is ground, or <b>if</b> the ground <b>groats</b> are to be <b>parched.</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: With fire, it interrupted the</b> previous <b>matter</b> and is now introducing a new clause. Accordingly, the instructions to parch with fire is referring to the grain still in the stalks, not the ground groats.
The verse states that the <i>omer</i> offering should be of the <b>fresh ear [<i>karmel</i>].</b> The <i>baraita</i> defines <i>karmel</i> as <b>soft and malleable [<i>rakh umal</i>]. And likewise</b> there are other examples of terms that are interpreted as shortened terms, <b>as</b> the verse <b>states: “And there came a man from Baal Shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain [<i>karmel</i>] in his sack [<i>betziklono</i>]. And he said: Give to the people, that they may eat”</b> (II Kings 4:42). This verse mentions the word <i>karmel</i> in connection with the word <i>betziklono</i>, which is interpreted as an abbreviation for: <b>He came [<i>ba</i>] and he poured for us [<i>veyatzak lanu</i>], and we ate [<i>ve’akhalnu</i>] and it was fine [<i>venaveh haya</i>].</b>
The <i>baraita</i> presents further examples of words that are interpreted as shortened terms of an expanded phrase. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; <b>let us solace ourselves [<i>nitalesa</i>] with love”</b> (Proverbs 7:18). The word <i>nitalesa</i> is short for: <b>We shall converse [<i>nissa veniten</i>] and we shall go up [<i>vena’aleh</i>]</b> to bed <b>and we shall rejoice [<i>venismaḥ</i>] and be pampered [<i>venitḥata</i>] with loves.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> provides an example of a similar shortened word: <b>“The wing of the ostrich beats joyously [<i>ne’elasa</i>]”</b> (Job 39:13). The word <i>ne’elasa</i> is a combination of the words: <b>Carries [<i>noseh</i>], goes up [<i>oleh</i>], and places down [<i>venitḥata</i>].</b> This bird carries its egg, flies upward, and places it in its nest.
Likewise, the verse states, after Balaam struck his donkey: “And the angel of the Lord said to him: Why did you hit your donkey these three times? Behold I have come out as an adversary <b>because your way is contrary [<i>yarat</i>] against me”</b> (Numbers 22:32). <i>Yarat</i> is also a shortened term: The donkey <b>feared [<i>yirata</i>], it saw [<i>ra’ata</i>],</b> and <b>it turned aside [<i>nateta</i>].</b>
The Gemara returns to discuss the word <i>karmel</i>. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that <b><i>karmel</i></b> means: <b>A full kernel [<i>kar maleh</i>],</b> i.e., that the shell of the kernel should be filled with the ripened kernel inside.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> this flour <b>obligated in</b> having <b><i>ḥalla</i> and the tithes</b> separated from it. <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva would say:</b> The <b>smoothing</b> of a pile of <b>consecrated</b> grains does <b>not exempt</b> it from the obligation to separate tithes if it is later redeemed for common use. This is despite the <i>halakha</i> that the smoothing of the pile is what causes the obligation of separating tithes to take effect.
<b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What would they do with</b> the <b>leftover</b> of <b>these three <i>se’a</i></b> of barley, i.e., the portion not used for the tenth of an ephah of flour for the <i>omer</i> offering? It <b>is redeemed and eaten by any person, and</b> it is <b>obligated in</b> the separation of <b><i>ḥalla</i> and exempt</b> from the separation of <b>tithes. Rabbi Akiva deems</b> this flour <b>obligated in</b> having <b><i>ḥalla</i> and the tithes</b> separated from it. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: The <i>halakha</i> of one who <b>redeems</b> produce <b>from the possession of</b> the Temple <b>treasurer [<i>gizbar</i>] proves</b> otherwise, <b>as</b> he is <b>obligated</b> in the separation of <b><i>ḥalla</i> but exempt from</b> the separation of <b>tithes.</b>
Rav Sheshet explains his objection: <b>And if it is so that</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that <b>smoothing</b> a pile of <b>consecrated</b> grains does <b>not exempt</b> it from tithes, <b>what</b> is the significance of that which the Rabbis <b>said to him?</b> Rabbi Akiva would simply disagree with their premise, as <b>it is</b> the same ruling <b>itself:</b> Just as a pile of consecrated grains that was smoothed is not exempt from tithes, so too, Rabbi Akiva would maintain that produce redeemed from the Temple treasury is not exempt from tithes.
<b>And furthermore, Rav Kahana bar Taḥlifa raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> <b>to Rav Kahana bar Matitya,</b> who reported that Rabbi Akiva holds that consecrated grain is not exempt from the obligation to separate tithes. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Rabbi Akiva obligates</b> one <b>in</b> the separation of <b><i>ḥalla</i> and in</b> the separation of <b>tithes, as</b> the Temple <b>money</b> designated for the <i>omer</i> crop <b>was given only</b> to cover the cost <b>of that</b> which <b>they required</b> for the offering. Only the requisite tenth of an ephah out of the entire three <i>se’a</i> was paid from the Temple treasury, and was therefore its property. This indicates that had the entire crop been purchased by the Temple, it would be exempt from the obligation to separate tithes.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is a settled,</b> accepted <b>tradition in the mouth of Rabbi Akiva that</b> the Temple <b>money</b> designated for the <i>omer</i> crop <b>was given only</b> to cover the cost <b>of that</b> which <b>they required</b> for the offering. In other words, Rav Kahana’s version of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, that in all cases the smoothing of a pile of consecrated grains does not exempt it from tithes, is rejected.
<b>Rava</b> likewise <b>said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me that</b> the <b>smoothing</b> of a pile of <b>consecrated</b> grain <b>exempts</b> one from any subsequent obligation to separate tithes. <b>And even Rabbi Akiva,</b> who requires the separation of tithes from the remainder of the grain not used for the <i>omer</i> offering, <b>obligates</b> one to separate <b>tithes only there, where</b> the <b>money was given only</b> to pay for <b>that</b> which <b>they required</b> for the offering. <b>But</b> he concedes that the <b>smoothing</b> of a pile of <b>consecrated</b> grain <b>generally exempts</b> one from the obligation to separate tithes.
Rava continues: The status of a pile of grain after <b>smoothing</b> performed by <b>a gentile</b> owner <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce <b>of a Jew to</b> exempt other produce <b>of a Jew,</b> and <b>from</b> produce bought <b>from gentiles to</b> exempt other produce bought <b>from gentiles, and from</b> produce bought <b>from Samaritans to</b> exempt other produce bought <b>from Samaritans.</b> Furthermore, one may separate <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> the produce <b>of any</b> of the above <b>to</b> exempt the produce <b>of any</b> of the above. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as they maintain that produce that belonged to gentiles or Samaritans is obligated in tithes and has the same status as produce that initially belonged to a Jew.
<b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: One separates <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce <b>of a Jew to</b> exempt other produce <b>of a Jew, and from</b> produce bought from <b>gentiles to</b> exempt produce bought <b>from Samaritans, and from</b> produce bought <b>from Samaritans to</b> exempt produce bought <b>from gentiles. But</b> one may <b>not</b> separate <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce <b>of a Jew to</b> exempt produce bought <b>from gentiles or from Samaritans, nor from</b> produce bought <b>from gentiles or from Samaritans to</b> exempt produce <b>of a Jew.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yishmael, produce that belonged to a gentile or a Samaritan is exempt from the obligation to separate tithes. Therefore one may not separate tithes from produce of a Jew, to which the obligation of tithes applies, to exempt such produce.

Daf 67a

Rava adds: The <b>kneading</b> of <b>consecrated</b> dough <b>exempts</b> it from the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 3:3): If a woman <b>consecrated her dough before she kneaded</b> it <b>and she</b> subsequently <b>redeemed it, she is obligated</b> to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. Likewise, if <b>she</b> consecrated it <b>after she kneaded</b> it <b>and</b> then <b>she redeemed it, she is obligated</b> to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. But if <b>she consecrated</b> the dough <b>before she kneaded</b> it <b>and</b> the Temple <b>treasurer</b> kneaded <b>it and</b> then <b>she subsequently redeemed it, she is exempt.</b> The reason is that <b>at the time</b> that <b>its obligation</b> in <i>ḥalla</i> would have taken effect, i.e., at the time of its kneading, <b>it was exempt,</b> because it was Temple property.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If dough was <b>kneaded</b> while in the possession of <b>a gentile, what</b> is its status? Is one who acquires it after it has been kneaded obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from it or not? The Gemara answers that this <b>is taught</b> explicitly, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 3:6): With regard to <b>a convert who converted and had dough</b> in <b>his</b> possession, if it was <b>prepared before he converted,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i>. If it was prepared <b>after he converted,</b> he is <b>obligated.</b> If he is <b>uncertain,</b> he is <b>obligated.</b>
The Gemara asks: Of the Sages who disagreed with regard to the obligation to tithe grain that is smoothed by a gentile, <b>who taught this</b> mishna with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>? Perhaps <b>it</b> is a ruling upon which <b>everyone agrees, and even Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, who obligate there,</b> in the case of tithes, <b>exempt here</b> in the case of <i>ḥalla</i>.
The Gemara explains this possibility. There are three verses written with regard to <i>teruma</i> that contain the term “your grain.” They are: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17); “And you shall eat before the Lord your God…the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17); and “The first fruits of your grain…you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4). It can therefore be claimed that only <b>there</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda hold that one is obligated to separate tithes from grain that was owned by a gentile, <b>as</b> in addition to the first reference to “your grain,” which excludes grain that was smoothed while in the Temple’s possession, <b>it is written an additional “your grain,”</b> and then another reference to <b>“your grain.”</b>
The Gemara elaborates: This <b>is</b> an example of <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression. And</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression comes only to include</b> additional cases. In this case, the verses teach that <b>even</b> grain that belonged to <b>gentiles</b> is obligated in the separation of tithes.
<b>But here,</b> with regard to the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>, the term <b>“your dough” is written</b> only <b>twice:</b> “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift; as that which is set apart of the threshing floor, so shall you set it apart. Of the first of your dough you shall give to the Lord a portion for a gift throughout your generations” (Numbers 15:20–21). <b>One</b> reference to <b>“your dough”</b> teaches that one is obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> only from an amount <b>equal to your dough</b> in the wilderness, where the mitzva was commanded, i.e., the volume of one <i>omer</i>. <b>And one</b> reference to <b>“your dough”</b> teaches that only the dough of an ordinary Jew is obligated <b>but not the dough of gentiles nor the dough of consecrated</b> property.
The Gemara continues: <b>Or perhaps</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon</b> who <b>taught</b> that mishna, <b>as they</b> maintain that grain that was smoothed by a gentile owner is exempt from the obligation to separate tithes, and likewise dough kneaded by a gentile owner is likewise <b>exempt</b> from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>But Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda derive</b> by way of verbal analogy the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>, concerning which it is written: “Of <b>the first</b> of your dough,” <b>from</b> the same expression that appears <b>there,</b> with regard to tithes: <b>“The first</b> fruits of your grain.” Just as in the case of tithes they hold that one is obligated to separate the tithes from a pile of grain that was smoothed by a gentile owner, so too they hold that one is obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from dough that was kneaded by a gentile owner.
<b>Rava said: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that I see</b> the answer to my question <b>in a dream. Rava then said: The one who says</b> that the <b>smoothing of</b> a grain pile by its <b>gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> a future Jewish owner from the obligation to separate tithes also maintains that the <b>kneading of</b> dough by its <b>gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> a future Jewish owner from any obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. So too <b>the one who says</b> that the <b>smoothing of</b> a grain pile by a <b>gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt</b> a future Jewish owner from the obligation to separate tithes also maintains that the <b>kneading</b> of dough by a <b>gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt</b> a future Jewish owner from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>.
<b>Rav Pappa raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 4:13): With regard to <b>a gentile who separated</b> a lamb in order to redeem <b>a firstborn donkey, or</b> if he separated <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from dough that he kneaded, <b>one informs him that he is exempt</b> from these obligations <b>and his <i>ḥalla</i></b> may be <b>eaten by non-priests and</b> the lamb designated to redeem his <b>firstborn donkey</b> may be <b>sheared and worked.</b>
One can infer: <b>But</b> if a gentile separated <i>teruma</i>, the portion of the produce designated for the priest, from a grain pile that he smoothed, <b>his <i>teruma</i></b> is <b>prohibited</b> to a non-priest. <b>And this</b> is an example of <b>a <i>tanna</i> who says:</b> The <b>smoothing</b> of a grain pile <b>by a gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt it</b> from tithes, as the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to tithes as to <i>teruma</i>, <b>and</b> yet he maintains that the <b>kneading</b> of dough by <b>a gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> it from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. This refutes Rava’s conclusion that one who holds that there is an exemption in the case of tithes likewise holds that an exemption applies to <i>ḥalla</i>.
<b>And Ravina further raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b><i>ḥalla</i> of a gentile</b> that he separated after kneading his dough <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>or his <i>teruma</i></b> that he separated after smoothing his pile of grain <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, in both cases <b>one informs him that he is exempt</b> from those obligations and <b>his <i>ḥalla</i></b> may be <b>eaten by non-priests and his <i>teruma</i> does not render a mixture</b> prohibited if it becomes mixed with non-sacred produce. One can infer: <b>But his <i>teruma</i></b> from his grain <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>prohibited</b> to non-priests <b>and renders a mixture</b> prohibited if it becomes mixed with non-sacred produce.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And</b> again <b>this</b> is an example of <b>a <i>tanna</i> who says:</b> The <b>smoothing</b> of a grain pile <b>by a gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt it</b> from tithes, and nevertheless he maintains that the <b>kneading</b> of dough <b>by a gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> it from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>.
The Gemara answers: This ruling that the smoothing of a grain pile by its gentile owner does not exempt it from the obligations of <i>teruma</i> and tithes applies only <b>by rabbinic law.</b> By Torah law, the smoothing of a grain pile by its gentile owner does exempt it from the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes. The Sages enacted <b>a decree due to</b> the schemes of <b>people of means.</b> There was a fear that conniving merchants might temporarily transfer ownership of their produce to gentiles while the piles were smoothed, after which the gentiles would return them to their possession, thereby circumventing the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes.

Daf 67b

The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> should be subject to the same rabbinic decree <b>as well,</b> to prevent someone from circumventing their obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> by temporarily selling their dough to a gentile who will knead it and return it to them. Why then does the <i>baraita</i> teach that dough kneaded by a gentile owner is exempt? The Gemara answers: There is no need for a decree in this case, since if one wanted to circumvent his obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from his dough, an easier method is available: It is <b>possible</b> for him <b>to bake</b> using <b>less than five-fourths</b> of a <i>kav</i> of <b>flour and</b> a bit <b>more,</b> the minimum amount necessitating the separation of <i>ḥalla</i>.
The Gemara asks: If so, why is there a need for a rabbinic decree with regard to <i>teruma</i> and tithes? The obligation to separate <b><i>teruma</i></b> and tithes can <b>also</b> be easily circumvented <b>by acting</b> in accordance with <b>that which Rabbi Oshaya</b> suggested, <b>as Rabbi Oshaya says: A person can employ artifice</b> to circumvent obligations incumbent upon him in dealing <b>with his grain, and</b> exempt himself by <b>bringing it into</b> his courtyard <b>in its chaff so that his animal may eat</b> from it. <b>And</b> this grain is <b>exempt from</b> <i>teruma</i> and <b>tithes.</b> Although the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> from and to tithe produce that has been fully processed applies even to animal fodder, it is permitted to feed one’s animal untithed produce that has not been fully processed. <b>Alternatively,</b> another option of avoiding the obligation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes is <b>to bring in</b> the produce to his house by <b>way</b> of <b>roofs or</b> by <b>way</b> of <b>enclosures [<i>karpeifot</i>].</b> The obligation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes applies only to produce that passes through the entrance of the house.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of <i>teruma</i> and tithes, the two options of bringing in the grain in its chaff or by way of roofs are performed <b>in public [<i>befarhesya</i>],</b> and <b>it is degrading for one</b> to be seen circumventing his obligation. Consequently, one who wishes to avoid the obligation would prefer the option of transferring ownership to a gentile, which the Sages prevent with their decree. <b>Here,</b> in the case of <i>ḥalla</i>, the option of baking with less than the minimum quantity of flour to avoid being obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from the dough is performed <b>in private,</b> and <b>it is not degrading for him,</b> and he would sooner take advantage of that option than go through the process of transferring the dough to a gentile. Therefore, the Sages did not apply their decree in this case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After daybreak, the priest sacrificing the <i>omer</i> <b>came to the</b> sifted <b>tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>placed in</b> the vessel in his hand some of <b>its</b> <i>log</i> of <b>oil, and</b> placed <b>its frankincense</b> on the side of the vessel. He then <b>poured</b> some more oil from the <i>log</i> onto the high-quality flour <b>and mixed</b> them together, <b>waved and brought</b> the meal offering to the corner of the altar, and <b>removed the handful and burned</b> it on the altar. <b>And the rest</b> of the meal offering <b>is eaten by the priests.</b>
<b>Once the <i>omer</i> was sacrificed</b> people would <b>emerge and find the marketplace of Jerusalem full of the flour</b> from the <b>parched grain</b> of the new crop that was permitted by the waving and the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering. That filling of the marketplace with the new crop was performed <b>not with the approval of the Sages;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: They would do</b> so <b>with the approval of the Sages.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the marketplaces of Jerusalem would be filled with flour of parched grain even before the sacrificing of the <i>omer</i> offering, and Rabbi Yehuda holds that the Sages approved of this practice. The Gemara asks: <b>And doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda</b> agree that the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> against filling of the marketplaces with grain that is prohibited in consumption at the time? Wasn’t he concerned that <b>perhaps someone</b> might <b>come to eat from it?</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 10b): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>one searches</b> for leaven <b>on the evening of the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>and on the fourteenth</b> in <b>the morning, and at the time of</b> the <b>eradication</b> of leaven. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> That is not the <i>halakha</i>; rather, if <b>one did not search</b> on the evening of the fourteenth he should search on the fourteenth during the day, and if he did not search on the fourteenth, he should search during the festival of Passover. Since Rabbi Yehuda does not allow a search on Passover itself, he is evidently concerned that one who finds prohibited food might come to eat it. The same reasoning should apply in the case of the new crop.
<b>Rabba says</b> that the prohibition of <b>new</b> grain <b>is different,</b> for the following reason:

Daf 68a

<b>Since</b> before the <i>omer</i> <b>you permitted one</b> to harvest the crop <b>only by picking</b> it by hand and not in the typical manner, <b>he will remember</b> the prohibition and refrain from eating it. With regard to searching for leaven, there is no reminder.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> This <b>works out well</b> in explaining Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to <b>picking</b> the grain. But with regard to <b>grinding and sifting, what can be said?</b> Apparently, it is permitted to perform these acts in a typical manner. Why, then, is there no concern that one may eat the grain at that stage?
The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one also performs <b>grinding</b> in an atypical manner. One must grind the grain before the sacrificing of the <i>omer</i> <b>with a hand mill,</b> not with a mill powered by an animal or by water. Likewise, <b>sifting</b> is performed unusually, not in the interior of the sifter. Instead, it is performed <b>on top of</b> the <b>sifter.</b> Since all of these actions are performed in an atypical manner, there is no concern that one might eat the grain.
The Gemara raises another difficulty from the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, where</b> typical <b>harvesting is permitted, as we learned</b> in a mishna (71a): <b>One may harvest</b> grain from <b>an irrigated field and</b> from fields <b>in the valleys,</b> as their grain ripens long before the <i>omer</i> is sacrificed, <b>but one</b> may <b>not pile</b> the produce. The use of the term: One may harvest, indicates that the grain was harvested in a typical manner, not by hand. In this case, <b>what can be said?</b> Why doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda issue a decree lest someone eat from the new grain?
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> This difference between the cases of the <i>omer</i> and leaven is not based on the manner in which one harvests, grinds, or sifts. Instead, the reason for the different rulings is that one <b>distances himself from new</b> grain, as it is prohibited to eat the new grain all year until the <i>omer</i> is sacrificed. By contrast, one <b>does not distance himself from leavened bread,</b> as eating it is permitted during the rest of the year. Therefore, he is more likely to eat leavened bread unwittingly.
<b>Rava said:</b> Does the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> pose <b>a difficulty,</b> while the contradiction between one statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> and the other statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> does <b>not</b> pose <b>a difficult?</b> There is also an apparent contradiction between the opinion of the Rabbis, who claim that the Sages issued a decree with regard to new grain but did not issue a decree with regard to leaven.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> is <b>not difficult, as we resolved</b> it previously. The contradiction between one ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> and the other ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> is <b>also not difficult:</b> The Rabbis maintain that there is no need to issue a decree prohibiting searching for leaven after it becomes prohibited, as with regard to one who <b>himself is seeking out</b> leaven specifically in order <b>to burn it,</b> will <b>he eat from it?</b> By contrast, in the case of new grain he is processing the grain and preparing it for consumption. Consequently, there is a concern that he might eat it unwittingly.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as the difficulty can be resolved in another manner. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna that the markets of Jerusalem were filled with <b>flour of parched grain.</b> It is permitted to prepare only such foods before the <i>omer</i>, as they are not eaten without further preparation. Therefore, there is no concern lest one eat it unwittingly before the <i>omer</i> offering is sacrificed.
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rav Ashi is an error [<i>baruta</i>],</b> as this suggestion can easily be refuted: That <b>works out well</b> with regard to the status of the grain <b>from</b> the point that it was processed into <b>flour of parched grain and forward,</b> as there is no concern that perhaps one will come to eat it. But with regard to its status initially, <b>until</b> it became <b>parched grain, what can be said?</b> There must have been a certain point when the grain kernels were edible before they were transformed into parched grain. Why is there no concern that one might eat the kernels at this earlier stage?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too</b> the grain is distinguished by the atypical manner in which it is harvested, <b>through picking</b> by hand, <b>in accordance with</b> the earlier statement <b>of Rabba,</b> nevertheless with regard to the difficulty raised to Rabba’s opinion from the case of <b>an irrigated field, which is permitted</b> to be <b>harvested</b> in the typical manner, <b>what can be said? Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this explanation and concludes that <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rav Ashi is an error.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From</b> the moment <b>that the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>was sacrificed,</b> the produce of the <b>new</b> crop <b>was permitted immediately.</b> For those <b>distant</b> from Jerusalem, the new crop <b>is permitted from midday and beyond. From</b> the time <b>that the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i>, the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>is entirely prohibited,</b> i.e., one may partake of the new crop only the next day.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: But isn’t it forbidden by Torah law, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh grain, <b>until this selfsame day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14)? This means that the new crop is prohibited on the day of the waving unless permitted by sacrifice of the offering. <b>And</b> if so, <b>for what</b> reason is it <b>permitted</b> for those <b>distant</b> to eat the new crop <b>from midday and beyond,</b> when the Temple is standing? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they know that the</b> members of the <b>court are not indolent in its</b> sacrifice, and certainly by midday the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering has been completed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, as presented in the mishna, is that after the destruction of the Temple the new crop is prohibited throughout the entire sixteenth of Nisan by Torah law. With regard to the dissenting opinion that the new crop is permitted on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>Rav and Shmuel both say: When the Temple is standing,</b> the sacrifice of the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>permits</b> the new crop. <b>When the Temple is not standing, the illumination of the eastern</b> horizon on the sixteenth of Nisan <b>permits</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Two verses are written</b> with regard to the new crop. More precisely, there are two clauses in the same verse: “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh grain, until this selfsame day, until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14). <b>It is written</b> that the new crop is prohibited <b>“until you have brought</b> the offering,” <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> that the new crop is prohibited only <b>“until the selfsame day.” How so?</b> How can these clauses be reconciled?
The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> when the verse permits the new crop only after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering, it is referring to the period <b>when the Temple is standing. There,</b> when the verse permits the new crop immediately upon the sixteenth of Nisan, it is speaking of the period <b>when the Temple is not standing.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say: Even when the Temple is standing, the illumination of the eastern</b> horizon <b>permits</b> the new crop. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Until you have brought</b> the offering,” which indicates that the new crop is not permitted at daybreak, but only after the <i>omer</i> offering is sacrificed? The Gemara answers: The verse means that one should wait to partake of the new crop until after the <i>omer</i> offering is brought <i>ab initio</i>, in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, but nevertheless it is permitted at daybreak.
The Gemara raises another difficulty. The mishna states: <b>From</b> the moment <b>that the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>was sacrificed,</b> the produce of the <b>new</b> crop <b>was permitted immediately.</b> This indicates that the new crop is not permitted at the illumination of the eastern horizon. The Gemara again answers that the mishna means that one should wait to partake of the new crop until after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, but it is permitted at daybreak.
The Gemara raises yet another difficulty from the next mishna (68b): Sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>would permit</b> consumption of the new crop <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country [<i>bamedina</i>]</b> outside the Temple, <b>and the two loaves</b> offering permitted the sacrifice of the new crop <b>in the Temple.</b> Here, too, the Gemara answers: One should wait to partake of the new crop until after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion.

Daf 68b

The Gemara questions the claim that the purpose of waiting until the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> is only in order to fulfill the mitzva in the most optimal fashion. The mishna teaches: <b>From</b> the time <b>that the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> partaking from the new crop on <b>the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i>, the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>is completely prohibited</b> and one may partake of the new crop only the next day. The Gemara analyzes this statement. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>soon the Temple will be rebuilt, and</b> people <b>will say: Last year [<i>eshtakad</i>],</b> when there was no Temple, <b>didn’t we eat</b> of the new crop <b>as soon as the eastern</b> horizon <b>was illuminated,</b> as the new crop was permitted immediately upon the advent of the morning of the sixteenth of Nisan? <b>Now, too, let us eat</b> the new grain at that time.
<b>And they</b> would <b>not know that last year, when there was no Temple, the illuminating of the eastern</b> horizon <b>permitted</b> one to eat the new grain immediately, <b>but now that</b> the Temple has been rebuilt and <b>there is an <i>omer</i></b> offering, it is <b>the <i>omer</i></b> that <b>permits</b> the consumption of the new grain. When the Temple is standing, the new grain is not permitted until the <i>omer</i> offering has been sacrificed. The Gemara concludes its question: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that one waits to partake of the new crop until the <i>omer</i> offering permits the new grain only in order <b>to</b> perform <b>the mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, would <b>we arise and decree</b> that the entire sixteenth of Nisan is entirely prohibited only <b>due to</b> the performance of <b>a mitzva</b> in the optimal manner?
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai stated</b> his ordinance <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>it is prohibited by Torah law</b> to eat of the new grain until the seventeenth of Nisan, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall eat neither bread nor parched grain, nor fresh stalks, <b>until this selfsame [<i>etzem</i>] day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14).
This does not mean that it is permitted to eat the new grain on the morning of the sixteenth, when the eastern horizon is illuminated. Rather, it is prohibited <b>until the essence [<i>itzumo</i>] of the day. And</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that when the verse says <b>“until,”</b> it means <b>until and including,</b> meaning that the grain is permitted only after the conclusion of the sixteenth. If so, by Torah law, eating the new grain is permitted only after the conclusion of the sixteenth, unless the <i>omer</i> offering was sacrificed, in which case it is permitted to eat the new grain immediately afterward.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>But he disagrees with him, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>From</b> the time <b>that the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> partaking from the new crop on <b>the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i>, the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>is entirely prohibited. Rabbi Yehuda says: But isn’t it forbidden by Torah law, as it is written: “Until this selfsame day”?</b> This indicates that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai disagrees with Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara rejects this. <b>It is Rabbi Yehuda who is mistaken. He thought</b> that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai is saying</b> that eating new grain on the sixteenth of Nisan is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law. And</b> that <b>is not so;</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>is</b> actually <b>saying</b> that it is prohibited <b>by Torah law.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But it is taught</b> in the mishna that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>instituted,</b> which indicates that it is a rabbinic ordinance. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Instituted,</b> in this context? It means that <b>he interpreted</b> the verses in the Torah <b>and instituted</b> public notice for the multitudes to conduct themselves accordingly.
§ <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, ate</b> from <b>the new</b> crop <b>on</b> the <b>evening</b> of the conclusion <b>of the sixteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>leading into the seventeenth</b> of Nisan. <b>They held</b> that the prohibition against eating the <b>new</b> crop <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael applies <b>by rabbinic law. And</b> therefore <b>we are not concerned for</b> the <b>uncertainty</b> that perhaps the day we think is the sixteenth of Nisan is really the fifteenth, due to the court proclaiming the previous month of Adar a full thirty days long.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>the Sages of the study hall of Rav Ashi ate</b> from <b>the new</b> crop only <b>on the morning of the seventeenth. They held</b> that the prohibition against eating the <b>new</b> crop <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael applies <b>by Torah law.</b> Consequently, they did entertain the concern that the day they thought was the sixteenth might actually be the fifteenth of Nisan, which would mean that the new crop is permitted only the following morning.
This is problematic, as if there is a concern that the sixteenth is really the fifteenth of Nisan, then the seventeenth would be the sixteenth of Nisan. Accordingly, how could they eat from the new crop on that morning? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai institute that the new crop is prohibited the entire day? The Gemara explains that those Sages of the study hall of Rav Ashi held: <b>And Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai is saying</b> that eating new grain on the sixteenth of Nisan nowadays is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law. And</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> this prohibition only <b>for</b> the actual <b>day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering, whereas it was <b>not instituted for</b> a day with regard to which the real date is <b>uncertain.</b>
<b>Ravina said: My mother told me: Your father would eat from</b> the <b>new</b> crop <b>only on the evening</b> at the conclusion <b>of the seventeenth</b> of Nisan, <b>leading into the eighteenth.</b> The reason for this was that <b>he held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that nowadays it is prohibited to eat of the new crop on the sixteenth of Nisan by Torah law, <b>and</b> he was therefore <b>concerned for</b> the <b>uncertainty</b> that perhaps the sixteenth of Nisan was really the fifteenth, and consequently the seventeenth was really the sixteenth. Therefore he waited until the eve of the eighteenth, when he could be sure that there was no prohibition by Torah law against eating from the new crop.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>would permit</b> consumption of the new crop <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country</b> outside the Temple, <b>and the two loaves</b> offering would permit the sacrifice of the new crop <b>in the Temple. One may not bring meal offerings, or first fruits, or the meal offering</b> brought with libations accompanying <b>animal</b> offerings, from the new crop <b>prior to</b> the sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i>, and if he brought</b> them from the new crop they are <b>unfit.</b> After the <i>omer</i> but <b>prior to the two loaves one may not bring</b> these offerings from the new crop, but <b>if he brought</b> them from the new crop, they are <b>fit.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that meal offerings brought from the new crop prior to the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering are unfit, whereas those brought after the <i>omer</i> but prior to the two loaves are fit. <b>Rabbi Tarfon sat and posed</b> the following <b>difficulty: What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> meal offerings brought <b>before the <i>omer</i></b> and those brought <b>before the two loaves?</b>
Rabbi <b>Yehuda bar Neḥemya said before</b> Rabbi Tarfon: <b>No,</b> one cannot compare the two situations. <b>If you said</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>before</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> sacrifice, this is because at that stage there are <b>no</b> circumstances in which the new crop’s <b>general prohibition was permitted,</b> even <b>with regard to an ordinary</b> person; <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>before</b> the sacrifice of <b>the two loaves, when</b> the new crop’s <b>general prohibition was permitted with regard to an ordinary</b> person? The new crop ingredient in the meal offering is at least permitted in consumption after the <i>omer</i> is brought. Therefore, the meal offerings that were brought after the <i>omer</i> but before the two loaves are fit.
<b>Rabbi Tarfon was silent,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Neḥemya’s face brightened. Rabbi Akiva said to him: Yehuda, has your face brightened because you answered the elder? I will be astonished if the days of your life will be lengthy. Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ilai, said: That period</b> in which that interaction occurred <b>was half</b> a month <b>before Passover. When I ascended</b> again to the study hall <b>for</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>, I asked about him: Where is</b> Rabbi <b>Yehuda ben Neḥemya? And they said to me: He passed away and left</b> this world.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: According to the statement of</b> Rabbi <b>Yehuda ben Neḥemya, libations</b> from <b>first fruits that one brought before the <i>omer</i></b> offering is sacrificed should be <b>valid.</b> The reason is that the prohibition of the new crop does not apply to fruits at all, and therefore they are never prohibited to ordinary people. When the mishna states that first fruits are prohibited it is referring to first fruits of grain, not the fruit of a tree. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that libations from first fruits brought before the <i>omer</i> offering are valid? Why would one think that they should not be valid?
The Gemara answers that Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement is necessary, <b>lest you say: It is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case of the meal offering of grain brought after the <i>omer</i> sacrifice, that it is valid, <b>as</b> the new crop’s <b>general prohibition was permitted with regard to an ordinary</b> person. <b>But here,</b> since with regard to these fruits there are <b>no</b> circumstances in which <b>its general prohibition was permitted,</b> one might say that the libation should <b>not</b> be valid. Therefore, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>teaches us</b> that the opposite is the case: <b>All the more so here</b> it is a valid offering, <b>where</b> the fruit <b>was not prohibited at all.</b>
§ The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing discussions in the Gemara: <b>Order, sprouting, dung of, elephant.</b> The mishna teaches that a meal offering using the new crop may not be brought prior to the <i>omer</i> sacrifice or the two loaves. <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>the two loaves</b> offering on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> to whether <b>they permit</b> the new grain to be used in the Temple, if this sacrifice was performed <b>out of their order?</b> The sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> permits ordinary people to eat from the new grain, whereas the sacrifice of the two loaves permits the new grain to be used in the Temple. What is the <i>halakha</i> if a new crop sprouted after the <i>omer</i> offering was brought but before the two loaves were brought?
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? The Gemara explains: This is referring to a case <b>where they planted</b> the grain <b>in between</b> the time of the sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i> and the</b> time of <b>the two loaves</b> offering. <b>And</b> therefore the sacrifice of <b>two loaves passed by</b> first, <b>and</b> then the time of the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering of the following year. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case? The Gemara explains the two possibilities: Does the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> and two loaves <b>permit</b> the new grain to be used for meal offerings if sacrificed only in <b>their</b> proper <b>order,</b> whereas if sacrificed <b>out of their order</b> the sacrifice <b>does not</b> permit the new crop? <b>Or perhaps</b> they <b>permit</b> the new grain to be used for meal offerings <b>even</b> when sacrificed <b>out of their order.</b>
<b>Rabba said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits</b> to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). <b>The verse is speaking of the <i>omer</i> meal offering. From where,</b> i.e., of which grain, <b>is it brought?</b> It is brought <b>from barley.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that it is brought <b>from barley, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only from wheat?</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that it <b>is stated “in the ear” with regard to</b> the plague of hail in <b>Egypt:</b> “And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom” (Exodus 9:31), <b>and it is stated “in the ear”</b> with regard to the mitzva of the new crop, which is <b>for</b> all <b>generations. Just as</b> the term <b>“in the ear” that is stated with regard to</b> plague of hail in <b>Egypt</b> is referring to <b>barley,</b> as is clear from the next verse: “But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten, for they ripen late” (Exodus 9:32), <b>so too</b> the term <b>“in the ear” that is stated</b> with regard to the new crop <b>for</b> all <b>generations</b> is referring to <b>barley.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> cites another proof that the <i>omer</i> offering is brought from barley. <b>And Rabbi Akiva says: We found an individual who brings his obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from wheat,</b> which is brought by a poor person for a false oath of testimony, a false oath of utterance, or for entering the Temple while ritually impure, <b>and</b> one who brings <b>his obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from barley,</b> in the case of a sinner’s meal offering or the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>.
<b>And</b> we also found with regard to the <b>community that they bring their obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from wheat,</b> in the case of the two loaves offering of <i>Shavuot</i>, and therefore, to keep the <i>halakha</i> of a community parallel to that of an individual there should be a case where the community <b>brings their obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from barley. And if you say</b> that the <i>omer</i> offering <b>comes from wheat,</b> then <b>we</b> will <b>not</b> have <b>found</b> a case of <b>a community that brings its obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from barley.</b> Consequently, it must be that the <i>omer</i> offering comes from barley.
Rabbi Akiva suggests another proof: <b>Alternatively, if you say</b> that the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>comes from wheat,</b> then <b>the two loaves</b> offering would <b>not</b> be from the <b>first fruits.</b> The verse states that the two loaves offering of <i>Shavuot</i> should come from the first fruits: “Also in the day of the first fruits, when you bring a new meal offering to the Lord in your feast of weeks” (Numbers 28:26). If the <i>omer</i> is from wheat, then the two loaves offering would not be the first offering of the first fruit, as the <i>omer</i> offering of Passover precedes it. Therefore, the <i>omer</i> offering must come from barley. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
Rabba resolves Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma from this last proof of Rabbi Akiva: <b>And if it is so, that the two loaves</b> sacrificed <b>not in their</b> proper <b>order</b> still <b>permit</b> the use of the new crop for meal offerings, <b>you</b> can in fact <b>find</b> a case where the two loaves are from the first fruits even though they are also brought from wheat, just like the <i>omer</i> offering. This is a case <b>where</b> the community <b>sacrifices</b> the current <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>from these</b> wheat grains <b>that took root prior</b> to the bringing of <b>the two loaves</b> offering <b>but after</b> the bringing of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>of last year.</b>
<b>And the</b> current <b>two loaves</b> offering is brought <b>from these</b> grains <b>that took root prior to the current <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>and after the two loaves</b> offering <b>of last year.</b> In this scenario, the two loaves come from wheat of this year’s crop and yet they are still called the first fruits, despite the fact that the <i>omer</i> offering also came from wheat, as that wheat is considered the previous year’s crop. Since this case is not mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, evidently if the two loaves are not in the proper order with regard to a certain crop they do not permit that crop to be used in offerings in the Temple. This resolves Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma.
In this manner Rabba has attempted to prove that the proper order of the <i>omer</i> offering followed by the two loaves is necessary to permit the new grain for use in meal offerings. The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Do you hold</b>

Daf 69a

that when <b>we say</b> the two loaves must come from the <b>first fruits,</b> the verse is referring to the new <b>fruit</b> crop grown this year? This is not so. Rather, <b>we say</b> that the two loaves must come from the first fruits sacrificed <b>upon the altar</b> this year. Therefore, even in Rabba’s case the two loaves cannot come from wheat, as <b>the altar</b> had already <b>consumed from the fruit,</b> i.e., the wheat used for the <i>omer</i> offering, <b>of this year.</b>
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>two loaves</b> that permit the bringing of first fruit, are all fruit that are <b>budding</b> at the time of the sacrifice <b>permitted, or</b> are only fruit that has gone through <b>formation permitted?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant here by <b>budding and what</b> is the meaning of <b>formation? If we say</b> that this is referring to the <b>budding of the fruit and the formation of the fruit,</b> this is difficult: <b>Now</b> that it is taught (70a) that even in the case of the grain <b>taking root</b> prior to the bringing of the two loaves, that grain is <b>permitted</b> by their sacrifice, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to discuss the <b>budding or formation</b> of fruit, which corresponds to a later stage than the taking root of grain?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Rami bar Ḥama is referring to the <b>budding of</b> a fruit tree’s <b>leaf and the formation of</b> a fruit tree’s <b>leaf.</b> The question is <b>whether</b> the budding of the fruit tree’s leaves <b>is like the taking root</b> of grain, and therefore all the tree’s first fruit is permitted by the two loaves, <b>or</b> whether this budding is <b>not</b> similar to the taking root of grain, and therefore the tree’s fruit is not permitted by the two loaves. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>wheat</b> kernels <b>that one sowed in the ground,</b> does the bringing of the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>permit them</b> to be eaten <b>or</b> does the <b><i>omer</i> not permit them</b> in consumption? The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the wheat kernel <b>has</b> already <b>taken root</b> prior to the bringing of the <i>omer</i> offering, <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> this in a mishna. <b>If it</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the wheat stalk <b>has not</b> yet <b>taken root, we</b> already <b>learn</b> this in a mishna as well.
The Gemara cites the source for this claim. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (70a): <b>If</b> crops <b>took root before</b> the sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering, the <b><i>omer</i> permits them</b> to be eaten. <b>And if not,</b> i.e., they took root only after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering, <b>they are prohibited until</b> the <b>next <i>omer</i></b> is sacrificed the following year.
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan’s dilemma <b>is necessary</b> only in a case <b>where one reaped</b> grain <b>and sowed it</b> again <b>prior to the <i>omer</i>, and</b> the time of the <b><i>omer</i> arrived and passed</b> while the grain was in the ground but before it had taken root. <b>And</b> this is <b>the dilemma</b> that <b>he raises: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in such a case? Is it permitted <b>to take</b> these kernels <b>and eat from them?</b> Is their halakhic status <b>considered like</b> that of kernels <b>cast into a jug,</b> i.e., disconnected from the ground, <b>and</b> consequently the sacrifice of the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>renders their</b> consumption <b>permitted? Or perhaps he subordinated them to the ground,</b> in which case their halakhic status is that of seeds that did not take root and are therefore prohibited.
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan raises another dilemma with regard to grains that were reaped and then sowed again: <b>Does</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>exploitation</b> apply <b>to them</b> in a case of a disparity of one-sixth between their sale price and their market value, which would render the exploiter obligated to refund the difference between the purchase price and the market value, <b>or does</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>exploitation not</b> apply <b>to them?</b> Since the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation apply only to movable property, not to land, this matter depends on whether these grains are considered like detached movable property or whether they have been subordinated to the land.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that one said: I sowed six</b> <i>kav</i> of grain <b>in</b> the field, <b>and witnesses came and said that he sowed only five</b> <i>kav</i> <b>in it,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>any item that</b> is otherwise subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation, and it is sold <b>by measure, or by weight, or by number, even</b> if the disparity was <b>less than the measure of exploitation</b> in the transaction, the transaction is <b>reversed.</b> A disparity of one-sixth between the value of an item and its price constitutes exploitation only in cases where there is room for error in assessing the value of an item. In a case where the sale item is easily quantifiable, any deviation from the designated quantity results in a nullification of the transaction, even if the sale item in question is subordinate to the ground.
<b>Rather,</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>said: I cast</b> kernels in the field <b>as required,</b> without quantifying the measure of the kernels that he cast, <b>and witnesses came and said that he did not cast</b> kernels in the field <b>as required.</b> Are <b>they</b> subject <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>exploitation,</b> as the halakhic status of these kernels is <b>like</b> that of kernels <b>cast into a jug, and they</b> are subject <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>exploitation? Or, perhaps</b> the laborer <b>subordinated them to the ground,</b> in which case they have the status of land, which is not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation.
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan raises yet another dilemma with regard to grains that were reaped and then sowed again. The <i>halakha</i> is that one does not take oaths with regard to claims on land. Consequently, if one admitted to part of a claim with regard to such grain, which generally obligates him in an oath, does <b>he take an oath with regard to</b> the kernels <b>or</b> does <b>he not take an oath with regard to</b> the kernels? Is their halakhic status <b>like</b> that of kernels <b>cast into a jug, and they are like movable property and one takes an oath with regard to them? Or, perhaps he subordinated them to the ground,</b> and <b>they are like land and one does not take an oath with regard to them.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>wheat</b> kernels <b>that</b> are found <b>in the dung of cattle, or barley</b> kernels <b>found in the dung of an animal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> issue was this dilemma raised? <b>If we say</b> it was with regard to their capacity <b>to become susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, we</b> already <b>learn</b> this in a <i>baraita</i>, as it is taught: If one found <b>wheat</b> kernels <b>in the dung of cattle or barley</b> kernels <b>in the dung of animals,</b> they <b>do not become susceptible to</b> the <b>ritual impurity of food.</b> But if he <b>collected them for eating,</b> they <b>do become susceptible to</b> the <b>ritual impurity of food.</b>
The Gemara provides another suggestion: <b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma is referring to the use of these kernels <b>for meal offerings.</b> The Gemara rejects this: It is <b>obvious that</b> they may <b>not</b> be used for meal offerings, as it is written with regard to those who offer inferior items to the Temple: <b>“Present it now unto your governor; will he be pleased with you or show you favor?</b> Says the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 1:8). Any item that one would not feel comfortable bringing to a governor or local ruler may certainly not be brought to the Temple.
The Gemara explains: <b>No;</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise the dilemma in a case <b>where one collected</b> these kernels <b>and sowed</b> them in the ground, <b>and</b> now he <b>wants to bring meal offerings from them. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is</b> the reason one may not use them initially for meal offerings <b>because</b> they are <b>disgusting, and since he sowed them</b> again <b>their disgusting</b> quality has <b>left? Or perhaps</b> they were initially disqualified <b>because they are</b> considered <b>weakened</b> after having been digested by an animal. <b>And</b> if so, even the grains that have <b>now</b> grown after they were replanted are <b>also weakened,</b> like the kernels that gave rise to them. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises</b> yet another <b>dilemma:</b> In the case of <b>an elephant that swallowed an Egyptian wicker basket and excreted it</b> intact along <b>with its waste, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter was this dilemma raised?
<b>If we say</b> that the dilemma was raised <b>with regard to</b> a case where the wicker basket was ritually impure and the question is if <b>its ritual impurity is nullified</b> by the elephant swallowing it, <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 25:9): <b>All vessels descend into their</b> state of <b>ritual impurity by means of thought.</b> Although an unfinished vessel cannot become ritually impure, if the craftsman decided not to finish it, it immediately assumes the halakhic status of a completed vessel and can become ritually impure. <b>But they ascend from their</b> state of <b>ritual impurity only by means of a change</b> resulting from <b>an action.</b> A ritually impure vessel, once it undergoes physical change, is no longer ritually impure. Therefore, as the wicker basket remained intact without physical change, it is clear that it remains ritually impure.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise this dilemma in a case <b>where</b> the elephant had <b>swallowed</b> ends of <b>palm leaves [<i>hutzin</i>]</b> whole, <b>and</b> after the leaves were excreted <b>one made them</b> into <b>an Egyptian wicker basket.</b> The dilemma is as follows: <b>Is</b> this considered <b>digestion,</b> and therefore the basket prepared from the leaves <b>is</b>

Daf 69b

<b>like dung vessels</b> and <b>like earth vessels, and</b> these <b>are not susceptible to ritual impurity, as the Master said: Stone vessels and dung vessels and earth vessels are not susceptible to ritual impurity, neither by Torah law nor by rabbinic law? Or perhaps</b> this is <b>not</b> considered <b>digestion,</b> as these palm leaves remained intact, and therefore the vessel prepared from them is susceptible to ritual impurity like any other wooden vessel.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from that which Ulla says in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yehotzadak: An incident</b> occurred in which <b>wolves swallowed two children</b> and excreted them <b>on</b> the east <b>bank of the Jordan, and</b> the <b>incident came before the Sages</b> for a ruling. They were asked whether the remains of the children were ritually impure even after they had passed through the animal’s digestive tract, <b>and they deemed the flesh ritually pure,</b> as it is no longer considered human flesh but wolf excrement. Similarly, the swallowed palm leaves should be considered like elephant dung and therefore the basket made from them should not be susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara rejects this resolution: That case of <b>flesh is different, as</b> flesh <b>is soft</b> and digestible. Palm leaves, by contrast, are hard and not easily digested. The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>let us resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from the last clause</b> of the account of that incident: The Sages ruled that flesh was ritually pure, <b>but</b> they <b>deemed</b> the intact <b>bones ritually impure.</b> The bones, which are a harder substance than the flesh, are not considered digested. Likewise, the hard palm leaves should also not be considered digested, and the wicker basket fashioned from them should be susceptible to ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: The case of <b>bones is different, as they are harder.</b> Therefore, one cannot cite a proof from here with regard to palm leaves, which are a comparatively softer substance.
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>wheat that fell from the clouds, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> issue was this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it is referring to using this wheat <b>for meal offerings, why not?</b> There should be no problem with using the wheat, since wheat for meal offerings does not have to come from Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is whether this wheat can be used <b>for the</b> offering of the <b>two loaves</b> on <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara explains the two possibilities. The verse states: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, for first fruits to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:17). When <b>the Merciful One states: “Out of your dwellings,”</b> does this serve <b>to exclude</b> wheat <b>that</b> came <b>from outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, teaching <b>that</b> it may <b>not</b> be used for the two loaves; <b>but</b> wheat that fell <b>from</b> the <b>clouds</b> is <b>permitted? Or perhaps</b> the verse means <b>specifically: “Out of your dwellings,”</b> i.e., only from Eretz Yisrael; <b>and</b> if so, <b>even</b> wheat that fell <b>from</b> the <b>clouds</b> is <b>also not</b> acceptable.
With regard to this dilemma, the Gemara asks: <b>But is there a case like this?</b> Is it possible for wheat to fall from the clouds? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as in</b> an incident involving <b>Adi the Arab [<i>taya’a</i>],</b> about whom it is related that it rained <b>down on him wheat</b> of <b>a height of one handbreadth</b> spread <b>over</b> an area of <b>three parasangs.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi raises a dilemma:</b> In a case where one had <b>an ear</b> of grain <b>that reached one-third</b> of its growth <b>prior to the</b> bringing of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering, <b>and</b> then he <b>uprooted it and planted</b> it again <b>after the <i>omer</i>, and</b> then <b>it added</b> to its growth, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we follow the original</b> growth, which was <b>permitted</b> by <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering, and therefore the additional growth is also permitted? <b>Or perhaps we follow the additional</b> growth, which was not permitted by the <i>omer</i>, as it grew afterward. <b>And</b> if so, it will remain prohibited <b>until the next <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>is brought.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> that <b>which Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>a young</b> vine within three years of its planting, whose fruits are prohibited as <i>orla</i>, <b>that one grafted onto an old,</b> permitted vine, <b>and there were fruits on</b> the younger vine, <b>even</b> if the older vine <b>added two hundred</b> parts of growth to the existing fruit, it is still <b>prohibited.</b> The two hundred permitted parts, which are generally sufficient to nullify one part of <i>orla</i>, are ineffective in this case, because the subsequent additional growth is considered subordinate to the original prohibited growth. This proves that we follow the original growth, and therefore in Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi’s case the original growth that was permitted by the <i>omer</i> should render the entire plant, including the subsequent growth, permitted in consumption.
The Gemara cites another proof from a similar case. <b>And</b> likewise <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> With regard to <b>an onion that one planted in a vineyard,</b> creating a forbidden mixture of food crops in a vineyard, <b>and the vineyard was</b> subsequently <b>uprooted,</b> so that most of the onion grew in a permitted manner, <b>even</b> if the onion <b>added two hundred</b> parts of growth, the onion is <b>prohibited.</b> The reason the entire onion is prohibited is apparently because we follow the original growth, which is forbidden.
The Gemara states that these proofs are inconclusive, as <b>that itself is</b> what Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi <b>raises</b> as <b>a dilemma:</b> Is it entirely <b>obvious to the Sages that we follow the main</b> growth, and there is <b>no difference whether</b> this leads <b>to a leniency or whether</b> it leads <b>to a stringency? Or perhaps they are uncertain</b> about the matter, <b>and</b> therefore they rule that when it leads <b>to a stringency,</b> e.g., prohibiting the additional growth of <i>orla</i> fruit or the additional growth of an onion that had grown in a vineyard, <b>we say</b> that we follow the original growth, but when it leads <b>to a leniency,</b> such as allowing the consumption of grain after the <i>omer</i>, <b>we do not say</b> that we follow the original growth. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ In connection to the previous discussion with regard to an ear of grain that had grown one-third prior to the <i>omer</i> and was subsequently uprooted and replanted, <b>Rabba raises a dilemma: With regard to</b> the obligation to <b>tithe, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> of such grain? The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> The circumstances involve a case <b>where</b>

Daf 70a

one <b>estimated</b> the amount of tithe necessary, <b>and</b> then he <b>separated those tithes, and</b> then he <b>planted</b> the grain again <b>and</b> it <b>added to its</b> growth. The question is whether we follow the initial growth, and therefore the subsequent growth is exempt from the obligation to separate tithes, or do we follow the additional growth and deem it obligated in tithes?
Rabba adds: <b>If you say</b> that <b>we do not follow the main</b> growth <b>and</b> therefore the <b>additional</b> growth <b>requires</b> the separation of <b>tithes, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>main,</b> initial growth? Does it require an additional separation of tithes, or does it not, as tithes were already set aside for it? <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from any general</b> case of <b>wheat or barley?</b> When grain is tithed and replanted, the obligation of tithes always applies to what then grows.
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>I do not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to <b>a substance whose seed disintegrates</b> in the ground. In such a case it is clear that the new growth requires a new tithe to be separated, as the original seed is no longer extant. <b>Rather, when I raise the dilemma</b> it is with regard to <b>a substance whose</b> original <b>seed does not disintegrate. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do we follow the original growth, for which tithes have already been separated, or do we follow the additional growth that is still being generated by that original seed?
The Gemara asks: <b>Let him resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from that which Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>litra</i> of onions that one tithed, and</b> then he <b>sowed</b> a field with the entire <i>litra</i> of onions, when the field yields a crop <b>it is tithed according to the entire</b> crop. Although some of the onions he sowed were already tithed, he is obligated to tithe them again because the growths exceed the original onions and therefore the entire crop has untithed status.
The Gemara rejects that resolution: <b>There,</b> in the case of the field sowed with the tithed onions, the entire field must be tithed because <b>that is</b> the normal way in which a field <b>is sowed.</b> One generally replants a full onion, and therefore the focus is not on the original onion but on the yield, which must be fully tithed. <b>Here,</b> in the case of grain, this <b>is not</b> the normal way in which a field <b>is sowed.</b> Generally one plants individual kernels, not fully grown ears of grain. Consequently, any subsequent growth from that fully grown ear is considered part of the original growth.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Minyumi said to Abaye:</b> In a case of <b>a flowerpot [<i>atzitz</i>] that is not perforated, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes? Abaye replied: What is the difficulty here? <b>If it is not perforated, this</b> <i>halakha</i> is the same as that of any <b>non-perforated</b> flowerpot, i.e., the separation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes is required by rabbinic law.
Abaye continues: <b>Perhaps</b> what <b>you</b> meant to <b>say</b> is that he subsequently <b>went and perforated it.</b> In such a case the question is whether one may separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the initial growth of the plant. Is the initial growth considered a separate entity, in which case one part of the growth requires the separation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes by rabbinic law and the rest by Torah law, and therefore one may not separate from the initial growth? Alternatively, perhaps the initial growth is nullified by the subsequent growth, which would mean that the obligation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes applies to the entire plant by Torah law. Consequently, this obligation can be fulfilled by separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the initial growth of the plant. This would be similar to Rabba’s dilemma with regard to an ear of grain that is replanted.
Abaye explains that the two cases are not comparable. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the non-perforated flowerpot which was subsequently perforated, it <b>is one</b> single <b>sowing.</b> Therefore, although the original growth occurred while the pot was not perforated, since it is now perforated, the plant <b>is</b> considered <b>attached</b> to the ground <b>and it rises</b> and grows from there. Consequently, the obligation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes applies to the entire plant by Torah law. <b>There,</b> in Rabba’s dilemma involving the replanting of an ear of grain, <b>there are two</b> distinct <b>sowings.</b> Therefore, there is room to debate whether or not the additional, second sowing is part of the original, first sowing.
§ <b>Rabbi Abbahu raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>an ear</b> of grain <b>that one smoothed into a pile and</b> then <b>sowed it</b> again <b>and</b> subsequently <b>designated it</b> as <i>teruma</i> or tithes <b>while</b> it was <b>attached</b> to the ground, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>since he smoothed it,</b> which is the act that renders produce subject to the obligation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>he has given it</b> the status of <b>untithed produce, and</b> therefore <b>when he</b> subsequently <b>designated it he</b> thereby <b>sanctified it? Or perhaps, since he</b> had <b>sowed it</b> again after he had smoothed it, <b>its</b> status as <b>untithed produce lapsed from it.</b>
<b>The Sages said to Abaye: If so,</b> that the grain is sanctified in this situation, <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> a case of <b><i>teruma</i></b> that is sanctified while it is still <b>attached to the ground. But we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>We do not find</b> a case of <b><i>teruma</i> attached to the ground.</b> Therefore, one must conclude that its status as untithed produce has been removed, and his designation does not render it <i>teruma</i>.
Abaye <b>said to</b> one of those Sages: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is taught with regard to <i>teruma</i>, which renders a non-priest <b>liable to death</b> at the hand of Heaven <b>or</b> payment of <b>a fifth.</b> If a non-priest ate <i>teruma</i> intentionally he is liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven; if he ate it unintentionally, he must restore the amount he ate with the addition of one-fifth (see Leviticus 22:9, 14). The reason there is no penalty for eating <i>teruma</i> that is attached to the ground is <b>that if one detaches</b> it <b>and eats</b> it, <b>it is</b> considered <b>detached. And if he stooped down and ate</b> it while it was attached to the ground he is not liable, as <b>his intention is</b> rendered <b>irrelevant by</b> the opinions of <b>all</b> other <b>people.</b> In other words, this is an abnormal manner of eating, for which one is not liable.
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that is written on the tablet [<i>appinkesa</i>] of Ilfa:</b> With regard to <b>eggs</b> found with the <b>carcass of a kosher bird, some of them outside</b> the bird <b>and some of them inside</b> the bird, if one ate from those inner eggs directly <b>from inside</b> the bird, <b>they render</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows them <b>ritually impure</b> when they are <b>in the throat.</b> If he removed those same eggs and ate <b>from</b> them when they were <b>outside</b> the bird, <b>they do not render</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows them <b>ritually impure</b> when they are <b>in the throat.</b> Apparently, even the abnormal method of eating eggs while they are inside the bird is still considered eating. If so, the same should apply to consuming <i>teruma</i> abnormally by stooping down and eating it while it is still attached to the ground.
The Gemara answers: With regard to an item that is <b>detached,</b> i.e., the eggs inside the bird, it is relatively <b>common for people to eat</b> even in <b>this</b> manner. But <b>with regard to</b> an item that is <b>attached</b> to the ground, it is <b>not common for people to eat</b> such produce at all.
§ <b>Rav Tavyumei bar Kisna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who plants diverse kinds</b> of plants <b>in a non-perforated flowerpot,</b> this is <b>prohibited. Abaye said:</b> What is novel about this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Granted if</b> Shmuel had <b>taught us</b> that one who plants in this manner <b>is flogged</b> with <b>lashes for rebelliousness by rabbinic law,</b> it is <b>well</b> and understandable. <b>But</b> with this basic ruling he stated, that it is <b>prohibited, what is</b> he <b>teaching us?</b>
Is he teaching <b>that</b> planting in a non-perforated flowerpot <b>is</b> considered <b>sowing by rabbinic law? We</b> already <b>learn</b> this in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one <b>separated <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce grown in <b>a non-perforated</b> pot <b>for</b> produce of <b>a perforated</b> pot, it is <b><i>teruma</i></b> by rabbinic law, <b>and he must again separate <i>teruma</i></b> from the produce obligated in <i>teruma</i> by Torah law to render the produce grown in the perforated pot permitted in consumption. Since this separation has the status of <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law, evidently sowing in a non-perforated pot is considered sowing.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye; these are obligated in</b> the separation of <b><i>ḥalla</i>, and</b> each <b>one</b> of them <b>joins together with the others</b>to constitute the measure that obligates one to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>And they are prohibited</b> due to the prohibition of partaking <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> crop <b>prior to the Passover</b> Festival, <b>and</b> likewise it is prohibited <b>to reap</b> them <b>prior to the <i>omer</i></b> offering. <b>If</b> these grains <b>took root prior the <i>omer</i></b> offering, <b>the <i>omer</i> permits their</b> consumption; <b>and if not, they are prohibited until the next <i>omer</i> is brought</b> and sacrificed the following year.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses the identity of the species mentioned in the mishna. A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Spelt</b> is <b>a type of wheat,</b> while <b>oats and rye</b> are <b>a type of barley.</b> The Gemara translates the lesser-known species into the vernacular Aramaic: <b>Spelt</b> is called

Daf 70b

<b><i>gulva</i>, rye</b> is <b><i>dishra</i>,</b> and <b>oats</b> are <b><i>shibbolei ta’ala</i>.</b> The Gemara infers: With regard to <b>these</b> species, <b>yes,</b> the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> applies to them, but concerning <b>rice and millet, no,</b> the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> does not apply to them.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that only these five grains are obligated in the separations of <i>ḥalla</i>, derived? <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> This principle is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“bread”</b> and <b>“bread” from</b> the case of <b><i>matza</i>. It is written here,</b> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>: <b>“And it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land,</b> you shall set apart a portion for a gift to the Lord” (Numbers 15:19), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to <i>matza</i>: <b>“Bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). Just as <i>matza</i> can be prepared only from one of those five grains, so too the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> applies only to bread from one of those five grains.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to <i>matza</i> itself, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it must be from one of those five grains? The Gemara answers: <b>Reish Lakish said, and likewise</b> a Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught, and likewise</b> a Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught,</b> that <b>the verse states: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>, the bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). This verse indicates that only with regard to <b>substances that will come to</b> a state of <b>leavening</b> does <b>a person fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>by</b> eating <b>them on Passover,</b> provided that he prevents them from becoming leavened. This serves to <b>exclude these</b> foods, i.e., rice, millet, and similar grains, <b>which,</b> even if flour is prepared from them and water is added to their flour, <b>do not come to</b> a state of <b>leavening but to</b> a state of <b>decay [<i>sirḥon</i>].</b>
§ The mishna teaches that each one of the five types of grain <b>joins together with the others</b> to constitute the measure that obligates one to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to grain from <b>produce and flours and pieces of dough,</b> each one of these <b>joins together with the others.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> was this taught?
<b>Rav Kahana says:</b> It was taught <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of eating of <b>the new</b> crop prior to the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering on the sixteenth of Nisan. If one ate grain, flour, and dough of the new crop that combined to equal the size of an olive-bulk, he is liable to receive lashes for transgressing a prohibition. <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> It was taught <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>leavened bread on Passover. Rav Pappa says:</b> It was taught <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>second tithe</b> outside the walls of Jerusalem. <b>As, if</b> one <b>ate</b> a combined olive-bulk’s worth of grain, flour and dough of the second tithe <b>outside the wall</b> of Jerusalem, he <b>is flogged.</b>
<b>Rava says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to the matter of</b> the <b>ritual impurity of food; and this</b> is what <b>it teaches us: That</b> grains of barley <b>produce and flours</b> are <b>similar to pieces of dough. Just as there,</b> concerning pieces of dough, they combine to form the minimal measure of ritually impure food only if the combination of <b>food</b> is <b>as is,</b> without other additives, <b>so too here also,</b> concerning grain and flour, they combine to form the minimal measure of ritually impure food only when the mixture is <b>food as is,</b> without any shell or other additives.
The Gemara cites support for this opinion, as <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Wheat, whether shelled or unshelled, combines</b> to form the minimal measure of food that is susceptible to ritual impurity. But as for <b>barley,</b> it <b>combines</b> only when it is <b>shelled. When</b> it is <b>not shelled,</b> it <b>does not combine</b> together, as the inedible shell interposes between the different grains. This support Rava’s interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>, that it addresses barley in the form of grain, flour, and dough.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that the shell of barley is not considered part of the grain with regard to combining for ritual impurity? <b>But didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Before a food item comes in contact with liquid it is not susceptible to ritual impurity, as the verse states: “And if anything falls from their carcasses <b>upon any sowing seed that is sown,</b> it is pure. But if water be put upon the seed, and any of the carcass fall thereon, it is impure unto you” (Leviticus 11:37–38). The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the term “that is sown” indicates that the entire seed is susceptible to ritual impurity when it is in a state where it is <b>typical for people to take it out</b> to the field <b>for sowing.</b> This applies to <b>wheat in its shell, barley in its shell, and lentils in their shells.</b> This demonstrates that shells are considered part of the grain with regard to ritual impurity.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult.</b> The ruling of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the shells of kernels are considered part of it with regard to ritual impurity, is stated <b>with regard to moist</b> kernels, whereas the ruling of <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the shells are not part of the seed, is stated <b>with regard to dry</b> kernels, in which the shells crumble and fall away.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to the five grains: <b>And they are forbidden</b> due to the prohibition of partaking <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> crop <b>prior to the Passover</b> festival. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“bread”</b> written in connection with the prohibition of the new crop (see Leviticus 23:14), and <b>“bread”</b> written <b>with regard to <i>matza</i></b> (see Deuteronomy 16:3). Just as <i>matza</i> can be prepared only from one of the five grains, so too the prohibition against eating of the new crop applies only to the five grains.
§ The mishna further teaches with regard to the five grains: <b>And</b> it is prohibited <b>to reap</b> them <b>prior to the <i>omer</i></b> offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“the first”</b> written in conjunction with the new crop: “You shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest” (Leviticus 23:10), <b>and “the first”</b> written <b>with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>:</b> “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift” (Numbers 15:20). Just as the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> applies only to bread prepared from the five grains, so too the prohibition against reaping the new crop prior to the <i>omer</i> offering applies only to crops of the five grains.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it says: <b>Prior to the <i>omer</i>?</b> Does it mean prior to the reaping of the <i>omer</i> grain or prior to the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering? <b>Rabbi Yona says:</b> It means <b>prior to the reaping of the <i>omer</i></b> grain, i.e., the new crop is permitted at daybreak on the sixteenth of Nisan. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Zavda says: Prior to the bringing of the <i>omer</i></b> offering later that day.
The Gemara cites a proof from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And they are forbidden</b> due to the prohibition of partaking <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> crop <b>prior to the Passover</b> Festival, <b>and</b> likewise it is prohibited <b>to reap</b> them <b>prior to</b> the sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering. <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that the prohibition applies <b>prior to the bringing of the <i>omer</i></b> offering, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> the mishna <b>did not combine</b> the clauses together <b>and teach them</b> as one, since the time frame for each prohibition is different. The prohibition of harvesting the new crop is lifted at daybreak after the <i>omer</i> crop was harvested at night, whereas the prohibition against consuming the new crop ends only with the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering later that day.
<b>But according to the one who said</b> that the prohibition applies <b>prior to the reaping of the <i>omer</i></b> grain, then both the consuming and the harvesting of the new crop are permitted at daybreak of the sixteenth of Nisan. If so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>combine them and teach them</b> together, as follows: <b>And they are forbidden</b> due to the prohibition of partaking <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> crop, <b>and</b> likewise it is prohibited <b>to reap</b> them <b>prior to the Passover</b> Festival.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, if</b> a dispute <b>was stated</b> in this matter, <b>it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which teaches: <b>If</b> these grains <b>took root prior to the <i>omer</i></b> offering, <b>the <i>omer</i> permits their</b> consumption. <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it says: <b>Prior to the <i>omer</i>? Rabbi Yona says: Prior to the bringing of the <i>omer</i></b> sacrifice. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Zavda says: Prior to the harvesting of the <i>omer</i></b> grain.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said to</b>

Daf 71a

<b>Rabbi Yoshiya of his generation,</b> i.e., not the <i>tanna</i> of the same name: <b>Do not sit on your knees until you have explained to me</b> the source <b>for that</b> latter clause in <b>the mishna: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>permits</b> the consumption of the new crop <b>upon</b> its <b>taking root</b> in the ground?
Rabbi Yoshiya responded: <b>From where do we</b> derive, you ask? The source is <b>that it is written:</b> “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits <b>grain in the ear</b> parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14). Can one <b>not</b> learn from here <b>by inference</b> that although the <i>omer</i> offering must be from fully formed grain, <b>there is</b> less-developed grain at an earlier stage <b>that is not “grain in the ear,”</b> i.e., grain that may not be used for the <i>omer</i> offering but is nevertheless permitted by the <i>omer</i>?
The Gemara rejects this claim. Perhaps one can infer from here only that there is less-developed grain <b>that is not “grain in the ear” but</b> is at a further stage than simply taking root. Rather, it <b>actually grew one-third</b> of its full growth. If so, merely taking root is not enough for the <i>omer</i> offering to permit the consumption of that grain.
<b>Rather, Shmuel said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a verse discussing the counting of the <i>omer</i>: “Seven weeks you shall number for you; <b>from the time the sickle is first put</b> to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). Can one <b>not</b> learn from here <b>by inference</b> that there is grain at an earlier stage <b>that cannot</b> be cut with <b>a sickle,</b> which nevertheless is permitted by the <i>omer</i> offering? This description applies to grain that has taken root. The Gemara rejects this claim as well: Perhaps the inference is to grain at an earlier stage <b>that cannot</b> be cut with <b>a sickle but</b> is <b>actually fodder,</b> i.e., produce that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> One can derive that grain that has taken root is permitted by the <i>omer</i> offering from the term: <b>“The standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:9). Can one <b>not</b> learn from here <b>by inference that</b> there is grain that is too soft <b>and unable to stand,</b> which may not be used for the <i>omer</i> offering and yet is permitted by the <i>omer</i>? The Gemara rejects this claim as well: Perhaps the inference is to grain <b>that is unable to stand</b> but is <b>actually</b> soft grain like that of <b>a marsh;</b> it has grown somewhat but is still soft enough that it bends rather than stands.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the source of the <i>halakha</i> is the verse: “And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, <b>which you sow</b> in the field” (Exodus 23:16). This verse is referring to grain <b>from the time of sowing,</b> i.e., from when the grain takes root. <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: If so,</b> then <b>even though</b> the grain <b>had not taken root</b> it should be permitted by the <i>omer</i> offering. The verse mentions grain at the time of sowing, but it does not indicate that it is necessary for that grain to have taken root in order to be permitted by the <i>omer</i>. Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa in reply: <b>Wise one [<i>sudni</i>]</b>! <b>It is written: “In the field,”</b> which indicates that the verse is referring to freshly sown produce that has become part of the field, i.e., it has taken root.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Even before the <i>omer</i> offering is brought, <b>one may reap</b> a crop that grows in <b>an irrigated field in the valleys, but one may not arrange</b> the reaped stalks in <b>a pile. The residents of Jericho,</b> whose fields were categorized as irrigated fields in a valley, <b>reaped</b> the crops <b>with the approval of the Sages and arranged</b> the crops <b>in a pile without the approval of the Sages, but</b> the Sages <b>did not reprimand them. One may</b> reap crops in any field <b>for fodder</b> and <b>feed it to an animal. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> may one do so? <b>At a time when he begins</b> reaping <b>before</b> the crop reaches <b>one-third</b> of its potential growth. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One may reap and feed</b> the crops to animals <b>even after they reached one-third</b> of their potential growth.
<b>And one may reap</b> crops prior to the <i>omer</i> <b>due to</b> potential damage to <b>saplings</b> growing alongside the crops; and <b>due to the place of mourning,</b> i.e., to create room for those consoling mourners, who would bless them upon their return from the cemetery; and <b>due to</b> the need to create room for students to study, as failure to do so would lead to <b>dereliction of</b> Torah study in <b>the study hall.</b> After reaping the crops for any of these reasons, <b>one may not fashion them</b> into <b>sheaves, but he leaves them unbound.</b>
<b>The mitzva of the <i>omer</i></b> is for the barley <b>to come from standing grain.</b> If <b>one did not find</b> standing grain, <b>he brings from sheaves. Its mitzva is</b> for it <b>to come from</b> fresh, <b>moist</b> grain. If <b>one did not find</b> moist grain, <b>he brings from dry</b> grain. <b>Its mitzva is</b> for one <b>to reap</b> the grain <b>at night,</b> but if <b>it was reaped during the day,</b> it is <b>fit. And</b> reaping the grain for the <i>omer</i> <b>overrides Shabbat.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the ruling of the mishna that one may reap a crop that grows in an irrigated field in the valleys, the Gemara cites that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Binyamin says</b> that <b>one verse states:</b> “When you come into the land that I give to you <b>and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring the <i>omer</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:10). This verse indicates that one may reap his grain before bringing the <i>omer</i> offering. <b>But it is</b> also <b>written</b> in the continuation of the same verse: <b>“Of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest,”</b> from which it may be inferred that the <i>omer</i> is brought from the first reaped grain.
<b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>With regard to a place from</b> which <b>you bring</b> the <i>omer</i> grain for the sacrifice, i.e., from a field that is saturated with rainwater, <b>you may not reap</b> there. But <b>with regard to a place from</b> which <b>you may not bring</b> the <i>omer</i> grain, an irrigated field, <b>you may reap</b> there.
The Gemara questions this resolution: Why not <b>say</b> instead: <b>With regard to the type</b> of grain <b>from</b> which <b>you bring</b> the <i>omer</i>, i.e., barley, <b>you may not reap</b> it; but <b>with regard to the type</b> of grain <b>from</b> which <b>you may not bring</b> the <i>omer</i>, e.g., wheat, <b>you may reap</b> it? The Gemara answers: <b>You cannot say that</b> resolution, due to <b>that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> teaches. On 70a it was stated that Rabbi Yoḥanan derives a verbal analogy between the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ḥalla</i> and the <i>omer</i> offering, from which he learns that the prohibition against reaping the new crop before the <i>omer</i> sacrifice applies to all five types of grain. Therefore, the reconciliation of the verses must be as first suggested, that one may reap in a place from which the <i>omer</i> grain may not be brought.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The residents of Jericho,</b> whose fields were irrigated fields in a valley, <b>reaped</b> their crops <b>with the approval of the Sages and arranged</b> the crops <b>in a pile without the approval of the Sages,</b> but the Sages did not reprimand them. The Gemara asks: <b>Whom did you hear who said:</b> The Sages <b>reprimanded</b> them, or: <b>They did not reprimand</b> them? In other words, who is the <i>tanna</i> who, in the context of the customs of the residents of Jericho, addresses whether or not the Sages reprimanded them, as opposed to whether or not their actions were in accordance with the Sages’ will? The Gemara states: It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
Upon identifying the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> really <b>hold</b> that the <b>reaping of the residents of Jericho was</b> performed <b>with the approval of the Sages? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 3:15): <b>The people of Jericho performed six actions, three with the approval of the Sages and three without the approval of the Sages.</b>
<b>And these</b> are the actions they performed <b>with the approval of the Sages: They</b> would <b>graft palm trees the entire day</b> of the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>and they</b> would <b>bundle <i>Shema</i>, and they</b> would <b>reap</b> grain <b>before the <i>omer</i></b> offering was brought; all of these were <b>with the approval of the Sages. And these</b> are the actions that they performed <b>without the approval of the Sages: They</b> would <b>pile</b> the harvest <b>before the <i>omer</i>, and they</b> would <b>permit</b> the use of <b>consecrated branches [<i>gamziyyot</i>] of carob and of sycamore</b> trees, <b>and they</b> would <b>make breaches in</b> the walls of <b>their gardens and in their orchards to feed fallen</b> fruit <b>to the poor during drought years,</b> so that the poor could take the fruit that had fallen even <b>on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> Rabbi Meir: This is an inaccurate formulation, since <b>if they acted with the approval of the Sages,</b> then <b>every person would do so,</b> not only the residents of Jericho. <b>Rather,</b> you should formulate it in this manner: Both <b>these</b> three acts <b>and those</b> three acts <b>were performed without the approval of the Sages. With regard to three</b> of them the Sages <b>reprimanded them, and with regard to</b> the other <b>three</b> the Sages <b>did not reprimand them.</b>
<b>And these</b> are the actions they performed for <b>which</b> the Sages <b>did not reprimand them: They</b> would <b>graft palm trees the entire day, and they</b> would <b>bundle <i>Shema</i>, and they</b> would <b>reap and pile</b> grain <b>before the <i>omer</i></b> offering was brought. <b>And these are</b> the actions they performed for <b>which</b> the Sages <b>reprimanded them:</b>

Daf 71b

<b>They</b> would <b>permit</b> the use of <b>consecrated branches of carob and of sycamore</b> trees; <b>they</b> would <b>make breaches in</b> the walls of <b>their gardens and orchards, in order to feed fallen fruit to the poor during drought years on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals; and they</b> would <b>designate</b> for the poor <b>the</b> produce in the <b>corner [<i>pe’a</i>]</b> in a field <b>of vegetables. And</b> the Sages <b>reprimanded them</b> for those actions. It is clear from the <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the reaping of the grain before the <i>omer</i> offering was performed without the approval the Sages. So why does the mishna, which represents Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, teach that it was with the approval of the Sages?
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> why did the <i>baraita</i> say that the residents of Jericho performed <b>six</b> actions without the approval of the Sages? Counting the cases listed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>there were</b> in fact <b>seven</b> actions, as reaping and piling count as two actions. Evidently, the text of the <i>baraita</i> is problematic. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, omit from here</b> the case of the <b>reaping</b> of the grain before the <i>omer</i> offering was brought. If so, then in the <i>baraita</i> Rabbi Yehuda never commented about the reaping of the grain before the <i>omer</i>, and therefore it does not contradict the mishna’s statement that it was performed with the approval of the Sages.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may</b> reap crops in any field <b>for fodder</b> and <b>feed it to an animal</b> even before the <i>omer</i> offering. The Gemara notes that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 2:1): <b>And these divide</b> a field <b>for</b> the purpose of <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> i.e., the presence of any of these separates a field so that each section constitutes a distinct field from which <i>pe’a</i> must be allocated independently: <b>A stream</b> that passes through the field, <b>and a canal [<i>vehashelulit</i>], and a private road</b> that is four cubits wide, <b>and a public road</b> that is at least sixteen cubits wide, <b>and a permanent public trail or a private trail</b> that is used <b>whether in the summer or in the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter, <b>and an uncultivated field, and a plowed field, and a seed</b> of <b>a different</b> kind of plant, e.g., a section of barley seed in a field full of wheat.
In all of the aforementioned instances a field is considered divided into two distinct fields. Another type of separation is subject to dispute: <b>And</b> in the case of one who <b>reaps</b> crops in a field <b>for fodder,</b> this action also <b>divides</b> a field in two. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> It <b>does not divide</b> a field <b>unless one</b> also <b>plowed</b> the area that he reaped. Only then is the field divided, as it is a plowed field.
With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Meir said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> in the mishna: <b>One may reap and feed</b> the crops to animals <b>even after they reached one-third</b> of their potential growth. <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>holds</b> that <b>any</b> reaping performed <b>for fodder is not</b> considered <b>reaping.</b> Likewise, Rabbi Meir maintains that reaping for fodder, even after the crop has reached one-third of its potential growth, is not considered the start of the reaping of the entire field, and therefore it divides the field.
<b>Rabba sat and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a section of crops in a field <b>was consumed by grasshoppers,</b> or <b>ants nibbled</b> away <b>at</b> those crops <b>[<i>kirsemuha</i>],</b> or <b>the wind broke it</b> down, <b>all concede</b> that if that section was subsequently <b>plowed, it divides</b> the field, and if it was <b>not plowed, it does not divide</b> the field. When the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>All concede,</b> to <b>whom</b> is it referring? It must be referring to <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that usually, reaping for fodder divides a field without subsequent plowing, yet in this case he admits that it divides the field only if it is subsequently plowed.
Rav Aḥa bar Huna explains his objection to the opinion that Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with Rabbi Shimon: <b>Granted,</b> Rabbi Meir’s opinion can be explained <b>if you say</b> that <b>the mishna,</b> where Rabbi Meir maintains that reaping fodder is not considered reaping, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the fodder had <b>not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of its potential growth, and the <b><i>baraita</i>, where</b> he maintains that only if it was <b>plowed, yes,</b> it divides the field, but if was <b>not plowed, no,</b> it does not divide the field, is referring to a case where the fodder had already <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth. If so, the difference between the rulings of Rabbi Meir is clear, as it all depends on the growth of the produce.
<b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with Rabbi Shimon, and <b>the mishna</b> is <b>also</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the fodder had <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth, how can his ruling in the <i>baraita</i> be explained? <b>Now, if</b> with regard to <b>reaping there,</b> in a case where it involves human intervention, <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> It is <b>not called reaping; here</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, where the reaping is performed by grasshoppers or ants, is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that Rabbi Meir would not consider it reaping? And yet the <i>baraita</i> indicates that all agree that it is considered reaping, as it does not divide the field without plowing.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who says,</b> with regard to the statement of the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna that one may reap fodder and feed it to an animal: <b>When [<i>eimatai</i>]</b> may one do so? <b>At a time when he began</b> reaping <b>before</b> the crop reaches <b>one-third</b> of its potential growth. <b>But if he began after</b> the crop <b>reached one-third,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b> If so, the discrepancy between Rabbi Meir’s opinion in the mishna and in the <i>baraita</i> can be resolved, as the mishna is referring to a case where the crops had not yet reached one-third of their growth, whereas the <i>baraita</i> is speaking of crops that had already reached one-third of their growth and therefore their harvesting is considered the start of the reaping of the field, which divides it only if he subsequently plows.
The Gemara asks: You can <b>say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> express his opinion with regard to fodder that is reaped for the purposes of feeding an animal, but <b>did you hear him</b> say so with regard to a case where the reaping is performed <b>for human</b> consumption? <b>That</b> cannot be his opinion, since <b>if</b> it were <b>so,</b> then <b>there would be three</b> disputing opinions among the <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, who holds that reaping fodder for animal consumption is permitted; the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who maintains that it may be reaped even for human consumption provided that it has not grown one-third; and the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who holds that it is permitted for human consumption even in a case where it had grown one-third. This is problematic, as the Gemara in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> (25a) states a principle that whenever Rabbi Yehuda says in a mishna: When [<i>eimatai</i>], he is clarifying, rather than disagreeing with, the opinion of the previous <i>tanna</i>.
<b>Rather, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Rabbi Meir stated</b> his opinion in accordance <b>with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, his teacher.</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that <b>even</b> harvesting <b>for human</b> consumption <b>is not</b> considered <b>reaping</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>pe’a</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>one who</b> reaps <b>alternate</b> rows of his <b>field, and he leaves in it moist stems</b> that are not yet fully grown, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One must separate <b><i>pe’a</i> in each and every</b> row, as each one is considered a separate field.
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One separates <i>pe’a</i> <b>from one</b> row <b>for the whole</b> field, as they are all considered a single field. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Akiva</b> maintained that one is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>pe’a</i> from each row <b>only when</b> he reaps <b>alternate</b> rows and the grain is unripe kernels used <b>for</b> making <b>roasted grains. But when</b> one reaps <b>alternate</b> rows and the grain is fully grown produce <b>for</b> his <b>storehouse,</b> there is <b>no</b> obligation to separate <i>pe’a</i> from each row, as all the rows are considered part of one field. Rav Dimi is suggesting that Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, and therefore the discrepancy between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> can be resolved: The mishna is discussing unripe grains that have not yet grown one-third, similar to unripe kernels used for roasted grains, whereas the <i>baraita</i> is discussing fully grown, ripened grains.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> in the separation of <i>pe’a</i> from each row <b>even where</b> he reaped fully grown fodder in <b>alternative</b> sections of his field <b>for</b> the purposes of storing in <b>a storehouse.</b> According to Ravin, Rabbi Akiva holds that reaping even fully grown fodder is not considered the start of the entire field’s reaping process, but only of the individual row. Therefore, one must separate <i>pe’a</i> from each row. This is inconsistent with Rabbi Meir’s opinion that the harvesting of fodder that has grown one-third is considered reaping.

Daf 72a

The Gemara answers: He <b>holds in accordance with</b> his opinion <b>with regard to one</b> issue, <b>and disagrees with him with regard to one</b> issue. In other words, Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with Rabbi Akiva’s opinion that the harvesting of fodder that has not yet reached one-third of its growth is not considered the start of the reaping of the entire crop, and he disagrees with Rabbi Akiva’s opinion that the harvesting of fodder that has reached one-third of its growth is also not considered the start of the reaping process, as Rabbi Meir maintains that this is considered the start of the reaping process even when it is performed for animals, and therefore it does not divide the field with regard to <i>pe’a</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one may reap</b> crops prior to the <i>omer</i> <b>due to</b> potential damage to <b>saplings</b> growing alongside the crops; and <b>due to the place of mourning,</b> to create room for those consoling the mourners, who would bless them upon their return from the cemetery; and <b>due to</b> the need to create room for students to study, as failure to do so would lead to <b>dereliction of</b> Torah study in <b>the study hall.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> one is permitted to reap prior to the <i>omer</i> offering in these instances? The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “You shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of <b>your harvest</b> to the priest” (Leviticus 23:10). The use of the term “your harvest” indicates that the <i>omer</i> offering’s reaping must precede any personal harvest, <b>but</b> it does <b>not</b> need to precede <b>reaping for</b> the purpose of <b>a mitzva.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: After reaping the crops for any of these reasons, <b>one may not fashion them</b> into <b>sheaves, but he leaves them unbound.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers: Although reaping is technically permitted, one should limit his involvement with the new grain. Therefore, <b>as much as possible</b> to avoid exerting effort in involvement with the grain, <b>we do not exert</b> effort.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>the mitzva of the <i>omer</i></b> is <b>to bring</b> the barley <b>from the standing grain. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear” (Leviticus 2:14)? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since the mitzva of the <i>omer</i></b> is <b>to bring</b> the barley <b>from the standing grain, from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one does not find</b> barley <b>from the standing grain,</b> he should <b>bring</b> it <b>from the</b> harvested and gathered <b>sheaves? The verse states: “You shall bring,”</b> to include this scenario.
<b>Alternatively,</b> the <i>baraita</i> suggests another reason why the verse states: <b>“You shall bring.” Since it is a mitzva to bring</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>from the moist</b> grain, one can ask: <b>From where</b> is it derived that if one does not find barley from the moist grain, he should <b>bring</b> it <b>from the dry</b> grain? <b>The verse states: “You shall bring,”</b> to include this case. <b>Alternatively,</b> the term <b>“you shall bring”</b> teaches the following: <b>Since</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of the <i>omer</i> is for it to be <b>reaped at night, from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if it was reaped <b>during the daytime, it is fit? The verse states: “You shall bring.”</b>
The <i>baraita</i> adds more <i>halakhot</i> that are derived from this same verse. From where is it derived that the <i>omer</i> offering <b>overrides Shabbat? The verse states: “You shall bring.”</b> Also, this term: <b>“You shall bring,”</b> teaches that the <i>omer</i> is brought in <b>any</b> manner that it is found, even from gathered sheaves. Furthermore, the term <b>“you shall bring,”</b> teaches that the <i>omer</i> crop may be brought <b>from anywhere</b> in Eretz Yisrael, if none is found near Jerusalem. Additionally, <b>“you shall bring”</b> teaches that it may be brought <b>even on Shabbat.</b> Lastly, <b>“you shall bring”</b> teaches that it may be brought <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>it was reaped during the day,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 20b): All mitzvot that must be performed at night may be performed anytime during that night. Therefore, <b>the entire night is valid</b> for <b>reaping the <i>omer</i></b> on the night following the first day of Passover, <b>for burning the fats</b> of offerings that had been brought during the preceding day, <b>and</b> for burning <b>the limbs</b> of burnt offerings. <b>This is the principle: A matter that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>during the entire day is valid</b> if performed anytime during <b>the entire day,</b> and likewise <b>a matter that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>at night is valid</b> if performed anytime during <b>the entire night.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this mishna: The mishna <b>teaches</b> the principle of mitzvot performed <b>at night</b> as being <b>similar to</b> the principle of those performed during <b>the day.</b> From this one can infer that <b>just as</b> in the case of a mitzva whose prescribed time is <b>by day,</b> if it is performed <b>at night</b> it is <b>not</b> valid, <b>so too</b> with regard to a mitzva whose prescribed time is <b>at night,</b> if it is performed <b>by day</b> it is also <b>not</b> valid. If so, why does the mishna here teach that if the <i>omer</i> was reaped during the day it is fit?
<b>Rabba said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna, which teaches that the <i>omer</i> reaped during the day is valid, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and that</b> mishna in <i>Megilla</i>, which states that any nighttime mitzva performed during the day is not valid, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:9): In a case where a priest <b>was standing and sacrificing the <i>omer</i> meal offering and it became ritually impure</b> in his hand, <b>if there is another</b> measure of barley grain that is ready to be reaped, then one <b>says to</b> the priest: Reap the barley and <b>bring another</b> meal offering <b>in its stead. And if</b> there is <b>no</b> alternative meal offering available, one <b>says to him: Be shrewd and keep silent;</b> i.e., do not tell anyone that it is impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: In either case,</b> one <b>says to him: Be shrewd and keep silent, as any <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>that is harvested not in accordance with</b> the procedure dictated by <b>its mitzva is unfit.</b> Likewise, one may not reap the barley during the daytime, as its prescribed time is at night.
With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, that barley for the <i>omer</i> offering that is reaped by day is unfit, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, the teacher of his father. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 130a): <b>Rabbi Akiva stated a principle: Any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve,</b> i.e., before Shabbat begins, <b>does not override Shabbat.</b>
<b>And</b> furthermore, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who said</b> that the <b>reaping of</b> barley for <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>is a mitzva. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 1:4) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse: “In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest” (Exodus 34:21), is not referring to the prohibition against farming the land during the Sabbatical Year, as one might have thought. Rather, it is referring to the prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat. And the reason that the verse mentions these two particular forms of labor is to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>plowing</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat is an otherwise <b>voluntary</b> act, as plowing is never required by the Torah, <b>so too,</b> the <b>harvesting</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat <b>is voluntary.</b> Therefore, <b>the harvesting of the <i>omer</i> is excluded</b> from the prohibition, <b>as it is a mitzva.</b> Consequently, the barley for the <i>omer</i> is harvested on the sixteenth of Nisan, even if it occurs on Shabbat.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains why Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael: <b>And</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, reached his opinion by the following reasoning: <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that barley for the <i>omer</i> offering that is <b>reaped not</b> in accordance with the procedure dictated by <b>its mitzva</b> is nevertheless <b>fit, why</b> would it <b>override Shabbat? Let one reap it on Shabbat eve. Rather, from</b> the fact that the reaping <b>overrides Shabbat, learn from</b> here that if it <b>was reaped not</b> in accordance with <b>its mitzva,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Isn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi also a <b>student of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who was a student of Rabbi Akiva? Since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was a student of Rabbi Shimon, and by extension of Rabbi Akiva, he should accept Rabbi Akiva’s principle that any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat. If so, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that if the <i>omer</i> was not performed at night it should be done by day, why does its harvest override Shabbat? Let it be harvested on Shabbat eve.
The Gemara cites a proof for its claim that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was a student of Rabbi Shimon. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When we would study Torah with Rabbi Shimon in Tekoa, we would carry to him oil and a towel [<i>aluntit</i>] from the courtyard to the roof and from the roof into an enclosure</b> similar to a courtyard, <b>and from</b> one <b>enclosure to another enclosure, until we reached the spring in which we would bathe,</b> without passing through a public domain.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi concedes that reaping barley for the <i>omer</i> offering overrides Shabbat, in accordance with Rabbi Akiva. But this is not because it is unfit if reaped at an improper time. Rather, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with the other</b> opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Come and see how dear is a mitzva</b> performed <b>in its</b> proper <b>time. As burning the fats and limbs is valid all night,</b> and therefore it is possible to wait until the conclusion of Shabbat and burn them at night, <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>one would not wait with them until nightfall;</b> rather, one burns them immediately, even on Shabbat. Likewise, when it comes to the reaping of the <i>omer</i>, although it is fit if reaped during the previous day, reaping at night still overrides Shabbat because a mitzva is dear when performed in its proper time.

Daf 72b

The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, not know</b> of this? He must have known of his father’s statement that a mitzva performed at its proper time overrides Shabbat. If so, his ruling that reaping at an improper time is unfit cannot be proven from the fact that reaping the <i>omer</i> overrides Shabbat, as claimed earlier.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, was aware of that principle, and nevertheless he maintains that the requirement to perform a mitzva at its optimal time does not apply to the case of the reaping of the <i>omer</i>. This is because <b>there,</b> in the case of the burning of the fats and limbs, it <b>is different, as the slaughter</b> of the animal already <b>overrode Shabbat.</b> Therefore, it is dear to perform the burning of its fats and limbs at the proper time, even on Shabbat. One cannot apply this reasoning to the reaping of the <i>omer</i>, as there is no prior labor performed on Shabbat before the reaping. Consequently, the reason it may be performed on Shabbat must be that it would be unfit if reaped any other time.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, he should agree that the case of the burning of the sacrifice’s fats and limbs is different from the <i>omer</i>, since <b>also</b> there, <b>the slaughter</b> of the animal already <b>overrode Shabbat.</b> Therefore, the Gemara gives a new explanation: <b>Rather, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that in fact the <b>reaping of the <i>omer</i></b> crop <b>does not override Shabbat,</b> in contrast to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. For this reason Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling that the <i>omer</i> is fit if reaped at an improper time does not conflict with the principle of his teacher, Rabbi Akiva, that any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>not</b> maintain that the reaping of the <i>omer</i> overrides Shabbat? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (63b) in response to Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion that when the sixteenth of Nisan occurred during the week, five <i>se’a</i> of barley were reaped, and when it occurred on Shabbat only three <i>se’a</i> were reaped: <b>And the Rabbis say: Both on Shabbat and</b> during the <b>week,</b> the <i>omer</i> offering <b>would come from three</b> <i>se’a</i>? In any case, according to both opinions, the <i>omer</i> was reaped on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mishna <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara raises a difficulty from the latter clause of that mishna. Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, says: On Shabbat the barley was reaped by an individual, with one sickle and one basket into which the barley was placed, whereas during the week it was reaped by three people, with three baskets and three sickles. <b>And the Rabbis say: Both on Shabbat and</b> during the <b>week</b> it is reaped <b>by three</b> people, <b>with three baskets and three sickles.</b> According to both opinions the <i>omer</i> was reaped on Shabbat. The Gemara again responds: <b>That</b> clause of the mishna <b>is</b> also <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara raises another difficulty from a mishna (65a) that describes the series of questions posed by the court emissary who reaps the grain to those assembled to witness the process: <b>And</b> if the sixteenth of Nisan occurs <b>on Shabbat,</b> the court emissary <b>says to</b> those assembled: Shall I cut the sheaves on <b>this Shabbat?</b> The assembly says in response: Yes. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> clause of mishna <b>is</b> also <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara raises a difficulty from the mishna (71a): If the <i>omer</i> <b>was reaped during the day,</b> it is <b>fit, and</b> it <b>overrides Shabbat.</b> Now, <b>whom did you hear who said: If the <i>omer</i> was reaped during the day,</b> it is <b>fit?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And</b> yet <b>it is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>And it overrides Shabbat. What, is it not</b> referring to <b>reaping?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>sacrifice</b> of the <i>omer</i> offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to reaping,</b> does it <b>not</b> override Shabbat, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As, isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi said the following <i>halakha</i> based upon the verse: <b>“And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord</b> to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 23:44): <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this phrase? This phrase is necessary <b>because we</b> had <b>learned only that the daily offering and the Paschal offering</b> override Shabbat and ritual impurity, <b>as it is stated concerning them: “In its appointed time”</b> (see Numbers 9:2, 28:2), from which it is derived that each of them must be sacrificed <b>in its appointed time and even on Shabbat; in its appointed time and even in ritual impurity.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>the rest of the communal offerings, from where</b> is it derived that they likewise override Shabbat and ritual impurity? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to additional offerings that are brought on the Festivals: <b>“These you shall sacrifice to the Lord in your appointed times”</b> (Numbers 29:39).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> in this <i>halakha</i> the <b><i>omer</i> and</b> the lambs that are <b>sacrificed with it, the two loaves</b> sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and</b> the communal peace offerings that are <b>sacrificed with them? The verse states: “And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord</b> to the children of Israel,” after it lists Shabbat and the Festivals. This indicates that <b>the verse established one time for all of them.</b> All of these days are considered appointed times, and their offerings are not deferred.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to what</b> ritual does the <i>baraita</i> state that these offerings override Shabbat? <b>If we say for</b> actual <b>sacrifice,</b> this cannot be correct, as <b>are the two loaves fit for sacrifice?</b> The two loaves are not sacrificed on the altar at all. Rather, they are waved and later eaten by priests.
The Gemara concludes its interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>, which leads to the question about the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the two loaves override Shabbat with regard <b>to grinding and sifting. And</b> if so, <b>similarly, with regard to the <i>omer</i></b> offering, it overrides Shabbat <b>with regard to</b> the process of <b>reaping</b> the grains. <b>And</b> as the <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, evidently he maintains that the reaping of the <i>omer</i> <b>overrides Sh abbat.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the <i>baraita</i> is not referring to comparable cases. As far as the <b><i>omer</i></b> is concerned, it overrides Shabbat only <b>with regard to</b> its actual <b>sacrifice, but</b> when it comes to the <b>two loaves,</b> it overrides Shabbat <b>with regard to</b> its <b>baking. And</b> the reason why the two loaves must be baked on Shabbat is because <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the <b>oven consecrates</b> that which is baked inside it. Therefore, <b>if</b> one were to <b>bake from the previous day,</b> on the eve of <i>Shavuot</i>, he would effectively be <b>disqualifying it</b> from being brought on <i>Shavuot</i> day, as it would be disqualified by being <b>left overnight.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi really <b>hold</b> that the <b>oven consecrates</b> that which is baked inside it? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The communal peace offering of two <b>lambs</b> that accompanies the two loaves sacrificed on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>consecrate the loaves</b> that accompany them <b>only by</b> means of their <b>slaughter. How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the lambs <b>for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., as lambs for <i>Shavuot</i> in the appropriate manner, <b>and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are consecrated.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: But if <b>one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are not consecrated,</b> as the factors indispensable in rendering the offering fit were not properly performed. If <b>one slaughtered them for their</b> own <b>sake and he sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> the fact that the lambs were properly slaughtered renders the loaves partially consecrated. Therefore, <b>the loaves are consecrated</b> to the extent that they cannot be redeemed, <b>but they are not consecrated</b> to the extent that they may be eaten. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Actually, the loaves are consecrated only when one slaughters</b> the offerings <b>for their</b> own <b>sake and sprinkles their blood for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., only if both factors indispensable in rendering the offering fit were properly performed. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that it is the slaughter of the lambs that consecrates the loaves, not baking the loaves in the oven.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> Actually, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does hold that the oven consecrates the loaves. What the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying</b> when it uses the categories of consecrated and not consecrated with regard to the slaughter of the lambs is that either the two loaves <b>are fixed</b> as <i>Shavuot</i> meal offerings and cannot be used for any other offering, <b>or</b> they <b>are not fixed</b> as <i>Shavuot</i> meal offerings. In other words, if the lambs were slaughtered and the blood sprinkled in the proper manner, one cannot change the designation of the loaves, whereas if they were not slaughtered and their blood was not sprinkled properly, one can change their designation. If the lambs were slaughtered properly but their blood was sprinkled improperly, the status of the loaves is subject to a dispute. This has nothing to do with when the loaves are consecrated.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are the meal offerings</b> from which <b>a handful is removed and</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the offering is eaten <b>by the priests: The meal offering of fine flour; and the</b> meal offering prepared in a <b>pan; and the</b> meal offering prepared in a <b>deep pan;</b> and <b>the</b> meal offering baked in an oven that is brought entirely of <b>loaves; and the</b> meal offering baked in an oven that is brought entirely of <b>wafers;</b> the <b>meal offering of gentiles; and</b> the <b>meal offering of women; and the <i>omer</i> meal offering,</b> i.e., the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan; <b>and the meal offering of a sinner; and</b> the <b>meal offering of jealousy,</b> brought by a <i>sota</i>.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Although its remainder is not eaten by priests, as meal offerings of priests are burned in their entirety, as it is written: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:16), nevertheless, with regard to the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests, a handful is removed. And the handful is sacrificed</b> on the altar <b>by itself, and</b> the <b>remainder is sacrificed</b> on the altar <b>by itself.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Pappa stated</b> a principle with regard to all the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: <b>Anywhere that we learned</b> in a mishna that one brings a meal offering, <b>we learned</b> that one must bring <b>ten</b> items of the same type, either loaves or wafers. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us,</b> as this is already stated by Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna (76a)?
The Gemara answers: This statement of Rav Pappa serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> One who takes a vow to bring a meal offering baked in an oven must bring ten items. If he wishes, he may bring ten loaves or ten wafers, and if he wishes <b>he may bring half</b> of them as <b>loaves and</b> the other <b>half</b> as <b>wafers.</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaches us that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> do so; all ten must be of the same type.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And their remainder</b> is eaten <b>by the priests.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara challenges the question: That <b>which is written</b> explicitly, <b>is written.</b> In the case of several meal offerings, including the gift meal offering brought by an individual, the Torah clearly states that the priests eat the remainder. <b>And</b> with regard to that <b>which is not written</b> explicitly, <b>it is written of it: “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it</b> before the Lord…And he shall take up from it his handful…and shall make the memorial part of it smoke upon the altar….<b>And the remainder of it shall Aaron and his sons eat”</b> (Leviticus 6:7–9). These verses establish the principle that the priests eat the remainders of meal offerings, even where the Torah does not state this explicitly. Therefore, it is unnecessary to ask for a source.
The Gemara explains the original question: With regard to a meal offering that <b>comes</b> from <b>wheat, we did not ask,</b> as that is included in the cited verse. <b>When we asked</b> it was with regard to a meal offering that <b>comes</b> from <b>barley,</b> i.e., the <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>: From where is it derived that the remainders of those offerings are given to the priests? The Gemara responds: With regard to one that <b>comes</b> from <b>barley also, since a handful</b> of it <b>is removed,</b> as the Torah states with regard to all meal offerings (see Leviticus 6:8), clearly <b>its remainder</b> is given <b>to the priests,</b> as why else would a handful be removed and offered?
The Gemara clarifies: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the priests eat the remainder of all meal offerings from which a handful is removed, <b>we did not ask</b> about the source. <b>When we asked</b> it was <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who said: There is</b> a type of <b>meal offering of which a handful is removed but</b> its remainder <b>is not eaten.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> From the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by a priest, a handful is removed.</b> Subsequently, <b>the handful is sacrificed</b> on the altar <b>by itself, and the remainder is sacrificed</b> on the altar <b>by itself.</b> Therefore, the question is: According to Rabbi Shimon, who says that the priests do not always eat the remainder when a handful is removed, <b>from where do we</b> derive that the priests eat the remainder of barley-based meal offerings?
The Gemara answers. <b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> The source is from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10). The verse is analyzed: <b>If</b> it <b>is not</b> necessary for <b>the matter of a mixed</b> meal offering <b>of wheat,</b> which is derived from the verse cited earlier, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a mixed</b> meal offering <b>of barley,</b> i.e., the meal offering of the <i>omer</i>. <b>And if</b> the verse <b>is not</b> necessary for <b>the matter of a dry</b> meal offering <b>of wheat,</b> which is derived from the verse cited earlier, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a dry</b> meal offering <b>of barley,</b> i.e., the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And this</b> verse, <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>Isn’t</b> the verse <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> priests <b>may not receive a share</b> of <b>meal offerings in exchange for</b> a share of animal <b>offerings,</b> i.e., one may not exchange his share of a meal offering for the equivalent value of meat from an animal offering of which he did not receive a share?

Daf 73a

<b>The verse states: “And every meal offering that is baked in the oven…shall all the sons of Aaron have, each man like the other”</b> (Leviticus 7:9–10). This verse emphasizes that the sons of Aaron must divide the meal offering equally among themselves, without exchanging it for a portion of any other offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>meal offerings in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings since they do not substitute for them in</b> the case of <b>poverty.</b> One who is too poor to afford to bring an animal offering, e.g., in the case of a sin offering determined on a sliding scale, does not bring a meal offering in its stead. Since meal offerings are not brought in place of animal offerings, there is clearly no connection between them. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of <b>meal offerings in exchange for</b> portions of <b>bird offering</b>s, <b>since they do substitute for them in</b> the case of <b>poverty.</b> If one is so destitute that he cannot afford to bring a bird offering he brings a meal offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “And all that is prepared in the deep pan…shall all the sons of Aaron have,”</b> again emphasizing that all must have an equal share in that meal offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>meal offerings in exchange for</b> portions of <b>bird offering</b>s <b>since these,</b> i.e., bird offerings, <b>are types of</b> offerings that involve <b>blood</b> sprinkled on the altar, <b>and those,</b> i.e., meal offerings, <b>are types</b> of offerings made <b>of flour. But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of portions of <b>bird offering</b>s <b>in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings, since both</b> categories are <b>types of</b> offerings that involve <b>blood</b> sprinkled on the altar. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “And on a pan…shall all the sons of Aaron have,”</b> a seemingly superfluous phrase, which teaches that one may not receive a share even of bird offerings in exchange for portions of animal offerings.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>bird offering</b>s <b>in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings because</b> with regard to <b>these,</b> i.e., the birds, <b>their processing,</b> i.e., killing, is executed <b>by hand,</b> by pinching the nape of the neck, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>those,</b> i.e., the animals, <b>their processing,</b> i.e., killing, is executed <b>with a utensil,</b> by slaughtering with a knife. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of <b>meal offerings in exchange for</b> portions of other <b>meal offerings, since the processing of</b> both <b>these and those</b> are carried out <b>by hand.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> next <b>verse states: “And every meal offering mixed with oil…shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of a meal offering prepared on <b>a pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal <b>offering</b> prepared in <b>a deep pan, or</b> portions of a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal <b>offering</b> prepared on <b>a pan, since the actions</b> with <b>this pan</b> result in <b>a hard</b> product, <b>and the actions</b> with <b>that</b> deep pan result in <b>a soft</b> product. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of a meal offering prepared on <b>a pan in exchange for</b> the portions of a different meal offering prepared on <b>a pan, or</b> a share of a meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a different meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that they <b>may not receive a share of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., meal offerings, in exchange for a portion of another similar offering, <b>but they may receive a share of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> in exchange for a portion of another similar offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to meal offerings: “Shall all the sons of Aaron have, <b>one as well as another”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>and</b> near it appears the verse: <b>“If</b> he offers it <b>for a thanks offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:12), from which is derived: <b>Just as one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of the most sacred order, so too, one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a thanks offering.
The <i>baraita</i> further expounds this verse: It states: <b>“One</b> as well as another <b>[<i>ish</i></b> <i>ke’aḥiv</i>],” which teaches that with regard to priests, <b>a man [<i>ish</i>]</b> who is an adult <b>receives a share even</b> if he is <b>blemished, but</b> a priest who is <b>a minor may not receive a share even</b> if he is <b>unblemished.</b> This <i>baraita</i> evidently interprets the verse: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another” (Leviticus 7:10), as referring to the prohibition against priests exchanging shares of offerings. If so, how does Ḥizkiyya state that this verse is referring to the priests’ eating of the remainder of the <i>omer</i> offering and the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>?
The Gemara answers: With regard to the prohibition against exchanging priestly shares, <b>that is derived from</b> the term: <b>“Every</b> meal offering.” By contrast, Ḥizkiyya derives his principle with regard to these two meal offerings from the rest of the verse. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> haven’t you already <b>derived</b> from the word “every” <b>that which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> states, that when one vows to offer a meal offering baked in an oven, all the baked items must be of a uniform type, either loaves or wafers (see 63b)? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, that</b> <i>halakha</i> concerning the exchange of shares of offerings is derived <b>from</b> the addition of the word “and,” in the term: <b>“And every [<i>vekhol</i>]</b> meal offering.”
§ <b>Ravina said:</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, the source for the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>omer</i> offering and the meal offering of a <i>sota</i> are eaten <b>comes from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>that Levi teaches, as Levi teaches:</b> The verse states with regard to the priestly gifts: “This shall be yours of the most sacred items, reserved from the fire: <b>Every offering of theirs, and every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs,</b> which they may restore to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons” (Numbers 18:9). The word “every” in each clause includes a number of additional offerings that are eaten by the priests.
The Torah states: <b>“Every offering of theirs,” to include</b> the <b><i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper,</b> teaching that it is also eaten by the priests. As, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in this verse: <b>“From the fire,”</b> this would exclude this oil, which is not brought onto the altar. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us:</b> “Every offering,” to include the leper’s oil.
The <i>baraita</i> continues expounding the verse: <b>“And every meal offering of theirs,”</b> serving <b>to include the <i>omer</i> meal offering, and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i>, teaching that they are also eaten by the priests. As, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states: “And they shall eat those wherewith atonement was made”</b> (Exodus 29:33), the verse thereby indicates that the priests may eat only those offerings that help the owner achieve atonement. <b>And this</b> <i>omer</i> <b>comes to permit</b> eating from the new grain (see Leviticus 23:9–14), not to achieve atonement; <b>and</b> concerning <b>the other</b> offering, i.e., the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>, <b>as well,</b> it <b>comes to clarify</b> whether or not the accused woman is guilty of adultery, but not to achieve atonement. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us:</b> “Every meal offering,” to teach that these two meal offerings are included.
The <i>baraita</i> continues to expound the verse. The verse states: <b>“And every sin offering of theirs,” to include a bird sin offering,</b> teaching that it is also eaten by the priests. As, it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> The priests may not eat it because <b>it is an unslaughtered animal carcass,</b> as it is killed by pinching the nape of the neck (see Leviticus 5:8), not by conventional slaughter. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us:</b> “Every sin offering,” teaching that bird sin offerings are included.
The <i>baraita</i> continues to expound the verse. The Torah states: <b>“And every guilt offering of theirs,” to include the guilt offering of the nazirite</b> who has become ritually impure (see Numbers 6:12) <b>and the guilt offering of the leper,</b> teaching that they are also eaten by the priests. The Gemara objects: With regard to <b>the guilt offering of the leper, it is explicitly written with regard to it: “For as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:13), which already teaches that it is eaten by the priests.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to include</b> the <b>guilt offering of the nazirite,</b> stating that its status is <b>like</b> the <b>guilt offering of the leper.</b> As, it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> The guilt offering of the nazirite is not sacrificed for atonement, but rather <b>it comes to prepare</b> the nazirite to begin his period of naziriteship anew, and therefore its meat would not be eaten by the priests. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us:</b> “Every guilt offering,” teaching that the guilt offering of the nazirite is included.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: “This shall be yours of the most sacred items…<b>which they may restore”; this</b> is referring to an item <b>stolen</b> from <b>a convert</b> who has no heirs and subsequently dies. In this case, the stolen item is given to the priests together with an additional one-fifth of its worth. The phrase <b>“for you and for your sons”</b> means that <b>it is yours and your sons’</b> personal property, and it may be used <b>even to betroth a woman with it,</b> and it does not belong to the Temple treasury.
§ <b>Rav Huna said:</b>

Daf 73b

<b>Peace offerings</b> volunteered by <b>gentiles</b> are sacrificed as <b>burnt offerings,</b> which are burned completely upon the altar. With regard to the source for this <i>halakha</i>, <b>if you wish, cite a verse; and if you wish, propose a logical argument. If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Concerning <b>a gentile</b> who volunteers an offering, the intent of <b>his heart is</b> that the offering should be entirely sacred <b>to Heaven,</b> and he does not intend for any of it to be eaten.
<b>And if you wish, cite a verse:</b> “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] who is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, <b>which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). The doubled term <i>ish ish</i> teaches that the offerings of a gentile are accepted, and the verse thereby teaches that <b>any</b> offering <b>that</b> gentiles volunteer to be <b>sacrificed should be a burnt offering.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a gentile who volunteered to bring a peace offering,</b> if he <b>gave it to an Israelite,</b> the <b>Israelite eats it;</b> if he <b>gave it to a priest, the priest eats it.</b> Evidently, the gentile’s peace offering is eaten, like the peace offering of a Jew.
To answer the challenge to Rav Huna’s statement, <b>Rava said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If a gentile volunteered a peace offering <b>in order to achieve atonement</b> on behalf of <b>an Israelite</b> who is already obligated to bring a peace offering, then <b>the Israelite eats</b> of the offering. If the gentile volunteered it <b>in order to achieve atonement</b> on behalf of <b>a priest</b> who is already obligated to bring a peace offering, then <b>the priest eats</b> of the offering. By contrast, Rav Huna’s statement teaches that when a gentile volunteers his own peace offering, it is treated as a burnt offering.
<b>Rav Sheizevi raises an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>These are the meal offerings</b> from which <b>a handful is removed and their remainder</b> is eaten <b>by the priests…the meal offering of gentiles.</b> If the priests may eat the remainder of the meal offerings of gentiles, it is logical that the peace offerings of gentiles should also be given to the priests to eat, as the right of the priests to eat from meal offerings and peace offerings is identical. To resolve this objection, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement in the mishna that the priests eat the meal offerings of gentiles is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> and <b>that</b> ruling of Rav Huna that the peace offerings of gentiles are not eaten is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse cited previously states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] who is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering.” The verse is now analyzed: The verse could have stated: <b>A man [<i>ish</i>]. Why</b> does <b>the verse state</b> the double expression <b>“<i>ish ish</i>”?</b> This serves <b>to include the gentiles,</b> demonstrating <b>that they can vow</b> to bring <b>vow offerings and gift offerings like a Jew</b> can.
When the verse states: <b>“Which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a gentile can vow to bring <b>a burnt offering. From where</b> is it derived that a gentile can vow to bring <b>a peace offering? The verse states: “Their vows.” From where</b> is it derived that he can bring <b>a thanks offering? The verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous clause: <b>“Their gift offerings.”</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the verse means <b>to include</b> that a gentile can bring <b>birds</b> as burnt offerings, <b>and wine</b> libations, <b>and the frankincense, and the wood</b> for the arrangement upon the altar? <b>The verse states</b> not only: <b>“Their vows,”</b> but also the more comprehensive term: <b>“Any of their vows”;</b> and the verse states not only: <b>“Their gift offerings,”</b> but also the more comprehensive term: <b>“Any of their gift offerings.”</b>
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “They will offer to the Lord as <b>a burnt offering”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: This teaches that a gentile can bring a standard <b>burnt offering,</b> to <b>the exclusion of</b> a burnt offering of <b>naziriteship.</b> Since a gentile is unable to assume the status of a nazirite, he is also unable to bring the offerings of a nazirite. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“Which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering,”</b> it indicates that <b>nothing other than a burnt offering alone</b> may be brought by a gentile.
With regard to the analysis of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the Gemara asks: <b>And this exclusion of</b> a burnt offering of <b>naziriteship,</b> is it <b>derived from here,</b> in the verse cited? Is it not <b>derived from there: “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When a man…shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite”</b> (Numbers 6:2); this is interpreted to mean that <b>the children of Israel</b> can <b>vow</b> to become nazirites, <b>but the gentiles cannot vow</b> to become nazirites? Therefore, the exclusion of gentiles from bringing the burnt offering of a nazirite is not learned from the term “a burnt offering.”
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the exclusion was derived <b>from there,</b> i.e., the verse in Leviticus, which is referring to offerings, <b>I would say:</b>It <b>is the offering</b> of nazirites <b>that</b> the gentiles <b>cannot bring, but naziriteship takes effect upon them</b> if they vow to become a nazirite. Therefore, the exclusion of naziriteship by the verse in Numbers <b>teaches us</b> that a gentile cannot become a nazirite at all.
§ The Gemara discusses a related matter. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:6): <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The court instituted seven ordinances</b> with regard to the financial aspects of offerings and consecrations. <b>And this</b> ordinance, namely, that the cost of the libations accompanying the sacrifice of a found sacrificial animal is borne by the public, <b>is one of them.</b> These are the other ordinances: If <b>a gentile sent his burnt offering from a country overseas,</b> and <b>he sent with it</b> money for the purchase of the <b>libations</b> that must accompany it, the libations <b>are offered at his</b> expense. <b>And if</b> the gentile did <b>not</b> cover the cost of the libations, it is a condition of the court that the libations are <b>sacrificed at the public’s</b> expense, with funds taken from the Temple treasury. Evidently, a gentile can offer libations as well as burnt offerings.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this mishna rules in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara rejects this assumption: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that this mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and he holds that a gentile can bring <b>a burnt offering and all its accessories,</b> including the libations.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to libations: “All who are <b>home born</b> shall do these things after this manner” (Numbers 15:13), which teaches that those who are <b>home born,</b> i.e., Jews, can <b>bring libations</b> as a separate offering, <b>but a gentile cannot bring</b> such <b>libations.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a gentile’s <b>burnt offering should not require</b> the standard accompanying <b>libations.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “So</b> it shall be done for one bull” (Numbers 15:11), which indicates that every offering requires libations. <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>not</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and not</b> that of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The Gemara explains the question: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, doesn’t he say</b> that a gentile may <b>even</b> bring <b>wine</b> by itself, and not only as a libation? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, doesn’t he say</b> that with regard to <b>a burnt offering, yes,</b> a gentile may bring it, but with regard to <b>something else</b> other than the offering itself, <b>no,</b> a gentile may not bring it?
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili; and if you wish, say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. If you wish, say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> and <b>omit from that</b> <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna</i> allows gentiles to bring <b>wine,</b> as he holds that gentiles cannot bring wine by itself. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and interpret his opinion to be that a gentile may bring <b>a burnt offering and all its accessories.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests,</b> a handful is removed, and the entire offering is sacrificed upon the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived?
The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states with regard to the meal offering of a sinner: “And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial of it, and burn it on the altar…it is a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin that he has sinned in any of these matters, and he shall be forgiven; and the remainder shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering” (Leviticus 5:12–13). Since the phrase <b>“And</b> the remainder <b>shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering”</b> is seemingly unnecessary, as these verses are discussing a meal offering, it therefore teaches <b>that its</b> sacrificial <b>rite would be valid</b> even when performed <b>by</b> a priest who has brought the offering for his own sin.
The <i>baraita</i> discusses the matter: <b>Do you say that</b> this verse teaches that <b>the rite</b> of the meal offering of a sinner <b>would be valid</b> when performed <b>by him? Or is it only</b> necessary <b>to permit</b> the eating of the remainder of the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests. And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse that states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16)? Perhaps that is referring to <b>his voluntary meal offering, but his obligatory</b> meal offering <b>may be eaten.</b>
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And it shall be the priest’s as the meal offering.”</b> In this way, the verse <b>compares</b> the priest’s <b>obligatory</b> offering <b>to his voluntary</b> offering: <b>Just as his voluntary</b> offering <b>is not eaten, so too, his obligatory</b> offering <b>is not eaten.</b> In disagreeing with the previous interpretation, <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Is it stated: And it shall be the priest’s, as his meal offering? But it states only: “As the meal offering,”</b> referring to the meal offering of a non-priest. <b>Rather,</b> this verse serves <b>to compare</b> and render the <i>halakha</i> of

Daf 74a

<b>the meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests</b> as <b>equivalent to</b> the status of <b>a meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by an Israelite. Just as</b> with regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by an Israelite, a handful is removed, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests, a handful is removed.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> challenges this: <b>If</b> so, then say as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by an Israelite, a handful is removed and its remainder is eaten, so too,</b> with regard to the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests, a handful</b> should be <b>removed and its remainder eaten.</b>
Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And the remainder shall be <b>the priest’s, as the meal offering,”</b> which is interpreted to mean that <b>with regard to</b> the rite performed by <b>the priest,</b> his meal offering is <b>like the meal offering</b> of the Israelite, <b>but</b> it is <b>not like the meal offering</b> of the Israelite with regard to consumption <b>by the fires</b> of the altar. <b>How</b> is <b>this</b> possible? In what ways does the meal offering of a priest resemble that of an Israelite in some respects and not in others? The priest’s <b>handful is sacrificed by itself,</b> like that of the Israelite, <b>and the remainder is sacrificed by itself,</b> unlike those of the Israelite, which are eaten.
§ According to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier, a priest may perform the rites of a meal offering of a sinner that he brings for himself based on the verse “And the remainder shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering.” The Gemara now asks: With regard to <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that its rite is valid</b> when performed <b>by him,</b> is it <b>derived from here?</b>
It is <b>derived from there,</b> another verse cited in a <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a priest that</b> he may <b>come and sacrifice his offerings at any time and at any hour that he desires,</b> even when it is not during the period of his priestly watch? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if a Levite comes from any of your gates from all of Israel, where he lives, <b>and comes with all the desire of his soul</b> to the place which the Lord shall choose, <b>then he shall serve</b> in the name of the Lord his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:6–7).
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> were derived <b>from there,</b> the verse in Deuteronomy, <b>I would say: This statement,</b> that a priest may perform his rites whenever he chooses, applies only to <b>a matter that does not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin,</b> as the verse is referring to an offering that he desires to bring. <b>But</b> with regard to a <b>matter that comes</b> to atone <b>for a sin, I would say</b> that he may <b>not</b> perform the rite himself. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> of the meal offering of a sinner must be derived from the verse in Leviticus: “And the remainder shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering.”
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that a priest may perform the rite of his own sin offering <b>also derived from here,</b> i.e., the verse: “And the remainder shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering”? It is <b>derived from there: “And the priest shall effect atonement for the soul that sins unwittingly, when he sins unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:28). The term “for the soul that sins unwittingly” <b>teaches that the priest</b> may <b>effect atonement</b> even <b>through himself,</b> when he performs the rite.
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> were derived <b>from that</b> latter verse, <b>I would say: This statement,</b> permitting him to effect his own atonement, applies when the offering is brought <b>for</b> a sin committed <b>unwittingly. But</b> with regard to an offering brought <b>for</b> a sin committed <b>intentionally,</b> the priest may <b>not</b> effect his own atonement. Therefore, the verse that states: “And the remainder shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering,” <b>teaches us</b> that the priest may perform the rite even for an offering that he brings for an intentional sin.
The Gemara clarifies: With regard to an offering brought <b>for</b> a sin committed <b>intentionally, how can you find these</b> circumstances? The Gemara answers: You can find them <b>in</b> the instance of a meal offering brought as atonement for <b>intentionally</b> taking a false <b>oath</b> of testimony that he was not aware of a certain incident involving another individual. The priest may perform the rites for a meal offering that he brings to atone for such a sin.
§ With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that a handful of the meal offering of a sinner brought by a priest is separated and offered upon the altar, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of <b>the priests, a handful is removed; and the handful is sacrificed by itself, and the remainder is sacrificed by itself. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: The handful is sacrificed by itself, and the remainder is scattered upon the place of the ashes.</b>
With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan discusses it</b> and asks: <b>To which place of the ashes</b> in the Temple is he referring? <b>If</b> he is referring to the one <b>that is above,</b> upon the altar, his opinion <b>is</b> identical to that of <b>his father,</b> Rabbi Shimon, who stated that the remainder is offered and burned upon the altar, after which the ashes are swept onto the ash heap upon the altar. If so, according to both opinions, the remainder is taken to the same place. And <b>if</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, is referring <b>to</b> the ash heap <b>that is below</b> the altar, that is difficult: Do <b>you have</b> any <b>item that is sacrificed below</b> the altar?
<b>Rabbi Abba said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>Perhaps</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, means that the remainder is scattered there <b>to be wasted.</b> When the Sages heard this, <b>they laughed at him,</b> saying: <b>But</b> do <b>you have</b> any <b>item that is sacrificed</b> as part of the Temple service in order <b>to be wasted?</b>
The Gemara answers that there are consecrated items that are intentionally wasted. With regard to such items, <b>the father of Rabbi Avin teaches: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). Why must this verse, which follows those discussing the High Priest’s daily griddle-cake offering, state that it shall not be eaten, after it already states that it is entirely offered? The verse teaches: <b>I have likened</b> the meal offering of a sinner brought by a priest to the daily griddle-cake offering brought by the High Priest <b>with regard to eating,</b> insofar as it is not eaten, <b>but</b> I have <b>not</b> likened it <b>with regard to another matter,</b> i.e., that the meal offering of a sinner is not burned in the manner of the griddle-cake offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying,</b> as the verse states explicitly that it must be entirely offered? <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is what</b> he <b>is saying:</b> This is how the verse is to be read: <b>“Every meal offering of the priest…shall not be eaten,”</b> when the offering is sacrificed to fulfill <b>his obligation,</b> such as the meal offering of a sinner. It is neither eaten nor completely burned, but rather placed on the ash heap. When the verse states: <b>“Shall be offered in its entirety,”</b> this is referring to <b>his gift</b> offering, which is completely burned in the manner of a griddle-cake offering. <b>Rava said to him:</b> This reading is like a <b>sharp knife cutting the verses</b> to pieces, as it interprets the beginning and end of the verse together, ignoring the middle.
<b>Rather, Rava says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“Every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety,”</b> this is referring to <b>his gift</b> offering, which is entirely offered. When the verse states that it <b>“shall not be eaten,”</b> this is referring to <b>his obligatory</b> meal offering, which is neither eaten nor entirely offered.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why should the verse be read that way? <b>I</b> can <b>reverse</b> the interpretation and say that the priest’s obligatory meal offering is entirely offered, and his gift offering shall be neither eaten nor entirely offered. The Gemara answers: It <b>stands to reason</b> that <b>his gift offering should be included</b> in the phrase “shall be offered in its entirety,” <b>as</b> it resembles the griddle-cake offering and differs from the meal offering of a sinner in several respects, namely, <b>that</b> it is <b>frequent,</b> that the priest bringing it <b>did not sin,</b> and that <b>its scent is fragrant,</b> as it is mixed with oil, and frankincense is added to it.
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> the verse <b>should</b> be interpreted <b>to include his obligatory</b> meal offering, <b>as</b> the obligatory meal offering is similar to the griddle-cake offering in that, unlike the gift offering, it comprises <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah and bringing it is <b>an obligation.</b> The Gemara responds: Because <b>these</b> similarities between the gift offering and the griddle-cake offering <b>are</b> more <b>numerous</b> than those between the obligatory offering and the griddle-cake offering, it is logical that the verse is comparing the gift offering to the griddle-cake offering.
§ After discussing the opinions of Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that no handful is removed from any of the meal offerings of the priests, with regard to <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten,” what do they do with it?</b> How do they interpret the superfluous phrase: “It shall not be eaten”?
The Gemara answers: <b>They require it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning the griddle-cake offering, the verse states: “It shall be entirely smoked for the Lord” (Leviticus 6:15). From this verse and the verse that follows it, which states: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the griddle-cake offering mentioned <b>above,</b> in the first verse, is subject <b>to: “It shall be entirely smoked,” and</b> that other meal offerings of priests mentioned <b>below,</b> in the second verse, are subject <b>to: “It shall not be eaten.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to apply</b> the prohibition <b>that was said about this</b> case <b>to that</b> case, <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>that was said about that</b> case <b>to this</b> case, to teach that the priests’ meal offerings shall be entirely smoked and the griddle-cake offering shall not be eaten? <b>The verse states: “Entirely,”</b> in the first verse, and: <b>“Entirely,”</b> in the second, to be utilized <b>as a verbal analogy: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the priests’ meal offerings: <b>“Entirely,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“Entirely.”</b>
<b>Just as there,</b> the offering is subject <b>to</b> the prohibition of: <b>“It shall be entirely smoked,” so too here,</b> the offerings are subject <b>to</b> the prohibition of: <b>“It shall be entirely smoked.” And just as here,</b> with regard to the meal offering of the priest, the verse serves <b>to impose a prohibition upon eating it, so too there,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering, the verse serves <b>to impose a prohibition upon eating it.</b>
§ With regard to the prohibition against eating from certain offerings derived from the verse that states: “Shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten,” <b>Ravina asks:</b> In the case of <b>a priest who ate from the sacrificial portions, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? As to whether this priest violates <b>the prohibition of a non-priest</b> eating certain types of sacrificial meat, expressed in the verse: “No non-priest shall eat of the sacrificial meat” (Leviticus 22:10),

Daf 74b

<b>I do not raise the dilemma. When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is with regard to the <b>prohibition of: “Shall be offered in its entirety;</b> it shall not be eaten.” <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this prohibition applicable only to the meal offering of a priest mentioned in the verse, or does it apply to a priest who eats from the sacrificial portions as well?
<b>Rav Aharon said to Ravina: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to this question from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> sacrificial item, not just the meal offering of a priest, such as the sacrificial portions, <b>which is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>“shall be offered in its entirety”</b> that requires it to be burned, the verse serves <b>to impose a prohibition against eating it.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The meal offering of priests, the meal offering of the anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>and the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> that accompany burnt offerings and peace offerings are burned in their entirety <b>on the altar, and there is no</b> part <b>of them for the priests. And in</b> the case of those offerings, <b>the power of the altar is greater than the power of the priests. The two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on Shavuot of two loaves baked from new wheat, <b>and the shewbread,</b> i.e., the twelve loaves that were placed on the sacred Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, <b>are eaten by the priests, and there is no part of them</b> burned <b>on the altar. And in</b> the case of those offerings, <b>the power of the priests is greater than the power of the altar.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no additional</b> cases of sacrificial items that are completely placed on the altar, with none of their parts given to the priests? <b>But isn’t there the burnt offering,</b> which is completely burned on the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> the burnt offering’s <b>hide,</b> which is given <b>to the priests.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there the bird</b> sacrificed as <b>a burnt offering,</b> whose skin is not given to the priests? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> the bird burnt offering’s <b>crop and its feathers,</b> which are not burned upon the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b> wine <b>libations,</b> which are completely poured onto the altar? The Gemara answers: The libations <b>go to the drainpipes,</b> and pouring the wine into the drainpipes is not considered placing it upon the altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is meant when the mishna emphasizes: <b>And in</b> the case of those offerings, the power of the altar is greater than the power of the priests, indicating that there are other items that one might have thought are burned entirely on the altar as well? The Gemara answers: The mishna’s wording serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: One who donates wine brings it and pours it over the fires</b> of the altar, such that it is offered in the manner of an animal offering and not as a libation. Therefore, the mishna’s wording <b>teaches us that</b> wine donated in this manner <b>goes to the drainpipes,</b> unlike according to the opinion of Shmuel that it is entirely burned.
The Gemara adds: With regard to another ruling, the mishna <b>supports</b> a different statement <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel said: One who donates oil</b> to the Temple <b>removes a handful</b> and sacrifices it on the altar, <b>and its remainder is eaten</b> by the priests. Shmuel’s ruling is in accordance with the mishna, which does not list a donation of oil as one of the offerings given completely to the altar.
§ According to the mishna, with regard to <b>the two loaves and the shewbread,</b> the power of the priests is greater than the power of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> cases of sacrificial items that are given completely to the priests, with none of their parts placed upon the altar? <b>But isn’t there the bird</b> sacrificed as a <b>sin offering,</b> which is eaten entirely by the priests, and none of it is placed upon the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>There is its blood,</b> which is sprinkled upon the altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the <b><i>log</i> of oil of a leper</b> that he brings on the day that he becomes ritually clean, which is given completely to the priests? The Gemara answers: It is not given completely to the priests, as <b>there are its placements,</b> when oil is sprinkled seven times “before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16), and applied to the leper’s right ear, thumb, and big toe (see Leviticus 14:17).
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is meant when the mishna emphasizes: <b>And in</b> the case of those offerings, the power of the priests is greater than the power of the altar? The Gemara answers: This wording serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says: The two loaves that are brought by themselves,</b> unaccompanied by the requisite two lambs, may not be offered, and instead of being eaten <b>they go to be burned.</b> By emphasizing that the two loaves and the shewbread are eaten by the priests and not placed on the altar, the mishna <b>teaches us that in this</b> case, <b>the power of the priests is always greater,</b> even if the two lambs are not offered with the two loaves.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal offerings that are prepared in a vessel,</b> e.g., the offerings prepared in a pan or deep pan, <b>require three placements of oil,</b> listed here in the reverse order of their placement: <b>Pouring</b> oil on the cakes after they have been cooked, <b>and mixing</b> oil into the flour, <b>and placement of oil into the vessel prior to preparation</b> of the meal offerings.
In the meal offerings that come as loaves, it is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that one breaks them into pieces and <b>mixes them</b> with oil; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is with <b>fine flour</b> that one mixes the oil. Although <b>the loaves</b> of the meal offering baked in an oven <b>require mixing</b> of their flour with oil, <b>wafers</b> do not require mixing, but rather a <b>smearing</b> of oil on them after baking. <b>How does one smear</b> oil on <b>them?</b> He does so in a shape <b>similar</b> to the Greek letter <b>chi,</b> Χ, <b>and the rest</b> of the oil remaining after smearing is <b>eaten by priests.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that all the meal offerings prepared in a vessel require three placements of oil, the Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> does the mishna specify: Meal offerings prepared in a vessel? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the oven-<b>baked meal offering,</b> whose preparation does not require the use of a service vessel, as it is merely baked in an oven. Such a meal offering does not require the pouring of the oil.
With regard to the three placements of oil in a pan meal offering and a deep-pan meal offering, <b>the Sages taught</b> that the verse states: <b>“And if your offering is a deep-pan meal offering, it shall be made of fine flour in oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:7). This <b>teaches that it requires</b> the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>vessel,</b> and the flour is added afterward. In addition, the term <b>“your offering”</b> in this verse and the term <b>“your offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:5), written with regard to the meal offering prepared in a pan, are understood <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy:</b>

Daf 75a

<b>Just as here,</b> with regard to the deep-pan meal offering, the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>utensil</b> is required, to which the flour is added only afterward, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>utensil</b> is required. <b>And just as there,</b> with regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, <b>pouring and mixing</b> are required, as the verse states: “Mixed with oil…and pour oil upon it” (Leviticus 2:5–6), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the deep-pan meal offering, <b>pouring and mixing</b> are required.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to meal offerings that come as loaves, i.e., those prepared in a shallow pan or deep pan or those baked in an oven, it is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that one breaks them into pieces and <b>mixes them</b> with oil; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is with <b>fine flour,</b> before the baking, that one mixes the oil.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, the verse states: “It shall be of <b>fine flour</b> unleavened, <b>mixed</b> with oil.” This <b>teaches that it is mixed</b> while still <b>flour. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that he <b>mixes them, as it is stated:</b> “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened <b>loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). The Rabbis <b>said to him: But is it not with regard to loaves of a thanks offering</b> that <b>it is stated:</b> “Unleavened <b>loaves</b> mixed with oil…and loaves mixed with oil, of fine flour soaked” (Leviticus 7:12), <b>and it is not possible to mix them when they are loaves,</b> but <b>only</b> when they are <b>fine flour?</b>
The Gemara explains the procedure of mixing the oven-baked meal offerings according to the Rabbis. <b>How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the rite? He <b>places oil in a utensil before</b> the placement of the flour <b>is done, and</b> then he <b>places</b> the flour into the utensil. <b>And he</b> then <b>places oil upon it and mixes it, and kneads it</b> in lukewarm water, <b>and bakes it</b> in a shallow pan or a deep pan, in accordance with his vow. <b>And</b> then <b>he breaks it</b> into pieces, <b>and he</b> again <b>places oil upon</b> the pieces, which constitutes the required pouring, <b>and</b> he <b>removes a handful</b> for the altar.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> After the meal offerings have been baked into <b>loaves,</b> one breaks them into pieces and <b>mixes them</b> with oil, <b>as it is stated: “Loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed with oil.” How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the rite? He <b>places oil in a utensil before</b> the placement of the flour <b>is done, and</b> then he <b>places</b> the flour into the utensil. <b>And</b> then <b>he kneads it</b> in lukewarm water, <b>and bakes it</b> in a shallow pan or deep pan, <b>and breaks</b> the loaves into pieces, <b>and places oil upon the</b> pieces <b>and mixes</b> them, <b>and again places oil upon</b> the pieces, which constitutes the pouring of the oil, <b>and removes a handful</b> to be burned on the altar.
The Gemara asks: With regard to the difficulty that <b>it is not possible</b> to mix them when they are loaves, <b>which the Rabbis said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what</b> is <b>it</b> that makes it impossible? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says:</b> Since only <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of oil is</b> used, <b>how could it be divided among a number of loaves?</b> As this is not sufficient oil to mix with baked offerings, it must be that the oil is mixed with the unbaked flour.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The loaves</b> of the meal offering baked in an oven <b>require mixing</b> of their flour with oil, <b>and wafers</b> require only <b>smearing. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse specifies with regard to the oven-baked meal offering: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened <b>loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). This indicates that only the loaves are mixed, <b>but the wafers are not mixed.</b> This derivation is necessary, as one <b>might</b> have thought: Could the opposite conclusion <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference? And if loaves, which do not require smearing,</b> do <b>require mixing,</b> then <b>is it not logical</b> that <b>wafers, which require smearing,</b> also <b>require mixing?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “Loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed,” but wafers are not mixed.</b>
With regard to wafers, the same verse teaches that <b>wafers are smeared</b> with oil, <b>but loaves are not smeared.</b> This derivation is necessary, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: Could the opposite conclusion <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference,</b> namely: <b>And if wafers, which do not require mixing,</b> do <b>require smearing,</b> then <b>is it not logical</b> that <b>loaves, which require mixing,</b> also <b>require smearing?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states</b> that <b>wafers are smeared</b> with oil, <b>but loaves are not smeared.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> Why are the terms “mixed” and “smeared” not interpreted to be referring to both varieties of oven-baked meal offerings? The Gemara answers: <b>Rava said:</b> If this were the intention, then the Torah <b>should not omit</b> this description completely, <b>and let it write</b> in some other verse: <b>Smeared loaves and mixed wafers.</b> The fact that the Torah never describes the loaves as smeared and wafers as mixed indicates that loaves are not smeared and wafers are not mixed.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How does one smear</b> oil on <b>them?</b> He does so in a shape <b>similar</b> to <b>chi, and the rest</b> of the oil <b>is eaten</b> by priests. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Similar</b> to <b>chi? Rav Kahana said:</b> It is smeared in a shape <b>similar</b> to the <b>Greek</b> letter <b>chi,</b> Χ.
§ Concerning the mixing of oil into the loaves and the smearing of oil upon the wafers, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: An oven-baked <b>meal offering that comes as half loaves and half wafers,</b> i.e., five of each, may be brought according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who does not require ten items of a uniform type. How is the oil applied to this offering? According to one opinion, he <b>brings a <i>log</i> of oil,</b> which is the requisite quantity to accompany a tenth of an ephah of flour, <b>and divides it into two</b> parts. <b>Half of</b> the oil is used <b>for</b> the <b>loaves, and half of</b> the oil is used <b>for</b> the <b>wafers.</b>
As for <b>the loaves,</b> he <b>mixes them</b> with the oil, <b>and</b> as for <b>the wafers,</b> he <b>smears</b> them. <b>And</b> he <b>smears</b> the oil on <b>the wafer over the entire surface,</b> not in the shape of the letter chi, <b>and he returns the rest of the oil to</b> mix into <b>the loaves. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> He <b>smears them</b> in a shape <b>similar</b> to the letter <b>chi, and the rest</b> of the oil <b>is eaten by the priests.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: In the case of ten <b>wafers that come by themselves</b> as a meal offering baked in the oven, and not as part of another offering, he <b>brings a <i>log</i> of oil and smears them, and he again smears them</b> repeatedly <b>until all the oil in the <i>log</i> is finished. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> He <b>smears them</b> in a shape <b>similar</b> to the letter <b>chi, and the rest of the oil is eaten by the priests.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal offerings that are prepared in a vessel require breaking</b> into pieces.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> does the mishna state that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to meal offerings prepared in vessels? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna serves <b>to exclude the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on Shavuot of two loaves baked from new wheat, <b>and the shewbread,</b> the twelve loaves that were placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat. Since these are baked in an oven and not prepared in vessels, they do not require breaking into pieces.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse discussing a meal offering prepared in a pan states: <b>“You shall break it in pieces,</b> and pour oil upon it; it is <b>a meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:6). The fact that the verse concludes with the phrase: “It is a meal offering,” indicates that the Torah means <b>to include all the meal offerings</b> in the requirement <b>of breaking</b> into pieces. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the two loaves and the shewbread.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall break <b>it</b> in pieces”; i.e., the meal offering baked in a pan, but not the two loaves and the shewbread.
The <i>baraita</i> continues that the same verse states: <b>“And you shall pour oil</b> upon it; it is <b>a meal offering.”</b> The fact that the verse concludes with the phrase “It is a meal offering” indicates that the Torah means <b>to include all the meal offerings</b> in the requirement <b>of pouring.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the</b> oven-<b>baked meal offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall pour <b>oil upon it,”</b> i.e., upon this meal offering, but not upon the oven-baked meal offering.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Perhaps <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the loaves</b> from the requirement of pouring, <b>but I should not exclude the wafers.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It</b> is a meal offering,” indicating that wafers are also excluded. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation,</b> by which the term “it” excludes wafers specifically? Perhaps <b>I will say:</b> The term serves <b>to exclude the meal offering of priests</b> from the requirement of pouring.

Daf 75b

<b>Rabba says:</b> This is the reason that wafers are also excluded from the mitzva of pouring, while a meal offering brought by a priest is not excluded: The verse uses two expressions of exclusion: “Upon it,” and: “It is a meal offering.” <b>What is the matter that requires two exclusions? You must say: It is the</b> oven-<b>baked meal offering,</b> of which there are two types of offerings: Wafers and loaves.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In breaking <b>the meal offering of an Israelite</b> into pieces, the priest <b>folds [<i>kofel</i>] one</b> into two <b>and two into four and separates</b> it at the folds. In breaking into pieces <b>the meal offering of priests,</b> the priest <b>folds one into two and two into four and does not separate</b> it at the folds. Because no handful is removed, separation is unnecessary. In the case of the griddle-cake <b>meal offering of the anointed priest, he would not fold it. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In neither <b>the meal offering of priests nor the meal offering of the anointed priest is there breaking</b> into pieces, <b>because in</b> those meal offerings <b>there is no removal of a handful. And any</b> meal offering <b>in which there is no removal of a handful there is no breaking</b> into pieces. <b>And</b> in <b>all</b> meal offerings that are broken into pieces, the priest <b>breaks them</b> into <b>olive-bulk-</b>sized pieces.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the difference between the meal offering of an Israelite and that of a priest detailed in the mishna, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall break</b> it in pieces” (Leviticus 2:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that it should be broken <b>into</b> only <b>two</b> pieces. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Break it in <b>pieces,”</b> indicating that each of these two pieces is subsequently broken into more pieces. <b>If</b> the Torah requires <b>pieces,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should</b> repeatedly break it into pieces until he <b>renders it</b> into <b>crumbs.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Break <b>it,”</b> i.e., break <b>it in pieces, and</b> do <b>not</b> break <b>its pieces into</b> additional <b>pieces.</b>
<b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>the meal offering of an Israelite,</b> the priest <b>folds one into two and two into four and separates</b> the pieces. In breaking into pieces <b>the meal offering of priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> the priest <b>folds it</b> into two, as it is stated: “In broken pieces you shall sacrifice the offering” (Leviticus 6:14). The Gemara asks: With regard to the meal offering of the anointed priest, <b>didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>He would not fold it? Rabba says:</b> He <b>does not fold it into four,</b> as it does not use the doubled phrase: “You shall break it in pieces [<i>patot otah pitim</i>],” <b>but</b> he does <b>fold it into two.</b>
The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In neither <b>the meal offering of priests nor the meal offering of the anointed priest is there breaking</b> into pieces…and in all meal offerings that are broken into pieces, one breaks them into olive-bulk pieces. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Over <b>this cooked dish, which contains pieces</b> of bread that are the size of <b>an olive-bulk,</b> before eating it <b>one recites upon it</b> the blessing of: <b>Who brings forth bread from the earth.</b> Over that same cooked dish, <b>if it does not contain pieces</b> of bread that are the size of <b>an olive-bulk,</b> before eating it <b>one recites upon it</b> the blessing of: <b>Who creates the various kinds of nourishment.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The first time an Israelite <b>would stand and</b> instruct a priest to <b>sacrifice meal offerings in Jerusalem</b> on his behalf, he would <b>recite: Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, <b>Who has given us life and sustained us</b> and brought us to this time, as it is the first time that the Israelite fulfills the mitzva of bringing that offering. Following the removal of the handful, when the priest <b>would take</b> the meal offerings in order <b>to eat them, he would</b> first <b>recite</b> the blessing of: <b>Who brings forth bread from the earth. And we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> in <b>all</b> meal offerings that are broken into pieces, the priest breaks them into <b>pieces</b> the size <b>of an olive-bulk.</b> This proves that over pieces of bread that are the volume of an olive-bulk, one recites the blessing of: Who brings forth bread from the earth.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>But according to the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, who said</b> with regard to meal offerings: <b>He crushes them</b> continuously <b>until he restores them to</b> the form they had when <b>they</b> were <b>flour,</b> would you say <b>that so too,</b> in that case, one who eats a meal offering so prepared <b>does not recite</b> the blessing of: <b>Who brings forth</b> bread from the earth?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> one does not recite that blessing over these meal offerings, that is difficult: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gathered</b> a portion the volume of <b>an olive-bulk from all of</b> the crumbs of the meal offerings <b>and ate it, if it was</b> an offering of <b>leavened bread</b> like that of a thanks offering, and he ate it on Passover, his act is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>. If</b> it <b>was</b> an offering <b>of unleavened bread, a person fulfills his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover through</b> the consumption of those pieces. This indicates that pieces of bread, regardless of their volume, are always considered bread.
Rav Yosef answered him that this is not the <i>halakha</i>, and one does not recite a blessing over crumbs of bread as he would over actual bread. Rather, <b>what are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> one kneaded the crumbs of bread together and <b>pressed them [<i>beshe’eirsan</i>]</b> into a single mass.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so, that which is taught about</b> the ruling in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>when he ate</b> all of the crumbs that constitute the volume of an olive-bulk <b>in</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf [<i>peras</i>]</b> of bread, is difficult. As, <b>if</b> it is a case <b>where he pressed them</b> into a single mass, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> taught: <b>When he ate it,</b> in the singular, as it is a single item. <b>Rather, what are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the crumbs <b>came from a large</b> loaf of <b>bread.</b> Although the crumbs themselves are each smaller than an olive-bulk, since they were broken from a large loaf, they are considered significant.
The Gemara asks: With regard to the blessing recited on the cooked dish with pieces less than an olive-bulk in volume, <b>what</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it? Rav Sheshet says: Even</b> when eating <b>pieces</b> of bread <b>that do not have</b> the volume of <b>an olive-bulk,</b> one recites the blessing of: Who brings forth bread from the earth. <b>Rava said: And</b> this <b>is</b> limited to a case <b>where</b> the crumbs still <b>have the appearance [<i>torita</i>] of bread,</b> and they did not dissolve completely.

Daf 76a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal offerings require rubbing three hundred</b> times <b>and striking five hundred</b> times with one’s fist or palm. <b>Rubbing and striking</b> are performed <b>on the wheat</b> kernels to remove their husks prior to grinding them into flour. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says:</b> They are performed <b>on the dough</b> to ensure a smooth product. <b>All of the meal offerings come</b> as <b>ten</b> loaves or <b>ten</b> wafers from each one tenth of an ephah of flour, <b>except for the shewbread and the griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest, which come</b> as <b>twelve</b> loaves or wafers; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: They all come</b> as <b>twelve</b> loaves <b>except for</b> the four types of <b>loaves</b> that accompany <b>the thanks offering and</b> the two types of loaves that accompany the peace offering of <b>naziriteship, which come</b> as <b>ten each.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the rubbing and striking are done in the following manner: He <b>rubs once</b> and <b>strikes twice.</b> Then he <b>rubs twice</b> and <b>strikes three</b> times. This sequence is repeated one hundred times, so that he rubs three hundred times and strikes five hundred times. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma</b> with regard to the rubbing: Is the rubbing of the hand <b>back and forth</b> over the surface of the item considered <b>one</b> rubbing, <b>or</b> is <b>perhaps</b> rubbing <b>back and forth</b> considered <b>two</b> distinct rubbings? <b>What</b> is the correct count? The Gemara states: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rubbing and striking</b> are performed <b>on the wheat</b> kernels, while <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> They are performed <b>on the dough.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does Rabbi Yosei mean that these actions are performed <b>on the dough and not on the wheat</b> kernels? <b>Or perhaps</b> he means that they are performed not only on the kernels but <b>also on the dough.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rubbing and striking</b> are performed <b>on the wheat</b> kernels. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Rubbing and striking</b> are performed <b>on the dough.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>all of the meal offerings come</b> as ten loaves or wafers, except for the shewbread and the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which come as <b>twelve</b> loaves or wafers. The Gemara examines the sources for these exceptions: With regard to <b>the shewbread, it is written explicitly of it:</b> “And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes of it” (Leviticus 24:5).
That the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest</b> is also offered as twelve units is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy of the word “obligation,” written in the context of the verse discussing the <b>shewbread.</b> With regard to the griddle-cake offering, the verse states: “And the anointed priest…shall offer it; it is an <b>obligation</b> forever” (Leviticus 6:15), and the verse states with regard to the twelve loaves of the shewbread: “And it shall be for Aaron and his sons…a perpetual <b>obligation”</b> (Leviticus 24:9).
§ The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Yehuda, who states in the mishna with regard to <b>all the meal offerings that they come</b> as <b>ten</b> loaves or <b>ten</b> wafers, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that he <b>derives</b> it <b>from the loaves of the thanks offering. Just as there,</b> there are <b>ten</b> loaves, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to all other meal offerings, there are <b>ten</b> loaves. The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him derive it from the shewbread: Just as there,</b> there are <b>twelve</b> loaves, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to all other meal offerings, there must be <b>twelve.</b>
The Gemara explains: It <b>stands to reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the other meal offerings <b>from the loaves of the thanks offering, as</b> the other meal offerings resemble the loaves of the thanks offering and differ from the shewbread in several respects: They are offered by <b>an individual</b> and not by the public; they are brought by <b>one who donates</b> and not as obligatory offerings; <b>oil</b> is used in their preparation; they are <b>disqualified</b> when left overnight, whereas, by contrast, the rite of the shewbread demands that it be left on the Table for eight days; they are <b>not</b> brought <b>on the Sabbath,</b> unlike the shewbread, whose rite is performed on the Sabbath; <b>and</b> they are <b>not</b> brought <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> unlike the shewbread, which is brought even in a state of impurity.
The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the other meal offerings <b>from the shewbread, as</b> they resemble the shewbread in several respects: They are <b>consecrated</b> property of the most sacred order, whereas the loaves of the thanks offering are of lesser sanctity; <b>and</b> they are brought with <b>frankincense,</b> whereas the loaves of the thanks offering are not; they are brought only as <b>unleavened bread,</b> whereas the loaves of the thanks offering include some leavened bread; <b>and</b> each is brought as an offering by <b>itself,</b> whereas the loaves of the thanks offering are brought together with an animal sacrifice.
The Gemara explains: <b>These</b> analogies between other meal offerings and the loaves of the thanks offering <b>are</b> more <b>numerous</b> than the analogies between other meal offerings and the shewbread. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> of other meal offerings is derived from the loaves of the thanks offering.
The Gemara posited previously that according to Rabbi Yehuda, a verbal analogy teaches that, like the shewbread, the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest is brought as twelve units. The Gemara asks: <b>And if we hold</b> that <b>a matter learned through a verbal analogy may subsequently teach as a paradigm, let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the other meal offerings <b>from the griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest: Just as there,</b> the meal <b>offering</b> comprises <b>twelve</b> units, <b>so too here,</b> other meal offerings should consist of <b>twelve</b> units.
The Gemara responds: It <b>stands to reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>should derive</b> their <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the loaves of the thanks offering, as</b> the other meal offerings resemble the loaves of the thanks offering and differ from the griddle-cake offering in several respects: They are brought by <b>an ordinary</b> person and not by the High Priest; they are brought by <b>one who donates</b> and not as obligatory offerings; and they are only brought whole, while the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering is brought in <b>halves,</b> half in the morning and half in the afternoon.
In addition, they are disqualified <b>as <i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., when they are sacrificed with the intent to be consumed after their appointed time, unlike the griddle-cake offering, which is not eaten at all; they are <b>not</b> brought <b>on the Sabbath,</b> unlike the griddle-cake offering; <b>and</b> they are <b>not</b> brought <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> whereas the griddle-cake offering is brought by the High Priest even while impure.
The Gemara challenges: <b>On the contrary,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>should have derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the other meal offerings <b>from the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, <b>as</b> the other meal offerings resemble the griddle-cake offering in several respects: They both contain <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour, whereas the loaves of the thanks offering contain several tenths of an ephah; they are consecrated when placed in a service <b>vessel,</b> whereas the loaves of the thanks offering are consecrated when the thanks offering is slaughtered; they are <b>consecrated</b> property of the most sacred order, whereas the loaves of the thanks offering are of lesser sanctity; <b>and</b> they are brought with <b>frankincense,</b> whereas the loaves of the thanks offering are not.
In addition, they are brought only of <b>unleavened bread,</b> whereas the loaves of the thanks offering include some leavened bread; <b>and</b> each is brought as an offering <b>itself,</b> whereas the loaves of the thanks offering are brought together with an animal sacrifice; part of their rite is <b>bringing</b> them <b>near</b> the southwest corner of the altar, unlike the loaves of the thanks offering; <b>and</b> parts or all of them are placed on <b>the fires of the altar,</b> unlike the loaves of the thanks offering. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> indeed, <b>these</b> similarities between other meal offerings and the griddle-cake offering <b>are</b> more <b>numerous</b> than the similarities between other meal offerings and the loaves of the thanks offering. Therefore, it seems more appropriate to derive the number of loaves from the griddle-cake offering.
The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, Rabbi Yehuda <b>prefers</b> to learn the <i>halakha</i> of the other meal offerings, which are brought by <b>an ordinary</b> person, <b>from</b> the loaves of the thanks offering, which are brought by <b>an ordinary</b> person.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says: They all come</b> as <b>twelve</b> loaves. The Gemara explains: <b>What does</b> he <b>hold? If he holds that a matter learned through a verbal analogy</b> is <b>subsequently</b> used to <b>teach as a paradigm,</b> he <b>derives</b> the number of loaves in other meal offerings <b>from the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, which was itself derived from a verbal analogy, <b>as these</b> similarities between other meal offerings and the griddle-cake offering enumerated above <b>are</b> more <b>numerous.</b>
And <b>if he holds that a matter learned through a verbal analogy is not subsequently</b> used to <b>teach as a paradigm,</b> then he <b>derives</b> the number of loaves in other meal offerings <b>from</b> the twelve loaves of <b>the shewbread.</b> This is because Rabbi Meir <b>prefers</b> to derive the status of the other meal offerings, which are <b>consecrated</b> property of the highest order, <b>from</b> the shewbread, which is also <b>consecrated</b> property of the highest order, in contrast to the loaves of the thanks offering, which are of lesser sanctity.
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Meir says: They all come as twelve loaves <b>except for</b> the <b>loaves</b> of the <b>thanks offering and</b> the loaves that accompany the guilt offering of <b>naziriteship, which come</b> as <b>ten each.</b> The Gemara explains the exceptions: With regard to <b>the loaves of the thanks offering, it is written explicitly of them</b> that these loaves are brought in units of ten, based on a verbal analogy: With regard to the thanks offering, the verse states: “And of it he shall present one out of each offering for a gift [<i>teruma</i>] to the Lord” (Leviticus 7:14), and with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe it is stated: “You shall set apart of it a gift [<i>teruma</i>] for the Lord, a tithe of the tithe” (Numbers 18:26). Just as the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe consists of one portion of ten, so too, the loaves of the thanks offering are brought in units of ten (see 77b).
That ten loaves accompany the guilt offering of <b>naziriteship</b> is derived from a verse, <b>as the Master says:</b> The verse describing the thanks offering states: “With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving” (Leviticus 7:13). The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of the <b>peace offering of the nazirite.</b> Just as each of the four varieties of loaves accompanying the thanks offering are brought in units of ten loaves, so too, the peace offering of the nazirite comprises ten loaves.
§ The loaves of the thanks offering consist of ten of each of the following four types: Leavened loaves, unleavened wafers, standard unleavened loaves, and unleavened loaves made from flour mixed with water and oil. With regard to these loaves, <b>Rav Tovi bar Kisna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>loaves of</b> the <b>thanks offering that one baked as</b> only <b>four loaves,</b> one of each of the four types, where each loaf is the size of ten loaves, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> do <b>we</b> not <b>require forty</b> loaves? The Gemara answers: Forty loaves are brought in order <b>to</b> fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, but he has nevertheless fulfilled his obligation with four loaves, one of each type.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But</b> an individual who brings the loaves as an offering <b>is required to separate <i>teruma</i> from them</b> by designating one loaf of each type to be given to the priests, which cannot be done where only one loaf of each type exists. <b>And if you would say that he</b> may <b>separate</b> a tenth-sized piece <b>from each and every</b> loaf, that is difficult: Doesn’t <b>the Merciful One state:</b> “And of it he shall present <b>one</b> out of each offering for a gift [<i>teruma</i>] to the Lord,” which teaches <b>that he may not take sliced</b> bread, but rather a whole loaf? The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where he separated it while kneading,</b> so that it is not considered separating a slice.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All the meal offerings where</b> one <b>increased the measure of their loaves or where</b> one <b>decreased the measure of their loaves</b> are nevertheless <b>fit, except for the</b> twelve loaves of <b>shewbread, and the</b> twelve loaves of the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, <b>and</b> the ten <b>loaves</b> of each variety for the <b>thanks offering and</b> the ten loaves that accompany the guilt offering of <b>naziriteship.</b> Evidently, no fewer than forty loaves are fit for the thanks offering, in contradiction to the statement of Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>He</b>

Daf 76b

<b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All the meal offerings where</b> one <b>increased the measure of their loaves or where</b> one <b>decreased the measure of their loaves</b> are nevertheless <b>fit, except for</b> the twelve loaves of <b>the shewbread and</b> the twelve loaves of <b>the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering. <b>And some say: Even the</b> ten <b>loaves</b> of each variety <b>of the thanks offering and</b> the ten loaves that accompany the guilt offering of <b>naziriteship</b> are fit only when brought in their prescribed measures. Shmuel agrees with the first <i>tanna</i>, according to whom the loaves of the thanks offering and the loaves of naziriteship are fit even when not offered in the proper quantities.
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to an oven-<b>baked meal offering that</b> one <b>baked</b> as only <b>one loaf,</b> although he did not bring the mandated quantity, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is that the verse states with regard to the oven-baked meal offering: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour” (Leviticus 2:4). The term <b>“unleavened loaves [<i>matzot</i>]” is written</b> without the letter <i>vav</i>, which is generally used with regard to the plural form. Therefore, it may be read in the singular as <b>unleavened loaf [<i>matzat</i>],</b> which teaches that even one unleavened loaf is fit.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> derivation: <b>The reason</b> Rav Huna gives is <b>that it is written</b> in the singular form of <b><i>matzat</i>. But</b> if it were <b>written: <i>Matzot</i>,</b> would this <b>not</b> be the <i>halakha</i>? <b>But</b> what about the verse <b>concerning the loaves of the thanks offering, where it is written “<i>matzot</i>”</b> with a <i>vav</i>, indicating the plural form, in the verse: “Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened loaves mixed with oil” (Leviticus 7:12), <b>and</b> yet <b>Rav Tovi bar Kisna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> In the case of <b>loaves of the thanks offering that were baked as four loaves,</b> such that each of the four varieties of loaves is baked as only one loaf, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> statement of Shmuel <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion of Rav Huna, according to whom four loaves are not fit for the thanks offering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The <i>omer</i> offering,</b> i.e., the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>would come</b> from <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour sifted <b>from three <i>se’a</i></b> of barley. <b>The two loaves</b> would come from <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour sifted <b>from three <i>se’a</i></b> of wheat. <b>The shewbread</b> would come from <b>twenty-four tenths</b> of an ephah of flour sifted <b>from twenty-four <i>se’a</i></b> of wheat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that according to the mishna, the relatively large amount of three <i>se’a</i> of barley is necessary to yield a single tenth of an ephah of flour for the <i>omer</i> offering? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> it <b>comes from</b> the fresh <b>new</b> crop, which contains a large amount of refuse, <b>and</b> it <b>comes from barley,</b> which is coarser than wheat, <b>a choice tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>comes only from</b> a minimum of <b>three <i>se’a</i></b> of barley.
The Gemara asks: Why does the mishna rule that <b>the two loaves</b> would come from <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour sifted <b>from three <i>se’a</i></b> of wheat, whereas only a tenth of an ephah is used from the same amount of grain for the <i>omer</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the loaves <b>come from wheat,</b> which is of superior quality to barley, <b>although</b> they <b>come from</b> the <b>new</b> crop and require sifting, the grains are clean enough that <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah <b>come from</b> the sifting of <b>three <i>se’a</i></b> of grain.
The mishna stated that <b>the shewbread</b> would come from <b>twenty-four tenths</b> of an ephah of flour sifted <b>from twenty-four <i>se’a</i></b> of wheat. <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> they <b>come from wheat, and</b> they <b>come from</b> the <b>old</b> crop, which contains relatively little refuse, the grains are so clean that <b>a choice tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>comes from one <i>se’a</i></b> of grain, and twenty-four tenths of an ephah come from twenty-four <i>se’a</i>.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All the meal offerings where</b> one <b>increased the measure of their tenth</b> of an ephah of flour by collecting it with a vessel larger than a tenth of an ephah, <b>or where</b> one <b>decreased the measure of</b> their <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour by collecting it with a vessel smaller than a tenth of an ephah, <b>are disqualified.</b> If he <b>increased the measure of their <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>or decreased the measure of their <i>se’a</i></b> of grain, e.g., if he used two or four <i>se’a</i> instead of three, but sifted until he was left with the correct measure of a tenth of an ephah of flour, they are <b>fit</b> offerings. This is because the number of <i>se’a</i> mentioned in the mishna is necessary only for the optimal fulfillment of the mitzva, but is not indispensable.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The flour of <b>the <i>omer</i> was sifted with thirteen sifters,</b> each finer than its predecessor, and the flour that emerged from the final sifter was sacrificed. The flour of <b>the two loaves</b> was sifted <b>with twelve</b> sifters, <b>and</b> the flour of <b>the shewbread</b> was sifted <b>with eleven</b> sifters. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They have no fixed</b> number of sifters; <b>rather,</b> it was <b>fine flour</b> that was <b>completely sifted</b> that <b>one would bring</b> for all of these offerings, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall take fine flour and bake it”</b> (Leviticus 24:5), indicating that one does not fulfill his obligation <b>until</b> the flour <b>will be completely sifted.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> When a fine sifter was used, the small, dust-like particles emerged and the fine flour was caught in the sifter, and when a coarse sifter was used, the fine flour emerged and the bran was caught in the sifter. With regard to the sifting of the flour, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The sifting would begin <b>in</b> a sifter of <b>slight</b> holes, and the flour that remained would then be sifted <b>in</b> a sifter of <b>large</b> holes. The flour that emerged would again be sifted <b>in</b> a sifter with <b>slight</b> holes that were not quite as small as the first one with small holes, and again <b>in</b> a sifter of <b>large</b> holes that were not quite as large as the first one with large holes. All the sifting would proceed in this manner. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: There were thirteen sifters in the Temple, this</b> one <b>above,</b> i.e., preceding, <b>that</b> one, <b>and this</b> one <b>above that</b> one. The <b>highest</b> sifter would <b>collect bran,</b> parts of the kernel aside from the actual pure flour, and the <b>lowest</b> sifter would <b>collect fine flour.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that in contrast to the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They have no fixed</b> number of sifters; but the flour would be sifted as many times as was necessary, based on the verse: “And you shall take fine flour, and bake it.” In addition, <b>the Sages taught:</b> When the verse states with regard to the shewbread: “And you shall take <b>fine flour and bake it,”</b> this <b>teaches that fine flour is acquired</b> after it has been sifted for the baking of the shewbread.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that even wheat</b> kernels may be purchased before they are ground and sifted? <b>The verse states: “And you shall take,”</b> indicating that the grain should be taken <b>in any case</b> and in any state. One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>so even for other meal offerings.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall take fine flour and bake <b>it,”</b> indicating that the shewbread alone may be acquired as kernels <b>because</b> of <b>the sparing [<i>haḥissaḥon</i>].</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Because</b> of <b>the sparing? Rabbi Elazar says: The Torah spared the money of the Jewish people.</b> Due to the large quantity of grain needed for the shewbread every week, purchasing sifted fine flour would be a substantial expense. The Gemara explains: <b>Where is the allusion</b> to this principle? It is found in a verse, <b>as it is written</b> that when the Jewish people were thirsty in the wilderness in the aftermath of Miriam’s death, God instructed Moses: “And speak to the rock before their eyes, so that it will give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; <b>so you shall give drink for the congregation and for their cattle”</b> (Numbers 20:8). Evidently, the miracle of extracting water from the rock was performed even for the purpose of providing water for the livestock.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The flour for the loaves accompanying <b>the thanks offering would come</b> from a measure of <b>five Jerusalem <i>se’a</i> offering, which are</b> equivalent to <b>six wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>. The <i>se’a</i> referred to in the Bible when the Jewish people were in the wilderness is smaller than the <i>se’a</i> used later in Jerusalem. This is equivalent to <b>two ephahs,</b> each <b>ephah</b> being <b>three</b> wilderness <b><i>se’a</i>.</b> These two ephahs are <b>twenty</b> measures of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah. <b>Ten</b> of these tenths were used <b>to</b> make <b>leavened</b> loaves <b>and ten</b> of these tenths were used <b>to</b> make unleavened loaves, i.e., <b><i>matza</i>.</b>

Daf 77a

The mishna elaborates: There are <b>ten</b> tenths <b>for the</b> loaves of <b>leavened bread, a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf. And</b> there are <b>ten</b> tenths <b>for the</b> loaves of <b><i>matza</i>. And among</b> the loaves of <b><i>matza</i></b> there are <b>three types: Loaves, wafers, and</b> those <b>poached in water,</b> ten loaves of each type. <b>Consequently,</b> there are <b>three-and-one-third tenths</b> of an ephah <b>for each and every type, three loaves per tenth</b> of an ephah.
<b>And in the Jerusalem measure there were thirty <i>kav</i>, fifteen</b> <i>kav</i> <b>for</b> the loaves of <b>leavened bread and fifteen for</b> the loaves of <b><i>matza</i>.</b> The mishna elaborates: There are <b>fifteen</b> <i>kav</i> <b>for</b> the loaves of <b>leavened bread, one and one-half <i>kav</i> per loaf.</b> And there are <b>fifteen</b> <i>kav</i> <b>for</b> the loaves of <b><i>matza</i>. And among</b> the loaves of <b><i>matza</i></b> there are <b>three types: Loaves, wafers, and</b> those <b>poached in water. Consequently,</b> there are <b>five <i>kav</i> for each and every type, two loaves per <i>kav</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: The flour for the loaves accompanying <b>the thanks offering would come</b> from a measure of <b>five Jerusalem <i>se’a</i>,</b> which are equivalent to six wilderness <i>se’a</i>. The <i>se’a</i> referred to in the Bible when the Jewish people were in the wilderness is smaller than the <i>se’a</i> used later in Jerusalem. This is equivalent to two ephahs, each ephah being three wilderness <i>se’a</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that there are three <i>se’a</i> in an ephah, derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> They are derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “The ephah and the <i>bat</i> shall be of one measure”</b> (Ezekiel 45:11). Therefore, <b>just as the <i>bat</i>,</b> a measure for liquids, is <b>three <i>se’a</i>, so too the ephah,</b> a measure for dry goods, <b>is three <i>se’a</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the <i>bat</i> itself, from where do we</b> derive its measure? <b>If we say</b> that we derive it <b>from</b> that <b>which is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“That the <i>bat</i> may contain the tenth-part of a <i>ḥomer</i>,”</b> and since one <i>ḥomer</i> consists of thirty <i>se’a</i>, one <i>bat</i> is equivalent to three <i>se’a</i>, there is a difficulty: With regard to <b>an ephah as well, isn’t it written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And the ephah the tenth-part of a <i>ḥomer</i>”?</b> Why, then, must the measure of an ephah be derived from that of a <i>bat</i>? <b>Rather, I do not know how much</b> the measure of <b>a <i>ḥomer</i></b> is; consequently, when the verse states that the ephah is one-tenth of one <i>ḥomer</i>, this does not demonstrate the measure of the ephah. <b>Here too, I do not know how much</b> the measure of the <i>bat</i> is.
<b>Rather,</b> derive the volume of the ephah <b>from here,</b> from a subsequent verse, where it is written with regard to separating <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And the set portion of oil, the <i>bat</i> of oil, shall be the tithe of the <i>bat</i> out of the <i>kor</i>, which is ten <i>bat</i>, even a <i>ḥomer</i>; for ten <i>bat</i> are a <i>ḥomer</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 45:14). The verse states that there are ten <i>bat</i> in one <i>kor</i> and ten <i>bat</i> in one <i>ḥomer</i>. Since it is known that one <i>kor</i> is equivalent to thirty <i>se’a</i>, the verse indicates that there are also thirty <i>se’a</i> in one <i>ḥomer</i>. It can therefore be derived from the verse that there are three <i>se’a</i> in one <i>bat</i>, and consequently, three <i>se’a</i> in one ephah.
§ The mishna teaches that the Sages increased the size of the measures so that five Jerusalem measures are equal to six wilderness measures. With regard to the practice of augmenting measures, <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the residents of a certain place want to change the standard of their measures and augment them by a certain fraction, <b>they may not increase the measures</b> by <b>more than one-sixth, and</b> they may <b>not</b> increase the value of <b>a coin</b> by <b>more than one-sixth</b> of its previous value. <b>And one who profits</b> from his sales <b>may not profit</b> by <b>more than one-sixth.</b>
The Gemara analyzes these statements. When Shmuel said: They may not increase the measures by more than one-sixth, <b>what is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because</b> doing so causes market <b>prices to rise,</b> the same concern should apply to raising the prices by <b>one-sixth,</b> and therefore that should <b>also not</b> be allowed.
<b>Rather,</b> one might say that the prohibition is <b>due to</b> concern for <b>exploitation;</b> and they may increase the measures only by up to one-sixth so <b>that there will not be nullification of the transaction,</b> as the transaction is nullified only when the disparity is more than one-sixth of the value of the item. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But doesn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>any item that</b> is otherwise subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation, and it is sold <b>by measure, or by weight, or by number, even</b> if the disparity was <b>less than the measure of exploitation</b> in the transaction, the transaction is <b>reversed?</b> A disparity of one-sixth between the value of an item and its price constitutes exploitation only in cases where there is room for error in assessing the value of an item. In a case where the details of the item are easily quantifiable, any deviation from the designated quantity results in a nullification of the transaction. The statement of Shmuel concerns sales involving measures.
<b>Rather,</b> the prohibition is for the benefit of <b>the merchant, so that there will not be a loss</b> suffered <b>by</b> a merchant who might not realize that a new standard was issued, and might sell in accordance with the old standard. Since a merchant usually enjoys a profit of one-sixth of the value of an item, if the standard is not increased by more than this amount he will not suffer a loss, as at worst he will forfeit his profit margin. The Gemara notes: This explanation is also difficult, since even if the aim is to ensure <b>that there will not be a loss</b> for the merchant, <b>does he not need</b> to earn <b>a profit?</b> There is a well-known adage in this regard: If you <b>buy and sell</b> without earning any profit, <b>will</b> you <b>be called a merchant?</b> A merchant must profit from his sales; therefore, if this decree was instituted for the protection of merchants, the Sages should have ensured that they earn a profit.
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The prohibition is not based on logical reasoning. Instead, <b>Shmuel found a verse and interpreted it homiletically: “And the shekel shall be twenty <i>gera</i>; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, ten, and five shekels, shall be your <i>maneh</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 45:12). According to this verse, the sum of all of these numbers, sixty shekels, is equivalent to a <i>maneh</i>. This is problematic: How can <b>a <i>maneh</i></b> consist of sixty shekels? Since each biblical shekel is equivalent to four dinars, if a <i>maneh</i> is equal to sixty shekels, a <i>maneh</i> <b>is two hundred and forty</b> dinars. But a <i>maneh</i> is actually equal to twenty-five shekels, which are one hundred dinars.
<b>Rather,</b> one can <b>learn from</b> the verse <b>three</b> matters: <b>Learn from it</b> that the <b>sacred <i>maneh</i> was doubled,</b> so that it equaled two hundred, not one hundred, dinars. <b>And</b> furthermore, as Ezekiel stated that the <i>maneh</i> will be sixty shekels, not fifty, <b>learn from it</b> that a community may <b>increase measures, but they may not increase</b> them by <b>more than one-sixth. And learn from it</b> that <b>the one-sixth</b> is calculated <b>from the outside,</b> i.e., it is one-sixth of the final sum, which is one-fifth of the previous sum.
<b>Ravina said: The mishna is also precisely</b> formulated so as to reflect the fact that the one-sixth increase is calculated from the outside, <b>as it teaches:</b> The flour for the loaves accompanying <b>the thanks offering would come</b> from a measure of <b>five Jerusalem <i>se’a</i></b> of flour, <b>which are</b> equivalent to <b>six wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>. One can infer that the <i>se’a</i> could be increased by only one-sixth from the outside. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>.

Daf 77b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From all</b> of the four types of loaves accompanying the thanks offering, <b>one takes one</b> loaf <b>from</b> each set of <b>ten as <i>teruma</i>,</b> to be given to a priest, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall present from it one of each offering as a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord;</b> to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings against the altar it shall be given” (Leviticus 7:14). The verse is analyzed: <b>“One”</b> indicates <b>that one should not take a sliced</b> loaf; <b>“of each offering”</b> indicates <b>that all the offerings should be equal,</b> i.e., <b>that one should not take</b> a loaf <b>from</b> one type of <b>offering for another</b> type; <b>“to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings against the altar it shall be given,” and the rest</b> of the loaves are <b>eaten by the owner.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches some of the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>teruma</i> to be taken from the loaves of the thanks offering that are derived from the verse: “And he shall present from it one of each offering as a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord.” The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the same verse: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“And he shall present from it”</b> indicates that the loaves must all be as one, i.e., <i>teruma</i> may be taken <b>from</b> the loaves only when they are joined <b>together</b> in one place. <b>“One”</b> indicates <b>that one should not take a sliced</b> loaf. <b>“Of each offering”</b> indicates <b>that all the offerings should be equal,</b> i.e., <b>that one should not take</b> a loaf <b>from one</b> type of <b>offering for another</b> type. When the verse states: <b>“As a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord,” I do not know from how many</b> loaves the <i>teruma</i> <b>is</b> taken.
<b>I</b> therefore <b>derive</b> this from a verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here,</b> in the passage of the loaves describing the thanks offering: <b>“<i>Teruma</i>,” and</b> it <b>is stated with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe:</b> “Then you shall set apart from it <b>a <i>teruma</i></b> for the Lord, even a tithe of the tithe” (Numbers 18:26). <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>one</b> out of every <b>ten</b> is separated as <i>teruma</i>, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering, <b>one</b> out <b>of</b> every <b>ten</b> loaves is separated as <i>teruma</i>.
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and derive the measure from a different verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here: “<i>Teruma</i>,” and</b> it <b>is stated with regard to first fruits: “<i>Teruma</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17). <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to first fruits, <b>it has no measure, so too here,</b> say that <b>it has no measure.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Let us consider to which</b> of the two cases, <i>teruma</i> of the tithe or the first fruits, the case of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering is more <b>similar.</b> It is logical that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>teruma</i> that is not followed by</b> another <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> such as <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering, <b>from a <i>teruma</i> that is not followed by</b> another <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> such as <i>teruma</i> of the tithe. <b>And</b> the case of the <b>first fruits will not</b> serve as <b>proof, since they are followed by</b> another <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> as <i>teruma</i> and tithes are taken after the first fruits are separated.
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and reason that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>teruma</i></b> of the loaves of the thanks offering, <b>which is eaten in a sacred place,</b> in Jerusalem, <b>from <i>teruma</i></b> of the first fruits, <b>which is eaten in a sacred place,</b> in Jerusalem. <b>And</b> the case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe will not</b> serve as <b>proof, as it may be eaten anywhere.</b>
Since both of these comparisons are equally plausible, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: <b>“From it…a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord,” and,</b> similarly, <b>it is written with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe: “From it a <i>teruma</i>,” to</b> indicate that there is <b>a verbal analogy</b> between the two, from which it can be derived that one separates one out of every ten loaves of the thanks offering as <i>teruma</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We have learned with regard to <i>teruma</i></b> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>that its</b> measure is <b>one</b> out <b>of</b> every <b>ten. But I do not know</b> from this verbal analogy <b>from how much</b> flour each leavened <b>loaf</b> is to be prepared. <b>I</b> therefore <b>derive</b> this from a verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here,</b> in the passage concerning the loaves of the thanks offering: <b>“Bread”</b> (Leviticus 7:13), <b>and</b> it <b>is stated there, with regard to the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat: <b>“Bread”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the two loaves, one prepares the loaves with <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf, so too here,</b> with regard to the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, one prepares the loaves with <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf.</b>
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and derive the <i>halakha</i> from a different verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: <b>“Bread,” and it is stated</b> there, <b>with regard to the shewbread: “Bread”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). One can conclude that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the shewbread, each of the twelve loaves is baked from <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah flour, <b>so too here,</b> each of the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering should be baked from <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Let us consider to which</b> of the two cases, the two loaves or the shewbread, the case of the leavened loaves of the thanks offering is more <b>similar.</b> It is logical that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, which is <b>a meal offering that comes</b> as <b>leavened bread</b> along <b>with an animal offering, from</b> another <b>meal offering that comes</b> as <b>leavened bread</b> along <b>with an animal offering,</b> such as the two loaves, which are also leavened, and which come with animal offerings (see Leviticus 23:17–19). <b>And the shewbread will not</b> serve as <b>proof, since it does not come</b> as <b>leavened bread,</b> nor does it come <b>with</b> an animal <b>offering.</b>
<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and reason that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, which is <b>a meal offering that</b> can <b>come from</b> the grain of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>or</b> of <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>from new</b> grain <b>or from old</b> grain; <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the shewbread, which is also <b>a meal offering that can come from</b> the grain of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>or from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>from new</b> grain <b>or from old</b> grain. <b>And the two loaves will not</b> serve as <b>proof, since they</b> can <b>come only from new</b> grain <b>and from Eretz</b> Yisrael.
Since both of these comparisons are equally plausible, <b>the verse states</b> concerning the two loaves: <b>“You shall bring out of your dwellings two loaves of waving”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “You shall bring,” what,</b> then, is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “You shall bring”?</b> This indicates <b>that whatever,</b> i.e., any meal offering, <b>you bring from a different place,</b> it must <b>be like this,</b> i.e., the two loaves. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> in the case of the two loaves, the measure is <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf, so too here,</b> in the case of the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, the measure is <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>per loaf.</b>
But <b>if</b> so, perhaps one can derive that <b>just as there,</b> in the case of the two loaves, the entire measure for the two loaves is <b>two-tenths</b> of an ephah, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering, the entire measure for all ten loaves of leavened bread is <b>two-tenths.</b> To exclude this possibility, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “They shall be,”</b> to indicate that each leavened loaf is prepared from a tenth of an ephah. Accordingly, the ten loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering are prepared with a total of ten tenths of an ephah.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We have learned</b> that there are <b>ten</b> tenths of an ephah of flour <b>for the</b> loaves of <b>leavened bread</b> accompanying the thanks offering. <b>From where</b> is it derived that there are <b>ten</b> tenths of an ephah <b>for the</b> thirty loaves of <b><i>matza</i>? The verse states:</b> “If he brings it for a thanks offering, then he shall bring with the thanks offering unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour poached. <b>With cakes of leavened bread</b> he shall present his offering, with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:12–13).
By mentioning all the loaves of unleavened bread in one verse and the loaves of leavened bread in the subsequent verse, it is indicated that one must <b>bring</b> the <b><i>matza</i></b> in a measure <b>corresponding to</b> the measure of the loaves of <b>leavened bread. Consequently,</b> there are <b>twenty tenths</b> of flour for the <b>loaves of the thanks offering, ten for the</b> loaves of <b>leavened bread, and ten for the <i>matza</i>.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that one brings <b>ten</b> loaves of <b><i>matza</i>,</b> and that <b>all of them shall be of only one type.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If he brings it for a thanks offering, then he shall bring with the thanks offering unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour poached.</b> With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering.” The verse indicates that one must bring three types of <i>matza</i>. <b>Consequently,</b> there are <b>three-and-one-third</b> of a tenth of an ephah of flour <b>for each and every type, and three loaves to a tenth</b> of an ephah. <b>And consequently,</b> there are a total of <b>forty loaves of the thanks offering.</b> The owner of the offering <b>takes four of them,</b> one loaf of each type, <b>and gives</b> them <b>to the priest, and the remaining</b> loaves <b>are eaten by the owner</b> and any ritually pure Jew to whom he wishes to give the loaves. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
§ The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: “And he shall present from it,”</b> indicates that the <i>teruma</i> may be taken <b>from</b> the loaves only when they are joined <b>together</b> in one place. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then concerning that <b>which is written</b> in the verse with regard to the sacrificial portions of the sin offering consumed on the altar: <b>“And all the fat thereof he shall take off from it</b> and make it smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 4:19), <b>there, what is there</b> to be joined <b>together?</b>
The Gemara responds: The sacrificial portions of the sin offering must be sacrificed from that which is joined together, <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rav Ḥisda</b> says that <b>Avimi says, as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says:</b> The priest <b>may not cut up the meat</b> of the offering <b>before taking</b> from it <b>the sacrificial portions</b> that are to be burned upon the altar.
§ <b>The Master said:</b> It <b>is stated here,</b> in the passage of the loaves of the thanks offering: <b>“<i>Teruma</i>,” and</b> it <b>is stated with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe: “<i>Teruma</i>.”</b> Just as one-tenth of the tithe is separated as <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, so too one out of every ten loaves of the thanks offering is separated as <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>from <i>teruma</i></b> that was taken following the war <b>of</b> the Jewish people against <b>Midian,</b> where the word <i>teruma</i> also appears (see Numbers 31:28–30). The measure of the <i>teruma</i> there was not one of ten. The Gemara responds: <b>One derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> of the loaves of the thanks offering, <b>which is practiced for</b> all <b>generations, from <i>teruma</i></b> of the tithe, <b>which is</b> also <b>practiced for</b> all <b>generations. And <i>teruma</i> of Midian shall not</b> serve as <b>proof, as it is not practiced for</b> all <b>generations.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>from <i>teruma</i> of <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of dough given to the priest, as the verse refers to it as a <i>teruma</i> (see Numbers 15:19–20). That measure is one in twenty-four. The Gemara responds: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that <b>one derives a matter,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering, <b>of which it is stated: “From it a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 7:14), <b>from a matter,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>of which it is stated:</b> “From it <b>a <i>teruma</i> for the Lord”</b> (Numbers 18:26). This serves <b>to exclude <i>teruma</i> of <i>ḥalla</i>, of which it is not stated: From it a <i>teruma</i> for the Lord.</b>
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b><i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering,</b> is a non-priest who intentionally partakes <b>of it liable</b> to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning a non-priest who intentionally consumes <i>teruma</i> of the tithe? <b>And</b> similarly, is a non-priest who unwittingly partakes of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering liable to pay the value of what he consumed as well as an additional <b>one-fifth</b> of that value, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning a non-priest who partakes of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe unwittingly (see Leviticus 22:9, 14)? <b>Or is one not</b> liable to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven <b>or</b> to pay an additional <b>one-fifth for their</b> consumption?
Rava elaborates: <b>Since</b> <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>is compared to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> perhaps <b>it is considered like <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> and the same penalties are incurred. <b>Or perhaps,</b> since the verse uses restrictive terms with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, as the verse states of one who intentionally partakes of it: “They shall die <b>due to it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and the verse states with regard to one who unwittingly partakes of it: “Then he shall put <b>its fifth-part</b> unto it” (Leviticus 22:14), <b>the Merciful One restricted</b> this <i>halakha</i> specifically to the case of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.
Rava raises another dilemma based on the comparison of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe: Does <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering that fell into non-sacred produce <b>render the mixture</b> forbidden, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning <i>teruma</i> of the tithe? <b>Or</b> does the comparison of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe apply only with regard to the proper measure, and it <b>does not render the mixture</b> forbidden? The Gemara comments: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The verse states: “They shall be,”</b> indicating that each leavened loaf must come from a tenth of an ephah, so that the loaves of <i>matza</i> of the thanks offering are prepared from ten tenths of an ephah. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> for this? How is this derived from “they shall be”?

Daf 78a

<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said: “They shall be” [<i>tihyena</i>] is written</b> with two instances of the letter <i>yod</i>. The superfluous <i>yod</i>, whose numerical value is ten, is interpreted to indicate that the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering must be prepared from ten tenths of flour. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Say</b> that the superfluous <i>yod</i> indicates that the loaves must be prepared with <b>ten half-kav,</b> a smaller measure than ten tenths of an ephah? <b>Rava says:</b> One cannot say this, since <b>the verse</b> habitually <b>spoke of tenths</b> of an ephah and not other measures.
§ The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>We have learned</b> that there are <b>ten</b> tenths of an ephah of flour <b>for the</b> loaves of <b>leavened bread</b> accompanying the thanks offering. <b>From where</b> is it derived that there are <b>ten</b> tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the thirty loaves of <b><i>matza</i>? The verse states: “With cakes of leavened bread,”</b> after mentioning the three types of <i>matza</i> accompanying the thanks offering (Leviticus 7:12–13), indicating that one must <b>bring</b> the <b><i>matza</i></b> in a measure <b>corresponding to</b> the measure of the loaves of <b>leavened bread.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But can a matter that was derived by comparison</b> then <b>come back and teach</b> the matter <b>by comparison</b> with regard to consecrated matters? Since the <i>halakha</i> that the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering are prepared from ten tenths of an ephah is itself derived by comparison to the two loaves, can one then derive from it that the <i>matza</i> loaves of the thanks offering consist of ten tenths of an ephah? The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> that the loaves of leavened bread consist of ten loaves made from ten tenths of an ephah is not derived solely by comparison to the two loaves; rather, <b>it is</b> derived <b>from itself,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> that there are ten loaves is stated in the verse concerning the thanks offering, <b>and</b> from <b>another matter, and any</b> <i>halakha</i> derived <b>from itself and</b> from <b>another matter is not</b> considered <b>a comparison.</b> Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <i>matza</i> loaves may be derived from it.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that a <i>halakha</i> derived from itself and from another matter <b>does not constitute a comparison, but according to the one who says</b> that a <i>halakha</i> derived from itself and from another matter <b>does constitute a comparison, what is there to say?</b> The Gemara responds: According to that opinion, the <i>halakha</i> that each loaf is prepared from a tenth of an ephah is derived from that which the verse states with regard to the two loaves: <b>“You shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 23:17), which <b>is</b> a term of <b>amplification</b> that serves to teach that the loaves of leavened bread of the thanks offering consist of ten tenths of an ephah of flour. Since this <i>halakha</i> is derived not by comparison but by amplification from the two loaves, one can derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <i>matza</i> loaves by comparison to the loaves of leavened bread.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The loaves that accompanied the ram of <b>the inauguration</b> of the Tabernacle <b>would come parallel to the</b> three types of <b><i>matza</i> that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering: Loaves, wafers, and</b> loaves <b>poached</b> in water and made with oil (see Leviticus 8:26). The loaves of leavened bread that accompany the thanks offering were not brought with the ram of inauguration.
The loaves that accompany the offering that the nazirite brings upon completion of his period of <b>naziriteship would come</b> with only <b>two parts</b> of the three types of <i>matza</i> that accompany the thanks offering, namely, <b>loaves and wafers, but there is no</b> <i>matza</i> <b>poached</b> in water (see Numbers 6:15). <b>Consequently,</b> the loaves of the offering of a nazirite are from <b>ten <i>kav</i></b> of fine flour according to the <b>Jerusalem</b> measure, as taught in the previous mishna that each type of the loaves of <i>matza</i> comes from five <i>kav</i> of flour, <b>which</b> equal <b>six-and-two-thirds tenths</b> of an ephah according to the wilderness measure, as each type of the loaves of <i>matza</i> comes from three-and-one-third tenths of an ephah.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the loaves that accompanied the ram of the inauguration of the Tabernacle consisted of the three types of <i>matza</i> brought with a thanks offering: Loaves, wafers, and loaves poached in water and made with oil. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said:</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer”</b> (Leviticus 8:26). <b>Granted, “cakes”</b> are <b>cakes,</b> and <b>“wafer”</b> is <b>a wafer.</b> But <b>what is “oiled</b> bread” referring to? Is this <b>not</b> referring to <i>matza</i> <b>poached</b> in water and made with oil?
<b>Rav Avya objects to this:</b> One can <b>say</b> that “oiled bread” is referring to <b>a cake of oil. Rather,</b> derive it <b>as Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught in the name of Rabbi Tavla,</b> that the verse states: <b>“This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall bring to the Lord on the day when he is anointed:</b> The tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. On a pan it shall be made with oil; when it is poached, you shall bring it in; in broken pieces shall you bring the meal offering for a pleasing aroma to the Lord. And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall bring it” (Leviticus 6:13–15).
One can ask: <b>And what have we learned with regard to</b> Aaron’s <b>sons,</b> i.e., the ordinary priests, from the instructions for the High Priest <b>on the day that he is anointed? Rather,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the meal offering brought by an ordinary priest during <b>his inauguration with</b> the meal offering brought by the High Priest when <b>he is anointed.</b> This juxtaposition teaches that <b>just as</b> the meal offering brought by the High Priest when <b>he is anointed is poached in water, so too</b> the meal offering brought by an ordinary priest during <b>his inauguration is poached in water.</b> Similarly, the loaves brought with the ram of the inauguration of the Tabernacle included loaves poached in water.
§ Concerning the matter of the High Priest’s meal offering on the day of his inaugural service in the Temple, <b>Rav Ḥisda says: A High Priest who approaches the</b> Temple <b>service</b> on the day that he is anointed is <b>required</b> to bring two meal offerings consisting of <b>two tenths of an ephah, one for</b> the fact that <b>he is anointed</b> as the High Priest and must bring the daily meal offering of the High Priest, <b>and one for his inauguration. Mar bar Rav Ashi says:</b> He requires <b>three</b> tenths of an ephah.
<b>And they do not disagree. This</b> one, Rav Ḥisda, is referring to a High Priest <b>who</b> already <b>performed</b> the Temple <b>service as an ordinary priest.</b> Accordingly, he has already brought a meal offering for his inauguration as an ordinary priest. He therefore brings only two tenths of flour, one for his inauguration as High Priest and one for the daily meal offering of the High Priest. And <b>that</b> one, Mar bar Rav Ashi, is referring to a High Priest <b>who has not</b> yet <b>performed</b> the Temple <b>service as an ordinary priest.</b> He must therefore bring three tenths, one for his inauguration as an ordinary priest, one for his inauguration as High Priest, and one for the daily meal offering of the High Priest.
§ The mishna teaches: The loaves that accompany the offering that the nazirite brings upon completion of his period of <b>naziriteship would come</b> with only <b>two parts, parallel to the</b> types of <b><i>matza</i> that</b> come <b>with the thanks offering,</b> i.e., loaves and wafers, but not <i>matza</i> poached in water.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the loaves brought with a thanks offering: “If he sacrifices it for a thanks offering, then he shall sacrifice with the thanks offering unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour poached. With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:12–13). <b>“His peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include the nazirite’s peace offering in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> that its accompanying meal offerings must consist of <b>ten Jerusalem <i>kav</i> and one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of oil,</b> just like the measurements required for the cakes and wafers of the thanks offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that the verse indicates that the meal offering of the nazirite’s peace offering is equivalent to the loaves of the thanks offering <b>concerning all that is stated with regard to the matter</b> of the thanks offering, and that one brings three types of <i>matza</i> consisting of fifteen Jerusalem <i>kav</i> and half a <i>log</i> of oil. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the nazirite’s peace offering: “And a basket of <b>unleavened bread,</b> loaves of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Numbers 6:15), to indicate that the nazirite’s meal offering consists only of <i>matza</i> loaves and <i>matza</i> wafers, and not <i>matza</i> poached in water.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> by which “<i>matza</i>” indicates that loaves poached in water were not brought? <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The verse indicates that the nazirite brings <i>matza</i> specifically from <b>an item of which it was stated: “<i>Matzot</i>.”</b> This serves <b>to exclude</b> loaves <b>poached in water, of which it is not stated: <i>Matzot</i>.</b> In addition, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: “Unleavened bread”</b> is <b>a generalization; “loaves</b> of fine flour mingled with oil, <b>and</b> unleavened <b>wafers</b> spread with oil” <b>is a detail.</b> When the Torah states <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization includes only what is in the detail.</b> Therefore, <b>loaves and wafers are</b> included in the nazirite’s meal offering, while <b>other items are not.</b>

Daf 78b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters the thanks offering</b> in its proper place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> at that time <b>its</b> forty <b>loaves were outside the wall, the loaves were not consecrated.</b> Likewise, <b>if he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>before the surface</b> of the loaves <b>formed a crust in the oven, and even</b> if the surface of all the loaves <b>formed a crust except for one of them, the loaves were not consecrated.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>outside the wall? Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it means <b>outside the wall of Beit Pagei</b> in Jerusalem. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that it means <b>outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it means <b>outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> because the verse states with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: “Then he shall sacrifice with [<i>al</i>] the thanks offering unleavened cakes mingled with oil” (Leviticus 7:12). And <b>we require</b> that the thanks offering be slaughtered strictly <b>“with [<i>al</i>]”</b> the accompanying loaves, i.e., with the loaves <b>nearby.</b> If the loaves are outside the wall of the Temple courtyard, they are not considered nearby.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the loaves were <b>outside the wall of Beit Pagei,</b> they are not consecrated, because it is prohibited to eat the loaves outside the wall of Beit Pagei. Since if they were taken outside the wall of Beit Pagei, they would be disqualified because they were removed from their permitted area, they cannot be consecrated if they are there. <b>But</b> if they were merely <b>outside the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> where they may be eaten, they are <b>consecrated. And we do not require</b> that the thanks offering be slaughtered strictly <b>“with”</b> the accompanying loaves, i.e., <b>nearby.</b>
The Gemara objects: Why is it necessary for Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish to disagree with regard to a case where the loaves were situated outside the wall when the thanks offering was slaughtered? <b>But didn’t they</b> already <b>disagree with regard to this</b> matter <b>one</b> other <b>time?</b>
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 63a) with regard to the slaughtering of the Paschal offering: <b>One who slaughters the Paschal offering with leavened bread</b> still in his possession <b>transgresses a prohibition,</b> as the verse states: “You shall not sacrifice the blood of My offering with [<i>al</i>] leavened bread; neither shall the offering of the festival of Passover be left until the morning” (Exodus 34:25). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> one who slaughters <b>the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering</b> on Passover eve with leavened bread in his possession transgresses the prohibition. <b>And Reish Lakish says: Actually, one is not liable unless</b> the leavened bread <b>is</b> in the possession <b>of the one who slaughters</b> the offering, <b>or the one who sprinkles</b> its blood, <b>or one of the members of the group,</b> and the leavened bread is <b>with</b> that person <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One is liable <b>even if</b> the leavened bread <b>is not with</b> that person <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Evidently, they already disagree with regard to the meaning of the word “<i>al.</i>”
The Gemara replies: It is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute concerning both matters. <b>As, if</b> their disagreement <b>were stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> matter of the Paschal offering, one might think that only <b>with regard to that</b> matter <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that one is liable even if the leavened bread is not inside the Temple courtyard, <b>since wherever there is</b> leavened bread, its owner <b>stands in</b> violation of <b>the prohibition</b> against owning leavened bread at that time. <b>But with regard to the matter of the consecration of</b> the <b>loaves</b> of the thanks offering, one could <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Reish Lakish that if</b> the loaves are <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard when the thanks offering is slaughtered, they are <b>consecrated,</b> but if they are <b>outside,</b> they are <b>not consecrated.</b>
<b>And if</b> their disagreement <b>were stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> matter of the loaves of the thanks offering, one might think that only <b>with regard to this</b> matter <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that the loaves are consecrated only if they were within the walls of the Temple courtyard. <b>But with regard to that</b> matter of the Paschal offering, one could <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that one is liable for slaughtering the Paschal offering while in possession of leavened bread even if it was not with him inside the Temple courtyard, as wherever there is leavened bread, its owner stands in violation of the prohibition against owning leavened bread at that time. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute concerning both matters.
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters the thanks offering inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> at that time <b>its loaves were outside the walls of Beit Pagei, the loaves were not consecrated.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>before the surface of the loaves formed a crust in the oven,</b> the loaves were not consecrated. The next mishna also teaches: If one slaughtered the thanks offering not for its sake, the loaves were not consecrated.
The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to the loaves accompanying the thanks offering: <b>“With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice</b> of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:13). This <b>teaches that the loaves are not consecrated unless the surface</b> of the loaves <b>formed a crust in the oven,</b> as only then can they be considered “cakes of leavened bread.” The phrase <b>“he shall present his offering with the sacrifice” teaches that the loaves are consecrated only upon the slaughtering of the offering.</b> The phrase <b>“the sacrifice</b> of his peace offerings <b>for thanks” teaches that if one slaughtered</b> the offering <b>not for its sake, the loaves were not consecrated.</b>
§ On a similar note, <b>the Sages taught:</b> One <b>fulfills</b> the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> on Passover <b>with half-done,</b> i.e., not fully baked, <b><i>matza</i>, and with <i>matza</i> made in a stewpot [<i>ilpas</i>]</b> rather than baked in an oven. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> constitutes <b>half-done <i>matza</i>? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>any</b> <i>matza</i> that is sufficiently baked such <b>that</b> if <b>one breaks it, threads</b> of dough <b>are not drawn from it.</b>
<b>Rava said: And so</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the matter of the loaves of the thanks offering,</b> i.e., if the loaves were already half-done at the time of the slaughter of the thanks offering, they are consecrated. The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary for Rava to state this? Isn’t it <b>obvious? Here,</b> with regard to <i>matza</i>, the term <b>“bread” is written</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and here,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering, the term <b>“bread” is written.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: “And of it he shall present <b>one</b> out of each offering for a gift unto the Lord” (Leviticus 7:14), this indicates <b>that one may not take sliced</b> bread for the thanks offering, <b>and this</b> half-done bread <b>is considered like one that is sliced,</b> as it will break apart upon being lifted, and it should consequently be disqualified for the bread of the thanks offering, therefore Rava <b>teaches us</b> that once it is baked to that point, it is considered as one loaf and it is valid for the thanks offering.
§ It <b>was stated</b> that there is a dispute among the <i>amora’im</i> with regard to <b>a thanks offering that one slaughtered</b> accompanied <b>by eighty loaves</b> rather than the required forty. <b>Ḥizkiyya says: Forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Not</b> even <b>forty of</b> the <b>eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated.</b>
With regard to this dispute, <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>concedes</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the individual bringing the offering <b>said: Let forty of</b> the <b>eighty</b> loaves <b>be consecrated, that</b> forty <b>are consecrated.</b> Likewise, everyone concedes that where he said: <b>Forty should not be consecrated unless eighty will be consecrated,</b> that <b>they were not consecrated. They disagree when</b> one brings eighty loaves <b>without specification.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds: He intends</b> to consecrate only forty of them, but he brought eighty in order <b>to guarantee</b> that there will be sufficient loaves. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds: He intends to</b> bring <b>a large offering</b> of eighty loaves; consequently, none of the loaves are consecrated.
<b>Abaye</b> offered another explanation of the dispute and <b>said: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>he intends to guarantee</b> that there will be sufficient loaves, <b>and they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>service vessels consecrate</b> the appropriate measure <b>without</b> the <b>intention</b> of the one bringing the offering. One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds</b> that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> items <b>without intention.</b> Accordingly, the knife that slaughters the thanks offering and consecrates its accompanying loaves consecrates forty of the eighty. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>service vessels do not consecrate</b> items <b>without intention.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa</b> offered another explanation of the dispute and <b>said: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> items <b>without intention, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether this is also the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the slaughtering <b>knife.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds</b> that <b>the knife consecrates</b> items <b>as a service vessel</b> does. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>since the knife has no inside, it does not consecrate</b> items <b>as a service vessel</b> does.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> items <b>only with intention, and here they disagree with regard to the</b> ability of the slaughtering <b>knife</b> to consecrate without intention. One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds</b> that the power of <b>the knife</b> to consecrate items <b>is stronger than</b> that of other <b>service vessels, as even though it has no inside it consecrates</b> items, and therefore it also consecrates items without intention. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that the power of <b>the knife</b> to consecrate items <b>is not stronger than</b> that of other <b>service vessels,</b> and like all service vessels, it does not consecrate items without intention.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering with the intent to partake of it or to burn the sacrificial portions <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> and the offering was rendered <i>piggul</i> or was disqualified, respectively, <b>the loaves were consecrated</b> and either rendered <i>piggul</i> or disqualified. If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>and it was discovered</b> that it was <b>an animal with a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], the loaves were not consecrated,</b> as the cause of the animal’s disqualification preceded its slaughter.
If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>and it was discovered</b> that it is <b>a blemished</b> animal that may not be sacrificed <i>ab initio</i> but if it ascended the altar it may be sacrificed, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He has <b>consecrated</b> the loaves, since if the offering ascends the altar it is sacrificed. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> He has <b>not consecrated</b> the loaves, since it may not be sacrificed <i>ab initio</i>.
If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>not for its sake</b> but for the sake of another offering, <b>and likewise,</b> if one slaughtered <b>the ram of inauguration</b> not for its sake, <b>and likewise,</b> if one <b>slaughtered the</b> communal peace offering of <b>two sheep</b> that accompany the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i> not for their sake, the loaves were not consecrated.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one slaughtered the thanks offering with the intent to partake of it beyond its designated time or outside its designated area, the loaves become consecrated. The mishna also teaches that if the thanks offering was slaughtered and it was discovered that it was a <i>tereifa</i>, the loaves were not consecrated, but if it was discovered to have a blemish, Rabbi Eliezer says that the loaves were consecrated, and the Rabbis say that they were not. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> instance in <b>which</b> the <b>disqualification</b> of the thanks offering <b>preceded</b> its <b>slaughter, the loaves were not consecrated,</b> and any instance in which <b>its disqualification</b> came into existence <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter, the loaves were consecrated.</b> Therefore, if one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering with the intent to partake of it or to burn the sacrificial portions <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area, the loaves were consecrated,</b> as the offering remained fit until after its slaughter. But if one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>and it was discovered</b> that it was <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, the loaves were not consecrated,</b> as the cause of the animal’s disqualification preceded its slaughter.

Daf 79a

If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>and it was discovered</b> that it is <b>a blemished</b> animal, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The loaves were <b>consecrated,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The loaves were <b>not consecrated.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> consistent with the dispute appearing in the mishna.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua did not disagree with regard to</b> a case where <b>he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>and it was discovered</b> that it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as all agree <b>that it was not consecrated; and</b> they did not disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where he slaughtered the thanks offering with the intent to partake of it or to burn the sacrificial portions <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> as all agree <b>that it was consecrated; and</b> they did not disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where he slaughtered the thanks offering and it was discovered that it is <b>a blemished</b> animal, as all agree <b>that it was not consecrated. And with regard to what</b> case <b>did they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where he slaughtered the thanks offering with the intent to partake of it or to burn the sacrificial portions <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area, as Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It <b>was consecrated, and Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It <b>was not consecrated.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: In explanation of his opinion, <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: Since</b> an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time is disqualified and</b> an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area is disqualified,</b> it is reasonable that <b>just as</b> in the case of intent to partake of it <b>beyond its time</b> the loaves <b>were consecrated, so too</b> in the case of intent to partake of it <b>outside its area</b> the loaves <b>were consecrated. Rabbi Yehoshua said: Since</b> an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area is disqualified and</b> an offering discovered to be <b>a blemished</b> animal <b>is disqualified,</b> it is reasonable that <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>a blemished</b> animal the loaves <b>were not consecrated, so too</b> in the case of intent to partake of it <b>outside its area</b> the loaves <b>were not consecrated.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: I compared</b> an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area <b>to</b> an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and you compared it to</b> an offering discovered to be <b>a blemished</b> animal. <b>Let us consider to which it is similar. If it is similar to</b> an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, we will deduce its</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> that of an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time. If it is similar to</b> an offering discovered to be <b>a blemished</b> animal, <b>we will deduce its</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> that of an offering discovered to be <b>a blemished</b> animal.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer began to reason: We deduce</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a disqualification</b> due to improper <b>intention from</b> that of <b>a disqualification</b> due to an improper <b>intention,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who slaughters the animal with intent to partake of it outside its designated area should be deduced from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who slaughters it with the intent to partake of it outside its designated time. <b>And we do not deduce</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a disqualification</b> due to improper <b>intention from</b> that of <b>a disqualification</b> due to a blemish in <b>the</b> physical <b>body</b> of the offering.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua began to reason</b> to the contrary: <b>We deduce</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a disqualification that does not</b> include liability for <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>],</b> i.e., an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area, <b>from</b> that of <b>a disqualification that does not</b> include liability for <b><i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., an offering discovered to be a blemished animal. And the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time should</b> not be brought <b>as proof, as</b> it is <b>a disqualification that</b> includes liability for <b><i>karet</i>. And furthermore,</b> even according to Rabbi Eliezer, who says that we deduce the <i>halakha</i> from a disqualification due to improper intention, <b>let us deduce</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> that of an offering slaughtered <b>not for its sake, as</b> it is <b>a disqualification</b> due to improper <b>intention and</b> it also <b>does not</b> include liability for <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and the loaves of such an offering were not consecrated.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer was silent,</b> conceding to Rabbi Yehoshua. In any event, it is clear in the <i>baraita</i> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that if the thanks offering was slaughtered and discovered to be a <i>tereifa</i> the loaves were not consecrated, but if it was discovered to be a blemished animal Rabbi Eliezer holds that the loaves were consecrated, <b>what is different</b> if <b>he slaughtered it and it was discovered to be a <i>tereifa</i></b> such <b>that it is</b> considered a case where <b>its disqualification precedes</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> and the loaves were not consecrated; <b>and what is different</b> if <b>he slaughtered it and it was discovered to be a blemished</b> animal such <b>that it is not</b> considered a case where <b>its disqualification precedes</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> and the loaves were consecrated according to Rabbi Eliezer?
The Gemara responds: Rabbi Meir is referring <b>to</b> a blemish <b>on the cornea of the eye, and</b> his ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> with regard to this type of blemish: Although animals with such a blemish are disqualified as an offering <i>ab initio</i>, <b>if they ascended</b> the altar <b>they shall not descend,</b> and they are sacrificed on the altar. The Gemara adds: <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who holds that if the animal is discovered to be blemished the loaves are not consecrated, says: <b>When Rabbi Akiva said</b> that <b>if they ascended</b> the altar, <b>they shall not descend,</b> he was referring to the <b>disqualification of</b> the offering <b>itself,</b> i.e., that once it ascended it shall not descend. <b>But with regard to the consecration of the loaves</b> through the slaughter of such an animal, he did <b>not</b> say this.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua in the <i>baraita</i>: It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered</b> with intent to partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, if it ascended</b> the altar <b>it shall not descend.</b> If one slaughtered it with intent to partake of it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area, Rava says: It shall descend</b> and shall not be burned, and <b>Rabba says: It shall not descend.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rava</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who deduces the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a thanks offering that was slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area from that of an offering discovered to have a blemish. Accordingly, just as a blemished sin offering descends from the altar even if it has already ascended, so too a sin offering that was slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area descends. <b>And Rabba</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who deduces the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a thanks offering that was slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area from that of an offering that was slaughtered with intent to partake of it beyond its designated time. Accordingly, just as a sin offering that was slaughtered with intent to partake of it beyond its designated time does not descend from the altar, so too a sin offering that was slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area does not descend.
<b>And Rabba retracted</b> his opinion <b>in favor of</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> and ruled that a sin offering slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area descends from the altar, <b>since Rabbi Eliezer retracted</b> his opinion <b>in favor of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> teaches that he was silent and accepted the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua. Accordingly, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an animal slaughtered with intent to partake of it outside its designated area should be deduced from that of an offering discovered to have a blemish.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: Even though Rabbi Eliezer retracted</b> his opinion <b>in favor of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabba did not retract</b> his opinion <b>in favor of</b> the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> because <b>there,</b> with regard to the consecration of the loaves of the thanks offering, Rabbi Eliezer conceded to Rabbi Yehoshua because Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Let us deduce its</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> that of an offering slaughtered <b>not for its sake. But here, if you deduce its</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> that of an offering slaughtered <b>not for its sake,</b> then the <i>halakha</i> should be that <b>if it ascended</b> the altar <b>it shall not descend.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>not for its sake,</b> and likewise, if one slaughtered the ram of inauguration not for its sake, and likewise, if one slaughtered the communal peace offering of two sheep that accompany the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i> not for their sake, the loaves were not consecrated. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> in bewilderment: Why does <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>omit</b> the case of the loaves of the <b>nazirite’s ram, which is common</b> and is also not consecrated if the ram was slaughtered not for its sake, <b>and teach</b> instead <b>the ram of the inauguration</b> of the Tabernacle, which was brought only by the Jewish people in the wilderness? The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna? <b>He taught</b> the ram of the inauguration because it was <b>the primary matter,</b> i.e., it was the first offering to be brought with loaves.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where <b>the libations</b> that accompany the offerings <b>were sanctified in</b> a service <b>vessel</b> when the animal was slaughtered <b>and the offering was discovered</b> to be <b>unfit, if there is another offering</b> that was slaughtered and requires libations, the libations <b>should be sacrificed with</b> that offering; <b>and if not, they should be disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight,</b> and then burned.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to statement of the mishna concerning a case where the libations of an animal offering were consecrated and the animal was then discovered to be unfit, <b>Ze’eiri says: Libations are sanctified only upon the slaughter of the offering. What is the reason</b> for this? The <b>verse states:</b> “To bring an offering made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, <b>a sacrifice, and libations,</b> each on its own day” (Leviticus 23:37), indicating that the libations complement the offering and are consecrated only upon its slaughter.
The Gemara poses a difficulty to the statement of Ze’eiri from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: In a case where <b>the libations were sanctified in</b> a service <b>vessel</b> when the animal was slaughtered <b>and the offering was discovered</b> to be <b>unfit, if there is another offering</b> that was slaughtered and requires libations, the libations <b>should be sacrificed with</b> that offering; <b>and if not, they should be disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight,</b> and then burned.
<b>What, is it not</b> so that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the offering <b>became unfit through</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> and consequently the libations were not sanctified by the slaughter of the offering? Why, then, must the libations be left overnight in order to disqualify them? Evidently, the libations are sanctified being placed in a service vessel and not upon the slaughter of the offering, in contradiction to the statement of Ze’eiri. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring to an offering <b>that became unfit through the sprinkling</b> of the blood; the libations were sanctified upon the slaughter of the offering, and therefore they must be disqualified by being left overnight.
The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this mishna? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said:</b> If an offering has <b>two factors that permit</b> it for consumption or for sacrifice, <b>they can each elevate</b> it to sanctified status <b>without the other.</b> Accordingly, although the slaughter of the animal and the sprinkling of its blood are both permitting factors for the libations, the libations were sanctified through the slaughter of the animal, despite the fact that the animal became unfit through the sprinkling of its blood.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and holds that both permitting factors must be performed in order to confer sanctity upon the libations, the mishna can still be explained as follows: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>collected its blood in the cup</b> for the purpose of sprinkling it on the altar, <b>but</b> the blood <b>spilled</b> out of the cup and could not be sprinkled. Nevertheless, the libations were sanctified, as the blood was fit for sprinkling upon the altar.

Daf 79b

<b>And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father</b> in this matter, <b>as</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said: Any</b> blood of an offering <b>that stands</b> fit <b>to be sprinkled</b> upon the altar <b>is considered as</b> if it were already <b>sprinkled.</b> Accordingly, although the blood was spilled after it was collected in the cup and was not actually sprinkled, it is nevertheless considered as if it were sprinkled.
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the mishna: <b>If there is another offering</b> that was slaughtered and requires libations, the libations <b>should be sacrificed with</b> that offering. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Ḥisda say</b> that <b>oil that</b> one <b>separated for the sake of this</b> one <b>meal offering</b> is <b>unfit</b> to be brought <b>for the sake of another meal offering?</b> Likewise, shouldn’t libations separated for one offering be unfit for sacrifice with another offering? <b>Rabbi Yannai says: The court tacitly stipulates concerning</b> the libations that <b>if they were required</b> for the offering for which they were separated, <b>they were required</b> and are brought with that offering. <b>But if not,</b> e.g., where the offering was disqualified, <b>they should be</b> brought with <b>another offering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then shouldn’t it be that the court tacitly stipulates concerning <b>the oil as well?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The oil is</b> part <b>of the meal offering itself</b> and cannot be brought for the sake of another meal offering, whereas the libations merely accompany the offering and are not an integral part of it.
The Gemara challenges: If it is so that the court tacitly stipulates concerning the libations, then <b>let</b> the court tacitly <b>stipulate concerning them that</b> if the offering they are meant to accompany is disqualified, <b>they shall emerge to non-sacred</b> status altogether. The Gemara responds: It is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that the court does not tacitly make this stipulation, <b>lest</b> people who are unaware of such a stipulation see that an item that was previously sanctified has become non-sacred, and <b>they will</b> mistakenly <b>say: One may remove</b> sanctified items <b>from service vessels to</b> become <b>non-sacred.</b>
The Gemara objects: If the Sages did not tacitly make such a stipulation because they were concerned that people might mistakenly conclude that items that were already consecrated in service vessels can become non-sacred, then <b>now as well,</b> where the court tacitly stipulates that the libations should be sacrificed with another offering, let there be a rabbinic <b>decree</b> against such a stipulation, <b>lest</b> people <b>say: Libations that one separated for the sake of one offering are fit for the sake of a different offering</b> <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>Mattitya ben Yehuda teaches</b> that the mishna is referring specifically to a case <b>where there was</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time.</b> In such a case, there is no concern that people will reach this mistaken conclusion, as one who sees that the libations are sacrificed immediately with the other offering will simply assume that they were separated for the sake of that offering from the outset.
The Gemara objects to this: According to the explanation of Mattitya ben Yehuda, it can be inferred from the mishna that if there is another offering that was slaughtered at the same time, then the libations are sacrificed with that offering; <b>but</b> if <b>there is not</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time,</b> then <b>what</b> should be done with the libations? They should be <b>disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight.</b> If so, <b>rather than teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And if</b> there is <b>not</b> another offering that requires libations, <b>they should be disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight; let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach</b> the distinction <b>within the</b> case <b>itself</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where there was</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time. But if there is not</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time,</b> the libations are <b>not</b> sacrificed with another offering.
The Gemara responds: <b>That is also what</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where there was</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time. But if there is not</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time,</b> the libations <b>are</b> immediately <b>considered as if they were disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight, and</b> they are <b>disqualified.</b>
The Gemara explained above that the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and that he holds in accordance with the opinion of his father that any blood that stands fit to be sprinkled is considered as if it has been sprinkled. The Gemara also explained that the mishna allows for the sacrifice of the libations with another offering because the court tacitly stipulates that the libations should be brought with another offering if the first offering becomes disqualified. In light of this, the Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> i.e., the father of Rabbi Elazar, <b>accept</b> the principle that <b>the court tacitly stipulates concerning</b> the libations?
<b>But didn’t Rav Idi bar Avin say</b> that <b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to animals that were designated as <b>daily offerings</b> but <b>that</b> in the end <b>were not needed for</b> use by <b>the public,</b> and have inherent sanctity, how shall they be redeemed? <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Shimon, they may not be redeemed</b> as long as they are <b>unblemished,</b> since they retain the status of offerings. But <b>according to the statement of the Rabbis, they may be redeemed</b> even when they are <b>unblemished,</b> as the court initially stipulates that if they are not needed they will not assume the status of an offering. Since Rabbi Shimon disagrees with the Rabbis, it may be inferred that according to Rabbi Shimon, one does not say that the court tacitly stipulates concerning the offerings.
The Gemara responds: In general, Rabbi Shimon holds that the court stipulates concerning them. And <b>it is different there,</b> in the case of the daily offerings, <b>because they have</b> an alternative <b>arrangement through</b> which their total loss may be avoided, as they may be left in the field to <b>graze</b> until they develop a blemish, at which point they may be sold. Since there is no arrangement for the libations save for sacrificing them with another offering, even Rabbi Shimon holds that the court stipulates concerning them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the offspring</b> of an animal designated as <b>a thanks offering, or</b> an animal that is <b>its substitute;</b> or in a case where <b>one separated</b> an animal as <b>a thanks offering and it was lost and he separated another in its stead,</b> and the first animal was then found, in all three cases, the second animal, i.e., the offspring, the substitute, or the replacement, is sacrificed, but it <b>does not require</b> the bringing of accompanying <b>loaves.</b> This is <b>as it is stated:</b> “If he sacrifices it for a thanks offering, <b>then he shall sacrifice with the thanks offering</b> unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour poached” (Leviticus 7:12). The verse indicates that <b>the</b> initial <b>thanks offering requires loaves, but neither its offspring, nor its replacement, nor its substitute requires loaves.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is it</b> that the verse teaches when it <b>states: He sacrifices for a thanks offering?</b> The verse states: <b>If he sacrifices for a thanks offering. From where</b> is it derived that <b>with regard to one</b> who <b>separated</b> an animal as <b>his thanks offering and it was lost and he separated another in its stead, and the first animal was</b> then <b>found, and</b> now <b>they both stand</b> fit to be sacrificed, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that he may sacrifice whichever</b> one <b>of them he wishes, and its loaves</b> are brought along <b>with it? The verse states</b> that <b>he shall sacrifice the thanks offering,</b> i.e., as long as he sacrifices some thanks offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that the second</b> animal also <b>requires loaves</b> to be brought with it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He sacrifices it,”</b> indicating that only <b>one</b> thanks offering requires loaves, <b>but not two. Since the verse included</b> the second animal as fit for sacrifice <b>and excluded</b> it from the requirement to bring loaves with it, <b>from where</b> is it derived that the verse also <b>includes</b> a thanks offering’s <b>offspring, replacements, and substitutes</b> as fit <b>for sacrifice?</b> From the fact that <b>the verse states: “If for a thanks offering,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would require loaves</b> to be brought with them. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then he shall sacrifice with the thanks offering,”</b> indicating that the initial <b>thanks offering</b> itself <b>requires loaves, but neither its offspring, nor its replacement, nor its substitute requires loaves.</b>
§ With regard to the offspring, substitute, and replacement of a thanks offering, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥanina sent</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to the Sages in Babylonia containing the following statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the offspring, replacement, and substitute do not require loaves <b>only</b> in a case where they were sacrificed <b>after</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement,</b> i.e., where the initial thanks offering was already sacrificed with its loaves; <b>but</b> if they were sacrificed <b>before</b> he achieved <b>atonement, they require loaves.</b>
<b>Rav Amram discussed this</b> <i>halakha</i> sent in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan and asked: <b>To which</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring <b>to the replacement for an obligatory thanks offering,</b> then there is no novelty in his statement. <b>If</b> his intention is to teach that where the thanks offering was found <b>before</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement</b> with its replacement, the replacement requires loaves, <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the <i>baraita</i>, as it states: He may sacrifice whichever one of them he wishes, and its loaves are brought along with it. And <b>if</b> his intention is to teach that where the thanks offering was found <b>after</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement</b> with the replacement, the thanks offering does not require loaves, this too <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, as it teaches that only the first offering requires loaves.

Daf 80a

<b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring not to the replacement for an obligatory thanks offering, but <b>to the replacement for a voluntary thanks offering.</b> This too is difficult, because <b>whether</b> the initial thanks offering was found <b>before</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement</b> with the replacement <b>or after</b> he achieved <b>atonement,</b> both offerings <b>require loaves,</b> as the owner <b>is</b> considered one who <b>increases thanks offerings.</b> That is, since he was not required to bring a replacement for the offering, if he brings another offering it is considered an additional voluntary offering, and a voluntary thanks offering requires loaves.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring <b>to the offspring of a voluntary thanks offering.</b> This too is difficult, because <b>whether</b> the offspring was sacrificed <b>before</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement</b> with its mother <b>or after</b> he achieved <b>atonement,</b> offspring <b>do not require loaves,</b> as <b>this is</b> considered <b>a leftover of the thanks offering,</b> which does not require loaves. <b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring <b>to the offspring of an obligatory thanks offering.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan teaches that if the offspring was sacrificed <b>before</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement, it requires loaves,</b> but if it was sacrificed <b>after</b> he achieved <b>atonement, it does not require loaves.</b>
The Gemara asks: According to this explanation, <b>what is</b> Rav Ḥanina <b>teaching us</b> by sending this letter? He teaches us <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds: A person achieves atonement with the enhancement of consecrated</b> property, even though it is not the initial consecrated property. If one sacrifices the offspring of an obligatory thanks-offering before the thanks-offering itself, he achieves atonement with the offspring, even though it is an enhancement of the consecrated thanks-offering. Accordingly, if he offers it before its mother, it requires loaves. The Gemara notes: <b>Abaye also discusses</b> the letter sent by Rav Ḥanina <b>in this way</b> and reaches conclusions similar to those of Rav Amram.
With regard to the conclusions of Rav Amram and Abaye, it <b>was also stated: Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one achieves atonement with <b>the replacement for a voluntary thanks offering, whether</b> the thanks offering was found <b>before</b> he achieved <b>atonement or after</b> he achieved <b>atonement,</b> the replacement <b>requires loaves,</b> as the owner <b>is</b> considered one who <b>increases thanks offerings. The offspring of a voluntary thanks offering, whether</b> it was sacrificed <b>before</b> he achieved <b>atonement or after</b> he achieved <b>atonement, does not require loaves,</b> as offspring <b>is</b> considered <b>a leftover of the thanks offering. And</b> with regard to <b>the offspring of an obligatory thanks offering,</b> if it was sacrificed <b>before</b> he achieved <b>atonement, it requires loaves,</b> but if it was sacrificed <b>after</b> he achieved <b>atonement, it does not require loaves.</b>
§ The Gemara cites additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the loaves of a thanks offering that was lost and another animal was taken as its replacement: <b>Shmuel says:</b> In <b>any</b> situation <b>in which a sin offering</b> would be placed in isolation for it <b>to die,</b> if that same situation occurs <b>with a thanks offering, it does not require loaves.</b> And in <b>any</b> situation <b>in which a sin offering</b> would be placed in the field to <b>graze</b> until it develops a blemish, if that same situation occurs <b>with a thanks offering, it requires loaves.</b>
<b>Rav Amram raises an objection</b> from the <i>baraita</i> cited on 79b: <b>What is it</b> that the verse teaches when it <b>states: He sacrifices for a thanks offering? From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who separated</b> an animal as <b>his thanks offering and it was lost and he separated another in its stead, and the first animal was</b> then <b>found, and</b> now <b>they both stand</b> fit to be sacrificed, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that he may sacrifice whichever</b> one <b>of them he wishes, and its loaves</b> are brought along <b>with it? The verse states: He sacrifices for a thanks offering.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that the second</b> animal also <b>requires loaves</b> to be brought with it. <b>The verse states: “He sacrifices it,”</b> indicating that only <b>one</b> thanks offering requires loaves, <b>but not two.</b>
Rav Amram continues: <b>Whereas with regard to a sin offering in a case like this,</b> the Rabbis hold that the animal <b>is</b> placed in the field to <b>graze, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 22b): If <b>one separated his sin offering and it was lost, and he separated another</b> animal <b>in its stead, and the first</b> sin offering <b>was found, and both</b> animals <b>stand</b> fit for sacrifice, then he <b>achieves atonement with one of them and the second</b> animal <b>shall</b> be left to <b>die;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: A sin offering</b> is left to <b>die only</b> if it <b>was found after its owner achieved atonement.</b> It may be inferred from the opinion of the Rabbis <b>that</b> if it is found <b>before the owner achieved atonement,</b> it is placed in the field to <b>graze.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said:</b> An animal separated as a sin offering that was <b>lost at the time of the separation</b> of its replacement, even if it was found before the replacement was sacrificed, is left to <b>die.</b> The principle stated by Shmuel is therefore correct, since in every situation in which a sin offering is left to die, a thanks offering does not require loaves.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that even in such a case the second sin offering is left to die, <b>how can you find</b> a case where the sin offering is placed in the field to <b>graze according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? The Gemara responds: It can be found in a case <b>like that of Rabbi Oshaya, as Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> If <b>one separated two sin offerings,</b> one to achieve atonement for his sin and the other <b>as a guarantee</b> in case the first one is lost, <b>he may achieve atonement with whichever of them he wishes, and the second shall</b> be placed in the field to <b>graze.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But in a case like this</b> involving <b>a thanks offering,</b> the animal <b>does not require loaves.</b> Therefore, if Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that in such a case the sin offering is placed in the field to graze, then Shmuel cannot hold in accordance with his opinion, since according to Shmuel, in circumstances where a sin offering would be left to graze, a thanks offering in the same circumstances would require loaves. <b>Rather, Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> There are <b>five sin offerings</b> that are left to <b>die;</b> one is a sin offering that was lost and found before its replacement was sacrificed, and another is the case where a sin offering was separated as a guarantee.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> it cannot be that Shmuel holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, since <b>Rabbi Shimon does not hold</b> that there are <b>any</b> circumstances in which a sin offering is placed in the field to <b>graze.</b> Accordingly, if Shmuel holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, how can he say: And in any situation in which a sin offering would be placed in the field to graze until it develops a blemish, if that same situation occurs with a thanks offering, it requires loaves?
The Gemara responds: In fact, <b>Shmuel also stated</b> only <b>one</b> principle: In <b>any</b> situation <b>in which a sin offering</b> is placed in isolation for it <b>to die,</b> if that same situation occurs <b>with a thanks offering, it does not require loaves.</b> He did not state the second principle. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Shmuel <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara responds: Shmuel teaches us his statement <b>to exclude</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said: A person achieves atonement with the enhancement of consecrated</b> property. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, the offspring of an obligatory thanks offering requires loaves if it is sacrificed before its mother. Shmuel <b>teaches us that</b> one does <b>not</b> achieve atonement with the enhancement of consecrated property, and the offspring of a thanks offering does not require loaves, which corresponds to the fact that the offspring of a sin offering is left to die.
§ With regard to the loaves of a thanks offering, <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> If one volunteered to bring a thanks offering, and said: <b>This</b> animal <b>is a thanks offering and this</b> flour <b>is</b> designated for <b>its loaves,</b> then if <b>the loaves were lost, he brings other loaves.</b> If <b>the thanks offering was lost, he does not bring another thanks offering,</b> and the loaves are not sacrificed. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The loaves are</b> brought <b>on account of the thanks offering;</b> therefore, if there is no thanks offering, there are no loaves. <b>But the thanks offering is not</b> brought <b>on account of the loaves;</b> consequently, if the loaves were lost, the thanks offering is still sacrificed, and one brings different loaves.
§ <b>And</b> with regard to the distinctions between a thanks offering and its accompanying loaves, <b>Rava says:</b> In the case of one who <b>separated money for his thanks offering</b>

Daf 80b

<b>and</b> some of the money <b>remained</b> after he purchased the offering, <b>he brings,</b> i.e., purchases, <b>with</b> the remaining money <b>loaves</b> to accompany the thanks offering. If he separated money <b>for the loaves of the thanks offering and</b> some of the money <b>remained</b> after he purchased the loaves, <b>he may not bring a thanks offering with</b> the remaining money.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Kahana,</b> that is difficult. <b>As Rav Kahana said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the loaves of a thanks offering are</b> themselves <b>called a thanks offering?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanks offering loaves”</b> (Leviticus 7:12). The juxtaposition of the words “thanks offering” and “loaves” indicates that the loaves are themselves called a thanks offering. Therefore, one who separated money for a thanks offering may use that money for the loaves as well. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>If that is so, the opposite</b> should <b>also</b> be the <i>halakha</i>, i.e., the thanks offering is called loaves, and it should therefore be permitted to use the money remaining from the loaves for the thanks offering. The Gemara rejects this: <b>The loaves are called a thanks offering,</b> but <b>the thanks offering is not called loaves.</b>
§ <b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>one separated</b> an animal as <b>his thanks offering and it was lost, and he again separated another in its stead, and it</b> too <b>was lost, and he again separated another in its stead, and the first</b> two animals <b>were</b> then <b>found, and the three of them stand</b> fit to be sacrificed, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If <b>he achieved atonement with the first</b> animal, <b>the second does not require loaves,</b> as it is the replacement for the first, and the first was sacrificed with its loaves. But <b>the third requires loaves,</b> because it is the replacement for the second, which does not require loaves.
If <b>he achieved atonement with the third,</b> then <b>the second does not require loaves,</b> because its replacement, i.e., the third, was sacrificed with loaves, but <b>the first requires loaves,</b> because its replacement, i.e., the second, will be sacrificed without loaves. If he achieved atonement <b>with the middle,</b> i.e., the second animal, <b>both of them,</b> i.e., the first and the third, <b>do not require loaves,</b> because the replacement for the first, i.e., the second, was sacrificed with loaves, and the third is the replacement for the second, which was sacrificed with loaves. <b>Abaye says: Even if he achieved atonement with</b> any <b>one of them,</b> the other <b>two do not require loaves,</b> as <b>they are all replacements for one another.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: And so</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>for the matter of sin offerings:</b> If <b>one separated</b> an animal as <b>his sin offering and it was lost, and he separated another in its stead, and it</b> too <b>was lost, and he separated another in its stead, and the first</b> two animals <b>were</b> then <b>found, and the three of them stand</b> fit to be sacrificed, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If <b>he achieved atonement with the first, the second is</b> left <b>to die,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a sin offering whose owner has already achieved atonement, and <b>the third is</b> placed in the field to <b>graze</b> until it develops a blemish and can be redeemed, since it is the replacement for a sin offering that was not sacrificed.
If <b>he achieved atonement with the third, the second is</b> left <b>to die,</b> because its replacement, i.e., the third, was already sacrificed, <b>and the first is</b> placed in the field to <b>graze,</b> because its replacement, i.e., the second, will not be sacrificed. If <b>he achieved atonement with the middle, both of them,</b> i.e., the first and the third, <b>are</b> left <b>to die,</b> because the second was sacrificed as a replacement for the first, and the third would have been the replacement of the second. <b>Abaye says: Even if he achieved atonement with</b> any <b>one of them,</b> the other <b>two are</b> left <b>to die,</b> as <b>they are all replacements for one another.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Zeira mean by: <b>And so</b> is the <i>halakha</i> for the matter of sin offerings? Why is it necessary for Rabbi Zeira to teach this seemingly identical <i>halakha</i> with regard to three sin offerings? The Gemara responds: It is necessary to teach that these <i>halakhot</i> apply with regard to sin offerings as well, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>there,</b> in the case of the thanks offerings, if one achieved atonement with the first animal then the third requires loaves, <b>since it can be said</b> that the owner <b>is one who increases thanks offerings; but here,</b> in the case of the sin offerings, <b>since it cannot be said</b> that the owner <b>is one who increases sin offerings,</b> as one cannot volunteer a sin offering, <b>I would say</b> that the same <i>halakhot</i> do <b>not</b> apply, and if one achieved atonement with the first sin offering, the third is left to die. Rabbi Zeira therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the third sin offering is considered the replacement for the second and is therefore left to graze.
§ The mishna teaches that the substitute of a thanks offering does not require loaves. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> In the case of an animal separated as <b>a thanks offering that was intermingled with its substitute,</b> and it is not known which is the thanks offering and which is the substitute, <b>and one of them died, the other has no remedy. What should we do?</b> If <b>we bring loaves with it,</b> this may be improper, because <b>perhaps it is a substitute,</b> which does not require loaves. If <b>we do not bring loaves with it,</b> this may be improper, because <b>perhaps it is the</b> actual <b>thanks offering,</b> which requires loaves.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> it is a case where the owner <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a thanks offering, in which case he is required to replace the thanks offering in the event of its loss, then why is there no remedy? Is it <b>not sufficient if he does not bring another animal and loaves, and says: If the one remaining</b> from the intermingled group <b>is the substitute,</b> then let <b>this</b> additional animal <b>be the thanks offering and these its loaves;</b> and <b>if the one remaining is the thanks offering,</b> then let it be the thanks offering and <b>these its loaves, and let this</b> additional animal <b>be its guarantee,</b> which does not require loaves?
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya is <b>necessary</b> in a case in <b>which</b> one <b>said: This</b> animal <b>is</b> a thanks offering. Since he consecrated a specific animal as a thanks offering, he is not required to provide a guarantee in the event of its loss, and the above remedy is not applicable.
§ The Gemara raises a series of challenges with the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya that if a thanks offering was intermingled with its substitute and one of them died, there is no remedy for the other. The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for remembering the names of the Sages that raise these challenges: <b><i>Lemudim</i>,</b> i.e., Levi, who was known as <i>Lemedin</i> before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi; <b><i>middat</i>,</b> i.e., Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta; <b><i>ala</i>,</b> i.e., Ulla bar Abba; <b><i>shish</i>,</b> i.e., Rav Shisha, son of Rav Idi; <b><i>sheken</i>,</b> an acronym for Rav Ashi and Rav Kahana; <b><i>dedamah</i>,</b> i.e., Rav Dimi, son of Rav Huna of Dimhorya; <b><i>de’i</i>,</b> i.e., Ravina of Ikla. An additional mnemonic is provided for recalling the topics of these questions: <b><i>Ḥalash</i>,</b> a contraction of <i>ḥullin</i>, i.e., non-sacred items, and <i>shelamim</i>, peace offerings; <b>leftover; substitute; outside; Ḥizkiyya; separated a sin offering; for a guarantee.</b>
<b><i>Lemedin</i>,</b> i.e., Levi, <b>said before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>But</b> why is there no remedy in this case? <b>Let him bring loaves</b> for the thanks offering <b>and let him say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant</b> from the intermingled pair <b>is the thanks offering,</b> then <b>these are its loaves,</b> and they will be consumed as the loaves of the thanks offering. And <b>if not,</b> i.e., if the extant animal is the substitute, which is sacrificed without loaves, then <b>let</b> these loaves <b>go out to</b> be consumed as <b>non-sacred</b> loaves. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> But the loaves of a thanks offering must be waved in the Temple courtyard, <b>and do we</b> intentionally <b>bring non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b>
Levi challenges: <b>And let him bring</b> another <b>animal with loaves and let him say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the substitute,</b> then let <b>this</b> additional animal be <b>the thanks offering and these its loaves. If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the thanks offering,</b> then let <b>these</b> be <b>its loaves, and this</b> additional animal <b>should be a peace offering,</b> which does not require loaves. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> This cannot be done, <b>because he</b> thereby <b>reduces</b> the time period permitted <b>for consuming the peace offering,</b> which is generally two days and one night. A thanks offering may be consumed only on the day it is sacrificed and the following night.
<b>Levi said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>And let him bring</b> another <b>animal with loaves and let him say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the substitute,</b> then let <b>this</b> be <b>the thanks offering and these its loaves. And if that</b> animal <b>that is extant is the thanks offering,</b> then let <b>these</b> be <b>its loaves and this will be the leftover of the thanks offering,</b> which does not require loaves. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: It seems to me that he has no brain in his skull.</b>

Daf 81a

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi explains why: <b>And does one separate</b> an animal <b>as a leftover <i>ab initio</i>?</b>
The Gemara suggests another solution: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta was sitting before Rav Naḥman, and he was sitting and saying: And let him bring</b> another <b>animal with loaves and let him say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the substitute,</b> then let <b>this</b> be <b>the thanks offering and these its loaves. And if this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the thanks offering,</b> then let <b>these</b> be <b>its loaves and this will be a substitute,</b> as the substitute of a thanks offering is not sacrificed with loaves, and it may be consumed for the same duration as the thanks offering itself.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Answer me, my Master:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that one who separates a substitute is liable to receive <b>forty</b> lashes <b>on his shoulders, and</b> yet you say it is <b>fit</b> to separate a substitute <i>ab initio</i>?
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ila took ill,</b> and <b>Abaye and the Sages went to</b> visit <b>him, and they were sitting and saying: If</b> one <b>accepts</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said:</b> If the loaves of the thanks offering were within Jerusalem, i.e., the area of consumption of a thanks offering and its loaves, even if they were <b>outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> when the thanks offering was slaughtered they are <b>consecrated,</b> then <b>let</b> the owner <b>bring loaves and set them outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard and let him say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the thanks offering,</b> then let <b>these</b> be <b>its loaves, and if</b> it is <b>not, let them go out</b> and be consumed <b>as non-sacred</b> loaves.
The Gemara responds: This too is not a valid remedy, <b>because there are four</b> loaves of the forty that one must <b>wave. How would he perform</b> the mitzva of waving them? <b>Shall he wave them outside</b> the Temple courtyard? He may not, since “waved for a wave offering <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 7:30) <b>is written</b> in the verse, and waving performed outside the Temple courtyard is not considered “before the Lord.” Shall he wave them <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard? <b>He</b> will have <b>brought non-sacred food into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. Therefore,</b> it is <b>not possible.</b>
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to this: If</b> one <b>accepts</b> the ruling <b>of Ḥizkiyya, who said</b> with regard to a thanks offering that one slaughtered accompanied by eighty loaves rather than the required forty: <b>Forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated,</b> then let the owner <b>bring an animal and let him bring eighty loaves with it and say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the thanks offering,</b> then <b>this</b> additional animal <b>should also be a thanks offering and these eighty</b> loaves should be <b>for both of them.</b> And <b>if this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the substitute,</b> then let <b>this</b> additional animal be <b>a thanks offering and these</b> shall be <b>its loaves, and let forty of the eighty be consecrated for it.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: This is not a valid remedy, <b>because it reduces</b> the <b>consumption of the forty</b> additional loaves, as the priests may not be able to consume the four loaves given from the additional forty, and the owner cannot consume them because they may be the portion of the priest.
<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: If</b> one <b>accepts</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said:</b> If <b>one separated a pregnant</b> animal as <b>a sin offering and it gave birth,</b> if <b>he wants he can achieve atonement with it,</b> and if <b>he wants he can achieve atonement with its offspring;</b> then <b>let</b> the owner <b>bring a pregnant animal and wait until it gives birth, and let him bring eighty</b> loaves <b>with it and say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the substitute,</b> then <b>this</b> and its offspring <b>are thanks offerings, and these eighty</b> loaves should be <b>for both of them. And if this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the thanks offering,</b> then <b>this</b> mother should also be <b>a thanks offering, and these eighty</b> loaves should be <b>for both of them, and let this</b> offspring <b>be the leftover of the thanks offering.</b>
Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Who shall say to us that</b> the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is that he <b>said</b> that the offspring is considered the property of the one who dedicated the pregnant mother, such that <b>if he reserved it</b> for a specific consecration it is considered <b>reserved</b> for that consecration? <b>Perhaps</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that <b>if he reserved it, it is not</b> considered <b>reserved, and this is the reason that Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> holds that one can achieve atonement with the offspring of a pregnant animal separated as a sin offering, <b>as he said: A person achieves atonement with the enhancement of consecrated</b> property, such as the offspring of an animal that was consecrated when pregnant.
<b>Ravina happened</b> to come <b>to Dimhorya. Rav Dimi, son of Rav Huna from Dimhorya, said to Ravina: And let</b> the owner <b>bring an animal and say: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring an animal for a thanks offering, and let him separate this animal in fulfillment of his vow, <b>and</b> then <b>let him bring another animal, and let him bring eighty</b> loaves <b>with it and say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the substitute,</b> then <b>these two</b> additional animals are <b>thanks offerings and these eighty</b> loaves should be <b>for both of them. And if this</b> animal <b>that is extant is the thanks offering,</b> then <b>this one</b> for <b>which I said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me, should also be a thanks offering, and these eighty</b> loaves are <b>for both of them, and let the other</b> animal <b>be for a guarantee,</b> to be sacrificed if my thanks offering gets lost, and it does not require loaves.
Ravina <b>said to him: The Torah said: “Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:4), <b>and you say: Let him rise up and vow <i>ab initio</i>?</b> Taking a vow to bring an offering is not encouraged. As all possible remedies have been rejected, the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya, that there is no remedy in a case where a thanks offering and its substitute were intermingled and one of them died, stands.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering, must bring it and its loaves from non-sacred</b> money in his possession and not second-tithe money. Since he said: It is incumbent upon me, bringing the offering is an obligation, and one may not fulfill an obligation with second-tithe money.

Daf 81b

If one said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering from non-sacred</b> money <b>and its loaves from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money, <b>he must bring</b> the thanks offering <b>and its loaves from non-sacred</b> money. If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a thanks offering from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money <b>and its loaves from non-sacred</b> money, <b>he may bring</b> it in that manner. Likewise, if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring a thanks offering <b>and its loaves from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money, <b>he may bring</b> it in that manner. <b>And he may not bring</b> the loaves <b>from second-tithe wheat; rather,</b> he purchases the flour <b>with second-tithe money.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the various ways in which one can take a vow to bring a thanks offering and its loaves, <b>Rav Huna says: One who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>loaves of a thanks offering, must bring a thanks offering and its loaves,</b> even though he did not expressly take upon himself the obligation to bring the thanks offering itself. <b>What is the reason? This man knows that loaves are not brought without a thanks offering, and</b> by stating the vow in <b>this</b> manner, he was effectively <b>saying:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a thanks offering and its loaves. And</b> the reason he <b>stated</b> his vow in <b>this</b> manner, namely, by saying: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>loaves of a thanks offering,</b> was that <b>he was citing the end of the matter,</b> as the sacrifice of a thanks offering is completed with the bringing of the loaves.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with the statement of Rav Huna from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a thanks offering from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money <b>and its loaves from non-sacred</b> money, <b>he may bring</b> it <b>as he vowed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of Rav Huna that one who takes a vow to bring the loaves of a thanks offering intends to bring the thanks offering as well, <b>why</b> does the mishna state that he may bring the thanks offering from second-tithe money? <b>Since he said: Its loaves from non-sacred</b> money, <b>he should bring</b> a thanks offering <b>and its loaves from non-sacred</b> money.
The Gemara responds: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of the mishna, <b>as since he said</b> initially: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a thanks offering from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money, and then said: And its loaves from non-sacred money, <b>he is considered as one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>loaves to exempt the thanks offering of so-and-so.</b> His vow to bring the loaves is not considered a new vow, but rather as a vow to bring loaves for the specific offering he vowed to bring.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which teaches</b> that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a thanks offering from non-sacred</b> money <b>and its loaves from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money, then <b>he must bring</b> the thanks offering <b>and its loaves from non-sacred</b> money, <b>here too</b> let it be said that <b>he is considered as one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering to exempt the loaves of so-and-so,</b> and he therefore should bring a thanks offering from second tithe. His initial vow to bring a thanks offering from non-sacred money should not include the bringing of the loaves.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted,</b> in a case where one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a thanks offering from second-tithe money and its loaves from non-sacred money, it can be said that he intends that the loaves should be brought to complete the vow of one who is obligated to bring a thanks offering, because <b>loaves come to exempt the thanks offering.</b> But in a case where one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a thanks offering from non-sacred money and its loaves from second-tithe money, it cannot be said that the thanks offering is meant to complete the vow of one who is obligated to bring the loaves of a thanks offering, as <b>does a thanks offering come to exempt the loaves?</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss the statement of Rav Huna that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring loaves of a thanks offering, must bring a thanks offering and its loaves. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> that contradicts the opinion of Rav Huna: In the case of <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering without loaves, or</b> an animal <b>offering without libations,</b> the court <b>coerces him, and he brings a thanks offering with its loaves,</b> or <b>an offering with its libations.</b>
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that he is coerced to bring a thanks offering with its loaves is <b>that he said</b> that it is incumbent upon himself to bring a thanks offering. <b>But</b> if <b>he did not say</b> that it is incumbent upon himself to bring <b>a thanks offering,</b> but instead said that it is incumbent upon himself to bring the loaves of a thanks offering, he would <b>not</b> be coerced to bring a thanks offering with the loaves, in contradiction to the opinion of Rav Huna.
The Gemara rejects this: Actually, <b>the same is true even if he did not say</b> that it is incumbent upon himself to bring <b>a thanks offering,</b> but said only: It is incumbent upon me to bring the loaves. <b>And</b> this is the reason that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> mentions specifically the case of one who renders himself obligated to bring a thanks offering without loaves: <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wants to teach</b> the case of one who renders himself obligated to bring an animal <b>offering without libations,</b> concerning <b>which</b> he could <b>not teach</b> a case where one renders himself obligated to bring <b>libations without an offering,</b> because, unlike the loaves of a thanks offering, libations are in fact brought on their own and one can take a vow to bring them on their own, <b>he</b> therefore <b>also taught</b> the case of one who renders himself obligated to bring <b>a thanks offering.</b>
The Gemara addresses the actual statement of the <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>Why</b> is he coerced to bring a thanks offering and its loaves? Isn’t <b>this</b> an instance of <b>a vow with its</b> inherent <b>opening?</b> That is, the vow should be dissolved entirely on the grounds that the one who took the vow may claim that he thought it was possible to bring a thanks offering without loaves, and now that he has been made aware that he cannot, he regrets taking the vow.
<b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say:</b> In the case of one who stated a declaration comprising two contradictory statements, <b>attend</b> to only <b>the first statement. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 9a): If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite from dried figs and from</b> pressed <b>figs,</b> which is a contradictory statement, as figs are not prohibited to a nazirite, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> He is a full-fledged <b>nazirite,</b> as one attends only to the first statement, i.e., I am hereby a nazirite, and the second part is discounted. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The second part of his statement is not discounted, and therefore <b>he is not a nazirite,</b> as he did not accept naziriteship upon himself.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> and the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>with regard to one who says: Had I known that one does not vow</b> in <b>this</b> manner, i.e., to bring a thanks offering without loaves or an animal offering without libations, <b>I would not have vowed</b> in <b>this</b> manner <b>but</b> in <b>that</b> manner, i.e., I would have vowed to bring a thanks offering with its loaves. There is therefore no opening for a dissolution. <b>And what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it states that the court <b>coerces</b> him? Why would he require coercion if he says that he would have willingly taken the proper vow? The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where,</b> despite the fact that he would have taken the proper vow initially, <b>he</b> now <b>wants to retract his</b> vow altogether.
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in support of the response of Ḥizkiyya: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> In a case involving <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering without loaves, or:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring an animal <b>offering without libations, and</b> the Sages <b>said to him: Bring a thanks offering with its loaves, or:</b> Bring an animal <b>offering with its libations, and he says: Had I known that such</b> is the requirement <b>I would not have vowed</b> at all; the <i>halakha</i> is that the court <b>coerces him, and says to him: “Observe and hear”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:28).
The Gemara continues: <b>Granted,</b> this <b>works out well according to Ḥizkiyya,</b> who says that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai that one attends only to the first statement, since this <i>baraita</i> can also be explained in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai. <b>But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who says that the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case where the person who took the vow says: Had I known that one does not vow in this manner I would have vowed to bring a thanks offering with its loaves, this <i>baraita</i> presents <b>a difficulty,</b> as although the individual claims that he would not have taken any vow, he must still bring a thanks offering and its loaves. The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: This</b> latter <i>baraita</i> <b>is certainly</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> but the previous <i>baraita</i> may still be explained in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.
The Gemara turns to analyze the <i>baraita</i> itself: <b>What</b> is the relevance of the phrase in the verse that says: <b>“Observe and hear,”</b> to one who vows to bring a thanks offering without its loaves? <b>Abaye says: “Observe”</b> means: <b>Bring a thanks offering; “and hear”</b> means: <b>Bring its loaves. Rava says: “Observe”</b> means: <b>Bring a thanks offering and its loaves; “and hear”</b> means <b>that you should not act</b> in <b>this</b> manner <b>regularly.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if one states: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a thanks offering and its loaves from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money, <b>he shall bring</b> it in that manner. The Gemara asks: Why does the mishna teach: <b>He shall bring,</b> which suggests that he must bring the thanks offering and loaves from second-tithe money? Is it <b>not sufficient</b> to fulfill his vow even <b>if he does not bring</b> it from second-tithe money but from non-sacred money? In fact, it is preferable that he bring the offering from non-sacred money. <b>Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda say:</b> The mishna does not mean that he must bring it specifically from second-tithe money; rather, if he <b>wants, he brings</b> it from second-tithe money, and if he <b>does not want, he does not</b> need to <b>bring</b> it from second-tithe money.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And he may not bring</b> the loaves <b>from second-tithe wheat; rather,</b> he purchases the flour <b>with second-tithe money.</b> With regard to this, <b>Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda both say:</b> The mishna <b>taught only</b> that the loaves may not be brought <b>from second-tithe wheat</b> itself, <b>but he may bring</b> the loaves <b>from wheat purchased with second-tithe money.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira, and he was sitting and saying:</b> The mishna <b>taught only</b> that the loaves may not be brought <b>from second-tithe wheat</b> itself, <b>but he may bring</b> the loaves <b>from wheat purchased from second-tithe money.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: My teacher,</b> do <b>you say so? I say</b> that <b>he may not bring</b> the loaves <b>even from wheat purchased from second-tithe money. And I will say my reasoning and I will say your reasoning. I will say your reasoning</b> first: <b>From where do you derive</b> that the loaves of <b>a thanks offering</b> may be brought from wheat purchased with second-tithe money? You derive it from the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a peace offering.</b> A thanks offering is a type of peace offering, as the verse states: “And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:15), and a peace offering may be brought from second-tithe money.

Daf 82a

<b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a peace offering</b> may be brought from second-tithe money is derived by a verbal analogy between <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there” from</b> the verse discussing second <b>tithe.</b> The verse states with regard to a peace offering: “And you shall sacrifice peace offerings and you shall eat there” (Deuteronomy 27:7), and the verse states with regard to second tithe: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there” (Deuteronomy 14:23). <b>And from this</b> it may be concluded: <b>Just as peace offerings are not themselves</b> brought from second <b>tithe,</b> as they are not produce, <b>so too</b> with regard to the loaves of <b>a thanks offering, they are not themselves</b> brought from second <b>tithe. And that wheat which is purchased with second-tithe money is also not itself</b> second <b>tithe;</b> it may therefore be used for the loaves of the thanks offering.
Now <b>I will say my reasoning</b> for why one may not prepare the loaves of a thanks offering with wheat that was purchased with second-tithe money: <b>From where do I derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a thanks offering</b> may be brought from second-tithe money? I derive it <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a peace offering. And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a peace offering</b> may be brought from second-tithe money is derived by a verbal analogy between <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there” from</b> second <b>tithe.</b> Therefore, <b>just as a peace offering is not</b> of the same <b>species</b> as second <b>tithe, so too</b> the loaves of <b>a thanks offering</b> may <b>not</b> be of the same <b>species</b> as second <b>tithe.</b> This serves <b>to exclude wheat purchased with second-tithe money, which is</b> of the same <b>species</b> as second <b>tithe.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> In a case involving <b>one who designates second-tithe money for a peace offering,</b> the money does <b>not assume</b> the status of <b>a peace offering. What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that the sanctity of the peace offering is not strong</b> enough <b>to take effect upon</b> items that have <b>the sanctity of second tithe.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:4): Ideally, one should use second-tithe money to purchase peace offerings. If one purchases a peace offering with second-tithe money, only the flesh of the animal is consecrated, while its hide is non-sacred. The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one who</b> uses second-tithe money in an improper manner and <b>purchases an undomesticated animal for a peace offering,</b> a purpose for which an undomesticated animal cannot be used, <b>or</b> purchases <b>a domesticated animal for meat of desire,</b> i.e., ordinary meat, the Sages penalized him and decreed that <b>the hide does not become non-sacred.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that not to say that</b> the hide of the animal purchased with the second-tithe money <b>assumes</b> the status of <b>a peace offering,</b> and it must be sold and the money used to purchase a peace offering, in contradiction to the statement of Rabbi Ami?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Wasn’t it stated concerning that</b> mishna that <b>Rav said:</b> The hide of the animal purchased with the second-tithe money does <b>not assume</b> the status of <b>a peace offering; and what</b> is the meaning of the mishna that <b>the hide does not become non-sacred? This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> The hide, as part of an undomesticated animal, is <b>not in the category of</b> a peace offering at all so that its <b>hide would become non-sacred. What is the reason? Rabba says:</b> Since he used the second-tithe money in an improper manner, <b>it is considered as if he purchased an ox for plowing,</b> to which no sanctity of second tithe applies.
§ It <b>was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to <b>one who designates second-tithe money for a peace offering. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The money <b>assumes</b> the status of a peace offering, and <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The money does <b>not assume</b> the status of a peace offering.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>And according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> Second <b>tithe is non-sacred property, everyone agrees that</b> the money <b>assumes</b> the status of a peace offering. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir, who said:</b> Second <b>tithe is property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High. The one who says</b> that the money does <b>not assume</b> the status of a peace offering holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and one may not designate property of the Most High for another purpose. <b>And the one who says</b> that the money <b>assumes</b> the status of a peace offering holds that <b>since</b> second <b>tithe is called a peace offering,</b> as an animal purchased with second-tithe money without specification is brought as a peace offering, <b>when he designates</b> the money for a peace offering, it <b>as well</b> is <b>designated</b> with the sanctity of a peace offering.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabbi Elazar from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case involving <b>one who designates second-tithe money for a peace offering,</b> the sanctity of a peace offering is applied to this money in addition to the sanctity of second tithe. Therefore, <b>when he redeems</b> this money, <b>he adds to it two-fifths:</b> One-fifth <b>for the</b> redemption of the <b>sacrificial</b> sanctity of a peace offering <b>and</b> one-fifth <b>for</b> the redemption of second <b>tithe.</b> Evidently, the sanctity of a peace offering does take effect on second-tithe money.
The Gemara responds: <b>Do you maintain</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is agreed</b> upon <b>by everyone?</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that second-tithe money is non-sacred property. Accordingly, the sanctity of a <b>peace</b> offering takes effect on the money. Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering, that he may bring</b> it <b>only from non-sacred</b> money? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “And you shall sacrifice the Paschal offering to the Lord your God, of the flock and the herd”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:2). The verse is difficult: <b>Doesn’t the Paschal offering come only from lambs and goats? If so, why does the verse state: “The flock and the herd”?</b> It is <b>to juxtapose all</b> offerings <b>that come from the flock and from the herd to</b> the <b>Paschal offering,</b> teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>Paschal offering</b> is <b>a matter of obligation and comes only from non-sacred</b> money, <b>so too any matter of obligation comes only from non-sacred</b> money.
<b>Therefore,</b> in the case of <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering,</b> or: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a peace offering, since</b> these offerings <b>come</b> as <b>an obligation</b> due to his vow, <b>they may be brought only from non-sacred</b> money. <b>And libations, in any case, may be brought only from non-sacred</b> money, and not from second-tithe money, because second-tithe money must be used to purchase items eaten by people, while libations are poured out next to the altar.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the <i>halakha</i> that any matter of obligation must be brought from non-sacred property is derived from the <i>halakha</i> of the Paschal offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning <b>the Paschal offering itself, from where do we</b> derive that it is brought only from non-sacred property? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “Paschal offering” is stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to</b> the offering sacrificed in <b>Egypt</b> (see Exodus 12:3), <b>and “Paschal offering” is stated with regard to</b> the yearly obligation throughout the <b>generations</b> (see Exodus 12:25). Therefore, <b>just as the Paschal offering stated with regard to Egypt was brought only from non-sacred</b> property, as there was no second tithe in Egypt, <b>so too the Paschal offering stated with regard to</b> the obligation throughout the <b>generations may be brought only from non-sacred</b> property.
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: But does one derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible?</b> Does one derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations, when there exists the possibility of using second-tithe money, from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal offering sacrificed in Egypt, when there was no second tithe? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Even though</b> it was <b>impossible</b> to bring the Paschal offering in Egypt from consecrated money, <b>it is a great proof, and we shall derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from it.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva then presented a different logical derivation</b> to reject the proof of Rabbi Eliezer: One cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations from that of the Paschal offering in Egypt, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about the Paschal offering</b> sacrificed in <b>Egypt?</b> It is notable in <b>that</b> it <b>did not require</b> the <b>placement of blood</b> on the altar nor that the <b>sacrificial portions</b> be consumed <b>by the altar.</b>

Daf 82b

Can <b>you say</b> the same <b>with</b> regard to <b>the Paschal offering</b> of the <b>generations, which requires</b> the <b>placement of blood</b> on the altar <b>and</b> that the <b>sacrificial portions</b> be consumed <b>by the altar?</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> The Paschal offerings should be compared, <b>as the</b> verse <b>states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations: “And it shall be when the Lord shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, <b>that you shall perform this service in this month”</b> (Exodus 13:5). This indicates <b>that all the services of this month</b> for the generations <b>shall be like this,</b> the Paschal offering of Egypt.
The Gemara discusses the opinion of Rabbi Akiva: Initially, Rabbi Akiva rejects the statement of Rabbi Eliezer based on the claim that one cannot derive the possible from the impossible. He then rejects the statement of Rabbi Eliezer on a technicality, namely that the two Paschal offerings have different sacrificial requirements. The Gemara therefore challenges: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva, if he holds that one does not derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> then <b>let him stand by his statement.</b>
And <b>if he retracted</b> and conceded that one derives the possible from the impossible, <b>and</b> the fact <b>that he did not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the Paschal offering</b> in <b>Egypt is due to that refutation</b> that he proposed, i.e., that the Paschal offerings are different, then <b>the Paschal offering</b> that was sacrificed in the second year in <b>the wilderness will prove</b> that this refutation is incorrect. That offering did require placement of the blood and sacrificial portions on the altar, yet it was brought only from non-sacred money, as there were no tithes in the wilderness.
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Akiva <b>stated</b> this objection <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> He meant as follows: <b>According to my</b> opinion, <b>one does not derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> and this is a sufficient reason why one cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations from the <i>halakha</i> of the Paschal offering in Egypt. And even <b>according to your</b> opinion, in <b>which you said</b> that <b>one derives</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> this comparison can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the Paschal offering</b> sacrificed in <b>Egypt?</b> It is notable in <b>that</b> it <b>did not require</b> the <b>placement of blood</b> on the altar nor that the <b>sacrificial portions</b> be consumed <b>by the altar.</b> Can <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the Paschal offering</b> of the <b>generations, which requires</b> the <b>placement of blood</b> on the altar <b>and</b> that the <b>sacrificial portions</b> be consumed <b>by the altar?</b>
<b>And</b> in response to this, <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations should be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of the Paschal offering in Egypt, since the verse states with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations: <b>“That you shall keep</b> this service in this month.”
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why must <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> cite this verse? <b>Let him say to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>The Paschal offering</b> brought in <b>the wilderness will prove</b> that this refutation is incorrect, since it did require placement of the blood and consumption of sacrificial portions on the altar, yet it was brought only from non-sacred money.
The Gemara responds: Rabbi Eliezer <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> He meant as follows: <b>In my</b> opinion, <b>one derives</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible. And as</b> for <b>that refutation</b> that you raised, that the Paschal offering in Egypt and the Paschal offering of the generations have different sacrificial requirements, <b>the Paschal offering</b> of <b>the wilderness will prove</b> that this is not a valid refutation. <b>According to your</b> opinion, in <b>which you said</b> that <b>one does not derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> the verse states: <b>“That you shall keep</b> this service in this month,” indicating that the Paschal offering of the generations is compared to the Paschal offering in Egypt.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But even now, let</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>refute</b> this comparison by the same claim that one cannot derive the possible from the impossible. <b>Rav Sheshet says: That is to say</b> that <b>one cannot refute a juxtaposition,</b> i.e., one cannot refute such a derivation based on reasoning.
<b>And in the study hall [<i>uvetarbitza</i>]</b> they discussed the statement of the mishna that the <i>halakha</i> that all obligatory offerings must be brought from non-sacred property is derived from the Paschal offering of the generations, and <b>they said: But can a matter derived via juxtaposition,</b> i.e., the Paschal offering of the generations, whose <i>halakha</i> is derived by juxtaposition from the Paschal offering in Egypt, <b>again teach a matter via</b> another <b>juxtaposition?</b> The Gemara responds: This is not considered an instance of a matter derived by juxtaposition teaching a matter derived by another juxtaposition. Rather, the statement of the mishna that all offerings are juxtaposed to the Paschal offering <b>was stated in a general</b> manner, since <b>the entire Paschal offering is one matter.</b> The Paschal offering in Egypt and the Paschal offering of the generations are both referred to as a Paschal offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who rejects the proofs of Rabbi Eliezer, <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>that the Paschal offering comes only from non-sacred</b> money? The Gemara responds: Rabbi Akiva <b>derives it from that which Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> It is stated: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:37). This verse connects all of the specified offerings, such that individual aspects of each offering are applicable to all of the offerings.
The Gemara details these aspects. The verse states: “Of the <b>burnt offering,”</b> to teach that all of the offerings are like a burnt offering in that <b>just as a burnt offering requires a utensil</b> in its preparation, <b>so too do all</b> animal offerings <b>require a utensil. What</b> is the <b>utensil? If we say</b> it is <b>a bowl,</b> a utensil used for collecting the blood, as is learned from the burnt offerings that were sacrificed at Mount Sinai, that cannot be correct, as a utensil for collecting blood does not need to be learned from a burnt offering. <b>With regard to communal peace offerings it is also written:</b> “And they offered burnt offerings, and they sacrificed peace offerings…<b>And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins”</b> (Exodus 24:5–6).
<b>Rather,</b> the term utensil must be referring to <b>a knife,</b> as the slaughter may be performed only with a knife and not with a sharp stone or reed. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering itself, from where do we</b> derive that it must be slaughtered with a knife? This is learned from <b>that which is written: “And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son”</b> (Genesis 22:10); <b>and there,</b> Abraham was sacrificing <b>a burnt offering, as it is written: “And offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son”</b> (Genesis 22:13).
The Gemara continues to expound the aforementioned verse (Leviticus 7:37). When the verse mentions <b>a meal offering,</b> it teaches that <b>just as a meal offering is eaten only by males of</b> the <b>priesthood</b> (see Leviticus 6:9–11), <b>so too are all</b> of the offerings mentioned in this verse <b>eaten only by males of</b> the <b>priesthood.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>what</b> offering <b>is it</b> that this <i>halakha</i> must be derived? <b>If</b> one suggests that it is with regard to the <b>sin offering and</b> the <b>guilt offering,</b>

Daf 83a

this <i>halakha</i> <b>is explicitly written</b> of them. With regard to the sin offering, it is stated: “Every male among the priests may eat it” (Leviticus 6:22), and with regard to the guilt offering, it is stated: “Every male among the priests may eat of it” (Leviticus 7:6).
<b>If</b> one suggests that the <i>halakha</i> must be derived with regard to <b>communal peace offerings,</b> i.e., the two lambs that were sacrificed as communal offerings on <i>Shavuot</i> together with the offering of the two loaves (see Leviticus 23:19), this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the <b>amplification of the verse</b> stated with regard to meal offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. The verse states: <b>“In a most sacred place shall you eat of it; every male may eat it”</b> (Numbers 18:10), and it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse <b>teaches with regard to communal peace offerings that they are eaten only by males of priestly</b> families.
The Gemara explains: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. There is</b> one <i>tanna</i> <b>who cites it,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only males of priestly families may eat of the communal peace offering, <b>from here,</b> i.e., the precedent mentioned explicitly with regard to the meal offering; <b>and there is</b> one <i>tanna</i> <b>who cites it from there,</b> i.e., the amplification of the verse stated with regard to meal offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings.
The Gemara continues expounding the verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings.” <b>“Sin offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> whatever it touches <b>is sanctified through</b> the substance that becomes <b>absorbed, so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned in this verse, whatever they touch <b>is sanctified through</b> the <b>absorbed</b> portions.
<b>“Guilt offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a guilt offering, a fetal sac and a placenta are not sacred within it,</b> because a guilt offering is always male and as such never holds a fetal sac or a placenta, <b>so too</b> for <b>any</b> of the offerings mentioned in the verse, <b>a fetal sac and a placenta are not sacred</b> if found <b>within it.</b> The Gemara notes: Evidently, this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that with regard to <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>they are sanctified</b> only <b>as they are</b> from the moment of their births, but not in utero. <b>And</b> he also holds that <b>one derives</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> so that the <i>halakha</i> of a fetal sac and a placenta in the case of female animals may be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a male animal.
<b>“Inauguration offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>inauguration offering,</b> the rams and the bread of which were brought during the seven days of inauguration of the Tabernacle and which the priests ate, <b>their leftovers</b> were disposed of <b>by incineration,</b> as is stated: “And if any of the flesh of the inauguration offering, or of the bread, remain until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire” (Exodus 29:34), <b>and</b> there were <b>no living animals</b> counted <b>among their leftovers</b> disposed of <b>by incineration, so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned, <b>their leftovers are</b> disposed of <b>by incineration, and there are no living animals</b> counted <b>among their leftovers</b> disposed of <b>by incineration.</b> Accordingly, if one sanctifies two animals so that either one may be brought if the other is lost, when one animal is sacrificed, the surviving animal is not killed and incinerated.
<b>“Peace offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>peace offering,</b> its components may <b>render</b> components of the offering <b><i>piggul</i> and</b> are <b>rendered <i>piggul</i>, so too</b> with regard to <b>all</b> offerings mentioned in this verse, their components <b>render</b> components of the offering <b><i>piggul</i> and are rendered <i>piggul</i>.</b>
§ <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> in the name of Rabbi Akiva</b> that the verse states: <b>“This is the law</b> of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the inauguration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37). From the term <b>“meal offering”</b> it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> whatever it touches <b>is sanctified through</b> the substance that becomes <b>absorbed,</b> as it is stated: “Whatever shall touch them shall be sacred” (Leviticus 6:11), <b>so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned in this verse, whatever they touch <b>is sanctified through</b> the <b>absorbed</b> portions.
The Gemara notes: <b>And it was necessary to write</b> the <i>halakha</i> of absorption <b>with regard to a sin offering, and it was necessary to write</b> the <i>halakha</i> of absorption <b>with regard to a meal offering. As, had the Merciful One written</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a meal offering,</b> I would say <b>that since it is soft, it is absorbed</b> and therefore sanctifies what it touches; <b>but</b> with regard to the meat of <b>a sin offering, I would say</b> that it does <b>not</b> sanctify what it touches. <b>And had the Merciful One written</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a sin offering,</b> I would say that it is <b>because, on account of its fattiness, the meat penetrates [<i>kadeir</i>]</b> into whatever it touches and sanctifies it; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering, I would say</b> that it does <b>not</b> sanctify what it touches. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the Torah to write both.
The cited <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Sin offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as a sin offering is brought only from non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and</b> it is sacrificed specifically <b>in the daytime, and</b> its service must be performed <b>with</b> the priest’s <b>right hand, so too all</b> offerings mentioned <b>are brought only from non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and</b> are sacrificed specifically <b>in the daytime, and</b> each one’s service must be performed <b>with</b> the priest’s <b>right hand.</b>
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering itself, from where do we</b> derive that it is brought only from non-sacred animals? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering, which is his”</b> (Leviticus 16:11). This teaches that the animal must come <b>from his</b> cattle, <b>and not from</b> money with which the second <b>tithe</b> has been redeemed.
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to derive from the <i>halakha</i> of a sin offering that an offering is sacrificed <b>in the daytime?</b> Isn’t this principle <b>derived from</b> the expression: <b>“On the day of His commanding”</b> (Leviticus 7:38), which is understood to be referring to all offerings? The Gemara answers: Indeed, the <i>baraita</i> <b>cited</b> the principle from the model of a sin offering <b>for no reason [<i>kedi</i>],</b> and it was mentioned here on account of the other principles.
The Gemara asks: Why must the <i>baraita</i> teach that the <i>halakha</i> of the sin offering teaches that the rites of offerings must be performed <b>with</b> the priest’s <b>right hand?</b> Isn’t this <b>derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana? As Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> In <b>any place</b> in the Torah <b>that it is stated</b> that an action is performed with <b>a finger, or</b> that it is performed by <b>priesthood,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the rite is performed <b>only</b> with the <b>right</b> hand. This is derived from the Torah’s statement with regard to the leper: “And the priest shall dip his right finger” (Leviticus 14:16). The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>cited</b> the principle from the model of a sin offering <b>for no reason,</b> since it is actually derived from Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s statement.
The cited <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Guilt offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a guilt offering, its bones</b> have no sanctity and <b>are permitted</b> for any use, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>any</b> mentioned offering, <b>its bones are permitted.</b>
The mishna teaches that the verse that states: “And you shall sacrifice the Paschal offering to the Lord your God, of the flock and the herd” (Deuteronomy 16:2), indicates by juxtaposition that every obligatory offering, like the Paschal offering, may be brought only from non-sacred money. The Gemara therefore asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who derives this from the verse: “This is the law of…the sin offering,” <b>that</b> verse: <b>“And you shall sacrifice the Paschal offering,”</b>

Daf 83b

<b>what does he make of it,</b> i.e., what does he derive from it? <b>He requires it for that</b> which was stated <b>by Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a leftover Paschal offering,</b> an animal consecrated but not ultimately sacrificed on Passover eve, <b>is sacrificed as a peace offering</b> afterward? It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “And you shall sacrifice the Passover offering unto the Lord, your God, of the flock and the herd.”</b> The verse is difficult: <b>But isn’t a Paschal offering brought only from the sheep and from the goats? Rather,</b> it is derived from here <b>that a leftover Paschal offering should be</b> sacrificed <b>as</b> an offering <b>brought</b> both <b>from the flock and from the herd,</b> i.e., a peace offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is it derived from here</b> that a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering? <b>It is derived from</b> the verse <b>that Shmuel’s father</b> cites: <b>As it is written:</b> “And <b>if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings</b> to the Lord <b>is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6); <b>and Shmuel’s father said:</b> This teaches that an offering <b>that is brought</b> only <b>from the flock,</b> i.e., the Paschal offering, <b>will be a sacrifice of peace offerings.</b>
<b>But still</b> it must be asked: <b>Is it derived from here? It is derived from there,</b> from the verse cited in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Even though the verse already states that peace offerings come from the flock, as it is written: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord be of the flock, male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish” (Leviticus 3:6), the verse goes on to specify: “If he bring a lamb for his offering…and if his offering be a goat” (Leviticus 3:7–12). The word <b>“lamb”</b> is written <b>to include the Paschal offering in</b> the requirement that the <b>fat tail</b> be sacrificed on the altar, which is written subsequently with regard to a peace offering (Leviticus 3:9), since this <i>halakha</i> is not mentioned in the verses concerning the Paschal offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “If</b> he brings <b>a lamb,”</b> it is <b>to include in all the mitzvot of peace offerings a Paschal offering whose</b> first <b>year has passed</b> and is therefore too old to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering, <b>and peace offerings brought due to a Paschal offering.</b> Specifically, this indicates <b>that they require placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>libations, and the waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh.</b>
<b>And when</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And <b>if</b> his offering is a <b>goat,” it interrupted the</b> previous <b>matter</b> and <b>taught that the</b> sacrifice of <b>a goat does not require</b> that the <b>fat tail</b> be burned on the altar. In any event, the verse indicates that a Paschal offering that was disqualified as such because it has reached its second year, i.e., the leftover of a Paschal offering, is sacrificed as a peace offering. It may therefore be asked: Why are there three verses to indicate this one <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Rather,</b> none of these derivations are superfluous, as <b>three verses are written</b> that teach the <i>halakha</i> that a Paschal offering that is sacrificed not on Passover eve is sacrificed as a peace offering. <b>One</b> verse teaches this <i>halakha</i> in a case where <b>its time</b> of sacrifice, Passover eve, <b>has passed, and its</b> first <b>year has</b> also <b>passed,</b> disqualifying it for sacrifice as a Paschal offering. <b>And one</b> verse teaches the <i>halakha</i> in a case where <b>its time</b> of sacrifice <b>has passed, but not its</b> first <b>year. And</b> the third <b>one</b> teaches a case where <b>neither its time</b> of sacrifice <b>nor its</b> first <b>year has passed,</b> but it was sacrificed before Passover eve.
<b>And</b> all these verses <b>are necessary. As had the Merciful One written</b> only the case <b>where</b> both <b>its</b> first <b>year and its time</b> of sacrifice <b>have passed,</b> one could say that only such a Paschal offering should be sacrificed as a peace offering, <b>as it was completely rejected from</b> its status as <b>a Paschal offering; but</b> in a case where <b>its time</b> of sacrifice <b>has passed but its</b> first <b>year</b> has <b>not</b> passed, in <b>which</b> case it is still <b>fit to</b> be sacrificed as a Paschal offering on the <b>second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, I would say</b> that it is <b>not</b> sacrificed as a peace offering.
<b>And if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us</b> only that a leftover Paschal offering <b>whose time has passed but whose year has not passed</b> is sacrificed as a peace offering, one might think that this is <b>because</b> the Paschal offering <b>was rejected from the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>; but</b> in a case <b>where neither its time</b> of sacrifice <b>nor its</b> first <b>year have passed,</b> in <b>which</b> case it is still <b>fit to</b> be sacrificed as <b>a Paschal offering</b> on Passover eve, <b>I would say</b> that it is <b>not</b> sacrificed as a peace offering. Therefore, all three verses <b>are necessary.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All communal and individual</b> meal <b>offerings</b> may <b>come from</b> produce grown in <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and from outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>from the new</b> crop, i.e., the current year’s crop, <b>and from the old</b> crop from previous years. This is the <i>halakha</i> of all meal offerings <b>except for the <i>omer</i>,</b> i.e., the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the communal offering brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>as they come only from the new</b> crop <b>and from Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>And all</b> meal offerings <b>come only from the optimal-</b>quality grain. <b>And which</b> places have the <b>optimal</b> grain <b>for them?</b> Fields in <b>Makhnis and Zateḥa</b> are the <b>primary [<i>alfa</i>]</b> source <b>for fine flour. Secondary to them</b> is <b>Aforayim in the valley.</b>
A<b>ll the regions were valid</b> as the source of the grain<b>, but</b> it is <b>from here,</b> the primary and secondary places, that <b>they would bring</b> grain, because it was of optimal quality.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the <i>omer</i> meal offering and the two loaves are prepared only from the new crop. The wording of the mishna indicates that this is an essential requirement. The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An <i>omer</i></b> meal offering <b>that comes from the old</b> crop is <b>valid.</b> Similarly, <b>the two loaves that come from the old</b> crop <b>are valid, but</b> by bringing them from the old crop one <b>lacks</b> the proper fulfillment of its <b>mitzva.</b>
The Gemara provides the biblical sources for the rulings of the <i>baraita</i>: The source for the ruling concerning the <b><i>omer</i></b> meal offering is <b>as it is written:</b> “And when you shall bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, it is ripened grain, toasted over fire, even groats of the fresh ear, <b>you shall bring the meal offering of your first fruits”</b> (Leviticus 2:14). The superfluous repetition of the term “you shall bring” teaches that the <i>omer</i> is valid <b>even</b> if brought <b>from</b> an old crop that was stored away in <b>the attic.</b>
The source for the ruling concerning the <b>two loaves</b> is <b>as it is written:</b> “And you shall offer a new meal offering to the Lord. <b>From your dwellings you shall bring</b> two wave-loaves” (Leviticus 23:16–17). The term “your dwellings” is a reference to Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, the verse indicates that the two loaves must be brought from grain grown there, <b>and not from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Furthermore, the term <b>“from your dwellings”</b> teaches that the offering may come from any grain grown in Eretz Yisrael <b>and even from</b> an old crop that was stored away in <b>the attic.</b>
The Gemara asks how two <i>halakhot</i> can be derived from the same term: <b>Didn’t you</b> already <b>expound that</b> term to teach that one can use grain only if it is grown in Eretz Yisrael? How can you also derive from it that the grain can be brought from an old crop? The Gemara explains: That is derived from the next term, as <b>the verse states:</b> “From your dwellings <b>you shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 23:17), which teaches that one may bring them from any grain grown in Eretz Yisrael <b>and even from</b> an old crop that was stored away in <b>the attic.</b>
The Gemara questions this answer: <b>But that</b> term <b>is necessary</b> to teach <b>that any</b> leavened bread offering <b>that you bring in another instance,</b> i.e., the loaves of the thanksgiving offering, <b>is to be like this</b> offering of the two loaves, i.e., the same requirements apply to it (see 77b). How, then, can you expound the term to also teach that grain from an old crop can be used for the two loaves? The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that the term is written only to teach about the requirements for other leavened bread offerings, then <b>let the verse write: You shall bring [<i>tavi</i>],</b> using the singular form. For <b>what</b> reason then, does it write: <b>“You shall bring [<i>tavi’u</i>],”</b> using the plural form? It is written so that one can <b>learn from it two</b> different <i>halakhot</i>.
The Gemara questions the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves are valid even if brought from an old crop: <b>But isn’t</b> the term <b>“first” written</b> with regard to both the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves? This indicates they must come from the new crop. The <i>omer</i> is referred to as “the first of your harvest” (Leviticus 23:10), and the two loaves are referred to as “an offering of the first” (Leviticus 2:12). The Gemara answers: The term indicates that only the new crop should be used, but that is only <b>for</b> the proper fulfillment of the <b>mitzva.</b> If an old crop was used, the offerings are still valid.
The Gemara asks: But <b>isn’t it written</b> with regard to the two loaves: <b>“A new</b> meal offering” (Leviticus 23:16), which indicates that only the new crop can be used? The fact that with regard to the two loaves the Torah repeats this requirement twice suggests that it is indispensable. The Gemara answers: The word “new” cannot teach that the use of the new crop is essential, as <b>it is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Akiva said</b> that even if <b>the two loaves are brought from the old</b> crop, they are <b>valid. How do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“A new</b> meal offering”? This teaches that the two loaves <b>are to be the first of all the</b> other <b>meal offerings.</b> No other meal offerings may be brought from the new crop until the meal offering of the two loaves has been brought.
§ The Gemara defines the limits of the dispute between the mishna and <i>baraita</i>: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> whether it is essential for the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves to be brought from <b>the new</b> crop.

Daf 84a

<b>But with regard to</b> the requirement to use grain grown in <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>they do not disagree that</b> if <b>the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves</b> come <b>from Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>indeed,</b> they are valid, but if they come <b>from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, they are <b>not</b> valid.
<b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> that <b>the <i>omer</i></b> may <b>come from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse that introduces the obligation to bring the <i>omer</i>: <b>“When you come into the land</b> which I give to you” (Leviticus 23:10)? This verse appears to indicate that the bringing of the <i>omer</i> is restricted to Eretz Yisrael. That verse teaches <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>were not obligated in</b> the mitzva of bringing <b>the <i>omer</i> before they entered Eretz</b> Yisrael.
The Gemara explains the basis of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>And he holds</b> that even <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, consuming the <b>new</b> crop <b>is</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “From all your dwellings”</b> (Leviticus 23:17), which <b>indicates</b> that the prohibition applies <b>anywhere that you dwell,</b> even outside of Eretz Yisrael. Accordingly, the earlier verse, which introduces the prohibition with: <b>“When you come</b> into the land which I give to you” (Leviticus 23:10), <b>is</b> a reference to <b>the time</b> of the Jewish people <b>entering</b> Eretz Yisrael, and it indicates that the prohibition takes effect only from that time. <b>And since</b> Rabbi Yosei holds that the new crop outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>is</b> prohibited for consumption <b>by Torah law,</b> he consequently holds that <b>one may also offer</b> the <i>omer</i> from crops grown there.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:1): The <b>guards</b> who are appointed by the court to protect some <b>of</b> the <b>produce that grew without being purposely planted [<i>sefiḥin</i>] during the Sabbatical</b> Year, in order that it can be used for the <i>omer</i> and the offering of the two loaves, <b>collect their wages from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b>
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a contradiction to Rav Ḥisda: We learned</b> in that mishna that <b>the guards of <i>sefiḥin</i> during the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>collect their wages from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> This indicates that even in the Sabbatical Year, the <i>omer</i> is brought from that year’s crop. <b>And one can raise a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the Sabbatical Year of the land shall be for you <b>for eating”</b> (Leviticus 25:6), which indicates it is to be used for eating, <b>but not for burning.</b> Accordingly, since the <i>omer</i> is burned on the altar, it should not be brought from produce of the Sabbatical Year.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: The Merciful One said to you</b> about the <i>omer</i>: “It is a statute forever <b>throughout your generations”</b> (Leviticus 23:14), indicating that the mitzva can be fulfilled in all times, <b>and you say</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>should be canceled</b> in a Sabbatical Year?
Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him: But am I saying</b> that the <i>omer</i> <b>should be canceled?</b> Certainly not. <b>Let one bring</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>from</b> grain that sprouted during <b>the previous year,</b> concerning which there is no prohibition against burning it. Rav Ḥisda rejects this suggestion: But to fulfill the mitzva <b>I require that</b> the grain be of the <b>“fresh ear”</b> (Leviticus 2:14), i.e., young grain, <b>and</b> this requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled with grain that sprouted during the previous year, as it has already been growing a long time.
Rami bar Ḥama persists: <b>But let one bring</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>from the young grain</b> that was cut during the harvest <b>of</b> the <b>previous year,</b> when it was still fresh. Rav Ḥisda rejects this suggestion: <b>The verse states: “Fresh ear, you shall bring”</b> (Leviticus 2:14). The juxtaposition of the mitzva to bring the grain with the requirement that it be young indicates that <b>I need</b> it to still be <b>young grain at the time of offering</b> it, <b>and</b> this condition <b>is not</b> fulfilled if one uses grain from the previous year’s harvest. Young grain is soft (see 66b), whereas grain that was reaped during the previous year would have become brittle.
§ An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> concerning the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>omer</i> may not be brought from the previous year’s crop: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> it is derived from: <b>“Fresh ear, you shall bring,”</b> as Rav Ḥisda explains. <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> it is derived from the fact that the <i>omer</i> is referred to as: <b>“The first of your harvest”</b> (Leviticus 23:10), which indicates that the <i>omer</i> is brought only from <b>the first of your harvest,</b> i.e., from the first produce of the current year’s crop, <b>and not from the last of your harvest,</b> i.e., from produce taken from the remainder of the previous year’s crop.
<b>Rabba raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And when you shall bring a meal offering of first fruits</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:14). <b>The verse is speaking of the <i>omer</i> meal offering. From which</b> type of grain <b>does it come?</b> It comes <b>from barley. Do you say</b> that it comes <b>from barley, or</b> does <b>it</b> come <b>only from wheat?</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that it <b>is stated “in the ear,” with regard to</b> the plague of hail in <b>Egypt:</b> “And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom” (Exodus 9:31), <b>and it is stated “in the ear”</b> with regard to the mitzva of the new crop, which is <b>for</b> all <b>generations. Just as</b> the term <b>“in the ear” that is stated with regard to</b> the plague of hail in <b>Egypt</b> is referring to <b>barley,</b> as is clear from the next verse: “But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten; for they ripen late” (Exodus 9:32), <b>so too</b> the term <b>“in the ear” that is stated</b> with regard to the new crop <b>for</b> all <b>generations</b> is referring to <b>barley.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> cites another proof that the <i>omer</i> offering is brought from barley. <b>And Rabbi Akiva says: We found an individual who brings his obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from wheat,</b> which is brought by a poor person for a false oath of testimony, a false oath of utterance, or for entering the Temple while ritually impure, <b>and</b> one who brings <b>his obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from barley,</b> in the case of a sinner’s meal offering or the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>. <b>And</b> we also found with regard to the <b>community that they bring their obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from wheat,</b> in the case of the two loaves offering of <i>Shavuot</i>, and therefore, to keep the <i>halakha</i> of the offering of a community parallel to that of an individual there should be a case where the community <b>brings their obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from barley. And if you say</b> that the <i>omer</i> offering <b>comes from wheat,</b> then <b>we</b> will <b>not</b> have <b>found</b> a case of <b>a community that brings their obligation</b> of a meal offering <b>from barley.</b> Consequently, it must be that the <i>omer</i> offering comes from barley.
Rabbi Akiva suggests another proof: <b>Alternatively, if you say</b> that the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>comes from wheat,</b> then <b>the two loaves</b> offering would <b>not</b> be brought from the <b>first fruits.</b> The verse states that the two loaves offering of <i>Shavuot</i> should come from the first fruits: “Also in the day of the first fruits, when you bring a new meal offering to the Lord in your feast of weeks” (Numbers 28:26). If the <i>omer</i> is from wheat, then the two loaves offering would not be the first offering of the first fruit, as the <i>omer</i> offering of Passover precedes it. Therefore, the <i>omer</i> offering must come from barley. Rabba explains the objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Evidently,</b> the <i>omer</i> offering is brought from the new crop <b>because</b> the grain used is referred to as <b>first fruits,</b> i.e., “the first of your harvest.” The Gemara concludes: This <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:3): <b>One may bring first fruits only from the seven species</b> with which Eretz Yisrael is praised in the verse: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8). <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b>

Daf 84b

bring them <b>from dates that</b> grow <b>in the mountains, and</b> one may <b>not</b> bring them <b>from produce that</b> grows <b>in the valleys.</b> Such produce is of inferior quality and may not be used. <b>Ulla says:</b> Even <b>if one did bring</b> such produce, <b>he does not</b> thereby <b>consecrate</b> it, i.e., it does not attain the consecrated status of first fruits.
<b>Rabba sat</b> in the study hall <b>and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Aḥa bar Abba raised an objection to Rabba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah refers to the two loaves offering as: <b>“A first offering</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11), which indicates <b>that it is to be the first of all the meal offerings</b> that come from the new crop. <b>And similarly</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>: “On the day of the first fruits, <b>when you bring a new meal offering to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:26). By designating the two loaves as “new,” the verse indicates that they should be brought from the first of the new crop.
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it must be <b>new,</b> i.e., the first, <b>of</b> all <b>wheat</b> meal offerings. <b>From where</b> do I derive that it must also be <b>new,</b> i.e., the first, <b>of</b> all <b>barley</b> meal offerings, e.g., the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>? With regard to the two loaves, <b>the verse states</b> the word <b>“new,”</b> and again states the word <b>“new,”</b> once in Numbers 28:26 and again in Leviticus 23:16. <b>If</b> the second mention <b>is not</b> needed to teach the <b>matter of</b> being the <b>new</b> meal offering <b>of wheat, apply it to the matter of</b> being the <b>new</b> meal offering <b>of barley.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the two loaves <b>precede</b> the bringing of the <b>first fruits</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “And you shall make for yourself a festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, the first fruits of the wheat harvest”</b> (Exodus 34:22). The order of the verse teaches that the offering of the Festival, which is the two loaves offering, precedes the bringing of the first fruits of the wheat harvest. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the two loaves precede the <b>first fruits of the wheat harvest. From where</b> do I derive that they also precede the bringing of the first fruits of <b>the barley harvest? The verse states</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>“And the festival of the harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you will sow in the field”</b> (Exodus 23:16). The order of the verse teaches that the offering of the Festival, which is the two loaves offering, precedes all forms of first fruits that are sown in the field, which includes barley.
From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the two loaves precede the bringing of the first fruits <b>that</b> sprouted from seeds <b>you sowed,</b> as the verse states: “Which you will sow.” <b>From where</b> do I derive that they precede even the bringing of first fruits <b>that sprouted by themselves? The</b> continuation of that <b>verse states: “In the field”</b> (Exodus 23:16). The term is superfluous and serves to include even produce that sprouted by itself.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the two loaves precede the bringing of produce that grew <b>in a field. From where</b> do I derive <b>to include</b> even produce <b>that</b> grew <b>on a roof, or that</b> grew <b>in a ruin, or that</b> grew <b>in a flowerpot, or that</b> grew <b>on a ship? The verse states</b> with regard to the priestly gifts: <b>“The first fruit of all that grows in their land,</b> which they shall bring to the Lord, shall be yours” (Numbers 18:13). The term “first fruits” in this verse is referring to all types of first fruits. This teaches that when the two loaves are referred to as the first fruits (see Exodus 34:22), the intention is that they should be brought first before all other types of produce.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the offering of the two loaves <b>is to precede</b> both <b>the</b> bringing of <b>libations</b> from grapes of the new crop <b>and</b> the bringing of the first <b>fruits of the tree? It is stated here,</b> with regard to the two loaves: <b>“The first fruits of your labors”</b> (Exodus 23:16), <b>and it is stated there</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“When you gather in the products of your labors from the field.” Just as there,</b> the term “your labors” is referring both to fruits used for <b>the libations and the fruit of the tree, so too, here,</b> the term is referring to both fruits used for <b>the libations and the fruit of the tree.</b>
Rabbi Aḥa bar Abba explains how the <i>baraita</i> poses a challenge to Ulla’s ruling: <b>In any event, it was taught</b> in this <i>baraita</i> that bringing the two loaves must precede even the bringing of produce <b>that</b> grew <b>on a roof, that</b> grew <b>in a ruin, that</b> grew <b>in a flowerpot, or that</b> grew <b>on a ship.</b> This indicates that all these types of produce are valid to be brought as first fruits, despite the fact that they are of inferior quality. This would appear to contradict Ulla’s ruling that dates that grow in the mountains and produce grown in the valleys are not fit to be brought as first fruits. Rabba explains: Whereas in the first clause, the <i>baraita</i> discusses which types of produce can be used for the first fruits, in <b>the latter clause we come to</b> discuss which grains can be used for <b>meal offerings.</b> Produce that grew in these atypical locations is valid to be brought as meal offerings, but not as first fruits.
The later clause of the <i>baraita</i> explained that the verse: “The first fruit of all that grows in their land” (Numbers 18:13), is referring to produce that grows in atypical locations. Rabba defended Ulla’s opinion by explaining that the verse concerns meal offerings only. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava objects to this: If so, that which is written</b> in the latter part of the verse: <b>“Any pure member of your household may eat of it,”</b> is difficult, as the phrase “your household” includes a priest’s wife and daughters and teaches that they may also partake of the priestly gifts referred to in the verse; <b>but if</b> the verse is referring to <b>meal offerings,</b> that is problematic <b>as they are</b> permitted <b>to be eaten</b> only <b>by male priests.</b>
In resolution of this difficulty, <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> Perforce this verse should be read as if <b>two verses are written,</b> as otherwise it contains an inherent contradiction: The first clause states: “The first fruit…<b>shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:13), indicating that only a priest himself may partake of the priestly gifts. <b>And it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“Any pure member of your household may eat of it,”</b> indicating that even female family members may partake of it. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>Here,</b> the latter part of the verse, <b>concerns the first fruits,</b> which even female family members may eat, and <b>there,</b> the first part of the verse, <b>concerns meal offerings,</b> which may be eaten only by male priests.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that there is an alternative resolution: The verse in <b>its entirety concerns meal offerings, but</b> with <b>the latter clause of the verse we come to</b> the specific case of the <b>loaves of a thanks offering,</b> which even female family members of the priest may eat.
§ The Gemara notes: Ulla and Rav Aḥa bar Abba disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> of earlier <i>amora’im</i>: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Even <b>if one did bring</b> mountain dates or valley produce as first fruits, <b>he does not</b> thereby <b>consecrate</b> them, i.e., they do not attain the sanctified status of first fruits. <b>Reish Lakish says: If one did bring</b> them, <b>he has consecrated</b> them; <b>they are regarded just like a gaunt</b> animal <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals. Although it is improper to consecrate such animals or such produce as an offering, if one does, the consecration certainly takes effect.
The Gemara discusses the dispute: <b>Granted,</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> is well founded, <b>as he stated the reason</b> for his ruling. <b>But</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> for his ruling? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> I have an explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling and since <b>I</b> was privileged to <b>see Rabbi Yoḥanan in a dream,</b> I know that <b>I am saying a proper matter. The verse states</b> with regard to first fruits: “And you shall take <b>from the first</b> of all the fruit” (Deuteronomy 26:2). The addition of the word “from” indicates that one should take from some of the first fruits, <b>but not</b> from <b>all the first</b> fruits. This teaches that one should use only the seven species for the mitzva. The verse continues: “That you shall bring <b>from your land.”</b> The addition of the word “from” indicates that one should take first fruits from some areas of the land, <b>but not</b> from <b>all</b> areas in <b>your land.</b> This teaches that one should not take dates from the mountains or produce from the valleys.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish,</b> for <b>what</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>does he use this</b> term <b>“your land”?</b> He holds that the term <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>says:</b> “From your <b>land” is stated here</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2), with regard to the first fruits, <b>and “land” is stated there</b> with regard to the praise of Eretz Yisrael: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), which are the seven species. This serves as the basis for a verbal analogy and teaches that <b>just as there,</b> the verse is referring only to the produce that is the <b>praise of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so too, here,</b> with regard to the mitzva to bring the first fruits, the verse is referring only to the produce that is the <b>praise of Eretz</b> Yisrael, i.e., the seven species.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> one, Rabbi Yoḥanan, since he has already expounded the term “from your land” to teach that one may not use mountain dates or valley produce, from where does he derive that only the seven species may be used? Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that since the Torah could have just written “your <b>land”</b> but instead writes <b>“from</b> your <b>land,”</b> the word “land” can be used to form the verbal analogy while the word “from” can teach that one may not use mountain dates or valley produce.
<b>And the other one,</b> Reish Lakish, what does he derive from the fact that the Torah adds the word “from”? <b>He does not learn</b> anything from the fact the Torah could have just written “your <b>land”</b> but instead writes <b>“from</b> your <b>land.”</b> In Hebrew, the term: From your land, is expressed by a single word: <i>Me’artzekha</i>. Reish Lakish holds that the verbal analogy uses the entire word.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to produce <b>that</b> grew <b>on a roof, or that</b> grew <b>in a ruin, or that</b> grew <b>in a flowerpot, or that</b> grew <b>on a ship,</b> the owner <b>brings</b> it to the Temple <b>and recites</b> the accompanying passage of thanks to God (see Deuteronomy 26:1–11). And <b>it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to such fruits: The owner <b>brings</b> them <b>but does not recite</b> the accompanying passage.
The Gemara attempts to reconcile the <i>baraitot</i>: <b>Granted</b> according to <b>Reish Lakish,</b> both <i>baraitot</i> accord with his opinion that even inferior produce can be brought as first fruits, and they contradict each other only with regard to whether or not one should recite the accompanying passage. And even with regard to that, the fact that the ruling of one <i>baraita</i> about produce that grew on <b>a roof</b> is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> about produce that grew on <b>a roof</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> One can explain that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the passage is recited, <b>is referring to a roof of a cave,</b> which is considered part of the ground, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the passage is not recited, <b>is referring to a roof of a house.</b>
Similarly, the fact that the ruling of one <i>baraita</i> about produce that grew in <b>a ruin</b> is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> about produce that grew in <b>a ruin</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> One can explain that <b>here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that the passage is recited, <b>is referring to a cultivated ruin,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that the passage is not recited, <b>is referring to an uncultivated ruin.</b>
And the fact that the ruling of one <i>baraita</i> about produce that grew in <b>a flowerpot</b> is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> about produce that grew in <b>a flowerpot</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> One can explain that <b>here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that the passage is recited, <b>is referring to a perforated</b> flowerpot, where the produce is able to draw nourishment from the soil beneath it, whereas <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that the passage is not recited, <b>is referring to an unperforated</b> flowerpot.
And the fact that the ruling of one <i>baraita</i> about fruit that grew on <b>a ship</b> is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> about fruit that grew on <b>a ship</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> One can explain that <b>here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that the passage is recited <b>is referring to a ship</b> made <b>of wood,</b> where the fruit were able to draw nourishment through the wood from the ground, whereas, <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that the passage is not recited <b>is referring to a ship</b> made <b>of earthenware.</b>

Daf 85a

Having reconciled all the apparent contradictions between the two <i>baraitot</i> according to the opinion of Reish Lakish, the Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds inferior produce cannot be consecrated as first fruits, the first <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult,</b> as it states that inferior produce can be consecrated.
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraitot</i> cited above contradict Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion. But there <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to this issue, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to produce <b>that</b> grew <b>on a roof, or that</b> grew <b>in a ruin,</b> the owner <b>brings</b> it <b>and recites</b> the accompanying passage. With regard to produce <b>that</b> grew <b>in a flowerpot, or that</b> grew <b>on a ship,</b> the owner <b>does not bring</b> it <b>at all.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan holds in accordance with that <i>baraita</i>.
§ The mishna states: <b>And all</b> meal offerings <b>come only from the optimal</b> produce. One of the places the mishna mentions as having good-quality produce is Aforayim. The superior quality of its produce was so well known that Aforayim was used as an example in colloquial aphorisms. In Moses and Aaron’s first meeting with Pharaoh, Aaron cast his staff to the ground, whereupon it turned into a serpent. Pharaoh’s necromancers then duplicated the feat using their incantations, only to then be confounded when Aaron’s staff swallowed up all of theirs (see Exodus 7:10–12). The Gemara relates the conversation that took place: Pharaoh’s two leading necromancers, <b>Yoḥana and Mamre, said to Moses:</b> Are <b>you are bringing straw to Afarayim?</b> Performing necromancy in Egypt, the world leader in sorcery, is like bringing straw to Afarayim, which is rich in the finest grains. Moses <b>said to them:</b> It is as <b>people say: To a city</b> rich in <b>herbs, take herbs.</b> If you want to guarantee that people will appreciate your merchandise, bring it to a place where they are familiar with it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Even when selecting grain for meal offerings from the locations mentioned in the previous mishna, <b>one may not bring</b> as a meal offering grain <b>from a fertilized field, nor from an irrigated field, nor from a field of trees,</b> as such fields do not produce grain of optimal quality. <b>But if</b> one <b>did bring</b> a meal offering of grain from such fields, it is <b>fit.</b>
<b>How does one produce</b> optimal-quality grain? <b>He plows</b> the field during the <b>first year,</b> but he does not sow it, <b>and in the second year, he sows it seventy days before Passover, and</b> in that manner <b>it produces</b> grain that will provide <b>an abundance of fine,</b> high-quality, <b>flour.</b>
<b>How does</b> the Temple treasurer <b>inspect</b> the flour to determine whether it is of sufficiently high quality? <b>The treasurer inserts his hand into</b> the flour. If, when he removes his hand, flour <b>powder covers it,</b> the flour is <b>unfit, until one sifts it</b> with a fine sifter, so that no powder will remain.
<b>And if</b> the flour <b>became wormy,</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for use in a meal offering.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <b>How does one produce</b> optimal-quality grain? <b>He plows</b> the field during the <b>first year,</b> and in the second year he sows it. The Gemara clarifies what should be done in the second year: <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What</b> is the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying?</b> Is he saying that <b>he plows</b> the field during the <b>first</b> year, <b>and</b> in the <b>second</b> year <b>he plows it and sows it? Or perhaps</b> he is saying that <b>he plows</b> the field during the <b>first</b> year, <b>and</b> in the <b>second</b> year <b>he sows it without plowing it.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Also</b> concerning <b>grain</b> grown in <b>Kerazayim and Kefar Aḥim, if only</b> those places <b>had been close to Jerusalem, they would have brought</b> barley <b>from them</b> for the <i>omer</i>. <b>As</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that one brings the <i>omer</i> only from the southern fields and</b> those <b>that were plowed for that</b> purpose, <b>as upon such</b> fields, the <b>sun rises</b> and shines, <b>and from those</b> fields, the <b>sun</b> also <b>sets.</b> In other words, those fields are exposed to a lot of sunlight, so they produce a superior-quality crop. Kerazayim and Kefar Aḥim were such fields, but they were too far from Jerusalem for their barley to be used for the <i>omer</i> offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How does one produce</b> optimal-quality grain? <b>He plows</b> the field during the <b>first year, and</b> in the <b>second</b> year, he <b>plows</b> it once <b>and</b> then <b>repeats</b> the plowing a second time, <b>and he sows it seventy days before Passover.</b> It is done this way <b>in order that</b> the sowing <b>will be</b> done <b>close to</b> the time when the strength of the <b>sun</b> reaches its climax, <b>and</b> will thereby <b>produce</b> a high-quality crop in which the length of <b>a stalk</b> is <b>a handspan and</b> the <b>ear</b> itself is <b>two handspans.</b>
<b>And</b> then one <b>reaps</b> the grain <b>and gathers</b> it together into a pile, <b>and</b> then he <b>threshes</b> the grain <b>and winnows</b> it, <b>and</b> then he <b>sorts</b> the inedible admixture from the edible grain, <b>and</b> then he <b>grinds</b> the grain <b>and sifts</b> it <b>and brings</b> the flour produced <b>to the</b> Temple <b>treasurer. And</b> the <b>treasurer inserts his hand into it</b> in order to check its quality. <b>If</b> upon removing his hand <b>powder covers it,</b> the treasurer <b>says to</b> the owner: <b>Go back and sift it a second</b> time. The Sages <b>say in the name of Rabbi Natan</b> that <b>the treasurer</b> would perform a more thorough examination of the flour’s quality. He <b>douses his hand</b> with <b>oil and</b> then <b>inserts it into</b> the flour <b>until all of its powder will be brought up.</b>
The Gemara explains that the <i>baraita</i> provides a resolution to the dilemma: <b>In any event, the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that during the second year, the owner of the field <b>plows</b> it once <b>and</b> then <b>repeats</b> the plowing. It is explicit, then, that during the second year the field should be plowed.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But</b> even <b>according to your reasoning,</b> ultimately <b>the mishna does not teach</b> that he plows the field and then <b>repeats</b> the plowing;

Daf 85b

it is only <b>the <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>teaches</b> that he plows and then <b>repeats</b> the plowing. It would appear, then, that the mishna and <i>baraita</i> express different opinions, and it may be that according to the mishna one does not need to plow in the second year at all.
The Gemara dismisses this suggestion: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult;</b> it is possible that the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> do not disagree, and <b>here,</b> the mishna, which does not require plowing a second time, <b>is referring to a cultivated</b> field, whereas <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is referring to an uncultivated</b> field, and therefore it requires that the field be plowed a second time.
The Gemara concludes: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For the first year, <b>one plows</b> the entire field during the first <b>half of</b> the year, <b>and</b> then he <b>sows half of</b> the field, leaving the other half fallow. For the second year, one again <b>plows</b> the entire field during the first <b>half of</b> the year, <b>and</b> then he <b>sows</b> the <b>half of</b> the field that was left fallow in the previous year. It is evident from this <i>baraita</i> that during the second year as well, the field is plowed before it is sown.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One brings the <i>omer</i> only from</b> the <b>southern fields of Eretz Yisrael, as upon those</b> fields, the <b>sun rises</b> and shines, <b>and from those</b> fields, the <b>sun</b> also <b>sets.</b> Those fields are exposed to abundant sunlight, and so they produce a superior-quality crop.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says</b> that <b>the <i>omer</i> would come from</b> grain grown in <b>the valley of Beit Mikle.</b> The field there <b>was about three <i>se’a</i>, and it was a southern field, and</b> the <b>sun would rise</b> and shine <b>upon it, and</b> the <b>sun would set from it.</b> During the first year, the farmer <b>plowed</b> the entire field during the first <b>half of</b> the year, <b>and</b> he then <b>sowed half of</b> the field, leaving the other half fallow. During the second year, he again <b>plowed</b> the entire field during the first <b>half of</b> the year, <b>and</b> he then <b>sowed</b> the <b>half of</b> the field that was left fallow in the previous year.
The Gemara demonstrates the efficacy of this method: <b>Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tovi had a tract of land. He plowed</b> the field during the first <b>half of</b> the year <b>and</b> then <b>sowed half of</b> it. The next year, <b>he plowed</b> the field during the first <b>half of</b> the year <b>and</b> then <b>sowed</b> the other <b>half of it. And</b> this method was so effective that his field <b>produced twice</b> as much wheat as other fields its size, <b>and</b> it was of such a superior quality that <b>he sold</b> the <b>wheat</b> to be used <b>as fine flour [<i>lismida</i>]</b> for the meal offerings in the Temple.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if</b> the flour <b>became wormy,</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for use in a meal offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Fine flour the majority of which became wormy</b> is <b>unfit. And</b> similarly, <b>wheat</b> kernels <b>the majority of which became wormy</b> are <b>unfit,</b> and they may not be used to produce fine flour for meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asks:</b> What is the meaning of this latter ruling? Is it saying only that if the <b>majority of</b> an individual <b>wheat</b> kernel becomes wormy the flour produced from it is unfit, <b>or</b> is it saying that when the <b>majority of a <i>se’a</i></b> of kernels becomes wormy the entire <i>se’a</i> is <b>unfit?</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava asks:</b> If <b>one consecrated</b> grains of wormy wheat for use in a meal offering, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he should be flogged for</b> consecrating <b>them due to</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item as an offering? One is flogged for consecrating a blemished animal as an offering (see <i>Temura</i> 6b); does the same apply to consecrating wormy wheat? Does one say that <b>since</b> the wheat is <b>unfit,</b> it is <b>comparable to a blemished</b> animal? <b>Or perhaps,</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item <b>applies only to an animal.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Middot</i> 2:5) with regard to the wood logs that are burned on the altar: Priests inspect them before they are used and <b>any log in which a worm is found</b> is <b>unfit for</b> use <b>on the altar.</b> In reference to this mishna, <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a wet</b> log, as a wormy section cannot be removed. <b>But</b> if a wormy section is found in <b>a dry</b> log, the priest <b>scrapes</b> the wormy spot <b>away, and</b> the log is <b>fit</b> for use.
<b>Rava asks:</b> If <b>one consecrated</b> a wormy log to be used on the altar, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he should be flogged for</b> consecrating <b>it due to</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item as an offering? Does one say that <b>since</b> the log is <b>unfit,</b> it is <b>comparable to a blemished</b> animal? <b>Or perhaps,</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item <b>applies only to an animal.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Olive trees in <b>Tekoa</b> are the <b>primary</b> source <b>of oil</b> to be used in meal offerings. <b>Abba Shaul says: Secondary to</b> Tekoa <b>is Regev on the</b> east <b>bank of the Jordan</b> River. <b>All the regions were valid</b> for oil to be brought from them, <b>but</b> it was <b>from here</b> that <b>they would bring</b> it.
<b>One may not bring</b> a meal offering containing oil from olives taken <b>from a fertilized</b> olive <b>grove, nor</b> from olives taken <b>from an irrigated</b> olive <b>grove, nor</b> from olives taken <b>from</b> an olive grove where grain <b>was sown between</b> the trees. <b>But if one did bring</b> a meal offering containing oil from such groves, it is <b>valid. One may not bring</b> a meal offering containing oil from <b>unripe olives [<i>anpiktan</i>], but if one did bring</b> it, it is <b>valid. One may not bring</b> a meal offering containing oil <b>from olives that were soaked in water, nor from pickled</b> olives, <b>nor from boiled</b> olives, <b>and</b> even if <b>one did bring</b> it, it is <b>not valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara notes the effect of Tekoa’s oil on those living there: The verse states: <b>“And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched from there a wise woman”</b> (II Samuel 14:2). <b>What is different</b> about <b>Tekoa</b> that Joab chose to bring a woman from there? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Since</b> the residents of Tekoa <b>are accustomed to</b> use <b>olive oil, wisdom is prevalent there.</b>
§ The Gemara digresses to discuss the tribal portion of Asher, in which the city of Tekoa is located: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In his blessing to the tribe of Asher, Moses said: “He will be pleasing to his brothers, <b>and immerse his foot in oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:24). <b>This</b> is referring to <b>the portion of Asher, as the oil flows</b> there <b>like a spring.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>They said</b> that <b>once, the people of Laodicea were in need of oil. They appointed</b> a gentile <b>messenger [<i>polmostos</i>]</b> and <b>said to him: Go and bring us one million</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil.</b>
<b>He</b> first <b>went to Jerusalem</b> to procure the oil, but residents there did not have that quantity of oil. <b>They said to him: Go to Tyre,</b> which was a commercial city. <b>He went to Tyre,</b> but they also did not have enough oil. <b>They said to him: Go to Gush Ḥalav,</b> which is located in the portion of Asher. <b>He went to Gush Ḥalav,</b> and <b>they said to him: Go to so-and-so, to that field.</b> He went there <b>and found</b> someone <b>hoeing [<i>ozek</i>] under his olive trees.</b> The messenger <b>said to</b> that man: <b>Do you have</b> the <b>one million</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil that I need?</b> The man <b>said to him: Wait for me until I complete my labor,</b> i.e., hoeing. The messenger <b>waited until</b> the man <b>completed his labor.</b>
<b>After he completed his labor,</b> the man <b>slung his tools</b> over his shoulders <b>behind him,</b> a manner typical of poor laborers, and started walking, <b>and he was removing stones</b> from his orchard <b>as he went along the path.</b> Upon seeing this behavior, which suggested the man was merely a laborer, the messenger questioned whether the man was truly able to provide him with the oil. <b>He said to</b> the man: Can it be that <b>you</b> really <b>have</b> the <b>one million</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil that I need? It seems to me that the Jews</b> of Gush Ḥalav <b>are making a laughingstock of me</b> by sending me here. <b>When he reached his city,</b> the man’s <b>maidservant brought out to him a kettle [<i>kumkemos</i>] of hot</b> water, <b>and he washed his hands and his feet.</b> Afterward, <b>she brought out to him a golden basin filled with oil, in which he immersed his hands and feet, in fulfillment of that</b> which <b>is stated</b> with regard to the Tribe of Asher: <b>“And immerse his foot in oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:24).
<b>After they ate and drank,</b> the man <b>measured out</b> for the messenger <b>one million</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil.</b> The man <b>said to him:</b> Are you sure that <b>you do not need any more</b> oil? The messenger <b>said to him: Yes,</b> I do need more, <b>but I do not have</b> the <b>money</b> for it. The man <b>said to him: If you wish to take</b> more oil, <b>take</b> it <b>and I will go</b> back to Laodicea <b>with you and collect the money</b> for the extra oil there. The messenger agreed and the man <b>measured out</b> an additional <b>180,000</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil.</b> Concerning this incident, people <b>said:</b> The messenger had such an enormous burden of oil that <b>he left neither a horse, nor a mule, nor a camel, nor a donkey in</b> all of <b>Eretz Yisrael that he did not rent</b> in order to help transport the oil back to Laodicea.
<b>When</b> the messenger finally <b>reached his city, the people of his city came out to praise him [<i>lekaleso</i>]</b> for achieving this tremendous feat. The messenger <b>said to them: Do not praise me. Rather,</b> praise <b>this</b> man <b>who has come with me, as</b> it is <b>he</b> who <b>measured for me one million</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil, and he extended a debt to me for 180,000</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil.</b> This incident was <b>in fulfillment of that</b> which <b>is stated: “There is one who seems to be rich, yet has nothing; there is one who seems to be poor, yet has great wealth”</b> (Proverbs 13:7).
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> a meal offering containing oil made from olives <b>from a fertilized</b> olive <b>grove.</b> The mishna continues to state that one may not bring a meal offering containing oil from unripe olives, and, according to one version of the mishna’s text, it adds that even if one did bring a meal offering containing such oil, it is not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not bring</b> a meal offering containing oil made from <b>unripe olives,</b>

Daf 86a

<b>but if one did bring</b> a meal offering made of such oil, <b>it is not valid. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one did bring it, it is valid, <b>because it is</b> regarded merely as <b>sap</b> and not as oil? This contradicts this mishna, which assumes that it is regarded as oil.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>not difficult</b> to resolve this contradiction. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> and <b>that</b> mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya would toss</b> such oil <b>away,</b> as he did not consider it to be oil, <b>and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>would dip</b> his food into it, as he considered it to be oil. The Gemara concludes: <b>And your mnemonic</b> by which to remember their respective opinions is: The <b>wealthy are parsimonious,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, was wealthy, and he did not toss the oil away.
§ The Gemara digresses to discuss oil of myrrh: In describing the treatments provided to the women in preparation for their meeting with King Ahasuerus, the verse states: “For so were the days of their anointing accomplished: <b>Six months with oil of myrrh,</b> and six months with sweet odors and with other ointments of the women” (Esther 2:12). The Gemara asks: <b>What is “oil of myrrh”? Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says:</b> It is the aromatic oil called <b><i>setakhta</i>. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> It is <b>an oil</b> derived <b>from olives that have not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of their growth; the acidic oil is effective as a depilatory.
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> explanation of Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The term <b><i>anpikanon</i></b> is referring to <b>olive oil</b> produced from olives <b>that have not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of their growth. And <b>why do</b> women <b>spread it</b> on their bodies? They do so <b>because it removes the hair and pampers the skin.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> meal offerings containing oil <b>from olives that were soaked in water,</b> nor from pickled olives, nor from boiled olives, and even if one did bring it, it is not valid. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Olive oil</b> produced from <b>pickled</b> olives, <b>boiled</b> olives, or olives <b>soaked</b> in water, <b>and</b> oil made <b>from</b> olive <b>sediment, and</b> oil <b>with a foul odor may not be brought</b> as part of a meal offering, <b>and</b> even <b>if one did bring</b> it, it is <b>not valid.</b>
<b>Rava asks:</b> If one <b>consecrated</b> one of these unfit oils for use in meal offerings, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he should be flogged for</b> consecrating <b>it due to</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item as an offering? Does one say that <b>since it</b> is <b>unfit,</b> it is <b>comparable to a blemished</b> animal? <b>Or perhaps</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item <b>applies only to an animal.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are three</b> harvests of <b>olives</b> each year, <b>and in each</b> of <b>them, three</b> different grades of <b>oils</b> are produced.
How is <b>the first olive</b> harvest processed? <b>One picks</b> the ripe olives <b>at the top of the olive</b> tree, as those are the first to ripen, <b>and crushes</b> them in a mortar <b>and places</b> them <b>inside</b> the bottom of a wicker <b>basket</b> that has many small holes in it. The oil will then drip from the olives through those holes into a vessel placed underneath the basket. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One positions the olives on the walls, <b>surrounding the basket.</b> This produces more refined oil, as the dregs stick to the walls of the basket. <b>This is the first</b> grade of oil produced from the first harvest.
After the oil ceases to seep from the crushed olives, <b>one then presses down with</b> a wooden <b>beam</b> upon them, causing additional oil to flow from the basket into the vessel. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The excessive pressure produced by pressing down with a beam would cause some of the flesh of the olives to get mixed in with the oil, compromising its quality. Rather, one applies pressure <b>by</b> placing <b>stones</b> upon the olives. <b>This is the second</b> grade of oil.
<b>One then ground</b> the olives with a millstone <b>and pressed down</b> with a beam on those olives to extract any remaining oil; <b>this is the third</b> grade of oil.
<b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum,</b> which requires: “Refined olive oil” (Leviticus 24:2), <b>and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>
How is <b>the second</b> olive harvest processed? <b>One picks</b> the crop of olives that is accessible while one is standing <b>on the rooftop.</b> This was the second lot of olives to ripen. <b>And one crushes</b> it in a mortar <b>and places</b> those olives <b>into</b> a wicker <b>basket,</b> allowing the oil to drip through the holes into a vessel underneath. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One positions the olives on the walls, <b>surrounding the basket. This</b> is the <b>first</b> grade of oil from the second harvest.
<b>One</b> then <b>presses down</b> upon those olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam,</b> thereby producing more oil. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One applies pressure only <b>by</b> placing <b>stones</b> upon them. <b>This</b> is the <b>second</b> grade of oil.
<b>One then ground</b> the olives with a millstone <b>and pressed down</b> upon them with a beam, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this</b> is the <b>third</b> grade of oil.
<b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>
How is the <b>third</b> olive harvest processed? This harvest consists of all the olives that still remain on trees. <b>One packs it into a vat [<i>oteno</i>] in</b> the building that houses <b>the olive press [<i>beit habbad</i>]</b> where it remains <b>until it softens, and</b> then <b>one raises</b> it <b>up</b> to the roof <b>and dries it on the rooftop</b> to remove the foul-smelling liquid secreted from the olives while in the vat. Then, <b>one crushes</b> the olives in a mortar <b>and places</b> them <b>into</b> a wicker <b>basket,</b> allowing the oil to drip through the holes into a vessel underneath. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One positions them on the walls, <b>surrounding the basket. This</b> is <b>the first</b> grade of oil.
<b>One</b> then <b>presses down</b> on those olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam,</b> thereby producing more oil. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One applies pressure only <b>by</b> placing <b>stones</b> upon them. <b>This</b> is the <b>second</b> grade of oil.
<b>One would then grind</b> the olives with a millstone <b>and press down</b> upon them with a beam, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this</b> is the <b>third</b> grade of oil.
<b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the correct text of the mishna? Do <b>we learn</b> that <b>one picks</b> the olives at the top <b>[<i>megargero</i>],</b> i.e., one selects those that are ripe, <b>or</b> do <b>we learn</b> that <b>one allows</b> all the olives <b>to ripen [<i>megalgelo</i>],</b> and then picks them all?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution to this dilemma from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states that the olive oil used for the kindling of the Candelabrum is to be: “Refined <b>oil of an olive”</b> (Exodus 27:20), which is interpreted to mean that the olives should be so ripe that the oil drips <b>from</b> them while they are still hanging on <b>their olive tree,</b> without them needing to be pressed. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that for the <b>first olive</b> harvest, <b>one allows</b> all the olives <b>to ripen [<i>megalgelo</i>],</b> picks the entire crop <b>and brings it into the olive press, and</b> he <b>grinds it with a millstone and places it in</b> wicker <b>baskets, and this oil that would flow from it would be</b> the <b>first</b> grade of oil.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Then <b>one presses down</b> upon the olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam.</b> As for the <b>oil that flows from it, this would be</b> the <b>second</b> grade of oil. And <b>then one would remove</b> the crushed olives from the baskets <b>and grind</b> them, <b>and press down</b> upon them with a beam or stones, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this would be</b> the <b>third</b> grade of oil. <b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings. And</b> the same process was <b>similarly</b> used for the <b>second olive</b> harvest.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> for the <b>third olive</b> harvest, the entire crop <b>is packed into a vat in</b> the building that houses <b>the olive press,</b> where it remains <b>until it softens, and</b> then <b>one raises</b> it <b>up to the roof and makes it</b> into <b>a sort of heap,</b> wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, and leaves it there <b>until the fluid</b> it produced while in the vat <b>flows away. And</b> then <b>one brings it to the olive press and grinds it with a millstone and places it into</b> wicker <b>baskets.</b> As for the <b>oil that would</b> then <b>flow from it, this would be</b> the <b>first</b> grade of oil.
Then <b>one presses down</b> upon it <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam.</b> As for the <b>oil that would</b> then <b>flow from it, this would be</b> the <b>second</b> grade of oil. <b>And then one would remove</b> the crushed olives from the baskets <b>and grind</b> them, <b>and press down</b> upon them with a beam or stones, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this would be</b> the <b>third</b> grade of oil. <b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees with the Rabbis and <b>says: One does not grind</b> the crop of olives <b>with a millstone; rather, one crushes it in a mortar. And one does not press down</b> upon the olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam; rather,</b> one presses on them <b>with stones. And one does not place</b> the olives <b>into</b> the bottom of <b>the</b> wicker <b>baskets; rather,</b> one positions them on the inner walls of the basket, all <b>around the basket.</b> In this <i>baraita</i>, the term: One allows all the olives to ripen [<i>megalgelo</i>], is used.
Having resolved the dilemma based on the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara now clarifies the ruling of the mishna in light of it. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as the first <i>tanna</i> teaches that the olives should be crushed. From the <i>baraita</i> it is evident that <b>whose</b> opinion is it that the olives are <b>crushed? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Yet, when the first <i>tanna</i> states that the olives are placed <b>inside</b> the bottom <b>of the basket,</b> and not on its walls, <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda in the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>This <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda <b>with regard to one</b> issue, i.e., the need to crush the olives, <b>but disagrees with him with regard to another</b> issue, i.e., he holds that the olives should be placed inside the basket, not on its walls.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Having enumerated the nine grades of oils in the previous mishna, this mishna proceeds to rank them by their quality: As for <b>the first</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the first</b> harvest, <b>there is none superior to it. The second</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the first</b> harvest <b>and the first</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the second</b> harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality; there is no reason to choose one over the other. <b>The third</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the first</b> harvest <b>and the second</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the second</b> harvest <b>and the first</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the third</b> harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality. <b>The third</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the second</b> harvest <b>and the second</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the third</b> harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality. As for <b>the third</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the third</b> harvest, <b>there is none inferior to it.</b>
<b>Also,</b> with regard to <b>all the meal offerings, it was logical that they should require</b> the highest quality of <b>refined olive oil,</b> just like the Candelabrum. Because <b>if</b> the <b>Candelabrum, whose</b> oil <b>is not to be consumed</b> on the altar, <b>requires refined olive oil,</b> then <b>meal offerings, which</b> are <b>to be consumed</b> on the altar, <b>is it not logical that they should require refined olive oil?</b> To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states: “Refined pounded</b> olive oil <b>for illumination”</b> (Leviticus 24:2), which indicates that the high-quality, refined, pounded oil is required for the Candelabrum, <b>but there is no</b> need for <b>refined pounded</b> olive oil <b>for meal offerings.</b>

Daf 86b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: How can the mishna state that the second grade of the first harvest and the first grade of the second harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality? <b>But didn’t you say</b> that the <b>first</b> grade of each harvest is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum and the rest</b> are fit only <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings?</b> It would appear then that the first grade in any harvest is actually superior to the second grade of other harvests. To resolve this, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What</b> does the mishna mean when it states that <b>they are</b> of <b>equal</b> quality? It means that <b>they are equal with regard to meal offerings,</b> and there is no reason to choose one over the other.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Also</b> with regard to <b>all the meal offerings, it was logical</b> that they should require refined olive oil. To dispel this notion, the verse states: “Refined pounded olive oil for illumination” (Leviticus 24:2). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse cited in the mishna: The word <b>“refined”</b> means <b>nothing other than clean</b> oil, which flows by itself from the olives without applying any pressure. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the word <b>“pounded”</b> means <b>nothing other than</b> olives <b>crushed</b> with a mortar, but not with a millstone.
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>refined, pounded</b> oil <b>is unfit for meal offerings,</b> since the verse specifies that this oil is to be used for illumination. To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering brought with the daily offering: <b>“And a tenth of fine flour, thoroughly mixed with</b> a quarter of a <i>hin</i> of <b>pounded oil”</b> (Exodus 29:40). This indicates that pounded oil is fit to be used in meal offerings. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> that the refined pounded oil is <b>“for illumination”? Rather,</b> the Torah requires the use of refined pounded oil only for the Candelabrum, <b>due to the sparing [<i>haḥisakhon</i>]</b> of money, as the highest-quality oil is very expensive.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason for being <b>sparing? Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The intention is that <b>the Torah spared the money of the Jewish people</b> and did not require that the highest-quality oil be used for the meal offerings.
§ The Gemara discusses the Candelabrum and other aspects of the Temple. The verse states: <b>“Command the children of Israel, and they shall take for yourself refined pounded olive oil</b> for illumination, to kindle the lamps continually” (Leviticus 24:2). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> God tells the Jewish people that the oil should be taken <b>“for yourself,”</b> to indicate that it is for their benefit <b>and not for My</b> benefit, as <b>I do not need its light.</b>
Similarly, with regard to the <b>Table</b> of the shewbread, located <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>and</b> the <b>Candelabrum,</b> located <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>Rabbi Zerika says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> God said to the Jewish people: <b>I do not require</b> the Table <b>for eating, nor do I require</b> the Candelabrum <b>for its illumination.</b> In evidence of this, the Candelabrum was not positioned close to the Table, as is done by one who sets a table with food in order to eat there.
With regard the Temple built by King Solomon, the verse states: <b>“And he made for the House, windows narrow and broad”</b> (I Kings 6:4). The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Typically, windows are constructed to widen toward the inside in order that the light from the outside would be dispersed throughout the room. For the Temple, God said: Make the windows <b>narrow within and broad without,</b> as <b>I do not require its illumination.</b> On the contrary, the light of the Temple is to be radiated outward.
God instructed Aaron to kindle the Candelabrum: <b>“Outside the Curtain of the testimony in the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 24:3). The dividing curtain is referred to here as: The Curtain of the testimony, to indicate that the illumination of the Candelabrum <b>is testimony to all of humanity that the Divine Presence rests among the Jewish people.</b>
<b>And if you</b> question this and <b>say:</b> How is this testimony; perhaps the Candelabrum is lit for illumination? To this God would respond: Do <b>I need its light? But isn’t</b> it so that for <b>all forty years that</b> the <b>Jewish people walked in the wilderness</b> of Sinai until they entered Eretz Yisrael, <b>they walked exclusively by His light,</b> i.e., from the pillar of fire that guided them at night. If God provides light for others, he certainly does not need it Himself. <b>Rather,</b> evidently, the illumination of the Candelabrum <b>is testimony to all of humanity that the Divine Presence rests among the Jewish people.</b>
<b>What</b> provides <b>its testimony? Rava says:</b> The testimony <b>is</b> provided by <b>the westernmost lamp</b> of the Candelabrum, <b>in which they place</b> a quantity of <b>oil equivalent</b> to that placed in <b>the other</b> lamps, <b>and</b> nevertheless it continues to burn longer than any of the other lamps. It burns so long that every evening, <b>from it</b> the priest <b>would kindle</b> the Candelabrum, i.e., he lit that westernmost lamp first, <b>and</b> the following morning, <b>with it he would conclude</b> the preparation of the lamps for the following evening’s lighting, because it remained alight longer than any of the other lamps. This perpetual miracle was testimony to God’s continuous presence among His people.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From where would they bring the wine</b> for libations? <b>Keduḥim and Attulin</b> are the <b>primary</b> sources <b>for wine. Secondary to them</b> is <b>Beit Rima and Beit Lavan,</b> located <b>in the mountain, and</b> the <b>village of Signa,</b> located <b>in the valley. All the regions were valid</b> sources for wine; <b>but</b> it was <b>from here,</b> i.e., the aforementioned locations, that <b>they would bring</b> the wine.
<b>One may not bring</b> libations of wine that come <b>from a fertilized vineyard, or from an irrigated vineyard, or from</b> a vineyard in <b>which</b> grain <b>was sown between</b> the vines. <b>But if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>valid. One may not bring</b> libations from <b>sweet wine made from sun-dried grapes [<i>hilyasteyon</i>], but if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>valid. One may not bring</b> wine <b>aged</b> for one year; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but the Rabbis deem it valid. One may not bring</b> libations from <b>sweet</b> wine, <b>nor</b> from wine produced from <b>smoked</b> grapes, <b>nor</b> libations <b>from boiled</b> wine, <b>and if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>not valid. And one may not bring</b> wine produced from <b>grapes suspended</b> on stakes or trees; <b>rather,</b> one brings it <b>from grapes at foot</b> height, i.e., that rest on the ground, which are superior-quality grapes, and from <b>vineyards that are cultivated,</b> i.e., where one hoes beneath the vines twice a year.
<b>And</b> when producing wine for libations, <b>one should not collect</b> the wine <b>into large barrels,</b> as it causes the wine to spoil; <b>rather,</b> it should be placed <b>in small casks. And one does not fill up</b> the cask <b>until its mouth;</b> rather, one leaves some empty space <b>so that its fragrance will</b> collect there and <b>diffuse</b> when the lid is opened.
<b>One should not bring</b> libations <b>from</b> wine that rests at the <b>mouth of</b> the cask <b>due to</b>

Daf 87a

<b>the flour-</b>like white scum that floats on the surface, <b>nor from</b> the wine at <b>bottom of</b> the cask <b>due to the sediment</b> that collects there. <b>Rather, one brings from</b> the wine in <b>its middle third.</b>
<b>How does</b> the Temple treasurer <b>inspect</b> the wine to determine that it is from the middle of the cask? <b>The treasurer sits</b> alongside the cask <b>and</b> has <b>the</b> measuring <b>reed in his hand.</b> The spigot is opened and the wine begins to flow. When he sees that the wine emerging <b>draws</b> with it <b>chalk</b>-like scum <b>[<i>hagir</i>], he</b> immediately <b>knocks with the reed</b> to indicate that the spigot should be closed.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> Wine <b>in which there is flour-</b>like white scum is <b>unfit</b> for libations, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to animal offerings: <b>“Unblemished they shall be for you…and their meal offering</b> shall be fine flour mixed with <b>oil…unblemished they shall be for you, and their libations”</b> (Numbers 28:19–20, 31). This indicates that animal offerings, meal offerings, and libations must all be brought from flawless products. Therefore, the presence of flour-like white scum in wine renders it unfit.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> libations from <b>sweet</b> wine, <b>nor</b> from <b>boiled</b> wine, <b>nor</b> from wine produced from <b>smoked</b> grapes, <b>and if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>not valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the first clause teach: One may not bring libations from sweet wine made from sun-dried grapes, but if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine it is <b>valid?</b> How can one clause teach that a libation of one type of sweet wine is valid, and the other clause teach that a libation of another type of sweet wine is not valid?
<b>Ravina said:</b> The text of the mishna is corrupt. To correct it, <b>combine</b> the two clauses into one <b>and teach</b> with regard to all the wines mentioned that they are unfit to be used for libations. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The text of the mishna is correct. The reason for the difference between the two wines is that <b>the sweetness</b> of grapes sweetended <b>by the sun is not objectionable,</b> so libations of wine made from such grapes are valid, while <b>sweetness</b> that results from the sugars <b>of the fruit</b> itself <b>is objectionable,</b> so libations of wine made from such grapes are not valid.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> wine <b>aged</b> for one year; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but the Rabbis deem it valid.</b> The Gemara provides the source for Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling. <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiyya said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the libations that accompany the New Moon offering: “And their libations: Half a <i>hin</i> for a bull, a third of a <i>hin</i> for a ram, and a quarter of a <i>hin</i> <b>for a lamb, of wine”</b> (Numbers 28:14). The juxtaposition of the terms lamb and wine teaches that <b>just as a lamb</b> is fit to be used as an offering only if brought <b>in its</b> first <b>year, so too wine</b> is fit to be used as a libation only if it is <b>in its</b> first <b>year.</b>
The Gemara ask: <b>If</b> so, take the analogy further and conclude that <b>just as</b> if one offers <b>a lamb in</b> its <b>second year,</b> it is <b>not valid, so too</b> a libation of <b>wine in</b> its <b>second year</b> is <b>not valid. And if you would say</b> that this is <b>indeed</b> the <i>halakha</i>, that is difficult: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>wine in</b> its <b>second year may not be brought</b> <i>ab initio</i>, but <b>if one did bring it</b> as a libation, it is <b>valid?</b> That <i>baraita</i> certainly expresses the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>whom did you hear who said</b> that aged wine <b>may not be brought?</b> Only <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who explicitly states this opinion in the mishna. <b>And yet he says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one did bring</b> a libation of aged wine, it is <b>valid.</b> According to Rabbi Ḥizkiyya’s explanation of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, such an opinion is illogical.
<b>Rather, Rava said: This is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse exhorting a person not to be enticed by fine wines: <b>“Look not upon the wine when it is red”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). Evidently, the redness of wine is indicative of its quality. After a year, wine begins to lose its redness and so it should not be used, <i>ab initio</i>. Nevertheless, it is still of a sufficient quality to be acceptable, after the fact.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> wine produced from <b>grapes suspended</b> on stakes or trees; rather, one brings wine produced from grapes at foot height and from vineyards that are cultivated. The definition of vineyards that are cultivated is clarified in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>taught: Vineyards that are cultivated twice a year.</b> This is done by hoeing the earth underneath the vines.
The Gemara relates the efficacy of cultivating the land twice a year: <b>Rav Yosef had a tract</b> of land <b>that was</b> used <b>an orchard [<i>depardeisa</i>]</b> to <b>which he</b> used to <b>give an extra hoeing, and</b> consequently <b>it produced wine</b> of such superior quality that when preparing the wine for drinking it required <b>a dilution using twice</b> the amount <b>of water</b> than that which is usually used to dilute wine.
§ The mishna teaches: When people produced wine for libations <b>they would not collect</b> the wine <b>into large barrels,</b> as it causes the wine to spoil; rather, it would be placed in small casks. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>casks</b> referred to by the mishna are <b>flasks</b> that are made in <b>Lod and</b> that <b>are medium-sized.</b>
The Gemara adds another <i>halakha</i>: When storing casks containing wine for libations, <b>they should not be placed in twos,</b> i.e., one atop the other, but <b>rather singly,</b> i.e., each one should be placed separately.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How does</b> the Temple treasurer <b>inspect</b> wine to determine that it is from the middle of the cask? The <b>treasurer sits</b> alongside the cask <b>and</b> has <b>the</b> measuring <b>reed in his hand.</b> The spigot is opened and the wine begins to flow. If he sees that the wine emerging <b>draws</b> with it <b>chalk</b>-like scum, <b>he</b> immediately <b>knocks with the reed</b> to indicate that the spigot should be closed. The precise point at which he knocks is clarified in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>taught:</b> If the wine <b>draws</b> with it <b>chalk</b>-like scum, which comes <b>from the sediment, he knocks with the reed.</b>
The Gemara challenges: Why does the treasurer knock with the reed; <b>let him</b> simply <b>speak.</b> The Gemara explains: This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Just as speech is beneficial to the</b> incense <b>spices, so is speech detrimental to wine,</b> and so the treasurer avoids speaking.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> Wine in which there is flour-like white scum is unfit for libations. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma</b> concerning such wine: If <b>one consecrated it</b> to be used as a libation, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he should be flogged for</b> consecrating <b>it due to</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item as an offering? Does one say that <b>since it</b> is <b>unfit, it is comparable to a blemished</b> animal? <b>Or perhaps,</b> the prohibition to consecrate <b>a flawed</b> item <b>applies only to an animal.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ Having discussed which flours, oils, and wine are fit to be offered in the Temple, the Gemara considers which animals are of sufficient quality to be used as offerings. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The choicest <b>rams</b> are those <b>from Moab;</b> the choicest <b>lambs</b> are those <b>from Hebron;</b> the choicest <b>calves</b> are those <b>from Sharon;</b> and the choicest <b>fledglings,</b> i.e., doves and pigeons, are those <b>from the King’s Mountain.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One should bring lambs whose height is like their width,</b> i.e., they are so robust that they are as wide as they are tall. <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written:</b> “And He will give the rain for your seed, with which you sow the ground, and bread of the produce of the ground, and it shall be fat and bountiful; <b>your cattle shall graze in wide pastures [<i>kar nirḥav</i>] on that day”</b> (Isaiah 30:23). The word “<i>kar</i>” can also mean a lamb, and “<i>nirḥav</i>” means wide. Accordingly, Rabbi Yehuda interprets this verse, on a homiletical level, to be alluding to robust sheep.
The chapter concludes by quoting an additional prophecy of Isaiah concerning the rebuilding of Eretz Yisrael: It <b>is written: “I have set watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never be silent day nor night; those who remind the Lord, take no rest”</b> (Isaiah 62:6). This is referring to the angels appointed by God to bring the redemption. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> do these watchmen <b>say</b> to remind the Lord? <b>This</b> is what <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said:</b> They recite the verse: <b>“You will arise and have compassion upon Zion;</b> for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come” (Psalms 102:14).
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> They recite the verse: <b>“The Lord builds up Jerusalem,</b> He gathers together the dispersed of Israel” (Psalms 147:2). The Gemara asks: <b>And initially,</b> when the Temple still stood and the Jewish people were gathered together in Eretz Yisrael, <b>what would</b> the watchmen <b>say? Rava bar Rav Sheila says:</b> They would say: <b>“For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation.</b> This is My resting place forever; here will I dwell for I have desired it” (Psalms 132:13–14).

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Two</b> sizes of <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances <b>were</b> used <b>in the Temple</b> for measuring flour for the meal offerings. One held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and</b> the other held <b>one-half of a tenth</b> of an ephah. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> There were three measuring vessels; one that held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, another one that also held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>and</b> a third one that held <b>one</b>-<b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah.
<b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>tenth</b> of an ephah measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> flour <b>for all the meal offerings. One would not measure</b> the flour by using a measuring vessel of a size that held the entire volume of flour required at once, i.e., <b>neither with</b> a vessel of <b>three-</b>tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering accompanying the sacrifice of <b>a bull, nor with</b> a vessel of <b>two</b>-tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering accompanying the sacrifice of <b>a ram. Rather, one measures</b> the flour for <b>them</b> by repeatedly using the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel to measure the required number of <b>tenths.</b>
<b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>one</b>-<b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> the flour for the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering. A tenth of an ephah was required each day; he sacrificed <b>half</b> of it <b>in the morning and</b> the other <b>half</b> of it <b>in the afternoon.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that clarifies Rabbi Meir’s opinion. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A tenth, a tenth, for every lamb”</b> (Numbers 28:29)? The fact the word “tenth” appears twice <b>teaches that there were two</b> measuring vessels that each held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the Temple. One</b> of them held that volume when it was <b>heaped, and</b> the other <b>one</b> was slightly larger and held that same volume when the flour was <b>leveled</b> with the rim.
The one that held a tenth of an ephah when <b>heaped</b> was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> the flour <b>for all the meal offerings.</b>

Daf 87b

The one that held a tenth of an ephah when <b>leveled</b> was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> the flour <b>for</b> the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, and then that flour would be divided into two equal parts.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree with Rabbi Meir and <b>say: There was only one</b> measuring vessel that held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>there</b> in the Temple, <b>as it is stated: “And one tenth-part for every lamb”</b> (Numbers 29:4). But <b>if so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A tenth, a tenth,</b> for every lamb” (Numbers 28:29)? Rabbi Meir derived from the repetition of “a tenth” that there were two measuring vessels that held a tenth of an ephah. How do the Rabbis expound that? They hold it serves <b>to include</b> another measuring vessel for dry substances, one that holds <b>one-half of a tenth</b> of an ephah.
Having cited the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara discusses each opinion: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Meir, from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive that there was a measuring vessel that held <b>one-half of a tenth</b> of an ephah? <b>He derives it from</b> the superfluous “and” in the phrase <b>“and one tenth-part</b> for every lamb.” The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> why don’t they expound this from the term “and”? <b>They do not derive</b> anything from <b>“and.”</b> They hold that the addition of the word is not significant enough to be expounded.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Meir, this</b> verse: <b>“And one tenth-part for every lamb,”</b> from which the Rabbis derive that there was only one measuring vessel of a tenth of an ephah, <b>what does he do with it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse teaches that <b>one should not measure</b> the flour by using a measuring vessel of a size that holds the entire volume of flour required, i.e., <b>neither with</b> a vessel that holds <b>three-</b>tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering accompanying the sacrifice of <b>a bull, nor with</b> a vessel that holds <b>two</b>-tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering accompanying the sacrifice of <b>a ram.</b> Rather, one measures the flour for them by using the tenth-ephah measuring vessel multiple times.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive that <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>They derive</b> it <b>from its dot.</b> In the Torah text, a dot appears above the term “a tenth.” This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Why is</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> in the middle of</b> the term <b>“a tenth [<i>issaron</i>]” dotted</b> the <b>first</b> time that the term <b>“a tenth”</b> appears in the verse <b>concerning</b> the <b>first festival day of the Festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>? The verse there states: “And a tenth, a tenth, for every lamb of the fourteen lambs” (Numbers 29:15). This serves to teach <b>that one should not measure</b> flour using a vessel of a size that holds the entire volume required, i.e., <b>neither with</b> a vessel that holds <b>three-</b>tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering of <b>a bull, nor with</b> a vessel that holds two-tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering of <b>a ram. And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> what does he derive from the dot? <b>He does not derive</b> anything from <b>its dot.</b> He holds that the dot is not significant enough to be expounded.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>one-half of a tenth</b> of an ephah measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> the flour <b>for the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering. A tenth of an ephah was required each day; he sacrificed half in the morning and the other half in the afternoon. From the mishna it appears that each half-tenth is measured separately.
The mishna indicates that the half-tenth vessel was used for <b>measuring. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a mishna (50b): The twelve loaves of <i>matza</i>, baked from a tenth of an ephah of flour, of the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest did not come</b> from the house of the High Priest <b>in halves. Rather,</b> the High Priest <b>brings</b> from his house <b>a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of flour (see Leviticus 6:13) <b>and divides it</b> in half, and he sacrifices half in the morning and half in the afternoon. It is apparent from this mishna that the tenth of an ephah is first measured in its entirety and only then divided.
To resolve the contradiction <b>Rav Sheshet said: What is</b> the meaning of: Used for <b>measuring, that</b> the mishna here <b>teaches?</b> It means only that the High Priest would <b>divide</b> the tenth of an ephah into two equal portions using the half-tenth measure, but the quantity would initially be measured in its entirety, as the mishna on 50b states.
§ In light of Rabbi Meir’s opinion that there were two vessels for measuring a tenth of an ephah, one that held its measure when leveled and one when it was heaped, <b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda:</b> With regard to the <b>one-half of a tenth</b> of an ephah measuring vessel, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, was</b> it one that held its measure when <b>heaped or was</b> it one that held its measure when <b>leveled?</b>
Before citing Rav Ḥisda’s response, the Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> that alludes to the three dilemmas it will immediately present: <b>Half; griddle-cake</b> offering; <b>Table.</b> This alludes to one-half of a tenth of an ephah; the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering; and the shewbread Table.
Rav Ḥisda said to Rami bar Ḥama: <b>But</b> why do you ask specifically with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>The dilemma can be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Rami bar Ḥama answered: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it would be with regard to the measuring vessel of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>itself</b> that <b>one raises the dilemma,</b> asking whether it <b>was</b> one that held its measure when <b>heaped or was</b> one that held its measure when <b>leveled.</b> The dilemma I raised concerned the half-tenth vessel, which is pertinent specifically according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, as he holds that there were both heaped and leveled measuring vessels of a tenth of an ephah.
In answer to Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma, Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: From</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> concerning the vessel of a tenth of an ephah <b>we can extrapolate</b> what <b>Rabbi Meir</b> holds concerning the vessel of one-half of a tenth of an ephah; <b>and from</b> that opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir we can extrapolate</b> what <b>the Rabbis</b> hold concerning both vessels.
Rav Ḥisda elaborates: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Meir said</b> that the vessel of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah used for the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering held its measure when <b>leveled,</b> we can extrapolate that the vessel of <b>one-half of a tenth, as well,</b> was such that it held its measure when <b>leveled.</b> It is reasonable that since both vessels were used for the same offering, they should be of the same type. And <b>from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Meir</b> holds that vessels used for the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering held their measures when <b>leveled,</b> we can extrapolate that <b>also according to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that both vessels were used for the High Priest’s griddle-cake offering, both of them held their measures when <b>leveled.</b>
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rav Ḥisda:</b> With regard to the dough used for the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, <b>with what</b> would <b>one divide it into</b> the <b>loaves</b> of the offering, six in the morning and six in the afternoon? Was the division done <b>with</b> one’s <b>hand or with</b> a measuring <b>vessel?</b> Rav Ḥisda said to him: It is <b>obvious that</b> it was divided <b>with</b> one’s <b>hand, as if</b> one suggests that it was done <b>with</b> a measuring <b>vessel, would one bring scales [<i>turtanei</i>]</b> into the Temple courtyard for this purpose?
Rami bar Ḥama responds: <b>And let him bring</b> scales into the courtyard. Rav Ḥisda explains: <b>Since in</b> God’s admonition of the Jewish people the act of weighing bread is <b>written</b> as part of <b>a curse:</b> “When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and you shall eat and not be satisfied” (Leviticus 26:26), as weighing bread is generally performed only at a time of famine, therefore it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to weigh the dough in the Temple.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rav Ḥisda:</b> With regard to the shewbread <b>Table, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> to whether <b>it consecrates handfuls</b> removed from meal offerings or from frankincense that were not consecrated by being placed in a service vessel, as they should have been, but were instead placed <b>on the upper part of</b> the Table, between the rows of shewbread? The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: Does one say that <b>from</b> the fact that the Table <b>consecrates</b> the <b>loaves</b> of shewbread placed upon it, it follows that it <b>also consecrates handfuls</b> placed upon it? <b>Or perhaps</b> the Table <b>consecrates</b> only that <b>which is fit for it,</b> i.e., the loaves, but it <b>does not consecrate</b> that <b>which is not fit for it,</b> such as the handfuls.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> The Table <b>does not consecrate</b> these handfuls. Rami bar Ḥama retorted: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> The shewbread loaves were longer than the length of the Table. Accordingly, it was necessary to fold the edges of the loaves in order that they would rest entirely upon the Table itself and not protrude past its edges. How much of each side needed to be folded up is subject to a tannaitic dispute concerning the length of the Table (see 96a). <b>According to the statement of the one who says</b> that <b>one folds two and a half handbreadths</b> from each side of the loaves, <b>it emerges</b> that the <b>Table consecrates fifteen handbreadths above it,</b> as there were six loaves on each side of the Table, which were each two and a half handbreadths high. And <b>according to the statement of the one who says</b> that <b>one folds two handbreadths</b> from each side of the loaves, <b>it emerges</b> that the <b>Table consecrates twelve handbreadths above it.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan stated that the Table consecrates that which is placed above it, regardless of whether it is fit for the Table or not.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> When I said that the Table does not consecrate the handfuls, I meant that it <b>does not consecrate</b> them <b>to</b> the extent that they can <b>be sacrificed</b> on the altar. <b>But</b> it certainly <b>consecrates</b> them <b>to</b> the extent that they will <b>be disqualified</b> by the same disqualifications that apply to handfuls that were consecrated by being placed in a service vessel, e.g., by being left overnight or by coming in contact with a ritually impure person who had immersed that day.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There were seven measuring vessels for liquids in the Temple.</b> There was a vessel of one <b><i>hin</i>,</b> i.e., twelve <i>log</i>. Three vessels were used to measure the oil and wine for the meal offerings and libations that accompanied the sacrifice of an animal. For a bull there was a vessel of <b>one</b>-<b>half of a <i>hin</i>,</b> i.e., six <i>log</i>; <b>and</b> for a ram there was one of <b>one-third of a <i>hin</i>,</b> i.e., four <i>log</i>; <b>and</b> for a lamb there was one of <b>one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>,</b> i.e., three <i>log</i>.
In addition, there was a vessel that held one <b><i>log</i></b> to measure the oil for all standard meal offerings; <b>and</b> another one that held <b>one</b>-<b>half of a <i>log</i></b> for measuring the water used in the rite of a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>] and also for the oil used in the loaves accompanying the thanks offering (see 88a); <b>and</b> another one that held <b>one-quarter of a <i>log</i></b> for measuring the water used in the purification of a leper and also for the oil used in the wafers and loaves that the nazirite brings on the day that his term of naziriteship ends.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> It was not necessary to have several vessels of different sizes; rather, <b>there were graduations [<i>shenatot</i>] on</b> the vessel that held one <b><i>hin</i></b> indicating that <b>until here</b> is the quantity needed <b>for the bull, and until here</b> is the quantity needed <b>for the ram,</b> and <b>until here</b> is the quantity needed <b>for the lamb.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: There was no</b> vessel <b>there</b> in the Temple that held one <b><i>hin</i>, as what</b> purpose <b>could</b> a one<b>-hin</b> vessel <b>serve?</b> That volume of liquid was never used in an offering. <b>Rather, there was an additional measuring vessel of one and a half <i>log</i> there,</b> in the Temple, which completed the tally of seven vessels, <b>with which one would measure</b> the oil used <b>for the</b> griddle-cake <b>meal offering of the High Priest; one and a half <i>log</i></b> were used <b>in the morning and one and a half <i>log</i> in the afternoon.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There were seven measuring vessels for liquids in the Temple.</b> Listed in ascending order of size, they held: <b>One-quarter of a <i>log</i>; one-half of a <i>log</i>;</b> one <b><i>log</i>; one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>; one-third of a <i>hin</i>; one-half of a <i>hin</i>; and</b> one <b><i>hin</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says</b> that there were these seven vessels but he lists them in descending order: One <b><i>hin</i>; one-half of a <i>hin</i>; one-third of a <i>hin</i>; one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>;</b> one <b><i>log</i>; one-half of a <i>log</i>; and one-quarter of a <i>log</i>. Rabbi Shimon says: There was no</b> vessel <b>there</b> in the Temple that held one <b><i>hin</i>, as what</b> purpose <b>could</b> a one<b>-hin</b> vessel <b>serve?</b> That volume of liquid was never used in an offering.

Daf 88a

If so, <b>which</b> size vessel shall <b>I bring in its stead</b> to complete the tally of seven vessels? <b>Rather, there was an additional measuring vessel of one and a half <i>log</i> there</b> in the Temple, <b>with which one would measure</b> the oil used <b>for the griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest; one and a half <i>log</i></b> were used <b>in the morning</b> and <b>one and a half <i>log</i> in the afternoon.</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: There is no need for a dedicated vessel for the one and a half <i>log</i> for the High Priest’s offering, as <b>there was</b> a vessel of <b>one-half of a <i>log</i> there,</b> in the Temple, <b>and</b> it is <b>possible to calculate</b> the required one and a half <i>log</i> <b>by</b> using the vessel of <b>one-half of a <i>log</i></b> three times.
Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> But <b>according to your statement as well, one should not fashion</b> a vessel of <b>one-half of a <i>log</i> or</b> of one <b><i>log</i>,</b> as <b>there was</b> a vessel of <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>there, and</b> it is <b>possible to calculate</b> whatever quantity is required <b>by</b> repeatedly using the vessel of <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i>. <b>Rather, this was the principle</b> with regard to measuring vessels <b>in the Temple:</b> A measuring <b>vessel that</b> was <b>used for</b> measuring <b>this quantity was not used</b> to measure <b>a different quantity.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> concludes with an opinion that is also stated in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: There were graduations on</b> the vessel that held one <b><i>hin</i>,</b> indicating the respective quantities needed for the bull, the ram, and the lamb.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda?</b> They both list the same seven vessels, but in a different order. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns whether the vessels consecrate the <b>overflow [<i>beirutzei</i>] of</b> the <b>measuring vessels,</b> i.e., the liquid that flows down over the outer walls of the vessel when it is filled beyond capacity.
<b>According to the one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in ascending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda, <b>he holds</b> that the <b>overflow of measuring vessels is consecrated.</b> His reasoning is as follows: When Moses was commanded to fashion these vessels, <b>the Merciful One</b> initially <b>gave Moses</b> a measuring vessel of <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>hin</i> <b>and said to him:</b> With this vessel <b>calculate</b> the various quantities needed and fashion vessels accordingly. So, for example, to calculate one-half of a <i>hin</i>, Moses would twice fill up the vessel of one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, each time pouring it into a larger vessel. When pouring from a small vessel into a larger one, the <b>overflow</b> also <b>enters</b> the larger one and so it is included in the calculation. Evidently, the overflow is also consecrated.
<b>According to the one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in descending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Meir, <b>he holds</b> that the <b>overflow of measuring vessels is not consecrated.</b> His reasoning is as follows: When Moses was commanded to fashion these vessels for the Temple, <b>the Merciful One</b> initially <b>gave Moses</b> a measuring vessel of one <b><i>hin</i> and said to him: With this</b> vessel <b>calculate</b> the various quantities needed and fashion vessels accordingly. So, for example, to calculate one-half of a <i>hin</i>, Moses filled the vessel of one <i>hin</i> and divided it equally into two vessels. Then, to calculate one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, he would equally divide the liquid in one of those vessels into another two vessels. When pouring from a large vessel into a smaller one, the overflow on the outer walls of the larger vessel does not enter the smaller vessel but instead falls to the ground. Therefore, the <b>overflow is excluded</b> from the calculation. Accordingly, there is no basis to say that the overflow is consecrated.
<b>Abaye said: Everyone,</b> both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir, agrees that with regard to the <b>overflow of measuring vessels, one could say</b> that <b>they are consecrated and one could say</b> that <b>they are not consecrated,</b> i.e., their dispute is unrelated to this issue. <b>But here they disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of the term <b>“full”</b> in the verse: “And his offering was one silver dish, its weight was one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver basin of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering” (Numbers 7:13).
<b>The one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in descending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that the term <b>“full”</b> indicates that the size of each vessel should be exact, i.e., <b>that it should</b> hold <b>neither less nor more</b> than the prescribed amount. If one calculates the various sizes by first filling a vessel of the largest size, one <i>hin</i>, and then dividing its contents carefully between two smaller vessels and so on, one will arrive at accurate measurements. By contrast, if one starts with the smallest size and uses it multiple times to calculate larger quantities, then each time one pours he includes the overflow of the smaller vessel, and so the quantities calculated are slightly larger than prescribed.
<b>And the one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in ascending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the intention of the term <b>“full”</b> is that the size of each vessel <b>should not</b> hold <b>less</b> than the prescribed amount, <b>but</b> if <b>it</b> holds <b>more,</b> that <b>is</b> still <b>called full.</b> Accordingly, the various quantities can be calculated by starting with the smallest vessel.
In the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>the Master said</b> that in contrast to the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: There was no</b> vessel <b>there</b> in the Temple that held one <b><i>hin</i>,</b> as what purpose could a one-<i>hin</i> vessel serve? That volume of liquid was never used in an offering. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Shimon is saying well to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., this is a reasonable objection. <b>And</b> what would <b>the Rabbis</b> say? Why is there a measuring vessel of one <i>hin</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It was</b> the vessel of one <b><i>hin</i> that Moses fashioned</b> in the wilderness <b>for</b> measuring the <b>anointing oil</b> with which the Tabernacle, its vessels, and the priests were anointed, <b>as it is written: “And of olive oil a <i>hin</i>.</b> And you shall make it a holy anointing oil” (Exodus 30:24–25).
The Gemara explains the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>since there was no</b> further <b>need</b> for the vessel of one <i>hin</i> <b>in</b> future <b>generations,</b> Moses <b>fashioned it</b> only <b>for</b> the sake of that <b>time, and</b> then afterward <b>it was sequestered. And the other</b> Sage, the Rabbis, holds that <b>since it was</b> fashioned and used in the time of Moses, <b>it was</b> kept in the Temple despite the fact there was no longer a need for it.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that after claiming that there was no vessel of one <i>hin</i>, Rabbi Shimon asked: If so, <b>which</b> size vessel shall <b>I bring in its stead</b> to complete the tally of seven vessels? The Gemara asks: <b>Is it not possible to</b> simply <b>not include</b> a seventh vessel? What compels him to list a seventh? The Gemara explains: It is just <b>as Ravina said</b> with regard to a different matter: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that there are <b>two</b> instances in which <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering is required <b>for communal</b> offerings. <b>Here too,</b> one must say that it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>there were seven measuring vessels for liquids in the Temple.</b>
The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> It was not necessary to have separate vessels for the meal offerings and libations of each type of animal. Rather, <b>there were graduations on</b> the vessel that held one <b><i>hin</i></b> indicating the measures for the various offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, <b>have</b> the tradition that there were <b>seven measuring vessels?</b> The Gemara concedes: <b>He does not have</b> that tradition. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he has that tradition, but he understands that <b>what</b> is meant by <b>seven measuring vessels?</b> It means that <b>seven</b> fixed ways of <b>measuring</b> should exist, but not that there must be seven different vessels.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i> measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was used to measure <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of water for</b> the purification of <b>the leper, and a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of oil for</b> the wafers and loaves that <b>the nazirite</b> brings on the day that his term of naziriteship ends.
<b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>half</b>-<i>log</i> measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was used to measure <b>a half-</b><i>log</i> <b>of water for</b> the rite of <b>the <i>sota</i> and a half-</b><i>log</i> <b>of oil for</b> the three types of loaves of <i>matza</i> accompanying <b>the thanks offering.</b>
<b>And with</b> the vessel of one <b><i>log</i>, one would measure</b> the oil <b>for all the</b> standard <b>meal offerings.</b>
Each tenth of an ephah of flour requires one <i>log</i> of oil. Accordingly, <b>even</b> if one brings <b>a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>one adds to it sixty <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Each meal offering, irrespective of its volume, <b>even a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, requires <b>only its</b> single <b><i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offering brought by a poor leper on the day of his purification: “And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil <b>for a meal offering, and a <i>log</i> of oil”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The juxtaposition of “a meal offering” with “a <i>log</i> of oil” teaches a principle for all meal offerings: Each offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil.
The mishna lists the quantities of oil and wine that were required for the meal offerings and libations that accompanied the sacrifice of an animal. <b>Six</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one<b>-</b>half of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a bull; and four</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-third of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a ram; and three</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a lamb.</b>
In addition, <b>three and a half</b> <i>log</i> of oil were required <b>for the Candelabrum,</b> as there were seven lamps and <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> was required <b>for each lamp.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was sitting</b> in study <b>and posed a difficulty: For what</b> purpose <b>was</b> the <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i> measuring vessel <b>anointed</b> with the anointing oil, thereby consecrating it a service vessel? <b>If</b> you suggest it was necessary in order to measure the water used in the purification of <b>a leper,</b>

Daf 88b

one can counter that the rite <b>is</b> performed <b>outside</b> the Temple, and so it does not require a service vessel. <b>And if</b> you suggest it was for measuring the oil for the loaves of <b>a nazirite,</b> one can counter that the <b>loaves of a nazirite are consecrated through the slaughter of</b> the <b>ram</b> he brings, and there is no need for the oil to have been consecrated through a service vessel.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: The consecration of the quarter-<i>log</i> measuring vessel was necessary, <b>as with it one would measure</b> oil <b>for</b> the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, as <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of oil</b> is used <b>for each and every loaf.</b> In praise for resolving his difficulty, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, who had traveled from Babylonia to join Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi in Eretz Yisrael: <b>“The man of my counsel from a far country”</b> (Isaiah 46:11).
§ The mishna teaches: <b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>half-<i>log</i></b> measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was used to measure a half-<i>log</i> of water for the <i>sota</i> and a half-<i>log</i> of oil for the thanks offering. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was sitting</b> in study <b>and posed a difficulty: For what</b> purpose <b>was</b> the <b>half-<i>log</i></b> measuring vessel <b>anointed</b> with the anointing oil, thereby consecrating it a service vessel? <b>If</b> you suggest it was necessary in order to measure the water used in the rite of the <b><i>sota</i>,</b> one can counter: <b>Is</b> the water that was used <b>non-sacred</b> such <b>that it is necessary to consecrate</b> it? Isn’t <b>it written:</b> “And the priest shall take <b>holy water</b> in an earthen vessel” (Numbers 5:17)? And <b>if</b> you suggest that it was for measuring the oil for the loaves of <b>a thanks offering,</b> one can counter that the <b>loaves of a thanks offering are consecrated through the slaughter of</b> the <b>thanks offering,</b> and so there is no need for the oil to have been consecrated through a service vessel.
<b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said to</b> his father: The consecration of the half-<i>log</i> measuring vessel was necessary, <b>as with it one would distribute a half-<i>log</i> of oil to each and every lamp</b> of the Candelabrum. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> his son in praise: <b>Lamp of Israel!</b> Indeed, <b>that was</b> its use.
§ Apropos the lamps of the Candelabrum, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> If there is <b>a lamp whose</b> flame <b>went out</b> during the night, <b>the oil</b> in the lamp <b>is</b> halakhically <b>rendered as ashes</b> and <b>the wick is rendered as ashes,</b> and they may no longer be used. <b>How</b> should the priest <b>act? He removes the ashes,</b> i.e., the oil and wick, from the lamp, <b>and puts</b> new <b>oil</b> and a new wick <b>into it and kindles it.</b>
<b>Rav Zerika was sitting</b> and studying this <i>halakha</i> <b>and raised a dilemma: When</b> the priest <b>puts oil</b> in the lamp, does he fill it <b>with</b> the <b>same quantity</b> of oil that was <b>initially</b> used, i.e., a half-<i>log</i>, <b>or</b> does he just fill it <b>with</b> an amount <b>equal to what it</b> now <b>lacks,</b> in order to replace the oil that was removed?
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> It is <b>obvious that</b> he fills it <b>with</b> the <b>same quantity</b> of oil that was <b>initially</b> used, <b>as, if</b> he were to fill <b>with</b> an amount <b>equal to what it</b> now <b>lacks,</b> there would be a difficulty: <b>How do we know how much</b> oil it <b>lacks? And if you would say that</b> the priest <b>calculates it</b> using a measuring vessel, one could counter that <b>if so,</b> there would not be only <b>seven measuring vessels</b> for liquids; rather, <b>there would</b> have to be <b>many more measuring vessels</b> of a whole range of volumes.
In praise for resolving his difficulty, Rabbi Zerika <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>“And in your majesty prosper, ride on, on behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness”</b> (Psalms 45:5).
An amoraic ruling <b>was also stated</b> in accordance with the explanation of Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> If there is <b>a lamp whose</b> flame <b>went out</b> during the night, <b>the oil</b> in the lamp <b>is rendered as ashes</b> and <b>the wick is rendered as ashes,</b> and they may no longer be used. <b>How</b> should the priest <b>act? He removes the ashes,</b> i.e., the oil and wick, from the lamp, <b>and puts into it oil of</b> the <b>same quantity</b> that was <b>initially</b> used, with a new wick, <b>and kindles it.</b>
§ <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehuda, says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> Each <b>lamp of</b> the Candelabrum <b>in the Temple was movable,</b> as the branches holding it were thin and flexible. They could therefore be bent over in order to tip out any ashes, remaining oil, or wicks from the lamps. The basis for his opinion is the verse: “And you shall make a Candelabrum of pure gold, of beaten work the Candelabrum shall be made, its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knobs, and its flowers, will be from it…of a talent of pure gold it shall be made” (Exodus 25:31, 39).
The Gemara explains that Rav Sheshet <b>holds</b> that <b>when it is written</b> that the Candelabrum is to be fashioned from a single <b>talent</b> of gold, <b>and</b> that it <b>be beaten</b> into its form, <b>it is written with regard to</b> both the frame of <b>Candelabrum and</b> each of <b>its lamps,</b> i.e., they must all be fashioned together from a single piece of gold beaten into its form. Perforce, the lamps must have been movable, because <b>since it is necessary to remove the ashes</b> from the lamps, <b>were</b> each lamp <b>not movable, it would not be</b> possible <b>to remove the ashes.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Sheshet’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> would the priest <b>act</b> when removing the ashes from the lamps? <b>He</b> would <b>remove</b> the lamps from the Candelabrum <b>and place them in the Tent</b> of Meeting, i.e., the Sanctuary, <b>and scrub them with a sponge [<i>bisfog</i>]</b> to remove any remaining oil. <b>And</b> then he would <b>put</b> fresh <b>oil into them and kindle them.</b> Evidently, the lamps and the frame of the Candelabrum were separate parts.
The Gemara explains that there is a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i> concerning this issue and Rav Sheshet <b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Rabbis say</b> that when removing the ashes, the priest <b>would not move</b> the lamp <b>from its place;</b> rather, he would remove the ashes while the lamp was still attached to the frame.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>from the fact</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states that the priest would not move the lamp from its place, it would appear <b>that if one wanted to move it, he was able to move it</b> from its place. Apparently, then, the lamps were independent parts. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> to <b>say:</b> The lamp <b>would not move from its place,</b> as the lamps were not independent removable parts but were formed together with the frame from a single piece of gold.
The Gemara asks: <b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed by <b>the Rabbis</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: There was a kind of gold plate [<i>tas</i>] for</b> each lamp, which was placed <b>on top of it</b> and which served as a cover for the lamp. The plate was attached to one side of the lamp, to the lamp’s head, and the wick emerged from the other side, from the lamp’s mouth. <b>When</b> the priest <b>would</b> come to <b>remove the ashes</b> from the lamp, <b>he would</b> first <b>push</b> up on the part of the plate <b>at the mouth of</b> the lamp, thereby exposing its contents. The lamp would then be bent over and its contents tipped out. And <b>when he would</b> come to <b>place</b> fresh <b>oil</b> and a wick <b>in</b> the lamp, <b>he would</b> place the new wick at its mouth and then <b>push</b> down on the plate <b>at the head of</b> the lamp, thereby closing it, then he would straighten it up and pour in the oil through a hole in the middle of the plate.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> whether or not the lamps were independent removable parts <b>is the subject of a dispute</b> between <b>these</b> following <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Both the frame of the <b>Candelabrum and its lamps are produced</b> together <b>from the</b> same <b>talent</b> of gold. <b>But its tongs and its pans,</b> which were the implements used for removing the ashes, <b>were not</b> fashioned <b>from that</b> same gold <b>talent. Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> Only the frame of the <b>Candelabrum is produced from the talent</b> of gold, <b>but its lamps and its tongs and its pans are not produced from that</b> same gold <b>talent;</b> rather, they are formed independently. The lamps are then positioned on the frame, but can still be removed from it.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the exposition of <b>this verse, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“Of a talent of pure gold it shall be fashioned</b> with all these vessels” (Exodus 25:39), <b>we learned about the</b> frame of the <b>Candelabrum that</b> it <b>is produced from the</b> gold <b>talent. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include its lamps,</b> that they should also be fashioned together with the frame from the same talent? <b>The verse states:</b> “It shall be fashioned <b>with all these vessels.”</b> This indicates that not only the frame, but also additional parts should be fashioned from the same talent. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even its tongs and its pans.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “It</b> shall be fashioned.” The additional word “it” teaches that only the frame and the lamps are to be fashioned from the gold talent. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Neḥemya.</b>
The Gemara interrupts the citation of the <i>baraita</i> and notes that the <b>statement of Rabbi Neḥemya</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, in which he claims the lamps were fashioned from the talent with the frame, is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the <b>statement of Rabbi Neḥemya</b> in the other <i>baraita</i>, in which he claims the lamps were independent parts. The Gemara explains: There are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya.</b>
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> Only the frame of the <b>Candelabrum was produced from the talent</b> of gold, <b>but its tongs and its pans and its lamps were not produced from the talent. Rather, how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: “Of a talent of pure gold it shall be fashioned <b>with all these vessels”?</b> It teaches only <b>that</b> all the <b>vessels</b> associated with the Candelabrum <b>were</b> made <b>of gold,</b> even though they were not fashioned from the same gold talent from which the Candelabrum and its lamps were.
The Gemara questions the need for the derivation of the <i>baraita</i>: But the requirement that the vessels be made of <b>gold is explicitly written in</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall fashion its lamps seven, and they shall kindle its lamps, and it will enlighten toward its face. And its tongs and its pans shall be of pure gold”</b> (Exodus 25:37–38); why then is it necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to derive this from the phrase “with all these vessels”? The Gemara explains: This derivation of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is necessary only to</b> teach that the same applies <b>to</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the <b>lamps,</b> where the wicks rest. Otherwise, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the <b>lamps blackens</b> and is damaged by the burning wick, therefore the principle that <b>the Torah spared the money of the Jewish people</b> should be applied,

Daf 89a

<b>and</b> consequently, <b>let</b> the mouth of the lamps <b>be fashioned from gold of any</b> quality, not necessarily from pure gold. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even the mouth of the lamps must be fashioned from pure gold.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A half-<i>log</i> of oil</b> was used to measure oil <b>for the thanks offering.</b> The thanks offering was accompanied by four different types of loaves; three types were unleavened and one was leavened, as the verse states: “If he offers it for a thanks offering, than he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanks offering: Unleavened loaves mixed with oil; and unleavened wafers spread with oil; and poached fine flour, loaves mixed with oil. With loaves of leavened bread he shall present his offering, with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for a thanks offering” (Leviticus 7:12–13).
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “With oil,” “with oil,”</b> writing it <b>twice;</b> why was the first time not sufficient? Because <b>were</b> the term <b>“with oil” stated only once, I would have said</b> that, with regard to the amount of oil required, the meal offerings that accompany the thanks offerings <b>are like all</b> other <b>meal offerings to</b> the extent that they require one <b><i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Now that</b> the verse <b>wrote “with oil,” “with oil,” it constitutes</b> one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification, and</b> the principle is that one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification</b> serves <b>only to restrict</b> the extent of the <i>halakha</i>. Accordingly, in this case <b>the verse restricted</b> the amount of oil used in the three types of unleavened meal offerings <b>to a half-<i>log</i></b> for all of them together.
The Gemara interjects the citation of the <i>baraita</i> to ask: Is this a case of one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification?</b> It would appear that there is only <b>one amplification,</b> as according to the <i>baraita</i> the first mention of the term “with oil” is necessary to teach the basic requirement that the meal offerings of the thanks offering require oil, like other meal offerings. How then can it be considered an amplification?
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s statement should be emended, as follows: <b>Were</b> the term <b>“with oil,” not written at all, I would</b> still <b>have said</b> that the thanks offering meal offerings <b>are like all</b> other <b>meal offerings to</b> the extent that they requires one <b><i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Now that</b> the verse <b>wrote “with oil,” “with oil,” it constitutes</b> one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification, and</b> the principle is that one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification</b> serves <b>only to restrict</b> the extent of the <i>halakha</i>. Accordingly, in this case <b>the verse restricted</b> the amount of oil used in the three types of unleavened meal offerings <b>to a half-<i>log</i></b> for all three together.
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: Once it has been established that the meal offerings require only a half-<i>log</i> of oil, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>this half-<i>log</i> should be</b> equally <b>divided between</b> the <b>three types</b> of unleavened meal offerings, i.e., one-sixth of a <i>log</i> <b>for</b> the <b>loaves,</b> one-sixth <b>for</b> the <b>wafers, and</b> one-sixth <b>for</b> the <b>poached</b> loaves. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “With oil,” with regard to</b> the <b>poached</b> loaves, that is seemingly superfluous, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> the requirement to use part of the half-<i>log</i> of oil, being that this requirement has already been established. It must therefore serve to <b>amplify</b> the amount of <b>oil</b> used <b>for a poached</b> loaf as opposed to the other two types. <b>How so? One brings a half-<i>log</i> of oil and divides it</b> equally into two. <b>Half of it</b> is further divided and used both <b>for</b> the ten regular <b>loaves and for</b> the ten <b>wafers, and</b> the other <b>half of it</b> is used entirely <b>for</b> the ten <b>poached</b> loaves.
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>Akiva,</b> even <b>if you</b> were to <b>amplify</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>the entire day</b> from the terms <b>“with oil,” “with oil,” I</b> would <b>not listen to you</b> and accept your claims. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a half-<i>log</i> of oil</b> is required <b>for</b> the <b>thanks offering, and</b> similarly, the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a quarter-<i>log</i> of oil</b> is required <b>for</b> the loaves of <b>a nazirite, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a woman who experiences an emission of blood during the <b>eleven days that are between</b> one seven-day period of <b>menstruation</b> and the next period of <b>menstruation</b> is a <i>zava</i>, each of these is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai;</b> they are not derived from verses.
§ The mishna states that with the vessel of one <b><i>log</i> one would measure</b> the oil for all the standard meal offerings. It then cites a dispute between the Rabbis, who hold that one <i>log</i> of oil is required for each tenth of an ephah of flour used, and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, who holds that each meal offering, irrespective of its size, requires only one <i>log</i> of oil.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a poor leper,</b> who cannot afford the standard offerings that are required as part of the purification process and is instead required to bring one lamb as a guilt offering and a tenth of an ephah of flour as a meal offering, <b>it is written:</b> “And <b>a tenth</b>-<b>part</b> of an ephah of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil for a meal offering, <b>and a <i>log</i></b> of oil” (Leviticus 14:21). The verse juxtaposes the need for a <i>log</i> of oil with the fact the offering is made of a tenth of an ephah of flour. Accordingly, it <b>teaches about</b> each <b>tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>that it requires</b> one <b><i>log</i> of oil;</b> this is <b>the statement of the Rabbis.</b>
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer say:</b> Each meal offering, irrespective of its size, and <b>even a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, requires <b>only its</b> single <b><i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to offering of a leper: “And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil <b>for a meal offering, and a <i>log</i> of oil.”</b> The juxtaposition of “a meal offering” with “a <i>log</i> of oil” teaches a principle for all meal offerings: Each offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, what do they do with this</b> verse: “And <b>a tenth</b>-<b>part</b> of an ephah of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil for a meal offering <b>and a <i>log</i></b> of oil,” which links the need for a <i>log</i> of oil with the fact the offering is made of a tenth of an ephah of flour? The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> verse is required <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself, as the Merciful One states: Let</b> a poor leper <b>bring</b> an offering of just <b>a tenth of an ephah</b> of flour. Accordingly, it cannot be used to teach a principle about meal offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, how do they respond to this claim? They maintain that <b>it is not necessary to</b> teach the matter <b>itself,</b> as <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One revealed with regard to a leper</b> who is not poor that he must bring <b>three</b> animal <b>offerings and</b> a meal offering of <b>three-tenths</b> of an ephah as part of his purification process, it may be inferred that <b>here,</b> with regard to a poor leper, <b>who</b> brings only <b>one offering,</b> that he similarly brings a meal offering of only <b>a tenth of an ephah.</b> Accordingly, the fact that the verse mentions that his offering is only a tenth of an ephah is superfluous and can teach a principle for all meal offerings.
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other,</b> Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer, how would they respond to this claim? They maintain that it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to state the size of his meal offering, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the Merciful One spared</b> the money of the poor leper by allowing him <b>to bring</b> an offering affordable <b>in poverty,</b> one might <b>say</b> that the Merciful One <b>does not require from him</b> to bring any meal offering <b>at all.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other,</b> the Rabbis, how would they respond to this? They claim that <b>we do not find</b> that the Torah <b>entirely</b> exempts a poor person from the offerings of the purification process, only that it provides a less expensive way to complete that process.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with</b> the juxtaposition in the end of <b>this</b> verse: <b>“For a meal offering and a <i>log</i> of oil,”</b> from which Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer derive the principle that each meal offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil? The Gemara explains: The Rabbis maintain that <b>that</b> the juxtaposition teaches <b>about one who donates a meal offering,</b> without specifying its size, <b>that he should not</b> bring <b>less than an amount</b> of flour <b>that requires</b> one <b><i>log</i>. And what is this</b> amount? <b>A tenth</b> of an ephah. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other,</b> Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer, from where do they derive that <i>halakha</i>, as they maintain the verse teaches the principle for all meal offerings? The Gemara explains: They maintain that <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>can be derived from</b> this verse.
§ The mishna lists the quantities of oil and wine that were required for the meal offerings and libations that accompanied the sacrifice of an animal. <b>Six</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-half of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a bull; and four</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-third of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a ram; and three</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a lamb.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive these quantities? We derive them from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And their libations shall be one-half of a <i>hin</i> of wine for a bull,</b> and one-third of a <i>hin</i> for the ram, and one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> for a lamb” (Numbers 28:14).
The Gemara elaborates: Now, one <b><i>hin</i> is twelve <i>log</i>, as it is written: “And of olive oil a <i>hin</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:24), <b>and it is written</b> afterward in the same verse: <b>“Sacred anointing oil, this [<i>zeh</i>] shall be for Me, throughout your generations.”</b> The <b>numerical value [<i>gimatriyya</i>] of <i>zeh</i> is twelve.</b> Once it is established that one <i>hin</i> is twelve <i>log</i>, it is possible to calculate how may <i>log</i> are in one-half, one-third, and one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Three and a half</b> <i>log</i> of oil were required <b>for the Candelabrum,</b> as there were seven lamps and <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> was required <b>for each lamp.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Candelabrum: “Aaron and his sons shall arrange it <b>from evening to morning,</b> before the Lord” (Exodus 27:21). This indicates that <b>you shall put into</b> each lamp <b>its</b> required <b>quantity</b> of oil <b>so that it will continue burning from evening until morning. Alternatively,</b> the phrase <b>“from evening to morning”</b> indicates that the mitzva is fulfilled throughout the night, and <b>you have no</b> other <b>rite that is valid from evening until morning except for this one alone. And the Sages calculated</b> that <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> of oil for each lamp is necessary to ensure that they continue burning <b>from evening until morning.</b>
How did the Sages reach the conclusion that a half-<i>log</i> of oil is needed? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the Sages <b>calculated</b> it <b>by</b> initially using a large quantity of oil, more than necessary to burn throughout the night, and then <b>decreasing</b> the quantity by a small amount each night until they saw that at the end of the night there was no oil remaining. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>they calculated</b> it <b>by</b> initially using a small quantity of oil and then <b>increasing</b> the quantity each night until they saw that the quantity was sufficient to allow the lamps to burn throughout the night.
The Gemara elaborates: The <b>one who said</b> that <b>they calculated</b> it <b>by increasing</b> the quantity each night holds that they did so in accordance with the principle that <b>the Torah spared the money of the Jewish people,</b> so the Sages wished to minimize the financial cost of their experimentation. <b>And</b> the <b>one who said</b> that <b>they calculated</b> it <b>by decreasing</b> the quantity each night holds that in the Temple one’s actions should not be motivated by a concern for the financial cost, as <b>in a place of wealth there is no poverty.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Many animal offerings are brought together with a meal offering and a wine libation. These additions are collectively referred to as libations. <b>One may mix together the libations of bulls with the libations of rams;</b> the meal offerings may be mixed as they both share the same ratio of flour to oil, i.e., two <i>log</i> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour. Likewise, one may mix together <b>the libations of lambs with the libations of</b> other <b>lambs,</b> as the meal offerings both share the same ratio of three <i>log</i> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour. And one may mix together the libations <b>of</b> the offering of <b>an individual with</b> those <b>of a communal</b> offering.

Daf 89b

And one may mix together the libations <b>of</b> an offering brought on one <b>day with</b> those <b>of the day before,</b> if the meal offerings have the same ratio of oil to flour.
<b>But one may not mix together the libations of lambs with the libations of bulls or</b> the libations of <b>rams,</b> as the meal offerings have different ratios of oil to flour. <b>And</b> nevertheless, <b>if one intermingled</b> the flour and oil of <b>these</b> lamb offerings <b>by themselves and</b> the flour and oil of <b>these</b> bull or ram offerings <b>by themselves, and</b> only then <b>were they mixed together,</b> then they remain <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>If</b> they were mixed together <b>before</b> the oil and flour of each offering <b>were</b> independently <b>intermingled</b> to form the meal offering, then they are <b>disqualified.</b>
With regard to <b>the lamb</b> offering <b>that comes with the <i>omer</i></b> meal offering, which is accompanied by another meal offering and a wine libation, <b>even though</b> the quantity of flour used in <b>its meal offering is doubled,</b> i.e., one uses twice the amount that is generally used for meal offerings that accompany the sacrifice of a lamb, <b>its</b> oil and wine <b>libations were not doubled;</b> rather, three <i>log</i> of oil and three <i>log</i> of wine were used, per the standard quantities used for a lamb.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that different types of libations may be mixed together provided that the meal offerings have the same flour to oil ratio. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse: “And he shall sacrifice, from the peace offerings, a fire to the Lord: The fat covering the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is over the loins; and the diaphragm with the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take away. And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar, apart from the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is a fire of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 3:3–5).
The direct object of the term: <b>“And they shall burn,”</b> i.e., the pronoun “it,” is singular, despite referring to the many types of fats listed in the verse. This indicates <b>that one may not mix fats</b> of one offering <b>with the fats</b> of a different offering, but should burn the parts from each offering separately. Similarly, it follows that the libations accompanying different animal offerings should not be mixed together.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna <b>stated</b> only that <b>if</b> libations of different offerings <b>were mixed</b> together one may still sacrifice them, but not that this is permitted <i>ab initio</i>. Accordingly, there is no contradiction between the mishna and <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara infers: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the mishna states in its first clause: <b>And one may not mix together the libations of lambs with the libations of bulls or</b> the libations of <b>rams,</b> the intention is that <b>even</b> after the fact, if <b>they were mixed together,</b> they are <b>also not</b> valid. The Gemara challenges: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches:</b> If <b>one intermingled</b> the flour and oil of <b>these</b> lamb offerings <b>by themselves and</b> the flour and oil of <b>these</b> bull or ram offerings <b>by themselves and</b> only then <b>were they mixed together</b> then they remain <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed, which is explicitly referring to the <i>halakha</i> after the fact, <b>it may be inferred that the first clause stated</b> the <i>halakha <b>ab initio</b></i><b>.</b>
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> When different animal offerings are sacrificed, <b>their wine</b> libations <b>may be mixed together</b> <i>ab initio</i>, but only <b>if their fine flour and their oil</b> from their respective meal offerings <b>were</b> already <b>mixed together,</b> albeit improperly.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it correct that one may <b>not</b> mix together the <b>wine</b> libations of different offerings <b><i>ab initio</i></b> unless their flour and oil were already mixed? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> just cited: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one may not mix together parts from different offerings, <b>said?</b> It is said only <b>with regard to flour and oil. But one may mix together</b> the <b>wine</b> libations of different offerings. The implication is that this is the <i>halakha</i> even if their meal offerings had not been mixed together.
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to offerings of similar types of animals, <b>where their fine flour and their oil</b> from their respective meal offerings <b>have been burned</b> on the altar, <b>one may mix together</b> the <b>wine</b> libations <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> And even <b>where</b> their fine flour and their oil <b>have not been burned, if their fine flour and their oil have</b> at least <b>been mixed together, one may mix together their wine</b> libations <i>ab initio</i>. <b>But if</b> the fine flour and oil have <b>not</b> been mixed together, then <b>one may not mix</b> the libations <b>together.</b> The reason is that if one does mix the libations, <b>perhaps one will come to mix together</b> their <b>flour and oil <i>ab initio</i>,</b> which is prohibited.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the lamb</b> offering <b>that comes with the <i>omer</i></b> meal offering, the quantity of flour used in its meal offering is doubled, i.e., one uses twice the amount that is generally used for meal offerings that accompany the sacrifice of a lamb, but the quantities of oil and wine are not doubled. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the <i>omer</i> meal offering: <b>“And its meal offering shall be two tenths”</b> (Leviticus 23:13). This verse <b>teaches about</b> the <b>lamb that comes with the <i>omer</i> that</b> the size of <b>its meal offering is doubled.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>just as its meal offering is doubled, so</b> too <b>its wine</b> libation should be <b>doubled,</b> i.e., instead of using a quarter-<i>hin</i>, as is generally done for lambs, one should use a half-<i>hin</i>. To counter this, <b>the verse states,</b> in its continuation: <b>“And its libation shall be of wine, a quarter-<i>hin</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is only <b>its wine</b> libation that <b>should not be doubled, as it is not intermingled with</b> the flour of <b>its meal offering, but its oil should be doubled, as it is intermingled with</b> the flour of <b>its meal offering.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And its libation</b> shall be of wine, a quarter-<i>hin</i>,” which teaches that <b>all of its libations shall be only a quarter</b>-<b><i>hin</i></b>, but no more.
The Gemara elaborates on the final proof in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> here? <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> There is an ambiguity as to whether the possessive pronoun in the term “and its libation” is referring to the lamb offering or the meal offering, both of which are mentioned previously in the verse. This is due to a disparity between the way the Hebrew word for the term is written and the way it is vocalized. <b>It is written</b> as <b><i>veniskah</i>,</b> with the possessive pronoun in the feminine form. This would be referring to the meal offering [<i>minḥa</i>], which is a feminine noun. Accordingly, this means: The libation of the meal offering, and it is referring to the oil that is intermingled in the meal offering. <b>And we read it</b> as <b><i>venisko</i>,</b> with the possessive pronoun in the masculine form. This would be referring to the lamb offering itself [<i>keves</i>], which is a masculine noun. Accordingly, this means: The libation of the lamb offering, which is a reference to the wine libation that accompanies the lamb offering.
<b>How</b> can this be explained? It teaches that <b>the libation of the meal offering,</b> i.e., its oil, <b>is like the libation of</b> the lamb <b>of wine: Just as</b> the quantity of <b>wine</b> used is <b>a quarter</b>-<i>hin</i>, <b>so too,</b> the quantity of <b>oil</b> used is <b>a quarter</b>-<i>hin</i> and no more.
§ The Gemara cites a related discussion: A guilt offering brought by a leper as part of his purification process is distinct from other guilt offerings in that there is an additional requirement that it must be brought together with a meal offering and a wine libation. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>a guilt offering of a leper that one slaughtered not for its own sake,</b> although the leper can therefore no longer fulfill his obligation with it, the offering continues to be regarded as a guilt offering of a leper and still <b>requires libations,</b> i.e., a meal offering and a wine libation; <b>as if you do not say this, you have disqualified it.</b> To bring it without libations one would have to regard it as a standard guilt offering, but the <i>halakha</i> is that an offering may not be sacrificed for a different purpose than the one for which it was originally consecrated.
<b>Rav Menashya bar Gadda objects to this: If that is so,</b> that whenever an offering is consecrated for a specific purpose that requires various additional conditions to be fulfilled beyond those normally required for that type of offering, then even if it is then slaughtered not for its own sake those conditions must still be fulfilled in order for the offering to be valid; then with regard to the <b>lamb</b> offering <b>that comes with the <i>omer</i></b> meal offering the <i>halakha</i> should likewise be that if <b>one slaughtered it not for its own sake,</b> the flour in <b>its meal offering should</b> still <b>be doubled</b> in quantity, as normally required for the <i>omer</i> meal offering, because it continues to be regarded as an <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>as if you do not say this, you have disqualified it.</b>
<b>And</b> similarly, with regard to the <b>daily morning offering,</b> if <b>one slaughtered it not for its own sake, it should</b> still <b>require</b> the arrangement of <b>two logs</b> of wood on the fire on the altar <b>by one priest,</b> because it continues to be regarded as a daily morning offering; <b>as if you do not say this, you have disqualified it. And</b> similarly, with regard to the <b>daily afternoon offering,</b> if <b>one slaughtered it not for its own sake, it should</b> still <b>require</b> the arrangement of <b>two logs</b> of wood on the fire on the altar <b>by two priests,</b> because it continues to be regarded as a daily afternoon offering; <b>as if you do not say this, you have disqualified it.</b> The fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan did not mention these <i>halakhot</i> suggests that he holds they are not correct, but then his opinion is logically inconsistent.
The Gemara deflects the objection: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling should be extended to other cases, as Rav Menashya bar Gadda claimed. <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>mentioned</b> just <b>one of them</b> as an example, even though they are all correct.
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that there is a different resolution: Actually, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling is limited to a guilt offering of a leper. The other offerings that Rav Menashya bar Gadda mentioned would be valid even if the additional conditions that originally applied to them were not fulfilled. The reason for this is as follows: <b>Granted, these</b> other offerings that Rav Menashya bar Gadda mentioned would be valid, as <b>they are burnt offerings;</b>

Daf 90a

therefore, even <b>if they are no</b> longer <b>fit to</b> be sacrificed as <b>obligatory burnt offerings,</b> for which they were originally consecrated, having now been slaughtered not for their own sake <b>they can</b> still <b>be sacrificed as voluntary burnt offerings,</b> without the need to fulfill the additional conditions that originally applied to them. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the guilt offering of a leper, <b>if you do not maintain it in accordance with its</b> original <b>status</b> and require it to be brought together with its libations, it can no longer be considered a guilt offering at all, as <b>is there a voluntary guilt offering?</b>
The Gemara notes that it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case of <b>a guilt offering of a leper that one slaughtered not for its own sake, or</b> in a case <b>where one did not place</b> some <b>of its blood upon</b> the leper’s right <b>thumb and big toe, this</b> guilt offering <b>is</b> still <b>brought up upon the altar and requires libations,</b> i.e., a meal offering and wine-libation; <b>but</b> since it was sacrificed incorrectly, the leper <b>needs</b> to bring <b>another guilt offering to permit him</b> to partake of offerings.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All measuring vessels that were in the Temple were</b> such that they held the volume that they measured when their contents were <b>heaped</b> above the rim, <b>except for</b> the measuring vessel used to measure the flour for the griddle-cake offering <b>of the High Priest, as its heaped</b> measure, i.e., the quantity of flour held by a tenth of an ephah measuring vessel when heaped, <b>was contained within its</b> walls when the flour was leveled with the rim. This was due to the fact that the measuring vessel for the griddle-cake offering was slightly larger than the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel.
With regard to <b>measuring vessels for liquids, their overflows,</b> i.e., that which flows onto the outside of vessel’s walls, <b>are sacred, but</b> with regard to <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances, <b>their overflows are non-sacred.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the reason for this difference is that since the <b>measuring vessels for liquids</b> are themselves <b>sacred, therefore their overflows are sacred,</b> and since the <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances are <b>non-sacred, therefore their overflows are non-sacred. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The difference is <b>not due to that</b> factor. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because the</b> overflow of <b>liquid</b> was originally inside the vessel, where it became consecrated, and <b>was</b> then <b>displaced,</b> whereas <b>the</b> overflow of <b>a dry</b> substance <b>was not displaced</b> from inside the vessel, so it had not become consecrated.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna and Gemara on 87a cite a dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Meir concerning the number and nature of the measuring vessels used for dry substances. In light of that dispute, the Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna here? <b>If</b> you suggest it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that is difficult: He holds that there were two measuring vessels that held a tenth of an ephah, but only <b>one</b> of them <b>was</b> such that it held its measure <b>when heaped;</b> the other one held its measure when leveled. And <b>if</b> you suggest it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is difficult: They hold <b>there was</b> only <b>one</b> measuring vessel that held a tenth of an ephah, <b>and</b> it held its measure when <b>leveled.</b> How can the mishna state that all measuring vessels in the Temple were heaped?
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Actually,</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that only one of two measuring vessels that held a tenth of an ephah was such that it held its measure when heaped. <b>And what</b> does the mishna means when it states: <b>All measuring vessels [<i>kol middot</i>]</b> in the Temple were heaped? It means that that <b>all measurements [<i>kol medidot</i>]</b> performed with that measuring vessel were done when its contents were heaped above its rim.
§ The mishna discusses the status of overflows: The first <i>tanna</i> states simply that with regard to <b>measuring vessels for liquids, their overflows are sacred,</b> but with regard to measuring vessels for dry substances, their overflows are non-sacred. Rabbi Akiva explains that this distinction is a function of whether the measuring vessel is itself sacred. Rabbi Yosei explains it is function of whether the overflow had initially been inside the vessel. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>do</b> these three <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items, e.g., wine for libations and oil, were <b>anointed</b> and thereby consecrated <b>both on</b> the <b>inside and on</b> the <b>outside.</b> Therefore, the overflow is consecrated as it comes in contact with the outside of the vessel’s walls. The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items, such as the flour for meal offerings, <b>were anointed</b> and consecrated only <b>on</b> the <b>inside, but were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside.</b> Therefore, the overflow is not consecrated when it comes into contact with the outside of the vessel’s walls.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who states the difference is due to whether the vessel is sacred or non-sacred, <b>holds</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items <b>were anointed on</b> the <b>inside and were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside,</b> whereas the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>were not anointed at all,</b> and they remained non-sacred and so could not consecrate the overflow.
<b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>this and that,</b> i.e., both types of measuring vessels, <b>were anointed</b> only <b>on the inside but were not anointed on the outside, and</b> so <b>here, this is the reason</b> behind whether the overflow was sacred: <b>As</b> the overflow <b>of liquid</b> was originally inside the vessel and <b>was</b> then <b>displaced, and it comes from the inside of the vessel,</b> it is therefore consecrated. <b>But the</b> overflow of <b>a dry</b> substance <b>was not</b> originally inside the vessel and then <b>displaced,</b> and so it is never consecrated.
The Gemara questions this explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>But</b> even <b>if</b> the overflow <b>was</b> previously inside the vessel and then <b>displaced, what of it? A person intends</b> to consecrate only <b>that which he requires,</b> and so even if the overflow had been inside the vessel it would not have been consecrated.
<b>Rav Dimi bar Shishna said in the name of Rav: That is to say</b> that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> their contents even <b>without</b> the <b>intent</b> of the person using them. <b>Ravina said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> their contents <b>only with</b> the <b>intent</b> of the person using them, and by Torah law the overflows are not sacred. <b>But</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> to regard them as sacred, <b>lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>one may transfer</b> a substance that has been consecrated <b>in a service vessel to non-sacred</b> status.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raised an objection</b> to this explanation from a mishna (100a): Each Shabbat, new shewbread and bowls of frankincense were arranged on the Table in the Sanctuary. They remained there until the following Shabbat, at which point the frankincense was burned, thereby permitting the shewbread to be eaten. If the priest <b>arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense on the Table <b>after Shabbat,</b> during the week, <b>and</b> then <b>he burned the</b> frankincense in the <b>bowls on</b> the <b>Shabbat</b> at the end of that week, the bread is <b>disqualified,</b> as it had not been on the Table for a full seven days from one Shabbat to the next. <b>How</b> then <b>should one proceed</b> to prevent the disqualification? <b>He should leave</b> the bread on the Table <b>until the following Shabbat, as even if it remained on the Table for many days,</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that,</b> provided that it is there for at least seven days. The frankincense may then be burned and it will permit the bread to be eaten.
Rabbi Zeira explains his objection: <b>But why</b> is it permitted to leave the bread on the Table for more than seven days? <b>There too, let us say</b> that the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> disqualifying the bread <b>lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>one can store</b> sacred items <b>in a service vessel</b> overnight and that will prevent them becoming disqualified. Evidently, the Sages did not issue such decrees, and it follows that also with regard to using the measuring vessels they did not issue a decree.
The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Are you raising a contradiction</b> between a rite performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., the arrangement of the shewbread, <b>and</b> a rite performed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., using the measuring vessels? Since in the case of a rite performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>not everyone is aware</b> of what is happening, there is no concern that people will misinterpret what is going on and so there is no need to issue a decree concerning it. In the case of a rite performed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>everyone is aware</b> of what is happening, and there is a need to issue a decree to prevent people from drawing mistaken conclusions.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the overflow of measures. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 10b): <b>The surplus libations</b> were sold and the proceeds used <b>to</b> purchase <b>supplementary</b> offerings <b>of the altar [<i>keitz hamizbe’aḥ</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Surplus libations?</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> It means <b>the overflows of measuring vessels. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Surplus libations are <b>like that which we learned</b> in another mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 13a): In the case of <b>one who accepts upon himself to supply fine flour at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> its market price <b>stood at three</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, he is required to fulfill his commitment and <b>supply</b> fine flour <b>at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>.

Daf 90b

If one committed to supply fine flour <b>at three</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> its market price decreased until it <b>stood at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, he must <b>supply</b> fine flour <b>at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>. The reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the</b> Temple <b>treasury is at an advantage.</b> In the latter case, the merchant ends up providing the Temple with a greater quantity of flour than had initially been intended. Consequently, the Temple has more flour than it requires. The extra amount is referred to as surplus libations, and it is sold in order to purchase supplementary offerings.
The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef: These overflows of measuring vessels, what would be done with them?</b> They are gathered, and <b>if there is another offering</b> to be sacrificed that day, the priests <b>sacrifice</b> this liquid <b>with it</b> as part of its libations. <b>And if</b> there is no other offering that day, and instead the overflows <b>were left overnight</b> without being sacrificed, <b>they are disqualified by being left overnight. And if</b> the overflows were <b>not</b> sacrificed with another offering and were not disqualified by being left overnight, they are sold, and the proceeds from their sale <b>are used to</b> purchase animals to <b>supplement</b> the offerings of <b>the altar. And these supplementary</b> offerings, <b>what</b> form do they take? They are <b>burnt offerings; their flesh</b> is entirely burned on the altar <b>to God, and the hides</b> are given <b>to the priests.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case of <b>one who accepts upon himself to supply fine flour at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> its market price <b>stood at three</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, he is required to fulfill his commitment and <b>supply</b> fine flour <b>at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>. If one committed to supply fine flour <b>at three</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> its market price decreased until it <b>stood at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, he must <b>supply</b> fine flour <b>at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>. The reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the</b> Temple <b>treasury is at an advantage. And</b> it is to <b>this</b> later case <b>that</b> we referred when <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>The surplus libations</b> were sold and the proceeds used <b>to</b> purchase <b>supplementary</b> offerings <b>of the altar.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All offerings,</b> whether <b>communal or individual, require libations,</b> i.e., a meal offering and a wine libation, <b>except for the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>the Paschal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering,</b> with which libations are not brought. <b>But</b> the exception to this exception is <b>that</b> the <b>sin offering of a leper and his guilt offering</b> do <b>require libations.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that derives each of the rulings of the mishna from the verses that state the requirement to accompany animal offerings with the sacrifice of libations. The Torah states: “And you will make a fire offering to the Lord, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift, or on your Festivals, to make a pleasing aroma to the Lord, of the herd or of the flock. And he who brings his offering to the Lord shall sacrifice a meal offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter-<i>hin</i> of oil; and wine for a libation, a quarter-<i>hin</i>, you shall make it with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one lamb” (Numbers 15:2–5). The Torah then proceeds to detail the quantities of flour, oil, and wine for a ram and a bull.
The verse states: <b>“And you will make a fire offering to the Lord.”</b> Accordingly, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>any</b> offering <b>that is raised up</b> on the altar <b>as a fire offering shall require</b> that <b>libations</b> be brought with it, <b>even a meal offering. The verse</b> then <b>states: “A burnt offering,”</b> which teaches that the requirement of libations applies only to animal burnt offerings, but not to meal offerings. If so, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>a peace offering</b> requires libations? <b>The verse states: “A sacrifice.” From where</b> is it derived that <b>a thanks offering</b> requires libations? <b>The verse states: “Or a sacrifice.”</b> The superfluous word “or” serves to include thanks offerings.
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>the Paschal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift.”</b> This teaches that an offering that <b>comes in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering <b>requires libations,</b> whereas each of these offerings, <b>which do not come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering but only as obligatory offerings, do <b>not require libations.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: It has been <b>derived,</b> then, that one should <b>exclude these</b> offerings from the requirement of libations, as they are obligatory. Perhaps then <b>I will</b> likewise <b>exclude</b> the <b>obligatory</b> offerings <b>that come on account of the pilgrimage Festival,</b> which are sacrificed <b>on the pilgrimage Festival, and what are these? Burnt offerings of appearance</b> in the Temple <b>and Festival peace offerings,</b> both of which are brought on the three pilgrimage Festivals. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Or on your Festivals,”</b> which indicates that <b>any</b> offering <b>that comes on your Festivals,</b> even if it is obligatory, <b>requires libations.</b>
It has been <b>derived,</b> then, that one should <b>include</b> even <b>these</b> Festival offerings, despite the fact that they are obligatory. Perhaps then <b>I will</b> likewise <b>include</b> the <b>goat sin offerings</b> brought as part of the additional offerings on the Festivals, <b>since they come</b> as <b>obligatory</b> offerings <b>on the pilgrimage Festival.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And when you make a young bull</b> as a burnt offering” (Numbers 15:8), and proceeds to state the requirement to bring libations with it.
Now, the requirement to bring libations with <b>a young bull was</b> already included <b>in the general</b> requirement to bring libations with any fire offering, as stated in the beginning of that passage; <b>and why,</b> then, <b>was it singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? This is in order <b>to equate</b> all other offerings <b>to it,</b> teaching that the requirement of libations applies only to offerings similar to a young bull: <b>Just as a young bull is distinct</b> in that it <b>can come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>so too, any</b> offering that <b>comes in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering requires libations.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verses at the beginning of the passage state: <b>“To make a pleasing aroma to the Lord, of the herd or of the flock.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Since</b> in the previous verse <b>it is stated: “A burnt offering,” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that all types of burnt offerings require libations, and <b>even a bird</b> sacrificed as a <b>burnt offering is indicated.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock,”</b> which limits the requirement to offerings of animals such as sheep or cattle, but not to bird offerings; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says: This</b> verse <b>is unnecessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “A sacrifice,” and a bird</b> offering <b>is not</b> referred to as <b>a sacrifice. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock”? Since it is stated</b> with regard to a burnt offering: <b>“A person, when he sacrifices from you an offering to the Lord, of the animals: Of the herd and of the flock,</b> you shall sacrifice your offering” (Leviticus 1:2), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who</b> takes a vow by <b>saying: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering,</b> without specifying which type of animal he will bring, that he must <b>bring</b> animals <b>of</b> both of <b>these two</b> types, i.e., from the herd and the flock. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock,”</b> separating the two types with the word “or,” thereby indicating that if <b>he wanted</b> to bring <b>one</b> of them, he may <b>bring</b> just one, and if he <b>wanted</b> to bring <b>two,</b> he may <b>bring</b> two. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, why do I</b> need an independent <b>verse</b> to teach that one who takes a vow to bring a burnt offering does not have to bring both types? <b>Didn’t</b> Rabbi Yonatan himself <b>say</b> an exegetical principle that whenever the Torah mentions two details together with regard to a <i>halakha</i>, it is presumed that the <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled even when only one of the details is realized, <b>unless the verse specifies</b> that both details are required by writing the word: <b>Together,</b> in the verse? Accordingly, when the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock,” the intention is that either one is sufficient, and there should be no need for an independent verse to teach this.
The Gemara answers: Despite his principle, an independent verse <b>was necessary</b> to teach this, as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b>

Daf 91a

<b>Since</b> in Leviticus 1:2 <b>it is written: “And of the flock,”</b> and not merely: Of the flock, <b>it is as though</b> the word: <b>Together, was written</b> in the verse. Therefore, the verse in Numbers 15, which does state: “Or of the flock,” is necessary to teach that this is not the case.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, who said</b> that <b>even though it is not</b> explicitly <b>written</b> in the verse: <b>Together, it is as though it is written: Together,</b> i.e., it is presumed that the <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled only when both details are realized, <b>a verse should be required.</b> Yet, in the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yoshiya expounds the phrase “of the herd or of the flock” to teach a different <i>halakha</i>. From where, then, does he derive that one who takes a vow to bring a burnt offering does not need to bring both types of animals?
The Gemara explains: <b>Isn’t it written: “If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), and then in a separate verse it states: <b>“And if his offering is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:9)? The fact that these possibilities are presented in two disjointed verses is an explicit indication that the burnt offering can be brought from even just one of these animals. Therefore, even Rabbi Yoshiya concedes that there is no reason to presume a burnt offering must be brought from both types there.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yonatan, why does he require a verse at all? The Gemara explains: It <b>was necessary</b> to have a verse to teach this, because otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say: These statements,</b> i.e., the verses that indicate it is sufficient to bring just one type of animal, concern a case <b>where one specifies</b> in his vow that he intends to bring just one animal, and the verses indicate that it is valid to bring just one. <b>But</b> if one vowed <b>without specification,</b> one might say: <b>Let him bring</b> burnt offerings <b>from both of them.</b> Therefore the phrase “of the herd or of the flock” <b>teaches us</b> that even in that case, it is sufficient to bring just one type of animal.
§ The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: From where is it derived that a peace offering requires libations? The verse states: “A sacrifice.” <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a thanks offering</b> requires libations? <b>The verse states: “Or a sacrifice.”</b> The superfluous word “or” includes thanks offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>a thanks offering is not</b> referred to as <b>a sacrifice?</b> It certainly is. Why, then, is it only included through the word “or”? The Gemara answers: An independent inclusion <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> in any event <b>there is bread</b> brought <b>together with</b> the thanks offering, <b>it should not require libations.</b>
The Gemara raises a question concerning this explanation: <b>But</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> a thanks offering <b>different from a nazirite’s ram, as there is bread</b> brought <b>together with it</b> also, <b>and</b> yet <b>it requires libations?</b> The verse states with regard to the ram of a nazirite: “And one unblemished ram for a peace offering, and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and their meal offering, and their libations” (Numbers 6:13–15).
The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that one should differentiate between the thanks offering and a nazirite’s ram as <b>there,</b> together with the nazirite’s ram, he brings only <b>two types</b> of bread, i.e., loaves and wafers, whereas, <b>here,</b> together with the thanks offering, one brings <b>four types</b> of bread. Therefore, one might have concluded that since there are many types of loaves it does not require libations. For that reason it is necessary to have an independent derivation that <b>teaches us</b> that it does require libations.
The Gemara analyzes another one of the derivations of the <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: And you will make a fire offering to the Lord, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift.” This teaches that an offering that comes in fulfillment of a vow or as a gift offering requires libations. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if that is the <i>halakha</i>, then <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only: <b>“In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift,” and it would be unnecessary</b> to write: <b>“A burnt offering,”</b> as a burnt offering is a type of offering that can be brought as a vow or gift offering.
The Gemara explains: <b>Had the Merciful One not written “a burnt offering,” I would say</b> that the verse should be expounded as follows: <b>“And you will make a fire offering to the Lord”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> indicating that all offerings require libations. But then it states: <b>“In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift,”</b> which is <b>a detail,</b> indicating that the requirement applies only to offerings brought in fulfillment of a vow or as a gift. But with <b>“to</b> make <b>a pleasing aroma</b> to the Lord” <b>it then generalized.</b> If so, this is <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and according to the principles of exegesis <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail: Just as the detail is explicit</b> in referring to an offering <b>that does not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin,</b> but comes to fulfill a vow or as a gift, <b>so too any</b> offering <b>that does not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin</b> requires libations.
Accordingly, <b>I</b> would <b>exclude a sin offering and a guilt offering</b> from the requirement to have libations, <b>as they come</b> to atone <b>for a sin,</b> and <b>I</b> would <b>include the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and the Paschal offering, as they do not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin.</b> In order to preclude the possibility of expounding the verses in this way, <b>the verse states: “Burnt offering,”</b> as an additional detail, which serves to further exclude offerings that are brought only in fulfillment of an obligation.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now that it is written: “Burnt offering,” what do you include through</b> the <b>generalization and detail</b> and generalization in this verse? The Gemara explains: <b>Just as the detail</b> of a burnt offering <b>is explicit</b> in referring to an offering <b>that one had not always been obligated</b> to bring, as it is referring to a burnt offering brought in fulfillment of a vow, which one became obligated to bring only once the vow was taken, <b>so too, any</b> offering <b>that one had not always been obligated</b> to bring requires libations.
This serves <b>to include</b> in the requirement for libations the <b>offspring of consecrated</b> animals, e.g., of a female peace offering; <b>and substitutes of</b> consecrated animals, i.e., a non-sacred animal with regard to which one stated that it should be a substitute for a consecrated animal, in which case the result is that both animals are consecrated and must be sacrificed; <b>and a burnt offering that comes from</b> the proceeds of having sold <b>surpluses</b> of items donated to the Temple that were not needed.
<b>And</b> this also serves to include <b>a guilt offering</b> whose owner either died or achieved atonement through sacrificing another animal and <b>which was</b> therefore <b>consigned to grazing</b> until it developed a blemish, at which point it should be sold and the proceeds used to purchase supplementary offerings for the altar. If instead, the guilt offering itself was sacrificed as a burnt offering, it is valid. In such a case, the offering requires libations. <b>And</b> this also serves to include <b>all offerings that were slaughtered not for their own sake.</b> Such offerings were brought to fulfill the owner’s obligation. Since they were not sacrificed for the sake of that purpose, the owner does not fulfill his obligation, but nevertheless the offerings are valid. In such a case, these offerings also require libations.
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you have said</b> that the word <b>“or”</b> in the phrase “or a sacrifice” is necessary <b>for the derivation</b> that teaches that the thanks offering requires libations, I can similarly ask <b>why do I</b> need the word “or” in the phrase <b>“in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered or as a gift,” to separate</b> between <b>them?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It was necessary</b> to write “or” in that phrase, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>until one brings</b> both <b>a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering together <b>they do not require libations.</b> The word “or” <b>teaches us</b> otherwise, <b>that</b> even <b>if one brings a vow</b> offering <b>by itself it requires libations, and if one brings a gift</b> offering <b>by itself he must bring libations.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> as he holds that whenever the Torah does not explicitly separate between two details stated with regard to a <i>halakha</i>, it is presumed that the <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled only when both details are realized. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> who holds that in general it is presumed that either detail is sufficient, <b>why do I</b> need the word “or”? The Gemara explains: Were it not for this word, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that although the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>if one brings a vow</b> offering <b>by itself</b> it <b>requires libations,</b> and if <b>one brings a gift</b> offering <b>by itself</b> it <b>requires libations,</b> nevertheless, if <b>one brings</b> both <b>a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering together, <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Therefore, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that libations are required for each offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or on your Festivals”?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that even when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only when they are distinct both in the type of offering and in the nature of the obligation to bring them, such as <b>where one brings a burnt offering in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and a peace offering as a gift</b> offering, <b>or vice versa.</b>
<b>But where one brings a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow,</b> or <b>alternatively, a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>as gift</b> offerings, one might have said that since in the former case both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> commitment, i.e., <b>a vow, and</b> in the latter case both are of <b>a single type of</b> commitment, i.e., <b>a gift</b> offering, therefore <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Consequently, the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or on your Festivals” teaches us</b> that even if they are distinct only in the type of offering, libations are required for each offering.
The Gemara continues its analysis: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the verse: <b>“And when you prepare a young bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice”</b> (Numbers 15:9)? The Gemara explains: It <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only when the two offerings are distinct in the type of offering, such as <b>where one brings a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow,</b> or <b>alternatively, a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>as a gift</b> offering.
<b>But where one brings two burnt offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering, or <b>alternatively, two peace offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering, <b>I would say</b> that since in the former case both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> offering, i.e., <b>a peace offering, and</b> in the latter case both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> offering, i.e., <b>a burnt offering,</b> therefore <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Consequently, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that even if they are distinct only in the nature of the commitment to bring them, libations are required for each offering.
The Gemara continues: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the verse: <b>“In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered or for peace offerings”</b> (Numbers 15:8)? The Gemara answers: It was necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only where two offerings are distinct from each other either in the nature of the commitment to bring them or in the type of offering, such as <b>where one brings two burnt offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering, or <b>alternatively, two peace offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering.
<b>But where one brings two burnt offerings,</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow, or two burnt offerings,</b> both <b>as a gift</b> offering, or <b>alternatively, two peace offerings,</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow, or two peace offerings,</b> both <b>as a gift</b> offering, I might have said with regard to the first of these cases that since both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> offering, i.e., <b>a burnt offering, and</b> of <b>a single type of</b> commitment, i.e., <b>a vow,</b> and likewise with regard to the other cases, therefore, <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Consequently, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that even if the offerings are not distinct from each other at all, libations are nevertheless required for each one.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that according to Rabbi Yonatan, the word “or” in the phrase “of the herd or of the flock” teaches that one who takes a vow to bring a burnt offering fulfills his obligation even if he brings only one animal, either from the herd or from the flock. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, why do I</b> need the word “or” in <b>this</b> phrase <b>“of the herd or of the flock”?</b> Although the <i>baraita</i> explains that he expounds the phrase to teach that one does not bring libations with a bird offering, it does not explain what he derives from the word “or.”
The Gemara explains: The word “or” is necessary, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only <b>where</b> one brings <b>two kinds</b> of animals, i.e., one from the flock and one from the herd; <b>but where</b> both animals are of <b>a single kind, it would be sufficient for him</b> to bring <b>libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Therefore, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that even if the offerings are of the same kind of animal, libations are nevertheless required for each one.
Later in the passage concerning libations it states: “So shall be done for each young bull, or for each ram, or for each of the lambs, or of the goats. According to the number that you may prepare, <b>so you shall do for each one</b> according to their number” (Numbers 15:11–12). The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this verse? The Gemara explains: It is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only <b>where</b> the offerings were consecrated <b>one after the other. But</b> if they were consecrated <b>at the same time, it would be sufficient for him</b> to bring <b>libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that in all cases, one must bring separate libations for each animal.
§ The mishna teaches that in general sin offerings and guilt offerings do not require libations. <b>But</b> the exception is <b>that the sin offering of a leper and his guilt offering require libations.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the following verse, which details the offerings a leper is required to bring as part of his purification process: “And on the eighth day he shall take two unblemished male lambs, and one unblemished female lamb in its year, <b>and three-tenths of fine flour for a meal offering,</b> mixed with oil, and one <i>log</i> of oil” (Leviticus 14:10). The <i>baraita</i> explains: It is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering</b> that <b>the verse speaks,</b> and so it is stating that each of the three offerings mentioned requires libations.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering</b> that the verse speaks? <b>Or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to a meal offering that comes by itself. When</b> the verse <b>states,</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And the priest shall sacrifice the burnt offering and the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:20), which demonstrates that the meal offering accompanies the burnt offering, <b>you must say</b> that in the earlier verse as well it is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering that the verse speaks.</b>
<b>But still, I do not know whether</b> this meal offering <b>requires</b> wine <b>libations or whether</b> it does <b>not.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And wine for pouring a libation, a quarter-<i>hin</i>, you shall prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one lamb”</b> (Numbers 15:5). The verse is expounded as referring to each of the leper’s offerings: “The <b>burnt offering”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burnt offering of a leper.</b> “The <b>sacrifice”; this</b> is referring to the <b>sin offering of a leper.</b> And as for the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or for the sacrifice,” this</b> is referring to the <b>guilt offering of a leper.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive both</b> the sin offering and the guilt offering <b>from</b> the word <b>“sacrifice”</b> alone, without relating to the word “or.”

Daf 91b

This would be just <b>as the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a nazirite: A nazirite who completes his term of naziriteship is required to shave his hair and bring various offerings. With regard to the shaved hair, the verse states: “And he shall take the hair of his nazirite head, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Numbers 6:18). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that if, instead of putting his hair on the fire under the peace offering, he puts it on the fire under his <b>sin offering or</b> under his <b>guilt offering,</b> he still fulfills the obligation? <b>The verse states:</b> “The <b>sacrifice,”</b> which serves to include these two offerings. Evidently, the term “sacrifice” refers both to a sin offering and to a guilt offering. Why does the <i>baraita</i> concerning a leper derive a guilt offering only from the word “or”?
The Gemara explains: <b>This matter,</b> that both a sin offering and a guilt offering can be derived from the same term, applies only <b>where they are both</b> brought <b>together,</b> for the same purpose, as in the case of a nazirite. Both offerings serve to render him fit, in the case of a pure nazirite to partake of wine and cut his hair, and in the case of an impure nazirite to begin counting his term of naziriteship again. <b>But</b> in the case of a leper, <b>where</b> his <b>guilt offering</b> serves <b>to render</b> him <b>fit</b> to return to the camp <b>and</b> his <b>sin offering</b> serves <b>to atone</b> for the sin that was the cause of his leprosy, since they come for different purposes, <b>we need two verses,</b> i.e., sources, to teach about the two of them.
The Gemara once again questions the derivations in the <i>baraita</i>: “The <b>sacrifice”; this</b> is referring to the <b>sin offering of a leper.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does the <i>baraita</i> know this? <b>I could say</b> instead that <b>this</b> is referring the <b>sin offering and guilt offering of a nazirite.</b> The sin offering is brought by a nazirite who completes his term of naziriteship, and the guilt offering is brought by a nazirite who became ritually impure. Accordingly, only those offerings of a nazirite would require libations, but not the burnt offering of a leper.
The Gemara rejects this possibility. This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In describing the offerings a nazirite brings upon the completion of his term of naziriteship, the verse states: “And he shall sacrifice his offering to the Lord, one unblemished male lamb in its year as a burnt offering, and one unblemished female lamb in its year as a sin offering, and one unblemished ram as peace offerings…<b>and their meal offering, and their libations”</b> (Numbers 6:14–15). The <i>baraita</i> explains that it is <b>with regard to his burnt offering and his peace offering,</b> mentioned earlier in that passage, <b>that the verse speaks,</b> and so it is only those nazirite offerings that require libations.
<b>Do you say</b> that the verse speaks <b>with regard to his burnt offering and his peace offering? Or</b> perhaps the verse speaks <b>even with regard to</b> the <b>sin offering</b> that a nazirite brings if he becomes ritually impure? To preclude the possibility of explaining the verse in that way, <b>the verse states</b> in the subsequent verses: <b>“And he shall make the ram a sacrifice of a peace offering</b> to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread; <b>and</b> the priest shall offer <b>its meal offering and its libations”</b> (Numbers 6:16–17).
Now, this <b>ram</b> offering <b>was</b> already <b>included</b> with all other peace offerings, which all require libations. <b>Why,</b> then, was it <b>singled out</b> in this verse with an independent statement teaching that it requires libations? It was in order <b>to equate</b> all other offerings <b>to it,</b> teaching that the requirement of libations applies only to offerings similar to it. <b>Just as a ram is distinct</b> in that it <b>can come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>so too, any</b> offering that <b>can come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering requires libations. This excludes the sin offering and guilt offering of a nazirite, as they cannot be brought as vow offerings or gift offerings.
The Gemara questions another of the derivations in the <i>baraita</i>: “The <b>burnt offering”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burnt offering of a leper.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does the <i>baraita</i> know this? <b>I could say</b> instead that <b>this</b> is referring the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth</b> (see Leviticus 12:6), and if so, there would be no source to require libations for the burnt offering of a leper.
<b>Abaye said:</b> The requirement to bring libations with the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth is derived from the end of</b> that <b>verse,</b> so the term “the burnt offering,” mentioned just before it, remains available to include the burnt offering of a leper in the requirement for libations.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And wine for pouring libations, a quarter-<i>hin</i>, you shall prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one lamb” (Numbers 15:5). <b>Rabbi Natan says: “For</b> the one <b>lamb”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth</b> and includes that offering in the requirement for libations. <b>“The one”; this</b> is referring to the <b>eleventh</b> animal <b>of</b> the animal <b>tithe, which is sacrificed</b> as <b>a peace offering.</b> In order to tithe his animals, the owner counts them one by one, and every tenth animal is consecrated as an animal tithe offering. If, when counting, he accidently counts the tenth animal as the ninth and the eleventh as the tenth, both are consecrated, the former as the animal tithe and the latter as a peace offering.
The <i>baraita</i> comments: It is necessary to have an independent derivation to teach that the eleventh animal requires libations, <b>because we do not find</b> another <i>halakha</i> like <b>this in the entire Torah,</b> in <b>which the ancillary</b> case <b>is more stringent than the principal</b> case. In this case, the animal tithe offering itself does not require libations.
The Gemara presents another answer. <b>Rava says:</b> The verse is expounded to be referring to three different offerings and includes them in the requirement to bring libations. It is reasonable that these three offerings all share an association with each other. <b>What is</b> the only <b>matter</b> in which three offerings are brought <b>that</b> would <b>necessitate three inclusions</b> to teach that each of them require libations? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is the offerings of <b>a leper,</b> who brings three different offerings.
§ It is further stated in the passage concerning libations: “Or <b>for a ram,</b> you shall prepare a meal offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with one-third of a <i>hin</i> of oil” (Numbers 15:6–7). The details of the meal offering brought with a ram are also mentioned elsewhere: “And two-tenths of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram” (Numbers 28:12); therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the verse here to state this? <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This verse serves <b>to include</b> in the requirement for libations <b>the ram of Aaron,</b> i.e., the ram of the High Priest that he sacrifices as a burnt offering on Yom Kippur.
The Gemara challenges: But the requirement to bring libations with <b>the ram of Aaron</b> should be <b>derived from</b> the term: <b>“On your Festivals”</b> (Numbers 15:3), as the <i>baraita</i> derived from that term that all obligatory offerings of Festivals require libations. The Gemara resolves this challenge: It is necessary to have an independent derivation for the ram of Aaron, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that obligatory offerings of Festivals require libations, applies only to <b>communal</b> offerings, <b>but not</b> to offerings <b>of an individual,</b> such as the ram of Aaron.
The Gemara questions this: <b>But</b> why would one think that because the ram of Aaron is an offering of an individual it would not require libations? In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> it <b>different from</b> the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth,</b> which is also brought by an individual and yet it requires libations?
The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> i.e., the conclusion drawn from the <i>halakha</i> of the burnt offering of a woman who gave birth that even offerings of an individual require libations, applies only to an offering <b>that does not have a fixed time</b> when it must be sacrificed; <b>but</b> with regard to an offering <b>that has a fixed time</b> when it must be sacrificed, <b>I</b> might <b>say</b> that it does <b>not</b> require libations. Accordingly, it is necessary to have an independent derivation that <b>teaches us</b> that the ram of Aaron requires libations.
The Gemara continues to expound the verse cited: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or for a ram”?</b> The Gemara explains: It serves <b>to include</b> the sacrifice of <b>a <i>palges</i></b> in the requirement to bring libations. When referring to sheep, the Torah speaks only of lambs and rams. A sheep during its first twelve months is called a lamb, and one older than thirteen months is called a ram. A <i>palges</i> is a sheep in its thirteenth month and is never explicitly mentioned by the Torah. It is therefore necessary to have an independent derivation to teach that if one is sacrificed, libations must be brought with it.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that a <i>palges</i> <b>is</b> considered an independent <b>entity,</b> i.e., it is not regarded as a lamb or a ram, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 1:3): One who is obligated to sacrifice a lamb or a ram and <b>sacrificed</b> a <i>palges</i> <b>should bring with it the libations</b> that are required when bringing <b>a ram, but</b> nevertheless its sacrifice <b>is not considered</b> a fulfillment of <b>his</b> obligation to bring <b>an offering</b> of a ram or a lamb. <b>And,</b> commenting on this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the requirement to bring libations in this case is derived from the phrase <b>“or for a ram,”</b> which serves <b>to include</b> the sacrifice of <b>a <i>palges</i>.</b>
<b>But</b> the need for an independent derivation is difficult <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda; as he said</b> that in the mishna’s case, the individual <b>brings</b> the libations of a ram <b>but stipulates</b> concerning them that if a <i>palges</i> is a ram, then all of the libations should be regarded as its libations, and if a <i>palges</i> is a lamb, then the quantity of those libations required for a lamb should be regarded as its libations and the rest should be regarded as a gift offering, <b>because</b> he holds that a <i>palges</i> is either a lamb or a ram but that it <b>is uncertain</b> to us which it is. According to bar Padda, one can ask: <b>Is it necessary</b> to have <b>a verse to include an uncertain</b> case? Although it is not known how to categorize a <i>palges</i>, it is included either in the category of a sheep or a ram, and its libations are therefore detailed in the verse.
The Gemara concludes: <b>Certainly, according to</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda,</b> this matter is <b>difficult.</b>
§ The Gemara discusses another verse in the passage about libations: <b>“So it shall be done for the one bull, or for the one ram, or for the kid of the lambs or of the goats”</b> (Numbers 15:11). Ostensibly, this verse states nothing beyond that which has already been explained in the beginning of that passage, which delineates the requirement of libations for each type of animal offering. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “For the one bull”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found the verse differentiates between the libations of a ram and the libations of a lamb,</b> even though they are both sheep, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should likewise <b>differentiate between the libations of a bull,</b> which is in its second year, <b>and the libations of a calf,</b> which is still in its first year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the one bull,”</b> teaching that there is one <i>halakha</i> for all bulls, including calves, i.e., the same requirement applies to them.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “For the one ram”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found the verse differentiates</b> with regard to sheep <b>between the libations of</b> a lamb <b>in</b> its first <b>year and the libations of</b> a ram <b>in</b> its <b>second</b> year, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should further <b>differentiate</b> with regard to rams themselves <b>between the libations of</b> a ram <b>in</b> its <b>second</b> year <b>and the libations of</b> a ram <b>in</b> its <b>third</b> year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the one ram,”</b> teaching that there is one <i>halakha</i> for all rams.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “For the kid of the lambs”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found that the verse differentiates</b> with regard to male sheep <b>between the libations of a male lamb and the libations of a ram,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should further <b>differentiate between the libations of a female lamb and the libations of a ewe.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the kid of the lambs.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Or of the goats”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found that the verse differentiates</b> with regard to sheep <b>between the libations of a male lamb and the libations of a ram,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should further <b>differentiate between the libations of a kid and the libations of</b> an older <b>goat.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Or of the goats.”</b>
§ Having mentioned the libations of a ewe, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa said: Rava tested us</b> by asking the following question:

Daf 92a

<b>How much</b> wine is used for the <b>libations of a ewe? And I resolved</b> this question <b>from</b> that which is stated in <b>a mishna</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 14b): Generally, the wine for libations would be procured from the supplies of the Temple. One bringing an offering would pay the Temple treasurer for the quantity of wine required, and then the treasurer would give him a token as a receipt indicating what had been paid for. The individual would then proceed to the official appointed over the Temple’s supplies to collect the wine he had paid for. If the token had the word: <b>Kid,</b> it could be <b>used</b> to collect wine for <b>libations for sheep,</b> whether <b>large or small, male or female, except for those of rams.</b> Evidently, the same quantity is required for the libations of ewes as for lambs.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <b>all communal offerings there is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>except for the bull that comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of <b>any</b> one <b>of the mitzvot</b> that was perpetrated due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin, where the judges of the Sanhedrin are required to place their hands upon its head (see Leviticus 4:13–21); <b>and the scapegoat</b> brought on Yom Kippur, upon which the High Priest places his hands (see Leviticus, chapter 16). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Also</b> in the case of the <b>goat</b> that comes to atone for a community-wide perpetration of <b>idol worship</b> that occurred due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin, the judges of the Sanhedrin are required to place their hands upon its head (see Numbers 15:22–26).
<b>All offerings of an individual require placing hands, except for the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and the Paschal offering.</b>
The mitzva of placing hands is performed by the owner of the offering. The mishna adds: <b>And</b> if the owner died, then <b>the heir</b> is regarded as the offering’s owner and so he <b>places</b> his <b>hands</b> on the offering <b>and brings</b> the accompanying <b>libations. And</b> furthermore, <b>he can substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for it. Although it is prohibited to perform an act of substitution, if the owner of an offering does this, his attempt is successful to the extent that the non-sacred animal is thereby consecrated, even though the original offering also remains sacred.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>all communal offerings there is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands, except for the bull that comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of <b>any</b> one <b>of the mitzvot, and</b> the <b>goats</b> that come to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of the prohibition <b>of idol worship;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says: There is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands</b> with regard to the <b>goats</b> that come to atone <b>for idol worship. But</b> if this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>which</b> offering <b>shall I bring in their place? The scapegoat.</b>
The Gemara interrupts the citation of the <i>baraita</i> with a question: Why does Rabbi Yehuda search for an additional case? Is it <b>not possible not to insert</b> an additional case? <b>Ravina said:</b> It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that there are <b>two</b> instances in which <b>placing hands</b> is required <b>for communal</b> offerings.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: How can you include the scapegoat as one of the two cases requiring the placing of hands? <b>Isn’t it</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>placing hands</b> can be performed <b>only by</b> the offering’s <b>owner,</b> i.e., the one who will achieve atonement through the sacrifice of the offering? <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> offering, the scapegoat, it is <b>Aaron</b> the High Priest <b>or</b> whichever of <b>his sons</b> serves as High Priest who <b>places</b> his <b>hands on it,</b> and yet it is not he who achieves atonement through it. Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> offering <b>as well,</b> that <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled because <b>Aaron and his sons</b> are considered owners, as they also <b>achieve atonement through it</b> together with the rest of the community.
The Gemara elaborates on the dispute. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: And</b> Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda, who disagree as to whether the High Priest achieves atonement through the scapegoat, each <b>follow</b> their standard line of <b>reasoning.</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: At the end of the passage delineating the Yom Kippur Temple service, the verse states: “He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred, and upon the Tent of Meeting and the altar he shall effect atonement; and upon the priests and upon all the people, shall he bring atonement” (Leviticus 16:33). <b>“He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies. <b>“And upon the Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary.</b> “And the <b>altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning. “He shall effect atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards.</b> “And upon the <b>priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning.</b> “And <b>upon all the people”; these are the Israelites. “Shall he bring atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b>
<b>All of them are equated with regard to</b> the fact that they are all atoned for through <b>one atonement,</b> i.e., <b>that they are atoned for by the scapegoat</b> for all transgressions other than the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atones for Israelites for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too,</b> the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. And <b>just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites for other transgressions, so too,</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests for other transgressions.</b> It is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that it is only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda that the scapegoat atones for both Israelites and priests, and consequently the High Priest may be considered an owner with regard to the mitzva of placing hands.
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Shimon’s opinion: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> one can ask: <b>Weren’t</b> both Israelites and priests <b>certainly equated</b> in the verse in Leviticus? In what way are they equated in the verse? The Gemara explains: Yes, according to his opinion <b>they are equated</b> in <b>that they are all subject to atonement</b> on Yom Kippur, <b>but each one</b> of the groups <b>achieves atonement in its own</b> way. The priests achieve atonement through the bull brought by the High Priest and his confession, while the Israelites and Levites achieve atonement through the confession over the scapegoat.
The Gemara summarizes: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> for the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>Israelites achieve atonemment through</b> the presentation of the <b>blood of the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>and</b> the <b>priests</b> achieve atonemment <b>through</b> the presentation of the blood of the <b>bull of Aaron,</b> i.e., of the High Priest. And <b>for other transgressions,</b> both <b>these</b> Israelites <b>and those</b> priests <b>achieve atonement through</b> the <b>confession</b> made over the <b>scapegoat. But according to Rabbi Shimon, for other transgressions as well,</b> the <b>priests achieve atonement through</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull</b> of the High Priest.
This understanding of their dispute is just <b>like that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 2b): <b>Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, achieve atonement from the scapegoat equally. <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest?</b> It is <b>only that the bull</b> of the High Priest that he offers on Yom Kippur <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for defiling caused by them through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat, whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests.</b> And for all other transgressions, <b>just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon disagree as to whether or not the goats that come for a community-wide violation of the prohibition against idol worship require the rite of placing hands. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull that comes to atone for a community-wide violation of one of the mitzvot: <b>“And the elders of the congregation shall place their hands upon the head of the bull before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 4:15). The verse specifies that this requirement applies to the bull to indicate that, with regard to offerings brought for community-wide transgressions, only the <b>bull requires placing hands, but</b> the <b>goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require placing hands;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Both offerings require placing hands. The verse specifies the requirement with regard to the <b>bull</b> because only it <b>requires</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Elders</b> of the Sanhedrin, <b>but</b> the <b>goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by the Elders,</b> but <b>rather by Aaron,</b> i.e., the High Priest.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the Yom Kippur scapegoat, the verse states: “And Aaron shall place both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins” (Leviticus 16:21). The emphasis of <b>“the live</b> goat” indicates that with regard to communal offerings of goats, only <b>the live</b> goat, i.e., the scapegoat, <b>requires placing hands, but the goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require placing hands;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Both offerings require placing hands. The verse specifies the requirement with regard to the <b>live</b> goat to teach that it <b>requires</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Aaron,</b> i.e., the High Priest,

Daf 92b

<b>but the goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Aaron. Rather,</b> they require that it be performed <b>by the Elders</b> of the Sanhedrin. This contradicts the <i>baraita</i> that states that Rabbi Shimon holds that placing hands on the goats brought for idol worship is performed by the High Priest.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: And</b> how can <b>you understand that this first</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is accurate,</b> in order to use it as the basis for a contradiction? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Shimon say</b> that <b>we require</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by</b> the <b>owners,</b> i.e., those who will achieve atonement through the offering? The goat brought for idol worship is brought to atone for the Sanhedrin and the people, not for the High Priest.
<b>Rather, answer</b> that the earlier <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>as follows:</b> The verse specifies the requirement of placing hands with regard to <b>the bull</b> brought for a community-wide transgression to indicate that only that <b>bull requires placing hands, but</b> the <b>goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require placing hands;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse specifies the requirement of placing hands with regard to <b>the live</b> goat, i.e., the scapegoat, to indicate that only that <b>live</b> goat <b>requires</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Aaron,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>but the goats</b> brought for a community-wide perpetration of <b>idol worship do not require</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Aaron. Rather,</b> they require that it be performed <b>by the Elders</b> of the Sanhedrin.
The Gemara adds: <b>And this is what Rabbi Shimon was saying to Rabbi Yehuda: Goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship require placing hands. And if you heard</b> a tradition <b>that they do not require placing hands, it is</b> only <b>with regard to</b> the fact that it is not to be performed by <b>Aaron,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>that you heard</b> that tradition, <b>and the exclusion</b> of the High Priest from having to place hands <b>is</b> derived <b>from</b> the term <b>“the live</b> goat.”
The Gemara questions Rabbi Yehuda’s statement: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda, why do I</b> need <b>to exclude</b> the goats brought for idol worship from the requirement of placing hands by deriving this exclusion <b>from a verse? Didn’t Ravina say</b> that it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that there are <b>two</b> instances in which <b>placing hands</b> is required <b>for communal</b> offerings? Accordingly, once it has been established that placing hands is required for the bull brought for a community-wide transgression and for the scapegoat, it follows that it is not required in any other case. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda holds that the tradition Ravina cited is <b>merely a well-known statement.</b> It is not a tradition that was transmitted to Moses; rather, the Sages formulated it to remember the <i>halakha</i> that they derived from the verses.
The Gemara questions Rabbi Shimon’s statement: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon, from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the <b>goats</b> brought for <b>idol worship require placing hands?</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>we derive</b> it <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When a king sins…he shall bring for his offering an unblemished male goat. <b>And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat”</b> (Leviticus 4:22–24). The verse could have stated: Upon its head. The reason it adds “of the goat” is <b>to include</b> the <b>goat</b> brought as a sin offering by <b>Nahshon</b> (see Numbers 7:12–17) <b>in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The term “of the goat” serves <b>to include</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin offerings for communal <b>idol worship in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering, <b>as Rabbi Shimon would say: Any sin offering whose blood enters inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>requires placing hands.</b>
The Gemara questions the concluding statement of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>baraita</i> <b>to state: As</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>would</b> say? The statement would appear to explain that Rabbi Shimon’s ruling is merely an expression of a principle that he held, while the <i>baraita</i> itself explains that Rabbi Shimon derived the matter from the repetition of the word “goat.” The Gemara explains: The statement is not presenting the basis of his ruling but is <b>merely a mnemonic</b> to aid in remembering it.
The Gemara questions why Rabbi Shimon expounds the word “goat” as referring to goats brought for idol worship: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the word “goat” includes the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur? The Gemara answers: It is more reasonable to include a goat offering that is <b>similar to</b> the offering mentioned in that verse, i.e., the <b>goat of a king, which atones for known transgressions of a mitzva.</b> A goat brought for idol worship is similar in this regard, whereas the goat brought on Yom Kippur atones specifically for transgressions of which the transgressor is unaware.
The Gemara questions why Rabbi Shimon needs a verse at all: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina, who said:</b> It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that there are <b>two</b> instances in which <b>placing hands</b> is required <b>for communal</b> offerings, <b>why do I</b> need any <b>verses,</b> i.e., why do I need the word “goat,” to include goats brought for idol worship in the requirement of placing hands? Since he holds that the priests do not achieve atonement through the scapegoat, perforce the goat brought to atone for idol worship must require placing hands, as otherwise there would not be two instances.
The Gemara explains: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> learned by tradition <b>was necessary, and</b> the exposition of <b>the verses was necessary</b> as well.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, if</b> the <i>halakha</i> were to be derived only <b>from the verse, I would say</b> through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that even <b>communal peace offerings,</b> i.e., the two lambs brought with the two loaves on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, require placing of the hands.
The Gemara explains: This is <b>like</b> the <b>difficulty</b> raised <b>against the mishna of that chapter,</b> i.e., Chapter Five, which begins: <b>All the meal offerings come</b> to be offered as matza. The mishna there states (61a): <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There are <b>three types</b> of offerings that <b>require</b> performance of <b>three mitzvot;</b> in each case, two of the mitzvot apply, but not the third. The mishna continues: Peace offerings brought by individuals require placing hands on the head of the animal while the animal is still alive, and waving after it is slaughtered, but there is no obligation to wave it while it is alive. Communal peace offerings require waving both while they are alive and after they are slaughtered, but there is no obligation to place hands on them. And the guilt offering of the leper requires placing hands and waving while alive, but there is no obligation to wave it after it is slaughtered.
The Gemara there (62b) raises the following difficulty: <b>Let us bring an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference to the contrary, i.e., conclude that <b>communal peace offerings should require placing hands through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than that of communal peace offerings in <b>that they do not require waving</b> while <b>alive,</b> nevertheless <b>require placing hands,</b> then with regard to communal peace offerings, which do require waving when alive, is it not logical to conclude that they require placing hands? To counter this inference it <b>was necessary</b> to have <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> learned by tradition to limit the requirement of placing hands to only two instances.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> it were derived only <b>from the <i>halakha</i></b> learned by tradition, without the exposition of the verse, <b>I would say</b> that <b>we do not know</b> exactly <b>which</b> offering other than the bull brought for a community-wide transgression requires placing hands. Therefore, the word “goat” <b>teaches us</b> that the second instance is a goat offering <b>similar to</b> the offering mentioned in that verse, specifically the <b>goat of a king, which atones for known transgressions of a mitzva,</b> i.e., a goat brought for idol worship.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>All offerings of an individual require placing hands except for the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and the Paschal offering.</b>
Leviticus, chapter 3, discusses peace offerings and details the obligation of placing hands. The term “his offering” is mentioned a number of times. Each time serves to emphasize that peace offerings require placing hands and to exclude another type of offering from that requirement. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> detailing which offerings are excluded and why one might have thought otherwise. <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:1) requires placing hands, <b>but not the firstborn</b> offering. <b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>If a peace offering, whose consecration does not</b> originate <b>from</b> being in its mother’s <b>womb,</b> nevertheless <b>requires placing hands,</b> then with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> offering, <b>whose consecration</b> originates <b>from the womb, is it not logical that it requires placing hands?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,”</b> teaching that a peace offering requires placing hands <b>but the firstborn</b> offering does <b>not.</b>
<b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:2) requires placing hands, <b>but not the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering. <b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>If peace offerings,</b> which are unlike the animal tithe in that their designation <b>does not consecrate</b> the animals <b>before and after them,</b> i.e., this unique stringency of animal tithe does not apply to them, nevertheless <b>require placing hands,</b> then with regard to an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>which can consecrate</b> the animals <b>before and after it,</b> as in the case where the ninth or eleventh animal to be counted was mistakenly designated as the tenth animal, <b>is it not logical that it requires placing hands?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,”</b> teaching that a peace offering requires placing hands, <b>but the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering does <b>not.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:6) requires placing hands, <b>but not the Paschal offering. As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>If peace offerings, which are not</b> subject to a positive mitzva to <b>arise and bring</b> them, nevertheless <b>require placing hands,</b> then with regard to <b>a Paschal offering, which is</b> subject to a positive mitzva to <b>arise and bring</b> it, <b>is it not logical that it requires placing hands?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,”</b> teaching that a peace offering requires placing hands, <b>but the Paschal offering</b> does <b>not.</b>
The Gemara rejects the inferences of the <i>baraita</i>: Each of these <i>a fortiori</i> inferences <b>can be refuted. What</b> is notable <b>about peace offerings?</b> They are notable in <b>that they require libations and the waving of the breast and thigh.</b> Therefore, a <i>halakha</i> that applies to peace offerings cannot necessarily be applied to the firstborn offering, animal tithe offering, or Paschal offering, which do not share those requirements. Accordingly, <b>the verses</b> that the <i>baraita</i> cites must be understood as <b>a mere support,</b> but are not actually necessary to counter the <i>a fortiori</i> inferences.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b>

Daf 93a

if the repeated term “his offering” is not needed to counter the <i>a fortiori</i> inferences, <b>why do I</b> need these three <b>verses?</b> The Gemara explains: One instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>an offering of another</b> person. Another instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>an offering of a gentile.</b> The third instance of <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands,</b> i.e., they are all required to place their hands on the offering.
§ The mishna states: If the owner of an offering died, then <b>the heir</b> is regarded as the offering’s owner. Therefore, he <b>places</b> his <b>hands</b> on the offering and brings the accompanying libations, and he can substitute a non-sacred animal for it. Although it is prohibited to perform an act of substitution, if the owner of an offering does this, his attempt is successful to the extent that the non-sacred animal is thereby consecrated, even though the original offering also remains sacred.
<b>Rav Ḥananya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the presence of Rava: An heir does not place hands</b> on an offering he inherited, and <b>an heir cannot substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for an offering he inherited. Rava asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>The heir places</b> his <b>hands</b> on the offering, <b>and brings</b> the accompanying <b>libations, and he can substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for it and thereby consecrate the non-sacred animal?
Rav Ḥananya <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Should I reverse</b> the current version of the <i>baraita</i> to have it be in accordance with the mishna? Rava <b>said to him: No,</b> as <b>whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An heir places hands,</b> and <b>an heir can effect substitution. Rabbi Yehuda says: An heir does not place hands,</b> and <b>an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> He expounds the term <b>“his offering”</b> as teaching that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>one’s father’s offering</b> that one inherited. <b>And</b> furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning who can substitute a non-sacred animal for an offering, which is <b>the initial stage of consecration, from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning who performs the rite of placing hands on the offering, which is <b>the final stage of consecration: Just as</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir does not place</b> his <b>hands, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration, an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>
<b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive their opinion? The verse states: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), with the doubled form of <i>hamer yamir</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one capable of effecting substitution. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>they derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning who performs the rite of placing hands, which is the <b>final stage of consecration, from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning who can effect substitution, which is <b>an initial stage of consecration: Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration, an heir can effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir places</b> his <b>hands.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> term: <b>“His offering”?</b> The Gemara explains how the Rabbis expound each mention of the term. One instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>an offering of a gentile.</b> Another instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>an offering of another</b> person. The third instance of <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands,</b> i.e., they are all required to place their hands on the offering.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not hold</b> that one of the mentions serves <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands,</b> so he is able to expound it to exclude an heir from the requirement. <b>Alternatively,</b> if <b>he holds</b> that one of the mentions serves to include owners of a jointly owned offering, then he must <b>derive</b> that one does not place hands on the offering of <b>a gentile or</b> of <b>another</b> person <b>from</b> the same <b>one</b> mention in the <b>verse,</b> which <b>leaves him two</b> more mentions in the <b>verses. One</b> he expounds to teach that on <b>“his offering”</b> he places hands, <b>but not</b> on <b>his father’s offering</b> that he inherited, <b>and the other</b> mention remains <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda, what does he do</b> with the use of the doubled form <b>in this</b> verse: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it to include a woman</b> among those who can effect substitution. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since the entire matter</b> of substitution <b>is stated</b> in the Torah <b>only in the masculine form, what</b> is the reason that <b>we ultimately</b> come <b>to include a woman? The verse states:</b> “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>],”</b> using a doubled form.
<b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, they derive</b> that a woman can effect substitution <b>from</b> the term: <b>“And if”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), in the phrase “and if he shall substitute.” <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not expound</b> the term <b>“and if”</b> at all.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Everyone</b> who brings an animal offering <b>places hands</b> upon its head, <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, a minor, a blind person, a gentile,</b> a Canaanite <b>slave, the agent</b> of the owner of the offering who brings the offering on the owner’s behalf, <b>and a woman.</b>
<b>And</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands is a non-essential mitzva;</b> therefore, failure to place hands does not prevent the owner from achieving atonement.
The rite of placing hands is performed by leaning <b>on the head</b> of the offering <b>with two hands. And in the</b> same <b>location</b> in the Temple <b>that one places hands, one slaughters</b> the animal. <b>And immediately following</b> the rite of <b>placing hands,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> is performed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains why certain types of people do not place hands on an offering: <b>Granted, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> do not place their hands on the offering, <b>as they are not mentally competent.</b> The exclusion of <b>a gentile</b> is also understandable, as the verses concerning placing hands are introduced with: “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them” (Leviticus 1:2), which indicates that <b>the children of Israel place hands</b> upon their offerings, <b>but gentiles do not place</b> their <b>hands</b> upon their offerings. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a blind person, what is the reason</b> that he does <b>not</b> place his hands on his offering?
<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi</b> disagree as to the source of the exclusion of a blind person. <b>One said</b> that it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the mention of <b>placing hands</b> in the passage detailing the general requirement to do so, and the mention of <b>placing hands</b> stated with regard to the bull offering brought for a community-wide violation perpetrated due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin, which is performed <b>by</b> the <b>Elders of</b> the <b>congregation,</b> i.e., the judges of the Sanhedrin: Just as the judges may not be blind (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 34b), so too the rite of placing hands is not performed by a blind person.
<b>And</b> the other <b>one said</b> that it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the mention of <b>placing hands</b> in the passage detailing the general requirement to do so, and the mention of <b>placing hands</b> stated with regard to the <b>burnt offering of appearance</b> brought by an individual on the pilgrimage Festivals: Just as a blind person is exempt from making the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and bringing the offering (see <i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a), so too he is excluding from the requirement of placing hands.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who said</b> that the exclusion of a blind person is derived <b>from</b> the <b>burnt offering of appearance, what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not derive</b> this <b>from</b> the placing of hands performed by the <b>Elders of</b> the <b>congregation?</b>

Daf 93b

The Gemara answers: He holds that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the offering of <b>an individual from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another offering of <b>an individual,</b> such as the burnt offering of appearance, <b>and one does not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the offering of <b>an individual from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a communal</b> offering, e.g., the bull brought for a community-wide violation.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who said</b> that the exclusion of a blind person is derived <b>from</b> the placing of hands performed by the <b>Elders of</b> the <b>congregation, what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not derive</b> this <b>from</b> the <b>burnt offering of appearance?</b> The Gemara answers: He holds that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a matter</b> concerning <b>which</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands is</b> explicitly <b>written with regard to</b> that case <b>itself,</b> as is the case in the passage detailing the general requirement of placing hands, <b>from</b> another <b>matter</b> concerning <b>which placing hands is</b> also explicitly <b>written with regard to</b> that case <b>itself,</b> as is the case in the passage describing the bull brought for a community-wide violation of a sin. This serves <b>to exclude</b> the possibility of deriving the <i>halakhot</i> from those of the <b>burnt offering of appearance, as</b> the requirement to place hands upon it is not explicitly written in the Torah with regard to it, but rather <b>it itself is derived from</b> the requirement stated with regard to <b>a voluntary burnt offering.</b>
This is <b>as a <i>tanna</i> taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the presence of Rav Yitzḥak bar Abba:</b> With regard to the obligatory offering brought by Aaron the High Priest on the eighth day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle, it is written: <b>“And the burnt offering was presented, and he sacrificed in accordance with the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 9:16). This last phrase means: <b>In accordance with the ordinance of a voluntary burnt offering.</b> Accordingly, this verse <b>teaches about</b> every <b>obligatory burnt offering,</b> including the burnt offering of appearance, <b>that it requires placing hands,</b> just as a voluntary burnt offering does.
§ The mishna states: A Canaanite <b>slave, the agent</b> of the owner of the offering who brings the offering on his behalf, <b>and a woman</b> do not place hands on their offerings. Concerning these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term “his hand” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3, which details the requirement of placing hands. Each mention is expounded to exclude a different case. <b>“His hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not the hand of his</b> Canaanite <b>slave; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not the hand of his agent; “his hand”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not the hand of his wife.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> three exclusions? The Gemara explains that all three mentions <b>are necessary,</b> as <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>one</b> exclusion, <b>I would say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> only a Canaanite <b>slave, as</b> since <b>he is not commanded in mitzvot</b> it is reasonable that he cannot perform the rite of placing hands. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>an agent, since he is commanded in mitzvot, and</b> there is a principle that the halakhic status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself,</b> one might <b>say</b> that he <b>could place</b> his <b>hands</b> on the offering of the owner on the owner’s behalf, and thereby fulfill the requirement. Therefore, it is necessary to have an independent source to exclude an agent.
<b>And had</b> the Merciful One <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, one would have excluded only a Canaanite slave and an agent, <b>as they are not considered like his own flesh. But</b> with regard to <b>his wife, who is considered like his own flesh,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she places</b> her <b>hands</b> on her husband’s offering. Therefore, the third mention is <b>necessary</b> to teach that even a wife cannot fulfill the requirement on behalf of her husband.
§ The mishna states: The requirement of <b>placing hands is a non-essential mitzva. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall place his hand</b> upon the head of the burnt offering, <b>and it shall be accepted for him</b> to effect atonement for him” (Leviticus 1:4). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But does</b> the rite of <b>placing hands effect atonement? Isn’t atonement</b> effected <b>only through</b> the presentation of the <b>blood? As it is stated</b> with regard to blood: “For the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to effect atonement for your souls, <b>for it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if one treated placing hands</b> as though it were <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and therefore neglected to perform it, then <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he did not effect atonement; but</b> nevertheless, in actuality, the offering <b>atones</b> for his sin and he does not need to bring another offering.
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to waving in this way:</b> “He shall take one male lamb as a guilt offering <b>to be waved to effect atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 14:21). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Does waving</b> the offering <b>effect atonement? Isn’t atonement</b> effected <b>only through</b> the presentation of <b>the blood? As it is stated: “For it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if one treated waving</b> as though it were <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and therefore neglected to perform it, then <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he did not effect atonement; but</b> nevertheless, in actuality, the offering <b>effects atonement</b> for his sin and he does not need to bring another offering.
§ The mishna further states that that placing hands is performed by leaning <b>on the head</b> of the offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase “his hand upon the head” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3. Each mention is expounded to exclude the possibility of performing the rite on a different part of the animal’s body. Placing hands is performed with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the neck</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the back</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the breast</b> of the animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> three exclusions? The Gemara explains that all three mentions <b>are necessary,</b> as <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>one</b> exclusion, <b>I would say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> only the animal’s <b>neck, as it is not level with the head of</b> the animal. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>its back, which is level with its head,</b> one might <b>say</b> that it is <b>not</b> precluded and that one can fulfill the requirement by placing one’s hands there. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to have an independent source to exclude the animal’s back.
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, one would have excluded only the neck and the back, <b>as</b> those parts are <b>not included in</b> the <b>waving</b> of the offering, i.e., they are not waved. <b>But</b> with regard to the animal’s <b>breast, which is included in the waving</b> of the offering, one might say that it is <b>not</b> precluded and that one can fulfill the requirement by placing one’s hands there. Therefore, the third mention is <b>necessary</b> to teach that placing hands cannot be performed even on the animal’s breast.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one placed <b>his hand on the sides</b> of the animal’s head, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; does one fulfill the requirement of placing hands by doing so? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Bira’a, son of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, says</b> that the verse: “And he shall place <b>his hand upon the head of</b> the burnt offering” (Leviticus 1:4), indicates that it must be done with his hand <b>on</b> the top of <b>its head and not</b> with <b>his hand on the sides</b> of its head.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If one’s hands were wrapped in <b>a cloth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether the cloth is regarded as <b>an interposition</b> between his hands and the animal such that it invalidates the rite? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>, which states: The rite is valid <b>provided that there is no item that interposes between him and the offering.</b>
§ The mishna adds that the placing of hands is performed <b>with two hands.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said: As the verse states</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And Aaron shall place both his hands [<i>yadav</i>]</b> upon the head of the live goat” (Leviticus 16:21). The word <i>yadav</i>, meaning: His hands, is written without a second <i>yod</i>, and so if read without vowels it reads as: <b>His hand. But it is</b> also <b>written “both,”</b> which makes clear that the intention is that he must use both of his hands. <b>This established a paradigm</b> that in <b>any place where it is stated</b> in the Torah: <b>His hand, there are here two</b> hands, <b>unless the verse</b> explicitly <b>specifies</b> that there is only <b>one.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar went and stated this <i>halakha</i> in the study hall, but he did not say it in the name of Reish Lakish. Reish Lakish heard</b> about this <b>and became angry.</b> He <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>If it enters your mind</b> that <b>wherever it is written: His hand,</b> the meaning is that <b>there are</b> actually <b>two</b> hands, then <b>why do I</b> ever need the Torah <b>to write: His hands, his hands,</b> i.e., <i>yadav</i> in the plural, which it does on numerous occasions?
Reish Lakish <b>raised objections against him</b> from <b>twenty-four</b> occasions where the Torah writes: <b>His hands,</b> for example: <b>“His own hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30); <b>“his hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall contend for him,</b> and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7); <b>“Guiding his hands [<i>yadav</i>] wittingly,</b> for Manasseh was the firstborn” (Genesis 48:14). Rabbi Elazar <b>was silent,</b> as he had no response.
<b>After</b> Reish Lakish had <b>calmed down, he said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not say to me</b> the following: When I established that paradigm, <b>I was speaking</b> only about the term: <b>His hands [<i>yadav</i>], with regard to placing hands.</b> But with regard to other <i>halakhot</i>, when the Torah says “his hand” the reference is to just one hand, and so when referring to two hands it must say “his hands.”
The Gemara asks: But <b>also with regard to placing hands it is written,</b> concerning Moses’ ordination of Joshua: <b>“And he placed his hands [<i>yadav</i>] upon him</b> and gave him a charge” (Numbers 27:23), using the plural “his hands” [<i>yadav</i>] instead of: His hand [<i>yado</i>]. The Gemara clarifies that Reish Lakish meant that one could say: When I established that paradigm, <b>I was speaking</b> only about the term: His hands [<i>yadav</i>], <b>with regard to placing hands</b> on <b>an animal</b> offering. But in all other cases, if the intention is that there were two hands, the plural must be used.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And in the</b> same <b>location</b> in the Temple <b>that one places hands, one slaughters</b> the animal. <b>And immediately following</b> the rite of <b>placing hands,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> is performed. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>saying?</b> The mishna appears to state two distinct rulings. But if so, the first statement is superfluous, because if the slaughter immediately follows the placing of hands, then it is obvious that the animal is slaughtered without changing its location. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: In the</b> same <b>location</b> in the Temple <b>that one places hands one slaughters</b> the animal, <b>because immediately following</b> the rite of <b>placing hands,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> is performed. There are not two distinct rulings; rather, the second statement is the explanation of the first.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is an aspect of greater <b>stringency with regard to placing hands than</b> there is <b>with regard to waving, and</b> there is an aspect of greater stringency <b>with regard to waving than</b> there is <b>with regard to placing hands.</b> The stringency with regard to placing hands is <b>that</b> if several people are partners in bringing an offering, <b>one</b> of them <b>waves</b> the offering <b>on behalf of all the</b> other <b>partners, but one cannot</b> fulfill the requirement of placing hands if he alone <b>places hands on behalf of all the</b> other <b>partners;</b> rather, each member must place hands himself. <b>The stringency with regard to waving</b> is <b>that waving is practiced in</b> the cases of both <b>offerings of an individual,</b> e.g., peace offerings, where the breast and thigh and sacrificial portions are waved, <b>and in</b> the cases of <b>communal offerings,</b> e.g., the two lambs sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, which are waved together with the two loaves;

Daf 94a

and it is practiced both <b>in</b> the cases of offerings when they are <b>alive,</b> e.g., the guilt offering of a leper and the lambs of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and in</b> the cases of offerings after they are <b>slaughtered,</b> e.g., the breast and thigh. By contrast, placing hands is practiced with a live animal. A further stringency is that waving is practiced both <b>in</b> the case of <b>an item in which there is a living spirit,</b> i.e., an animal offering, <b>and in</b> the case of <b>an item in which there is not a living spirit,</b> e.g., the <i>omer</i> offering, the <i>sota</i> meal offering, and the loaves accompanying a thanks offering and the ram of the nazirite, whereas placing hands is only ever performed upon living beings.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to placing hands: “And he shall place his hand on the head of his offering” (Leviticus 3:2). The term <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> of the <b>owners of an offering</b> in the requirement <b>of placing hands,</b> i.e., each one must perform it.
It is necessary for the verse to teach this, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could it not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> that only one partner needs to place his hands on the offering? The inference is as follows: <b>If</b> the requirement of <b>waving, which was amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, nevertheless <b>was limited with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by a number of <b>partners,</b> as only one of them waves on behalf of all of them, then with regard to the requirement of <b>placing hands, which was not amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>is it not logical that it was</b> also <b>limited with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> and it is sufficient for one partner to place his hands on behalf of the others? To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,” to include each of the owners of an offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one could suggest the opposite inference and conclude that the requirement of <b>waving should be amplified with regard to partners, through</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands, which was not amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>was amplified with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> requiring each partner to perform it himself, then with regard to the requirement of <b>waving, which was amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>is it not logical that it was</b> also <b>amplified with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> requiring each partner to perform it himself?
The Gemara rejects this: This inference cannot be correct, <b>because</b> it is obvious that only one of the partners needs to perform the waving. <b>It is not possible</b> to have all of them perform it, <b>as how would it be done?</b> If one says: <b>Let all of</b> the partners <b>wave together,</b> with each one placing his hands under those of another, that is difficult: There <b>would be</b> an invalidating <b>interposition</b> between the offering and hands of the partners who are not directly holding onto the offering. And if one says: <b>Let</b> one partner <b>wave, and then</b> the next one <b>will wave,</b> and so on, that would also be invalid, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that one must perform <b>a waving,</b> using a singular noun, which indicates that one waving, <b>but not</b> multiple <b>wavings,</b> should be performed.
§ The mishna states that placing hands is not performed upon a slaughtered offering. The Gemara questions this: <b>And is there no</b> instance of <b>placing hands</b> performed <b>on slaughtered</b> animals? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 33b): <b>When the High Priest</b> would <b>want to sacrifice</b> the daily offering, as it is his right to be the one to sacrifice it whenever he wishes to, <b>he would ascend the ramp</b> to the top of the altar, <b>and the deputy [<i>segan</i>]</b> High Priest would also ascend <b>to the right</b> of the High Priest. If it occurred that the High Priest <b>reached halfway</b> up <b>the ramp</b> and grew tired, the <b>deputy</b> would <b>hold</b> him <b>by his right hand</b> to assist him <b>and</b> would <b>bring him up</b> to the top of the altar. <b>And the first</b> of the group of priests who had been selected to bring the limbs of the daily offering to the altar would <b>hold out the head and the</b> right hind <b>leg</b> of the offering to the High Priest, <b>who would place</b> his <b>hands upon them, and</b> then <b>he would throw</b> the limbs onto the fire of the altar.
Then <b>the second</b> priest <b>would hold out the two forelegs to the first</b> priest, and the first priest would <b>give them to the High Priest,</b> who would <b>place</b> his <b>hands upon them and</b> then <b>throw them</b> onto the fire. At this stage <b>the second priest</b> would <b>slip away and leave,</b> as he was no longer needed. The first priest remained where he was, as he was still needed to present the other limbs of the offering to the High Priest. <b>And in this manner</b> the other priests who had been selected <b>would hold out the rest of all the limbs</b> to the first priest, who would present them to the High Priest, who would then <b>place</b> his <b>hands upon them and throw them</b> onto the fire.
The mishna concludes: <b>And when</b> the High Priest <b>wants, he</b> may merely <b>place</b> his <b>hands</b> upon the limbs, <b>and</b> then the <b>other</b> priests <b>throw</b> the limbs onto the fire of the altar.
This mishna apparently demonstrates an instance of placing hands performed upon a slaughtered animal. In resolution of this difficulty, <b>Abaye said:</b> In the mishna <b>there,</b> the placing of hands is not in fulfillment of the requirement to do so to an offering; rather, it is done merely <b>due to the eminence of the High Priest,</b> so that his sacrifice of the limbs of an offering is more distinguished than when performed by ordinary priests.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The two loaves</b> that are brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> from the new wheat are each made from a tenth of an ephah of fine flour. They <b>are kneaded one</b> by <b>one and they are baked one</b> by <b>one,</b> i.e., each loaf is placed separately in the oven. <b>The</b> loaves of the <b>shewbread are kneaded one</b> by <b>one and baked two</b> by <b>two,</b> i.e., two loaves are placed in the oven at the same time. <b>And</b> the baker <b>would prepare</b> the shewbread <b>in a mold [<i>defus</i>]</b> when he made the dough. <b>When he removes</b> the shewbread from the oven <b>he</b> again <b>places</b> the loaves <b>in a mold so that their</b> shape <b>will not be ruined.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the two loaves are kneaded one by one and baked one by one. The loaves of the shewbread are also kneaded one by one but are baked two at a time. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes from it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in one cake. And you shall set them in two arrangements, six in an arrangement, upon the pure Table before the Lord” (Leviticus 24:5–6). The phrase <b>“Two-tenths of an ephah shall be in one cake” teaches that</b> the loaves of the shewbread <b>are kneaded one</b> by <b>one.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that this</b> is <b>also</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the two loaves,</b> i.e., that they are kneaded one at a time? <b>The verse states: “Shall be,”</b> to include the two loaves. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that the baking</b> of the loaves of the shewbread is performed <b>two</b> by <b>two? The verse states: “And you shall set them [<i>vesamta otam</i>],”</b> the plural form indicating that two loaves should be baked together. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the two loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i> should <b>also</b> be baked in <b>this</b> manner. <b>The verse states: “Them [otam],”</b> which is a term of exclusion, indicating that only the loaves of the shewbread are baked two at a time, but not the two loaves brought on <i>Shavuot</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t you</b> already <b>derive</b> from <b>this</b> term: <b>“Them,”</b> that the shewbread must be baked two loaves at a time? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the term “them” teaches only that the shewbread is baked two loaves at a time, <b>let the verse say: And you shall set them [<i>vesamtam</i>],</b> using the shortened form. <b>What</b> is the verse teaching by using the longer form <b>“<i>vesamta otam</i>”? You</b> may <b>learn from</b> the verse <b>two</b> matters, both that the loaves of the shewbread should be baked two at a time and that this requirement does not apply to the two loaves brought on <i>Shavuot</i>.
§ The mishna teaches that the shewbread was placed in a mold, and with regard to this <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall set them”</b> (Leviticus 24:6), which means to set them <b>in a mold. There are three molds</b> that are used in the Temple in the preparation of the loaves. First, the baker <b>places</b> the shewbread <b>in a mold</b> while <b>it is still dough. And</b> second, <b>there was a type of mold for</b> the shewbread <b>in the oven,</b> in which the loaves were baked. <b>And when he removes [<i>rodah</i>]</b> the shewbread from the oven, <b>he places it in</b> a third <b>mold so that its</b> shape <b>will not be ruined.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is a third mold necessary? <b>Let him return</b> the shewbread <b>to the first mold,</b> in which the dough was kneaded. The Gemara answers: <b>Once</b> the dough <b>is baked, it rises,</b> and no longer fits into the first mold.
§ <b>It was stated: How is the shewbread prepared,</b> i.e., in what shape?

Daf 94b

<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It was rectangular, with a wide base and two parallel walls with an open space between them, <b>like a box that is open</b> on two sides. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat,</b> i.e., a triangular-shaped boat with a narrow base from which two walls rise at angles. Since the boat does not have a wide base it rocks from side to side.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a box that is open</b> on two sides, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <b>bowls of frankincense could rest</b> upon it. The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat, how would</b> the <b>bowls rest</b> upon it? The Gemara answers: The baker <b>prepared</b> a flat <b>place for</b> the bowls to rest, on the side of the shewbread.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a box that is open</b> on two sides, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <b>rods could rest</b> upon the it. The shewbread was placed on the Table in two arrangements. In each arrangement the lowest loaf was placed on the Table and the remaining loaves were set one above the other, with rods separating the loaves. There were fourteen rods for each arrangement, each loaf being placed upon three rods, except for the uppermost loaf, which was placed on only two rods. The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat, how were</b> the <b>rods resting</b> upon the shewbread? Since the loaves had a narrow base, they would rest on only one rod. The Gemara answers: The baker <b>would make a protrusion in</b> the base of the loaves, which would slightly widen their pointed base, enabling them to rest with stability upon the rods.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a box that is open</b> on two sides, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <b>panels would support the loaves.</b> There were four gold panels that stood at the two sides of the Table and rose up above the height of the Table, and the rods rested on these panels. The loaves were placed lengthwise along the entire width of the Table, and the panels supported the two sides of the loaves, preventing them from falling to the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat, how would</b> the <b>panels support the loaves?</b> Since the sides of the shewbread rose at an angle, the panels would touch only the upper edges of the shewbread. The Gemara answers <b>that</b> the panels <b>would be made to curve</b> inward at an angle corresponding to the angle of the shewbread, so that the panels supported the loaves along their entire length.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat, this is</b> the reason <b>that we require panels.</b> Since the loaves do not have a wide base they cannot stand on their own without the support of the rods and panels. The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a box that is open</b> on two sides, <b>why do I</b> need <b>panels?</b> The loaves could stand without the assistance of rods and panels. The Gemara answers: If there were no panels supporting the loaves from the sides and the loaves were placed on top of each other, <b>due to the weight of</b> the upper <b>loaves</b> the lower loaves <b>would break [<i>telaḥ</i>].</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat,</b> it is evident that the <b>panels are placed on</b> the <b>Table,</b> in order to prevent the slanted loaves from falling to the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a box that is open</b> on two sides, <b>where would</b> the priest <b>place</b> the <b>panels?</b> Since the wide base of the loaves reached the edge of the Table, there was no room for the panels there. <b>Would</b> the priest <b>place them on the ground?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the panels were placed on the ground, <b>as Rabbi Abba bar Memel said: According to the statement of the one who says</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat,</b> the <b>panels are placed on the Table,</b> whereas <b>according to the statement of the one who says</b> the shewbread was <b>like a box that is open</b> on two sides, the <b>panels are placed on</b> the <b>ground.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yehuda said: The loaves support the panels and the panels support the loaves,</b> i.e., they lean against one another? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan. According to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, the panels stood on the ground and did not require the support of the loaves.

Daf 95a

The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was</b> a mold <b>in the oven for</b> the shewbread that was <b>similar to a barrel</b> made of reeds, as it was perforated to enable the bread to bake well, <b>and</b> in its shape <b>it resembled a type of rectangular tablet [<i>tavla</i>].</b> This indicates that the shewbread was rectangular. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>the opening,</b> i.e., the upper section of the mold, <b>resembled a type of rectangular tablet,</b> and that the mold tapered down to a point.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the one who said</b> the shewbread was <b>like a rocking boat, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There were four gold panels there,</b> on the Table, which <b>split up at their upper ends</b> so that <b>they were like forked</b> reed branches. The panels were forked <b>because the bread, which resembled a type of rocking boat, was supported by them.</b>
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: During the era of the Tabernacle, was <b>the shewbread disqualified during the journeys</b> of the Jewish people in the wilderness, <b>or was it not disqualified during the journeys?</b> When the Jewish people would travel from one place to another in the wilderness, the Tabernacle would be dismantled and the Table would be carried with the loaves upon it. The dilemma is about whether or not the loaves were disqualified, since they left the boundaries of the Sanctuary. This matter is the subject of a dispute between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. One says</b> the loaves were thereby <b>disqualified, and one says</b> they were <b>not disqualified.</b>
The Gemara explains their respective reasons: <b>The one who says</b> the shewbread was <b>disqualified</b> derives his opinion from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the journeys: “Then the Tent of Meeting shall journey with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; <b>as they encamp, so shall they journey,</b> every man in his place, by their banners” (Numbers 2:17). The verse juxtaposes the encampments with the journeys, indicating that <b>just as when</b> the Tabernacle is <b>encamped</b> the shewbread is <b>disqualified when</b> it <b>leaves</b> the Tabernacle courtyard, <b>so too, when</b> the Tabernacle <b>journeys</b> the shewbread is <b>disqualified when</b> it <b>leaves</b> the courtyard.
<b>The one who says</b> the shewbread was <b>not disqualified</b> during the journeys derives his opinion from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the journeys: “And upon the Table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue…<b>and the continual bread shall remain upon it”</b> (Numbers 4:7). The verse refers to the shewbread as “the continual bread” even during the journeys, indicating that as long as the loaves are on the Table they retain their sacred status.
The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, who maintains the shewbread was not disqualified during the journeys, <b>isn’t it written: “As they encamp, so shall they journey,”</b> indicating that the shewbread is disqualified when it leaves the Tabernacle during the journeys? The Gemara replies that according to this opinion, the juxtaposition of the encampments with the journeys is interpreted <b>in the other direction: Just as when</b> the Tabernacle is <b>encamped, if</b> the shewbread <b>does not leave its place</b> and remains on the Table it is <b>not disqualified, so too, when</b> the Tabernacle <b>journeys, if it does not leave its place</b> on the Table it is <b>not disqualified.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, who maintains the shewbread was disqualified during the journeys, <b>isn’t it written: “And the continual bread shall remain upon it,”</b> indicating that the shewbread retains its sanctity as long as it is on the Table? <b>Rather, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> that the explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is different. With regard to a case <b>where</b> the shewbread <b>is arranged</b> on the Table, <b>everyone agrees</b> the shewbread is not disqualified during the journey. <b>Rather, when they disagree</b> it is in a case <b>where</b> the shewbread <b>is removed</b> from the Table before the journey.
The Gemara explains their respective reasons: <b>The one who says</b> the shewbread <b>is disqualified</b> derives his opinion from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “Then the Tent of Meeting shall journey with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; <b>as they encamp, so shall they journey,</b> every man in his place, by their banners” (Numbers 2:17). The verse juxtaposes the encampments with the journeys, indicating that <b>just as when</b> the Tabernacle is <b>encamped</b> the shewbread is <b>disqualified when</b> it <b>leaves</b> the Tabernacle courtyard, <b>so too, when</b> the Tabernacle <b>journeys</b> the shewbread is <b>disqualified when</b> it <b>leaves</b> the courtyard.
<b>According to the one who says</b> the shewbread <b>is not disqualified</b> during the journeys, this is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Then the Tent of Meeting shall journey,”</b> indicating that <b>even though it has journeyed it is</b> still considered <b>the Tent of Meeting,</b> and therefore the shewbread is not disqualified.
The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, who maintains the shewbread was not disqualified during the journeys, <b>isn’t it written: “As they encamp, so shall they journey,”</b> indicating that the shewbread is disqualified when it leaves the Tabernacle during the journeys? The Gemara replies that according to this opinion, the juxtaposition of the encampments with the journeys is interpreted <b>in the other direction: Just as when</b> the Tabernacle is <b>encamped, if</b> one <b>does not take</b> the shewbread <b>out</b> of the courtyard <b>it is not disqualified, so too, when</b> the Tabernacle <b>journeys, if</b> one <b>does not take</b> the shewbread <b>out</b> of the courtyard <b>it is not disqualified.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, who maintains the shewbread was disqualified during the journeys, <b>isn’t it written: “Then the Tent of Meeting shall journey,”</b> indicating that the Tent of Meeting retains its sanctity during the journeys and therefore the shewbread should not be disqualified? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is not referring to the sanctity of the Tent of Meeting during the journeys. Rather, <b>it comes to</b> teach the position of the Tent of Meeting between the <b>banners</b> of the different tribes during the journeys.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, from where does he derive the position of the Tent of Meeting during the journeys? The Gemara replies: He <b>derives</b> this <b>from</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“With the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps”</b> (Numbers 2:17).
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the opinion that the shewbread was not disqualified during the journeys: <b>At the time of the dismantling</b> of the Tabernacle in order to commence the <b>journeys,</b> when the curtains surrounding the Tabernacle courtyard are removed, the <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>is disqualified</b> from being consumed, <b>as</b> it is considered to have <b>left</b> the Tabernacle courtyard. <b>And <i>zavim</i> and lepers are sent out of the partitions of their</b> camps; the <i>zavim</i> are sent out of the Levite camp, while lepers are sent out of the Israelite camp. <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>even</b> to <b>the shewbread,</b> indicating that it is disqualified during the journeys? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that most sacrificial food is disqualified, <b>except for the shewbread.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, this explanation is difficult. <b>If</b> the phrase: “Then the <b>Tent of Meeting</b> shall journey,” <b>is</b> meant <b>exactly,</b> i.e., literally, and it still has the status of the Tent of Meeting even during the journeys, then <b>even</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> food should not be disqualified during the journeys. <b>If</b> “then the <b>Tent of Meeting</b> shall journey,” <b>is not</b> meant <b>exactly,</b> and it does not have the status of the Tent of Meeting during the journeys, then <b>even the shewbread</b> should be disqualified.
<b>Rather, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> that there is actually no dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. This <b>Master,</b> who stated that the shewbread is not disqualified during the journeys, <b>stated</b> his ruling <b>with regard to</b> loaves <b>that are arranged</b> on the Table; <b>and</b> that <b>Master,</b> who stated that the shewbread is disqualified during the journeys, <b>stated</b> his ruling <b>with regard to</b> loaves <b>that were removed</b> from the Table. <b>And</b> the two <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree,</b> as each was referring to a different case.
§ The aforementioned <i>baraita</i> states that when the Tabernacle was dismantled the sacrificial food was disqualified, as it was considered to have left the Tabernacle courtyard. <b>Abaye said:</b> One may <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>there</b> could <b>be</b> a case where the <b>dismantling</b> of the Tabernacle in order to commence the <b>journeys</b> would take place <b>at night.</b> This is a necessary conclusion, <b>as if it</b> should <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>there</b> could <b>not be</b> a case where the <b>dismantling</b> of the Tabernacle in order to commence the <b>journeys</b> would take place <b>at night, when would</b> the curtains surrounding the Tabernacle <b>be removed?</b> If they were removed right away <b>in the morning, why</b> was the sacrificial food disqualified <b>specifically due to</b> the fact that it <b>left</b> the Tabernacle courtyard? <b>I may derive that it was disqualified</b> because of the fact that it was <b>left overnight.</b>
The Gemara challenges: It is <b>obvious</b> that the Tabernacle could be dismantled at night, as it <b>is written:</b> “And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; <b>that they might go by day and by night”</b> (Exodus 13:21). The Gemara answers that Abaye’s observation is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that they would travel at night, applies only in a case <b>where</b> the Jewish people <b>dismantled</b> their camp and began to journey <b>by day,</b> in which case they would continue to travel at night. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where they did not dismantle</b> their camp <b>by day they could not dismantle</b> the camp and leave <b>at night.</b> Abaye therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they could set out even at night.
§ The aforementioned <i>baraita</i> teaches that even when the Tabernacle was dismantled, <i>zavim</i> and lepers were sent outside the camp, as the sanctity of both the Levite camp and the Israelite camp remained intact even while the Tabernacle was dismantled. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: Once <b>the curtain</b> surrounding the Tabernacle courtyard <b>was rolled up, the <i>zavim</i> and</b> the <b>lepers were permitted to enter into that</b> area where the Tabernacle had stood. This indicates that the camps did not retain their sacred status once the Tabernacle was dismantled. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is <b>not difficult; this</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 95b

<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that if <b><i>zavim</i> and lepers pushed</b> their way in <b>and entered the Temple courtyard during</b> the sacrifice of <b>a Paschal offering that is brought in</b> a state of <b>impurity,</b> i.e., when the majority of the nation are ritually impure due to contact with a corpse, that perhaps the <i>zavim</i> and lepers are liable. In other words, one <b>might</b> have thought that since it is prohibited for <i>zavim</i> and lepers to enter even under such circumstances, <b>they would be liable</b> to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That they send out from the camp any leper and any <i>zav</i> and anyone impure by reason of a corpse”</b> (Numbers 5:2). The verse indicates that <b>at a time when those who are impure</b> with impurity imparted <b>by a corpse are sent out</b> of the Temple, <b><i>zavim</i> and lepers are</b> also <b>sent out</b> of the Temple and are liable to receive <i>karet</i> if they enter it.
But when <b>those who are impure</b> with impurity imparted <b>by a corpse are not sent out</b> of the Temple, <b><i>zavim</i> and lepers are</b> also <b>not sent out,</b> i.e., they are not liable to receive <i>karet</i> if they enter the Temple. The <i>baraita</i> that teaches that once the curtain surrounding the Tabernacle courtyard was rolled up it was permitted for <i>zavim</i> and lepers to enter the place where it had stood, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The reason is that once the curtain was rolled up it was permitted for those who were impure with impurity imparted by a corpse to enter; it was prohibited for them to enter only the Temple courtyard, and this had been dismantled. According to Rabbi Eliezer, it was permitted even for <i>zavim</i> and lepers to then enter the camp. The <i>baraita</i> that rules that even when the Tabernacle was dismantled <i>zavim</i> and lepers were sent outside the camp, is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>both the two loaves and the shewbread, the kneading of their</b> dough <b>and the forming of their</b> loaves take place <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>but their baking</b> takes place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard. <b>And their</b> preparation <b>does not override Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says: All of the procedures</b> involved in <b>their</b> preparation take place <b>inside</b> the courtyard. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One <b>should always be accustomed to say</b> that <b>the two loaves and the shewbread are fit</b> if they were prepared <b>in the Temple courtyard and they are</b> also <b>fit</b> if they were prepared <b>in Beit Pagei,</b> outside the Temple Mount, as he maintains that they may be baked outside the Temple courtyard.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that according to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> the two loaves and the shewbread are kneaded and shaped outside the Temple courtyard, but they are baked inside the courtyard. The Gemara comments: <b>This itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>You said</b> initially that <b>the kneading of their</b> dough <b>and the forming of their</b> loaves take place <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard. One can infer from this that <b>apparently,</b> the <b>dry measure,</b> i.e., the vessel used in the Temple for measuring dry substances, e.g., flour, <b>was not consecrated.</b> If the dry measure sanctified the items placed in them, the flour brought for the two loaves and the shewbread would already be sanctified, and these loaves could not be kneaded and shaped outside the courtyard. And the mishna subsequently states that <b>their baking</b> takes place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard. One can infer from this that <b>apparently,</b> the <b>dry measure was consecrated.</b> If the flour had not been sanctified by being placed in the measuring vessel, why must the loaves be baked inside the Temple courtyard? <b>Rabba says: A formidable man, who is</b> as <b>tough as iron, raised</b> this <b>difficulty. And who is</b> that Sage? This is referring to <b>Rav Sheshet.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>difficulty? Perhaps</b> the measure of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, which is used to measure the flour for the two loaves and the shewbread, <b>does not sanctify</b> that which is placed inside it, but the <b>oven sanctifies</b> the loaves that are baked in it, and therefore they must be baked inside the Temple courtyard.
<b>Rather, if</b> the mishna <b>is difficult, this is difficult:</b> The mishna states that <b>the baking</b> of the two loaves and the shewbread takes place <b>inside</b> the courtyard. <b>Evidently,</b> the <b>oven sanctifies</b> that which is baked inside it. And the mishna subsequently states that kneading, shaping, and baking the loaves <b>does not override Shabbat.</b> If these procedures were performed before Shabbat in a vessel that sanctifies them, the loaves would be <b>disqualified by</b> virtue of the fact that they were <b>left overnight</b> without having been placed on the Table. <b>Rather, Rava says: A formidable man, who is</b> as <b>tough as iron, raised</b> this <b>difficulty. And who is</b> that Sage? This is referring to <b>Rav Sheshet.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: What</b> is the <b>difficulty? Perhaps</b> the oven does not sanctify the loaves that are baked in it, and therefore the two loaves and the shewbread are not disqualified by being left overnight. And accordingly, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the statement: Their baking takes place <b>inside?</b> This is not referring to inside the Temple courtyard. Rather, it means they are baked <b>in a place</b> where there are priests who are <b>vigilant</b> in their efforts, who will supervise the loaves as they are baked and ensure they do not become leavened.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement attributed <b>to Rav Ashi is an error [<i>baruta</i>],</b> as <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, it is difficult: <b>If we require vigilant</b> priests for the <b>baking</b> of the two loaves and the shewbread, <b>we</b> should <b>also require vigilant</b> priests for the <b>kneading and forming</b> of the loaves. <b>And if we do not require vigilant</b> priests for the <b>kneading and forming</b> of the loaves, <b>we</b> should <b>also not require vigilant</b> priests for the <b>baking.</b> Rav Ashi’s explanation does not explain why the mishna differentiates between the kneading and forming of the loaves on the one hand, and their baking on the other hand. <b>Rather,</b> the statement attributed <b>to Rav Ashi is an error.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: All the procedures</b> involved in the preparation of the two loaves and the shewbread take place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, whereas Rabbi Shimon maintains that even their baking may take place outside the courtyard. <b>Rabbi Abbahu bar Kahana says: Both</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon derived their opinions from <b>the same verse,</b> which <b>they interpreted homiletically.</b> When David fled from King Saul he came to Nov, where he requested bread from Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech replied: “There is no non-sacred bread under my hand, but there is sacred bread” (I Samuel 21:5), i.e., the shewbread. David then said to Ahimelech: <b>“But it is a non-sacred manner, and yet it shall be consecrated today in the vessel”</b> (I Samuel 21:6).
Both Sages understand David’s response to be a halakhic critique: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that David <b>found</b> the priests <b>baking</b> the shewbread <b>on a weekday.</b> David <b>said to them:</b> Why <b>are you baking</b> the shewbread in <b>a non-sacred manner,</b> i.e., on a weekday, rather than on Shabbat? <b>“Yet it shall be consecrated today in the vessel,”</b> i.e., it will be consecrated today when it is baked in the oven, and <b>it will be disqualified</b> tomorrow <b>because</b> it will have been <b>left overnight.</b> Rabbi Yehuda infers from David’s criticism that the shewbread must be baked on Shabbat in the Temple courtyard, as it is consecrated in the oven.
<b>Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that David <b>found</b> the priests <b>baking</b> the shewbread <b>on Shabbat.</b> David <b>said to them: Aren’t you required to prepare it</b> in <b>a non-sacred manner,</b> i.e., on a weekday? <b>Does the oven consecrate</b> the shewbread? No, <b>it is</b> the <b>Table that consecrates</b> it when the shewbread is placed there. The loaves are therefore not disqualified by being left overnight.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how can you say that</b> David <b>found</b> the priests <b>at the time of baking? But isn’t it</b> subsequently <b>written: “And the priest gave him sacred bread, for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 21:7)? This indicates that David received shewbread that had already been on the Table, not loaves that had just been baked.
<b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the statement: “But it is <b>a non-sacred manner,</b> and yet it shall be consecrated today in the vessel,” <b>which</b> David <b>said to</b> the priests? The Gemara replies: <b>This is</b> what the priests <b>said to him:</b> There is <b>no bread</b> here <b>except “the shewbread that was taken from before the Lord,”</b> and the shewbread is prohibited for consumption by non-priests.
David <b>said to</b> the priests: <b>It is not necessary</b> to say that it is permitted for me to eat <b>this</b> shewbread, which has already been removed from the Table. This is <b>because</b> the frankincense placed in the bowls that were on the Table has been burned. <b>Since</b> the shewbread <b>has been removed from</b> having the status of items to which the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property apply, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a non-sacred matter,</b> i.e., permitted to priests for consumption. <b>But even the other</b> shewbread, <b>which “shall be consecrated today in the vessel,”</b> i.e., the shewbread placed on the Table today, <b>you should give him,</b> i.e., you should give me, <b>to eat.</b>

Daf 96a

This is because <b>he is,</b> i.e., I am, <b>dangerously</b> ill, being utterly famished, and a non-priest may eat sacrificial food in a life-threatening situation. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> their dispute does not stem from the interpretation of the verses. Rather, <b>they disagree with regard to a tradition,</b> as they had divergent traditions as to whether or not the oven consecrates the shewbread.
The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One <b>should always be accustomed to say</b> that <b>the two loaves and the shewbread are fit</b> if they were prepared <b>in the Temple courtyard and they are</b> also <b>fit</b> if they were prepared <b>in Beit Pagei.</b> The term: One should always be accustomed to say, indicates that Rabbi Shimon’s opinion is based on an oral tradition and not on the interpretation of a verse. The Gemara concludes: One may <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that this is the case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the twelve loaves of the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, of which six are offered in the morning and six in the evening, <b>their kneading, the forming of their</b> loaves, <b>and their baking</b> take place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> all types of labor involved in those actions <b>override Shabbat.</b> These labors cannot be performed prior to Shabbat, as once the loaves are consecrated in a service vessel they are disqualified if they are left overnight. <b>Grinding their</b> flour <b>and sifting their</b> flour <b>do not override Shabbat. Rabbi Akiva stated a principle: Any labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat, but</b> one <b>that cannot be performed on Shabbat eve overrides Shabbat.</b>
<b>All</b> preparatory procedures of <b>the meal offerings</b> that take place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, e.g., kneading and forming the High Priest’s griddle cakes, <b>involve</b> the <b>use</b> of a service <b>vessel</b> that consecrates the offerings. <b>But</b> any preparatory procedures that take place <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, e.g., kneading and forming the two loaves and the shewbread, <b>do not involve</b> the <b>use</b> of a service <b>vessel.</b>
With regard to <b>the two loaves, their length is seven handbreadths, their width is four handbreadths, and</b> they have hornlike <b>protrusions</b> made of dough that is attached to each of their corners, which are <b>four fingerbreadths</b> high. With regard to the loaves of <b>shewbread, their length is ten handbreadths, their width is five handbreadths, and</b> each loaf’s hornlike <b>protrusions</b> is <b>seven fingerbreadths</b> high.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The following letters are a mnemonic so <b>that you will not err</b> and forget the dimensions of the two loaves: <b><i>Zayin</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>dalet</i>.</b> The numerical value of the letter <i>zayin</i> is seven and the numerical value of the letter <i>dalet</i> is four. The mnemonic therefore represents the length of seven handbreadths, the width of four handbreadths, and the height of four fingerbreadths, respectively. The following letters are a mnemonic for the dimensions of the shewbread: <b><i>Yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>zayin</i>,</b> which stand for the length of ten handbreadths, the width of five handbreadths, and the height of seven fingerbreadths, respectively. <b>Ben Zoma says</b> that it is written: <b>“And you shall set upon the Table shewbread [<i>leḥem panim</i>] before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30). The term <b><i>leḥem panim</i></b> indicates <b>that it should have</b> vertical <b>sides [<i>panim</i>]</b> rather than a rounded shape.
As for <b>the Table, its length is ten</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is five</b> handbreadths, as the Torah states that the Table is two cubits long and one cubit wide (see Exodus 25:23), and Rabbi Yehuda holds that the cubit used as the unit of measurement for the construction of the Temple vessels was equal to five handbreadths. With regard to <b>the shewbread, its length is ten</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is five</b> handbreadths.
The priest <b>places the length</b> of the two shewbread arrangements <b>across the width of</b> the <b>Table,</b> which leaves five handbreadths of each loaf protruding from the Table. <b>And he folds</b> the protruding <b>two and a half handbreadths</b> upward <b>on this</b> side of the Table, <b>and</b> the protruding <b>two and a half handbreadths</b> upward <b>on that</b> side of the Table. One <b>finds,</b> therefore, that <b>the length</b> of the shewbread <b>covers the width of the Table.</b> Similarly, since the width of each loaf is five handbreadths, the width of the two loaves filled the entire length of the Table. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>the Table, its length is twelve</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is six</b> handbreadths, as the measure of a cubit used in the construction of the Temple vessels was equal to six handbreadths. Concerning <b>the shewbread, its length is ten</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is five</b> handbreadths.
Rabbi Meir continues: The priest <b>places the length</b> of the shewbread <b>across the width of</b> the <b>Table,</b> which leaves four handbreadths of each loaf protruding from the Table. <b>He folds</b> the protruding <b>two handbreadths</b> upward <b>on this</b> side of the Table, <b>and</b> the protruding <b>two handbreadths</b> upward <b>on that</b> side of the Table. The width of the two arrangements of shewbread occupies only ten of the twelve handbreadths of the length of the Table, <b>and</b> this leaves <b>a space of two handbreadths in the middle,</b> between the two arrangements, <b>so that the wind will blow between them</b> and prevent the loaves from becoming moldy.
<b>Abba Shaul says: There,</b> in the space between the two arrangements, the priests <b>would place</b> the <b>two bowls of frankincense that</b> accompany <b>the shewbread.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “And you shall place pure frankincense upon [<i>al</i>] each arrangement,</b> that it may be for the bread as a memorial part, an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 24:7)? The verse indicates that the frankincense is placed upon the shewbread and not next to it. Abba Shaul <b>said to</b> the Sages in response: <b>Isn’t it already stated: “And next to him [<i>alav</i>] shall be the tribe of Manasseh”</b> (Numbers 2:20)? Just as the preposition “<i>alav</i>” in this verse means that the tribe of Manasseh pitched camp next to the tribe of Ephraim and not upon it, so too, the preposition “<i>al</i>” means that the frankincense was placed next to the arrangements of the shewbread.
The mishna continues to describe the shewbread Table: <b>And there were four panels of gold there,</b> which stood on the ground and rose above the height of the Table, and <b>they split up at their upper ends,</b> above the Table, so <b>that</b> the rods upon which the shewbread was placed could rest upon the panels. In this manner the panels <b>would support</b> the shewbread. There were <b>two</b> panels <b>for this arrangement and two</b> panels <b>for that arrangement, and</b> there were <b>twenty-eight rods,</b> each of which was shaped <b>like half of a hollow reed.</b> There were <b>fourteen</b> rods <b>for this arrangement and fourteen</b> rods <b>for that arrangement.</b>
<b>Neither</b> the <b>arranging of</b> the <b>rods</b> for the new shewbread, <b>nor their removal</b> from the arrangement of the old shewbread, <b>overrides Shabbat. Rather,</b> a priest <b>enters</b> the Sanctuary <b>on Shabbat eve,</b> i.e., Friday before sundown, <b>and removes</b> each of the rods from between the loaves. <b>And</b> according to Rabbi Meir he then <b>places</b> each rod in the space between the two arrangements, <b>along the length of the Table.</b> Then, on Shabbat, he places the new shewbread on the Table without the rods, and he inserts the rods between the loaves at the conclusion of Shabbat.
The mishna concludes: <b>All the vessels that were in the Temple,</b> including the Table, were placed so that <b>their length was</b> from east to west, <b>along the length of</b> the <b>Temple.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>all</b> preparatory procedures of <b>the meal offerings</b> that take place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>involve</b> the <b>use</b> of a service <b>vessel</b> that consecrates the offerings. The Sages <b>asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>From where</b> is <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> derived? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them: Doesn’t</b> the verse <b>state: “And he said to me: This is the place where the priests shall cook the guilt offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meal offering; that they do not bring them out to the outer courtyard,</b> to sanctify the people” (Ezekiel 46:20)? Cooking the meat of the guilt offering and the sin offering requires the use of a vessel, and the verse indicates that this must be performed inside the Temple courtyard, as the meat may not be brought to the outer courtyard.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi explains: The verse compares the meal offering to the guilt offering and the sin offering, indicating that the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>meal offering is similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>guilt offering and the sin offering. Just as</b> the <b>guilt offering and</b> the <b>sin offering require</b> the use of a service <b>vessel</b> in order to cook the sacrificial meat, and this is performed inside the Temple courtyard, <b>so too,</b> the <b>meal offering also requires</b> a service <b>vessel</b> for its preparation, which is performed inside the Temple courtyard.
§ The mishna cites the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: As for <b>the Table, its length is ten</b> handbreadths and its width is five handbreadths. Five handbreadths of each loaf of the shewbread, each of which is bent upward, protrude from the Table; two and a half handbreadths on each side. Rabbi Meir holds that the width of the Table is six handbreadths. Therefore, only four handbreadths of each loaf protrude from the Table and two handbreadths are bent upward on each side.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: According to the statement of the one who says</b> that <b>one folds</b> up <b>two and a half handbreadths</b> from each side of the loaves, <b>it emerges</b> that the <b>Table consecrates fifteen handbreadths above</b> it, as there were six loaves on each side of the Table, which were each two and a half handbreadths high. And <b>according to the statement of the one who says</b> that <b>one folds</b> up <b>two handbreadths</b> from each side of the loaves, <b>it emerges</b> that the <b>Table consecrates twelve handbreadths above</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there rods</b> between the loaves? The total height of the arrangements should therefore be more than fifteen handbreadths according to Rabbi Yehuda, and more than twelve handbreadths according to Rabbi Meir. The Gemara answers that the rods did not add to the height of the arrangement, as the loaves were shaped with indentations so that <b>the rods were embedded</b> in them.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the rods are required? They are required <b>because</b> the <b>bread</b> is apt to <b>become moldy.</b> The rods prevent this by enabling the air to circulate between the loaves. But if the rods are sunk into the loaves, <b>ultimately</b> the <b>bread will become moldy.</b> The Gemara answers <b>that</b> the priest <b>would raise</b> the rods <b>slightly</b> above the loaves. The rods were not completely embedded in the loaves, and there was a small gap between the loaves that enabled the air to circulate.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>isn’t there that slight</b> gap between each of the six loaves, causing the total height of each arrangement to be more than fifteen or twelve handbreadths? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the gaps <b>did not</b> amount to a single <b>handbreadth,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>did not count them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b> also the <b>bowls</b> of frankincense that are placed above the arrangements, adding to the total height of the items consecrated by the Table? The Gemara answers: The bowls of frankincense <b>would rest inside</b> the middle <b>of the bread and</b> consequently <b>their</b> height <b>corresponded with that of the bread.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b> the hornlike <b>protrusions</b> of the shewbread, which are seven fingerbreadths in height? These protrusions should be added to the total height of the arrangements. The Gemara answers: With regard to the <b>protrusions,</b> the priest <b>would fold them into</b> the <b>bread, and</b> the loaf of <b>bread</b> above <b>rested upon them.</b> The protrusions therefore did not increase the height of the arrangements.

Daf 96b

The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the Table’s decorated <b>frame,</b> which ran around its perimeter and was one handbreadth wide, as the verse states: “And you shall make for it a frame of a handbreadth” (Exodus 25:25)? Since the arrangements are placed on the Table’s frame, they rise one additional handbreadth above the Table.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is <b>in accordance with the</b> opinion of the <b>one who said</b> the Table’s <b>frame was</b> not above the Table’s surface but <b>below</b> it, and therefore it did not add any height to the arrangements on the Table. <b>And</b> furthermore, even <b>according to the one who said</b> the Table’s <b>frame was above</b> the Table’s surface, it did not add to the height of the arrangements. This is because the frame <b>was tilted</b> outward, <b>but</b> the <b>bread was set within</b> the area <b>of</b> the <b>Table’s</b> surface.
The Gemara cites the dispute with regard to the location of the frame: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: There were no panels there</b> at all, as they were not required in order to support the loaves. <b>Rather, the Table’s frame supported the bread,</b> as the frame was above the Table’s surface. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: The Table’s <b>frame was below</b> the Table’s surface, and therefore the panels were required to support the loaves.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: According to the statement of the one who says</b> that the Table’s <b>frame was below</b> the Table’s surface, the surface was merely a flat board. It is a halakhic principle with regard to wooden utensils that only rounded utensils are susceptible to ritual impurity, but not flat utensils. It is known that the shewbread Table was susceptible to impurity. One may therefore infer from this that a flat <b>board is susceptible to impurity,</b> provided <b>that</b> it <b>can be turned over</b> and used on both sides. This is because the wide surface of the board renders it functionally similar to a concave receptacle.
Rabbi Yoḥanan continues: <b>According to the statement of the one who says</b> that the Table’s <b>frame was above</b> the Table’s surface, the Table served as a receptacle. One therefore cannot infer the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a flat <b>board that can be turned over</b> from the case of the Table, and <b>you must</b> still <b>raise the dilemma</b> as to whether it is susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: One can conclude <b>by inference</b> from Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement <b>that</b> the <b>Table is susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> But <b>it is a wooden vessel designated to rest</b> in a fixed place, <b>and any wooden vessel</b> that is <b>designated to rest</b> in a fixed place <b>is not susceptible to impurity.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The verse states with regard to items that are rendered impure by the carcasses of creeping animals: “And anything upon which any of them fall when they are dead shall be impure, whether it is any vessel of wood, or cloth, or leather, or sack” (Leviticus 11:32). The verse juxtaposes wooden vessels with sacks, indicating that <b>we require</b> a wooden vessel to be <b>similar to a sack</b> in order to be susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>Just as a sack is carried</b> both when it is <b>full and</b> when it is <b>empty, so too, any</b> wooden vessel that is <b>carried</b> both <b>full and empty</b> is susceptible to impurity. Since the Table is designated to rest in a fixed place and not to be carried, it should not be susceptible to impurity.
The Gemara answers: The <b>Table is also carried</b> both <b>full and empty,</b> i.e., even when the shewbread is upon it, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish.</b> This is <b>as Reish Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And you shall set them in two arrangements, six in an arrangement, <b>upon the pure Table</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 24:6)? The term “the <b>pure</b> Table” teaches <b>by inference that there is</b> a case where the Table becomes <b>impure,</b> and therefore the Torah states that the Table must be pure when the shewbread is set upon it. This conclusion is difficult, as the principle that a wooden vessel designated to rest in a fixed place is not susceptible to impurity indicates that the Table should not be susceptible to impurity.
<b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>teaches that</b> the priests would <b>lift</b> the Table with its shewbread <b>to display the shewbread to the pilgrims</b> standing in the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> a priest would <b>say to them: See</b> how <b>beloved you</b> are <b>before,</b> i.e., in the eyes of, <b>the Omnipresent,</b> Who constantly performs a miracle with regard to the shewbread. For this reason, the Table is susceptible to ritual impurity.
This is <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A great miracle was performed with the shewbread:</b> Its condition at the time of <b>its removal</b> from the Table, after having been left there for a week, was <b>like</b> its condition at the time of <b>its arrangement</b> on the Table; <b>as it is stated: “To place hot bread on the day when it was taken away”</b> (I Samuel 21:7), indicating that it was as hot on the day of its removal as it was on the day when it was placed on the Table.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is it necessary to derive that the Table is susceptible to impurity due to the fact that it is not designated to rest in a fixed place? <b>I may derive</b> that it is susceptible to impurity <b>due to</b> its gold <b>covering. Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 22:1): Consider the case of <b>the table and the <i>dulbeki</i>,</b> a small table upon which the food and drink are placed before being served at the dining table, <b>that were</b> partially <b>broken, or that one covered with marble</b> stone, which is not susceptible to impurity. If <b>an area of their</b> surface large enough for <b>placing cups</b> there <b>was left</b> unbroken or uncovered with marble they remain <b>susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The remaining surface <b>area</b> must be large enough for <b>placing pieces</b> of meat and bread as well.
One can infer from the mishna that if one <b>left</b> part of the surface area of the table without covering it with marble, <b>yes,</b> it remains susceptible to impurity. But if <b>he did not leave</b> part of the table without covering it with marble it is <b>not</b> susceptible to impurity. Evidently, the status of a vessel is determined according to the material of its external covering and not according to its main material. Consequently, since the shewbread Table was covered with gold it should have the status of a metal vessel, which is susceptible to ritual impurity even if it is designated to rest in a fixed place.
<b>And if you would say</b> the case of the shewbread Table is different, as <b>here,</b> with regard to the marble-covered table, the mishna is referring <b>to a permanent covering</b> that is fixed to the table with nails, whereas <b>there,</b> in the case of the shewbread Table, the discussion is referring <b>to a covering that is not permanent,</b> as the gold was not attached to the shewbread Table with nails, this explanation is difficult. <b>But didn’t Reish Lakish raise a dilemma to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Is the mishna that discusses the marble-covered table referring only <b>to a permanent covering, or</b> even <b>to a covering that is not permanent?</b> Is it referring only to a case <b>where</b> one <b>covered</b>

Daf 97a

the Table’s <b>rim [<i>levazbazin</i>]</b> as well as the Table itself, <b>or</b> even to a case <b>where</b> one <b>did not cover</b> its <b>rim? And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: The case of <b>a permanent covering is not different, and</b> the case of <b>a covering that is not permanent is not different.</b> Likewise, the case where one <b>covered</b> the <b>rim is not different, and</b> the case where one <b>did not cover</b> the <b>rim is not different.</b> In any case a vessel’s status is determined according to the material of the external covering, and the shewbread Table should be susceptible to impurity because its external covering was of gold. It is therefore not necessary to derive that the Table is susceptible to impurity due to the fact that it is not designated to rest in a fixed place.
The Gemara suggests another explanation: <b>And if you would say</b> that the <b>acacia wood</b> from which the shewbread Table is fashioned is different, as it is <b>an important,</b> valuable type of wood <b>and</b> therefore the Table’s status as a wooden vessel <b>is not negated</b> by the fact that it was covered with gold, there would still be a difficulty. <b>This</b> explanation <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, who said:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the status of a wooden vessel is determined according to the material of its covering <b>only with regard to vessels</b> made <b>of</b> medium-grade <b><i>akhsalgos</i></b> wood, <b>which come from overseas, but vessels</b> made <b>of</b> expensive <b><i>masmas</i></b> wood <b>are important, and</b> therefore their status as wooden vessels <b>is not negated</b> by the covering. According to this opinion the ruling works out <b>well,</b> as the acacia wood of the shewbread Table is also valuable. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> the importance of <b><i>masmas</i> vessels is also negated</b> by the covering, <b>what is there to say?</b>
The Gemara answers: The <b>Table is different, because the Merciful One called it wood, as it is stated: “The altar was of wood, three cubits high,</b> and <b>its length two cubits, and so its corners; and its length, and its walls were also of wood, and he said to me: This is the Table that is before the Lord”</b> (Ezekiel 41:22). This verse is referring to the shewbread Table, and it describes it as being made of wood, even though the wood was not visible. This indicates that its status is like that of all wooden vessels, which are not susceptible to impurity unless they are carried both when empty and when full.
The Gemara challenges: Why does the verse <b>begin with the</b> word <b>“altar” and conclude with the</b> word <b>“Table,”</b> even though both terms are referring to the same item? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say</b> the following interpretation: <b>When the Temple is standing,</b> the <b>altar effects atonement for</b> the transgressions of <b>a person, but now that the Temple is not standing, a person’s table effects atonement for his</b> transgressions, if he provides for the poor and needy from the food on his table.
§ The mishna describes the shewbread Table (96a): <b>There were four panels of gold there,</b> which split up at their upper ends, above the Table, and there were twenty-eight rods that rested upon the panels. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ketina said: The verse states</b> with regard to the Table: <b>“And you shall make its dishes and its pans, <i>uksotav umnakkiyyotav</i>,</b> with which it shall be covered; of pure gold you shall make them” (Exodus 25:29).
Rav Ketina interprets the verse: <b>“Its dishes,” these are</b> the <b>molds</b> in which the loaves are kneaded, baked, and placed after baking (see 94a). <b>“Its pans,” these are</b> the <b>bowls</b> for the frankincense that is placed on the Table with the shewbread. <b>“<i>Kesotav</i>,” these are</b> the four <b>panels</b> of gold. <b>“<i>Umnakkiyyotav</i>,” these are</b> the <b>rods,</b> which rest on the notches in the panels and bear the loaves, one on top of the other. <b>“With which it shall be covered,”</b> this indicates <b>that the bread is covered by</b> the rods.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to this interpretation, which indicates that the rods are required by Torah law: The mishna states: <b>Neither the arranging of the rods</b> for the new shewbread, <b>nor their removal</b> from the arrangement of the old shewbread, <b>overrides Shabbat. And if it enters your mind</b> to say the rods are required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>why does</b> their arrangement <b>not override Shabbat?</b>
<b>Rava then said: That which I said,</b> that one can infer from the mishna that the rods are not required by Torah law, <b>is not correct, as we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva stated a principle: Any labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat. And these</b> actions, arranging and removing the rods, <b>can also</b> be performed in a manner <b>that does not</b> require <b>overriding Shabbat for them,</b> as the rods can be removed before Shabbat, and the rods can be arranged for the new loaves once Shabbat has ended.
Rava explains why the rods can be arranged after Shabbat: <b>What is the reason</b> that the rods are required? They are necessary in order to create a gap between the loaves, so that the <b>bread does not become moldy. In</b> such a short time <b>period as this,</b> from when the new loaves are placed on the Table on Shabbat until the arrangement of the rods after Shabbat, the loaves will <b>not become moldy.</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the removal and arrangement of the rods: <b>How</b> does the priest proceed? <b>He enters</b> the Sanctuary <b>on Shabbat eve and removes</b> the rods from between the loaves. <b>And he places them</b> in the space of two handbreadths between the two arrangements, <b>along the length of</b> the <b>Table. And</b> at <b>the conclusion of Shabbat he enters</b> the Sanctuary again. <b>He raises the ends of a loaf</b> of the shewbread <b>and inserts a rod underneath it, and again raises the ends of a loaf and inserts a rod underneath it.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues to describe the placement of the rods: Each arrangement contains six loaves. The <b>four loaves</b> in the middle of the six <b>require three</b> for the first of the four middle loaves, and likewise <b>three rods</b> for each of the other middle loaves, totaling twelve rods. <b>The upper</b> loaf <b>requires only two</b> rods, <b>as</b> the <b>weight</b> of another loaf <b>does not</b> bear <b>upon it.</b> Each arrangement therefore requires a total of fourteen rods, and the two arrangements require twenty-eight rods. As for <b>the lowest</b> loaf of each arrangement, <b>it does not require</b> rods <b>at all, as it rests on the Table itself.</b>
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 17:10) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: All</b> the <b>cubits that were</b> mentioned <b>with regard to the Temple</b> were <b>medium</b> cubits, consisting of six handbreadths, <b>except</b> in the case <b>of</b> the following items: <b>The golden altar,</b> which was one cubit long and one cubit wide; each protruding <b>corner</b> of the external altar, which were one cubit long, one cubit wide, and one cubit high; <b>the surrounding ledge</b> of the external altar, which was five cubits high and one cubit wide; <b>and the base</b> of the altar, which was one cubit high and one cubit wide. In all these cases, the cubit was of five handbreadths. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The measure of <b>a cubit</b> that was used with regard to the <b>building</b> of the Temple was a cubit of <b>six handbreadths, but</b> the cubit mentioned <b>with regard to</b> the Temple <b>vessels,</b> e.g., the Table, the Candelabrum and the golden altar, was a smaller cubit of <b>five</b> handbreadths.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And both</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda <b>derived</b> their opinions from <b>the same verse: “And these are the measures of the altar by cubits: The cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth,</b>

Daf 97b

<b>and the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and its border by its edge round about shall be the one span. And this shall be the higher part of the altar”</b> (Ezekiel 43:13). The first section of this verse is referring to the outer altar: <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit,” this is</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar. “And <b>the breadth a cubit,” this is</b> the <b>surrounding ledge</b> of the altar. <b>“And its border by its edge round about shall be the one span,” these are</b> the protruding <b>corners</b> of the altar, which were one cubit wide and one cubit high. “And <b>this shall be the higher part of the altar,” this is</b> referring to <b>the golden altar,</b> which stood inside the Sanctuary and was also measured with small cubits.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree with regard to the inference from the phrase “And this shall be the higher part of the altar.” <b>Rabbi Meir maintains</b> that one can infer that it <b>is this,</b> the golden altar, which is measured <b>with a cubit of five</b> handbreadths, <b>but all</b> the <b>cubits</b> of the other <b>vessels</b> in the Temple are measured <b>with a cubit of six</b> handbreadths. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that one can infer that <b>like this</b> small cubit <b>shall be all</b> the <b>cubits</b> of the other <b>vessels</b> in the Temple.
The Gemara discusses the interpretation of the verse: It might <b>enter your mind</b> to say that the verse is referring to the height of the sections of the altar, i.e., <b>from the base</b> of the altar <b>until</b> the <b>surrounding ledge</b> the <b>height</b> is measured <b>with a cubit of five</b> handbreadths. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit”? This</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: From</b> the <b>cubit</b> at the <b>bottom,</b> i.e., the base of the altar, <b>until</b> the <b>cubit</b> of the <b>breadth</b> of the surrounding ledge shall be measured <b>with a cubit of five</b> handbreadths.
The Gemara explains the difficulty with this interpretation: According to this interpretation, <b>how many</b> cubits is <b>the height of the altar?</b> It is <b>ten cubits. Six</b> of these cubits, from the ground up to the surrounding ledge, are measured <b>with</b> a cubit of <b>five</b> handbreadths <b>each,</b> totaling thirty handbreadths. <b>And</b> the remaining <b>four</b> cubits, from the ledge up to the top of the corners of the altar, are measured <b>with</b> a cubit of <b>six</b> handbreadths <b>each,</b> totaling twenty-four handbreadths.
Accordingly, <b>how many</b> handbreadths is the height of the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>fifty-four</b> handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths is the height of <b>half of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>twenty-seven</b> handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths is the height <b>from</b> the top of the <b>corners</b> of the altar <b>until</b> the <b>surrounding ledge?</b> It is <b>twenty-four</b> handbreadths, four cubits of six handbreadths each. Therefore, <b>how many</b> handbreadths is the surrounding ledge <b>short of half</b> the height <b>of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>three</b> handbreadths above the halfway mark. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 3:1): <b>A red line encircled</b> the altar <b>in the middle, in order to separate between the blood</b> that must be presented on the <b>upper</b> part of the altar and <b>the blood</b> that must be presented on the <b>lower</b> part of the altar.
<b>But</b> this interpretation is contradicted by <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to the bird burnt offering,</b> the blood of which must be presented on the upper part of the altar: The priest <b>would ascend the ramp and turn to the surrounding ledge and arrive at</b> the <b>southeast corner. He would pinch off the</b> bird’s <b>head across its nape, and separate</b> it from its body. <b>He would</b> then <b>squeeze out its blood on the wall of the altar</b> beside him. <b>And if</b> the priest <b>performed</b> the squeezing <b>below his feet,</b> i.e., below the surrounding ledge, <b>even</b> one <b>cubit</b> beneath the ledge, it is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara explains the difficulty: According to the previous calculation, the surrounding ledge was only three handbreadths above the halfway mark. Therefore, if one squeezes out the blood one cubit, of five handbreadths, below the ledge, <b>isn’t he putting</b> the blood of an offering that must be presented on the <b>upper</b> part of the altar, <b>two handbreadths below</b> the middle of the altar?
<b>Rather,</b> the verse must be interpreted differently. It is not referring to the height of the altar but to the width of each of its levels, as follows: <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit”:</b> From the top of the external side of the base of the altar, the wall of the altar is <b>inset</b> by one cubit of five handbreadths. “And <b>the breadth a cubit,”</b> this is referring to the width of the surrounding ledge of the altar, as at this point the wall is again <b>inset</b> by one cubit of five handbreadths. <b>“Its border by its edge round about</b> shall be the one span,” this is referring to the width of the corners of the altar, which is also a cubit of five handbreadths, causing the area of the top of the altar to be <b>inset</b> by an additional cubit.
The Gemara explains the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the bird burnt offering according to this interpretation: <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height of the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>sixty</b> handbreadths, ten cubits of six handbreadths each. <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height of <b>half of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>thirty</b> handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height <b>from</b> the top of the <b>corners</b> of the altar <b>until</b> the <b>surrounding ledge?</b> It is <b>twenty-four</b> handbreadths, four cubits of six handbreadths each. Therefore, <b>how many</b> handbreadths is the surrounding ledge <b>short of half</b> the height <b>of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>six</b> handbreadths above the halfway mark. <b>And we learned</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And <b>if</b> the priest <b>performed</b> the squeezing <b>below his feet, even</b> one <b>cubit</b> beneath the ledge, it is <b>valid.</b> According to this calculation, one cubit below the surrounding ledge is still part of the upper section of the altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> part of the altar <b>did you interpret</b> the verse to be referring? It is referring <b>to</b> the width by which each section of the altar is <b>inset. And can you interpret</b> the verse as referring <b>to</b> the width by which each section is <b>inset? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 3:1): The measurements of the base of the <b>altar were thirty-two</b> cubits <b>by thirty-two</b> cubits. Once the altar <b>rose</b> to the height of one <b>cubit</b> it was <b>inset</b> by one <b>cubit</b> on each side. <b>This</b> lower section <b>was</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar. One therefore <b>finds</b> that the second section of the altar measured <b>thirty</b> cubits <b>by thirty</b> cubits.
If the width of the base is measured with a cubit of five handbreadths, then the second section of the altar does not measure thirty cubits by thirty cubits. Since the rest of the altar is measured with a cubit of six handbreadths, the second section measures <b>thirty</b> cubits <b>and two handbreadths.</b>
<b>And furthermore,</b> the aforementioned mishna continues: Once the altar <b>rose</b> to the height of six cubits, i.e., <b>five</b> cubits above the base, it was <b>inset</b> by one <b>cubit</b> on each side, forming a ledge. <b>This is</b> the <b>surrounding ledge.</b> One therefore <b>finds</b> that the third section of the altar measured <b>twenty-eight</b> cubits <b>by twenty-eight</b> cubits. If the width of the base and the surrounding ledge are measured with a cubit of five handbreadths, the third section measures <b>twenty-eight</b> cubits <b>and four handbreadths.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>since</b> the additional area <b>is not</b> a full <b>cubit</b> the mishna <b>did not count it,</b> this explanation is difficult, as the mishna continues: The <b>area</b> taken up by each of the four <b>corners</b> of the altar was <b>one cubit on this</b> side, along the length of the altar, <b>and one cubit on that</b> side, along the width of the altar. One therefore <b>finds</b> that the area of the top of the altar, within the corners, is <b>twenty-six</b> cubits <b>by twenty-six</b> cubits.
If the corners of the altar were also measured with a cubit of five handbreadths, then the top of the altar was a full cubit of six handbreadths wider, as the wall of the altar was inset three times on each side by a cubit of five handbreadths rather than six handbreadths. The area of the top of the altar <b>was</b> therefore <b>twenty-seven</b> cubits by twenty-seven cubits, which the mishna should not have referred to as twenty-six cubits. The Gemara answers that the <i>tanna</i> <b>was not precise,</b> as he should indeed have stated that the altar measured twenty-seven cubits by twenty-seven cubits.
The Gemara rejects this explanation, as the mishna continues: Within the corners of the altar there was <b>an area where the priests set</b> their <b>feet</b> as they circuited the altar. This area was <b>one cubit on this</b> side, along the length of the altar, <b>and one cubit on that</b> side, along the width of the altar. One therefore <b>finds</b> that an area of <b>twenty-four</b> cubits <b>by twenty-four</b> cubits remained as the <b>area for the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar. If the total area of the top of the altar was twenty-seven cubits by twenty-seven cubits, the remaining area <b>would be twenty-five</b> cubits by twenty-five cubits, not twenty-four by twenty-four.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>was not precise,</b> that is difficult: <b>But isn’t it written: “And the hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square</b> on its four sides” (Ezekiel 43:16)? The hearth is the area for the arrangement of wood on the altar. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> the area for the arrangement of wood was <b>only twelve</b> cubits <b>by twelve</b> cubits. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “On its four sides,”</b> this <b>teaches that</b> one <b>measures from the middle</b> of the altar <b>twelve cubits in each and every direction,</b> i.e., the area for the arrangement of wood was twenty-four cubits by twenty-four cubits, not twenty-five by twenty-five.
The Gemara rejects an alternative explanation: <b>And if you would say</b> that when the mishna states that the base of the altar was thirty-two cubits by thirty-two cubits, with regard to <b>six of those</b> cubits the mishna <b>initially counted them as cubits of five</b> handbreadths, this explanation is difficult. <b>If so,</b> the base of the altar measures six handbreadths less, totaling only thirty-one cubits of six handbreadths, in which case the vacant area in the <b>Temple courtyard would be</b> one cubit <b>wider</b> than it actually was.
The Gemara elaborates: This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 5:1): The dimensions of <b>the entire Temple courtyard were a length of 187</b> cubits <b>by a width of 135</b> cubits. The length of the courtyard <b>from east to west</b> was <b>187</b> cubits, divided as follows: <b>The area</b> of the Israelite courtyard, <b>where</b> it was permitted for <b>Israelites to set their feet,</b> was <b>eleven cubits</b> long, <b>and the area where</b> it was permitted only for <b>the priests to set their feet</b> was <b>eleven cubits</b> long. <b>The altar</b> was <b>thirty-two</b> cubits long. The area designated as: <b>Between the Entrance Hall and the altar,</b> was <b>twenty-two cubits,</b> and <b>the Sanctuary</b> was <b>one hundred cubits</b> long. There was an additional <b>eleven cubits</b> of space <b>behind the Hall of the Ark Cover,</b> i.e., behind the Holy of Holies, which was at the western end of the Sanctuary. If the altar was actually only thirty-one cubits long, the mishna accounts for the length of only 186 cubits.
<b>Rather,</b> the verse must be interpreted differently: <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit,”</b> this is referring <b>to the height of</b> the base. <b>“The breadth a cubit,”</b> this is referring to the width of the surrounding ledge, where the wall of the altar is <b>inset</b> by one cubit. <b>“Its border by its edge round about</b> shall be the one span,”

Daf 98a

this is referring to the measurements of the corners of the altar, concerning which there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>this,</b> their height, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>that,</b> their width, as both are measured with a cubit of five handbreadths.
Accordingly, <b>how many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height of the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>fifty-eight</b> handbreadths high, as only eight of its cubits are of six handbreadths, while two cubits, those of the base and of the corners, are of five handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height of <b>half of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>twenty-nine</b> handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height <b>from</b> the top of the <b>corners</b> of the altar <b>until</b> the <b>surrounding ledge?</b> It is <b>twenty-three</b> handbreadths, as the corners of the altar are five handbreadths high, and the upper section of the altar is three cubits of six handbreadths.
Therefore, <b>how many</b> handbreadths is the surrounding ledge <b>short of half</b> the height <b>of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>six</b> handbreadths above the halfway mark. <b>And</b> this correlates with that which <b>we learned</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And <b>if</b> the priest <b>performed</b> the squeezing <b>below his feet, even</b> one <b>cubit</b> beneath the ledge, it is <b>valid.</b> According to this calculation, one cubit below the surrounding ledge is still part of the upper section of the altar.
The Gemara adds that the language of the verse <b>is also precise.</b> The verse indicates that although it is referring to the height of the base, it is referring to the width of the surrounding ledge, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the base: <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit,”</b> whereas with regard to the ledge it is written: <b>“And the breadth a cubit.”</b> Since the verse mentions the breadth only with regard to the surrounding ledge one can infer that the previous term is referring not to the width but to the height. The Gemara concludes: One may <b>conclude from</b> the language of the verse that this is the correct interpretation.
§ The Gemara (97a) cited a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. According to Rabbi Meir all the cubits mentioned with regard to the Temple were medium cubits, except for the measurements of the golden altar, the corners of the external altar, its surrounding ledge, and its base. The Gemara asks: <b>And how many</b> handbreadths is <b>a medium cubit? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>six handbreadths. Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says: We learn</b> in a mishna (96a), <b>as well: Rabbi Meir says: The Table, its length is twelve</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is six</b> handbreadths. Since the Torah states that the length of the Table was two cubits and its width one cubit (see Exodus 25:23), this indicates that the cubit is six handbreadths.
The Gemara asks: May one derive <b>from the fact</b> that the cubit of six handbreadths is referred to as a medium cubit <b>that there is a cubit that is larger than</b> the medium cubit? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> there is a larger cubit, <b>and</b> so <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:9): <b>There were two</b> rods for measuring <b>cubits in</b> the chamber of <b>Shushan the capital,</b> which was located above the eastern gate of the Temple Mount, <b>one in the northeast corner and one in the southeast corner.</b> The one <b>that was in the northeast corner was longer than</b> the cubit used <b>by Moses</b> in the building of the Tabernacle, which was of six handbreadths, by <b>half a fingerbreadth,</b> and the one <b>that was in the southeast corner was longer than</b> the other one by another <b>half a fingerbreadth.</b> One therefore <b>finds it longer than Moses’</b> cubit by a full <b>fingerbreadth.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>And why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that there should be two measures of a cubit, <b>one large and one small?</b> It was <b>so that the artisans</b> who were working in the Temple <b>would take</b> payment according the amount of work they did, as measured <b>by the small</b> cubit, <b>and return</b> it to the Temple through their work, as measured <b>by the large</b> cubit, <b>so they would not come to misuse consecrated property.</b> If they would accept any payment that they did not deserve, they would be misusing consecrated property.
The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>two</b> large cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>One,</b> the shorter of the two, was used <b>to</b> measure <b>silver and gold.</b> Since silver and gold were valuable, the difference between the two measurements was set at only half a fingerbreadth, so that the artisans would not suffer too great a loss. <b>And</b> the other <b>one,</b> which was longer than Moses’ cubit by a full fingerbreadth, was used <b>in</b> the <b>construction</b> of wood and stone structures.
§ The Gemara discusses the depiction of Shushan the capital: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:3): One of the five gates of the Temple Mount was <b>the eastern gate upon</b> which <b>Shushan the capital</b> was <b>depicted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Shushan the capital was depicted on a gate of the Temple Mount?
There is a dispute with regard to this matter between <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi. One said</b> that Shushan was depicted <b>so that</b> those who passed through the gate <b>would know from where</b> it was that <b>they had come</b> back to Jerusalem. The Jews returned once Persia had conquered Babylonia, and therefore they should give thanks to the Persian Empire for releasing them from exile. <b>And one said</b> that it was depicted <b>so that the fear of</b> the Persian <b>Empire would be upon them,</b> to prevent them from rebelling.
The Gemara continues to discuss giving a king his due: <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The <b>fear of kingship should always be upon you,</b> even when the king does not deserve it, <b>as it is stated</b> that Moses said to Pharaoh, when he warned him about the forthcoming plague of the firstborn: <b>“And all these, your servants, shall come down to me, and bow down to me, saying:</b> Get out, you and all the people who follow you, and after that I will go out” (Exodus 11:8). Although ultimately Pharaoh would himself come to Moses, Moses mentioned only that Pharaoh’s servants would come to him, <b>whereas he did not say</b> this <b>to</b> Pharaoh <b>about</b> Pharaoh <b>himself,</b> because of giving a king his due.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> this principle may be derived <b>from here, as it is stated: “And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel”</b> (I Kings 18:46). Despite Ahab’s wickedness, Elijah acted in this manner out of respect for the king.
§ The Gemara cites another dispute between Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: With regard to the fruit trees that in the future will grow on either side of a river that will emerge from the Temple, the verse states: “And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall its fruit fail. It shall bring forth new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the Sanctuary, and its fruit shall be for food, <b>and its leaf for healing [<i>litrufa</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 47:12). The Gemara interprets the term “<i>litrufa</i>” as a contraction of <i>lehatir peh</i>, meaning: To unlock the mouth, and there is a dispute between <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi</b> with regard to the meaning of this term.
<b>One said</b> the leaf shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth that is above,</b> i.e., in the person’s head. The leaves will unlock the mouths of the mute and they will be capable of speech. <b>And one said</b> the leaf shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth that is below,</b> i.e., the womb, enabling barren women to give birth. <b>It was</b> likewise <b>stated</b> that <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> The leaf shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth of the mute,</b> whereas <b>bar Kappara says:</b> It shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth,</b> i.e., the womb, <b>of the barren</b> women.
§ The Torah states with regard to the shewbread: “And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes from it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in one cake. And you shall set them in two arrangements, six in an arrangement, upon the pure Table before the Lord” (Leviticus 24:5–6). <b>The Sages taught: Had</b> the Torah <b>stated: “And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes from it…And you shall set them in two arrangements,” but</b> had it <b>not stated</b> the continuation <b>“six</b> in an arrangement,” <b>I would have said</b> there may be <b>one</b> arrangement <b>of four</b> loaves <b>and one of eight</b> loaves, i.e., the arrangements do not have to be of equal size. <b>Therefore, it is stated: “Six</b> in an arrangement.”
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And had</b> the Torah <b>stated: “Two arrangements, six in an arrangement,” but</b> had it <b>not stated: “Twelve</b> cakes,” <b>I would have said</b> that the total number of loaves may be more than twelve, and the phrase “six in an arrangement” teaches that one may bring another arrangement of six loaves in addition to the two mentioned in the verse, so that there are <b>three</b> arrangements <b>of six</b> loaves <b>each. Therefore, it is stated: “Twelve</b> cakes.”
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>stated: Twelve cakes…And</b> you shall set them in <b>arrangements, but</b> had it <b>not stated: “Two” and “Six,” I would have said</b> that the twelve loaves should be divided into <b>three</b> arrangements <b>of four</b> loaves <b>each. Therefore, it is stated: “Two</b> arrangements,” <b>and: “Six</b> in an arrangement.” <b>Therefore, until these three</b> phrases in the <b>verses were stated we could not learn</b> how to set the shewbread on the Table.
<b>How</b> are <b>these</b> arrangements actually set on the Table? The priest <b>places</b> on the Table <b>two arrangements of six</b> loaves <b>each. And if he placed one</b> arrangement <b>of four</b> loaves <b>and one</b> arrangement <b>of eight</b> loaves <b>he has not fulfilled</b> the obligation. If he added two loaves, so that there were <b>two</b> arrangements <b>of seven</b> loaves <b>each, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One views the upper</b> loaf of each arrangement <b>as though it is not</b> there, and he has fulfilled the obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we require</b> that the frankincense be placed upon the shewbread, as it is stated: <b>“And you shall place</b> pure frankincense <b>upon [<i>al</i>]</b> each arrangement, that it may be for the bread as a memorial part” (Leviticus 24:7)? If the priest places an additional, non-sacred loaf upon the arrangement, it interposes between the frankincense and the shewbread.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Hamnuna, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> said <b>to Rav Ḥisda: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that the word <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means that the frankincense is <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall place pure frankincense by [<i>al</i>] each arrangement”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). The preposition <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> in this verse means that the frankincense is <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread. <b>Do you say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread, <b>or</b> perhaps it means <b>nothing other than</b> that the frankincense was <b>literally upon</b> the shewbread? <b>When it says: “And you shall place the Curtain as a screen next to [<i>al</i>] the Ark”</b> (Exodus 40:3), it is evident that “<i>al</i>” does not mean upon the Ark, as the Curtain separating the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies was hung in front of the Ark and not placed on top of it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that the word <b><i>al</i></b> can also mean <b>adjacent to.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>All the vessels that</b> were <b>in the Temple</b> were placed so that their length was from east to west, along the length of the Temple. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all the vessels that</b> were <b>in the Temple, their length was</b> placed <b>along the length of</b> the <b>Temple, except for</b> the <b>Ark, whose length was</b> placed <b>along the width of</b> the <b>Temple,</b> from north to south. <b>And in this manner</b> the Ark <b>was placed, and in that manner its staves were placed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying</b> in the last clause of the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying:</b> One can infer that <b>in this manner</b> the Ark <b>was placed,</b> i.e., along the width of the Temple, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that its staves were placed in that manner,</b> along the length of the Temple. Since the staves were fixed along the width of the Ark, the Ark itself was necessarily placed along the width of the Temple
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>its staves, from where do we</b> derive that they were placed along the length of the Temple, from east to west? This is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the staves were so long</b> that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the Sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside” (I Kings 8:8). One <b>might</b> have thought that the staves <b>did not touch the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies, and did not protrude at all. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “The ends of the staves <b>were seen.” If</b> the verse had stated only: “The ends of the staves <b>were seen,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the staves <b>tear through the Curtain and emerge</b> into the Sanctuary. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “They could not be seen outside.” How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled?

Daf 98b

The <i>baraita</i> explains: The staves of the Ark <b>pressed against the Curtain and bulged</b> outward. <b>And they appeared like two breasts of a woman</b> that are discernible through her clothes, <b>as it is stated: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh that lies between my breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 1:13). Since the staves pressed against the Curtain, they were evidently placed from east to west.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the Ark’s <b>staves were set along the width of the Ark? Perhaps they were set along the Ark’s length,</b> in which case the Ark was placed along the length of the Temple, not along its width. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that this cannot be the case, as the Ark was carried by two men on each side, who stood between the two staves. If the staves were placed along its length, the two men carrying it on each side would be positioned along the width of the Ark, which was one and a half cubits. This is impossible, as <b>two men</b> standing next to each other <b>in</b> the space of only <b>one and a half cubits cannot walk.</b> If the staves were placed along the width of the Ark, the two bearers on each side would be positioned between the staves along the length of the Ark, which was a larger space of two and a half cubits.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the Ark <b>was carried by four</b> men? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the carrying of the Ark by the descendants of Kohath: “And the Kohathites would travel, the bearers of the Holy Ark, that the Tabernacle might be set up before their coming” (Numbers 10:21). The verse uses the plural form twice. The first phrase: <b>“And the Kohathites would travel,”</b> indicates that <b>two</b> people bear the Ark, and the second phrase: <b>“The bearers of the Holy Ark,” also</b> indicates that <b>two</b> people bear the Ark; the total is therefore four bearers.
§ <b>The Sages taught: King Solomon built ten</b> additional <b>tables,</b> modeled after the one that Moses crafted, <b>as it is stated</b> in the description of the Temple constructed by Solomon: <b>“He made also ten tables, and placed them in the Sanctuary, five on the right side, and five on the left”</b> (II Chronicles 4:8).
<b>And if you say</b> that the terms “right” and “left” are referring to the two sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, which was in the center of the eastern wall, this is difficult. According to this interpretation, Solomon placed <b>five</b> tables <b>to the right of the entrance,</b> on the north side, <b>and five</b> tables <b>to the left of the entrance,</b> on the south of the Sanctuary. <b>If so, we find that</b> in the case of the five tables to the left of the entrance, the <b>table</b> was placed <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>But the Torah said: “And you shall put the Table on the north side”</b> (Exodus 26:35).
<b>Rather,</b> the verse means that the Table <b>of Moses</b> was placed <b>in the middle</b> of the north section of the Sanctuary, while <b>five</b> of Solomon’s tables were placed <b>to the right of</b> Moses’ Table <b>and</b> the other <b>five</b> were placed <b>to the left of</b> Moses’ Table. All of the tables were in the north of the Sanctuary.
Similarly, <b>the Sages taught:</b> King <b>Solomon built ten</b> additional <b>candelabra,</b> modeled after the one that Moses crafted, <b>as it is stated: “And he made the ten candelabra of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the Sanctuary, five on the right, and five on the left”</b> (II Chronicles 4:7).
<b>And if you say</b> that the terms “right” and “left” are referring to the two sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, this is difficult. According to this interpretation, Solomon placed <b>five</b> candelabra <b>to the right of the entrance,</b> on the north side, <b>and five</b> candelabra <b>to the left of the entrance,</b> on the south side. <b>If so, we find that</b> in the case of the five candelabra to the right of the entrance, the <b>candelabrum</b> was placed <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>But the Torah said:</b> “And you shall set the Table outside the Curtain, <b>and the Candelabrum opposite the Table</b> on the side of the Tabernacle toward the south, and you shall put the Table on the north side” (Exodus 26:35).
<b>Rather,</b> the verse means that the Candelabrum <b>of Moses</b> was placed <b>in the middle</b> of the south section of the Sanctuary, while <b>five</b> of the candelabra that Solomon crafted were placed <b>to the right</b> of the Candelabrum of Moses, <b>and five to its left,</b> all in the south of the Sanctuary.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that these tables and candelabra <b>were set inward of</b> the first <b>half of</b> the length of the structure of the <b>Temple,</b> as measured from east to west. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>they were set inward of</b> the first <b>third of</b> the length of the structure of the <b>Temple.</b>
The Gemara explains that this is <b>not difficult,</b> as the two <i>baraitot</i> do not disagree with regard to the location of the tables and candelabra. In the second <i>baraita</i> the <b>Sage is reckoning</b> the length of <b>the Hall of the Holy of Holies,</b> which was twenty cubits, <b>together with</b> the length of the <b>Sanctuary,</b> which was forty cubits. Accordingly, the total length of the structure of the Temple was sixty cubits, and the tables and candelabra were set inward of the first third of its length, i.e., twenty cubits from the entrance. Conversely, in the first <i>baraita</i> the <b>Sage is not reckoning</b> the length of <b>the Hall of the Holy of Holies together with</b> the length of the <b>Sanctuary.</b> Since he is referring to the forty cubits of the Sanctuary itself, inward of the first half of the structure of the Temple’s length means twenty cubits from the entrance.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: All the tables built by Solomon <b>were placed</b> from <b>east</b> to <b>west,</b> i.e., their length was along the length of the Sanctuary, as was the Table in the Tabernacle; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> They were placed from <b>north to south,</b> along the width of the Sanctuary. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> a comparison of the tables to the <b>Candelabrum: Just as</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> was placed from <b>east</b> to <b>west, so too, these</b> tables were positioned from <b>east</b> to <b>west.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>Candelabrum itself, from where do we</b> derive that it was positioned from east to west? This is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written with regard to the western lamp</b> of the Candelabrum: “Outside the Curtain of the testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, <b>Aaron shall set it in order,</b> to burn from evening to morning <b>before the Lord</b> continually” (Leviticus 24:3). The phrase “shall set it in order” is written in the singular, referring only to the western lamp.
The Gemara explains: One can infer <b>from the fact</b> that the verse states that the western lamp is set “before the Lord,” i.e., before the Holy of Holies, <b>that</b> the location of <b>all</b> the other lamps of the Candelabrum <b>is not</b> considered <b>“before the Lord,”</b> as they are not situated in the same proximity to the Holy of Holies. This would be the case only if the Candelabrum was positioned from east to west. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> to say that the Candelabrum was positioned from <b>north</b> to <b>south,</b> then <b>all</b> the other lamps <b>should also be</b> considered <b>“before the Lord,”</b> as all the lamps are an equal distance from the Holy of Holies.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, what is the reason</b> for his opinion? The Gemara replies: <b>He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> a comparison of the tables to the <b>Ark: Just as</b> the <b>Ark</b> was placed from <b>north</b> to <b>south, so too, these</b> tables were positioned from <b>north</b> to <b>south.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> as for <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>let him also derive from</b> the <b>Ark</b> that the tables were positioned from north to south. The Gemara explains that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>one derives</b> the position of the tables, which are located in the <b>outer</b> area of the Sanctuary, <b>from</b> the Candelabrum, which is also located in the <b>outer</b> area of the Sanctuary. <b>And one does not derive</b> the position of the tables, which are located in the <b>outer</b> area of the Sanctuary, <b>from</b> the Ark, which is located in the <b>inner</b> area of the Sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, let him derive from</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> that the tables were positioned from east to west. The Gemara answers that Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, could have <b>said to you:</b> The <b>Candelabrum itself was</b> also <b>placed</b> from <b>north</b> to <b>south.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the western lamp of the Candelabrum: <b>“Aaron and his sons shall set it in order,</b> to burn from evening to morning before the Lord” (Exodus 27:21), indicating that this lamp must be in greater proximity to the Holy of Holies, which is possible only if the Candelabrum is positioned from east to west? The Gemara replies that according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, the term “before the Lord” means that the wick of the middle lamp is turned toward the Holy of Holies, as the priest who kindles the lamps <b>turns</b> the wicks of the other lamps slightly <b>to the side,</b> whereas the wick of the middle lamp is turned directly toward the Holy of Holies.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When you light the lamps, <b>the seven lamps shall give light toward the front of the Candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:2). This <b>teaches that</b> the priests <b>would turn the front</b> of each lamp <b>toward</b> the <b>middle lamp,</b> but the middle lamp was turned toward the Holy of Holies. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> One can infer <b>from here that</b> the <b>middle</b> position is <b>preeminent.</b>
§ The Gemara discusses the different opinions with regard to the position of the tables: The length of each table was two cubits. When the ten tables were placed one alongside the other their overall length would amount to slightly more than twenty cubits. <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned along the length of the Sanctuary from <b>east</b> to <b>west,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>this is</b> the way <b>that ten</b> tables <b>resided in</b> an area <b>twenty</b> cubits long; they could extend slightly beyond the twenty cubits, since the entire area was forty cubits long. <b>But according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned along the width of the Sanctuary from <b>north</b> to <b>south,</b> i.e., Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>how could ten</b> tables <b>reside in</b> an area that was precisely <b>twenty</b> cubits wide?
<b>And moreover,</b> if the ten tables occupied the entire width of the Sanctuary, <b>how would</b> the High <b>Priests</b> pass them in order to <b>enter</b> the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur? <b>And moreover,</b> if the tables were positioned in this manner <b>we find</b> that <b>five</b> of the ten <b>tables</b> were located <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, whereas the Torah states that the Table must be in the north of the Sanctuary. <b>And moreover,</b> if the ten tables built by Solomon occupied the entire width of the Sanctuary, <b>where would</b> one <b>place</b> the <b>Table</b> built <b>by Moses?</b>
The Gemara replies: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> the last question applies <b>according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned from <b>east</b> to <b>west as well: Where would</b> one <b>place</b> the <b>Table</b> built <b>by Moses?</b> If the ten tables of Solomon occupied the entire twenty cubits of the inner half of the Sanctuary, how could Moses’ Table be placed in the middle of the ten tables?
<b>Rather, do you maintain</b> that <b>there was</b> only <b>one row</b> of tables? It was not so; <b>they were</b> set in <b>two rows,</b> with the Table of Moses between the rows. Therefore, there was room for all the tables and it was also possible for the High Priest to pass by them.

Daf 99a

The Gemara continues: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned along the width of the Sanctuary, from <b>north</b> to <b>south,</b> it works out <b>well.</b> According to this opinion there was enough room on the east and the west of the Table for the two priests arranging the new loaves to stand on one side of the Table and for the two priests removing the old loaves to stand on the other side.
<b>But according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned along the length of the Sanctuary, from <b>east</b> to <b>west,</b> in which case the priests arranging and removing the shewbread would stand at the north and south of the Table, this is difficult. <b>Now,</b> consider how much space was taken up by the tables: <b>How far</b> was the <b>Table removed from the</b> northern <b>wall</b> of the Sanctuary? It was <b>two and a half cubits</b> away from the wall, as this is the space necessary for the two priests to pass. <b>And</b> to this one must add one <b>cubit</b> for the width of the northern row of tables <b>itself, and</b> another <b>two and a half cubits that</b> were <b>between</b> the northern row of five tables and Moses’ Table, as space for two priests to pass is required here as well.
The Gemara continues to calculate the area occupied by the tables: <b>And</b> then one must add one <b>cubit</b> for the width of the Table of Moses, <b>and two and a half cubits that</b> were <b>between</b> Moses’ Table and the southern row of tables, <b>and</b> another <b>cubit</b> for the width of the southern row <b>itself.</b> This totals ten and a half cubits, according to which <b>it is found that</b> the <b>Table occupies half a cubit in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, although the Table is supposed to be entirely in the north of the Sanctuary.
The Gemara answers: <b>Do you maintain</b> that the <b>Table of Moses resided together with</b> the other ten tables, i.e., parallel to them? It was <b>not</b> so. The Table of Moses was situated to the west of the other tables, in the space corresponding to the space between the two rows of tables, and its width should not be added to the width of the two rows of Solomon’s tables. All the tables were therefore situated in the north of the Sanctuary. Since the Temple was built on terrain that sloped downward from west to east, this means <b>that</b> the Table of Moses <b>was raised</b> above the tables of Solomon. The Table of Moses <b>was placed</b> to the west <b>and</b> the tables of Solomon <b>were lowered slightly</b> toward the east. Solomon’s tables therefore appeared in relation to Moses’ Table <b>as a student who sits</b> on a lower level <b>before his teacher.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Solomon built ten tables</b> that were situated in the Sanctuary, in addition to Moses’ Table, <b>but</b> the priests <b>would arrange</b> the shewbread <b>only upon</b> the Table <b>of Moses.</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the House of the Lord, the golden altar, <b>and the Table upon which the shewbread was, of gold”</b> (I Kings 7:48), indicating that the shewbread was placed on only one Table.
Likewise, <b>Solomon built ten candelabra, but</b> the priests <b>would kindle</b> the lamps <b>only on</b> the Candelabrum <b>of Moses.</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And they burn unto the Lord every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense; the shewbread also they arrange in order upon the pure Table, and <b>the Candelabrum of gold with its lamps, to burn</b> every <b>evening”</b> (II Chronicles 13:11). The singular form indicates that the lamps were kindled on only one Candelabrum.
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua says: They would arrange</b> the shewbread <b>upon all</b> the tables, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the House of God, the golden altar as well, and <b>the tables upon which was the shewbread”</b> (II Chronicles 4:19). The plural form indicates that the shewbread was arranged on all the tables. <b>And they would kindle</b> the lamps <b>on all</b> the candelabra, <b>as it is stated</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“And the candelabra with their lamps, which they should burn according to the ordinance before the Sanctuary, of pure gold”</b> (II Chronicles 4:20).
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: They would arrange</b> the shewbread <b>only upon</b> the Table <b>of Moses. Rather, how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And the tables upon which was the shewbread…</b>of pure <b>gold”</b> (II Chronicles 4:19–20)? <b>These are</b> the <b>three tables that were in the Temple,</b> of which there were <b>two that were</b> situated <b>in the Entrance Hall</b> to the Sanctuary, <b>on the inside</b> near <b>to the entrance to the Temple,</b> i.e., near the entrance to the Sanctuary. <b>One</b> of these tables was made <b>of silver, and</b> the other <b>one</b> was made <b>of gold.</b>
<b>On</b> the table <b>of silver</b> the priest <b>places the</b> new <b>shewbread</b> that has been baked, <b>before its entrance</b> into the Sanctuary, so that the loaves may cool a little from the heat of the oven. <b>And</b> when the old shewbread is removed from the shewbread Table it is placed <b>on</b> the table <b>of gold upon its exit</b> from the Sanctuary, until the frankincense is burned on the altar. The reason the shewbread is placed on a silver table before it is brought into the Sanctuary and on a gold one when it is removed is <b>that one elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Since it is set on the gold shewbread Table all week, it cannot be downgraded to a silver table upon its removal. The Gemara concludes: The third of the three tables is the <b>one</b> Table <b>of gold inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>upon which the shewbread</b> is <b>always</b> found.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that one does not downgrade</b> in matters of sanctity? <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And Moses erected the Tabernacle, and he laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and erected its pillars”</b> (Exodus 40:18). This teaches that once Moses, who was at a greater level of sanctity than the rest of the people, began the work of erecting the Tabernacle, he alone completed it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that one elevates</b> to a higher level in matters of sanctity? <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the coal pans of the men of Korah’s assembly, in which they burned incense before they were consumed by a fire: <b>“The coal pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they have become sacred because they were brought before the Lord, that they may be a sign to the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 17:3). <b>Initially</b> the coal pans had the status of <b>articles</b> used in the service <b>of</b> the <b>altar,</b> as they contained the incense, <b>and now</b> that they have been made into a covering for the altar their status has been elevated to that of <b>the altar itself.</b>
§ Having mentioned the principle that one does not downgrade in matters of sanctity, the Gemara cites a related issue. The verse states: “At that time the Lord said to me: Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first…And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <b>which you broke, and you shall put them in the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1–2). <b>Rav Yosef teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i>: This verse <b>teaches that</b> both <b>the tablets</b> of the Covenant <b>and</b> the <b>pieces of</b> the broken <b>tablets are placed in the Ark.</b> One should learn <b>from here that with regard to a Torah scholar who has forgotten his</b> Torah <b>knowledge due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond his control,</b> e.g., illness, <b>one may not behave toward him</b> in <b>a degrading manner.</b> Although the first tablets were broken it is prohibited to treat them with disrespect, due to their sanctity. A Torah scholar who forgot the Torah knowledge he once possessed is likened to these broken tablets.
The Gemara notes <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following three statements of Reish Lakish, which are all related to the concept stated by Rav Yosef: One who <b>caused dereliction</b> of the study of Torah for the sake of a mitzva, a Torah scholar who <b>sinned, and</b> a Torah scholar who <b>forgot</b> his studies.
<b>Reish Lakish says: Sometimes</b>

Daf 99b

<b>the</b> apparent <b>dereliction of</b> the study of <b>Torah is its foundation,</b> e.g., if one breaks off his studies in order to participate in a funeral or a wedding procession. This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Moses: Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write upon the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <b>which [<i>asher</i>] you broke”</b> (Exodus 34:1). The word “<i>asher</i>” is an allusion to the fact that that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Your strength is true [<i>yishar koḥakha</i>]</b> in <b>that you broke</b> the tablets, as the breaking of the first tablets led to the foundation of the Torah through the giving of the second tablets.
<b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> With regard to <b>a Torah scholar who sinned, he is not disgraced in public, as it is stated: “Therefore, you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with you in the night”</b> (Hosea 4:5). One can derive from the verse that if a prophet or any other Torah scholar stumbles and sins, one <b>should conceal</b> his offense <b>like the night</b> and not punish him in public.
<b>And Reish Lakish says: Anyone who causes himself to forget</b> even <b>one matter from his studies violates a prohibition, as it is stated</b> with regard to the receiving of the Torah on Mount Sinai: “Only <b>observe for yourself, and guard your soul diligently, lest you forget the matters</b> that your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life, but you should make them known to your children and to your children’s children” (Deuteronomy 4:9). <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the principle that <b>Rabbi Avin</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says, as Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: Wherever it is stated: Observe,</b> or: <b>Lest, or: Do not, it is nothing other than a prohibition.</b>
<b>Ravina says:</b> One who forgets his studies violates two prohibitions, as the verse uses both the term <b>“observe” and</b> the term <b>“lest,”</b> and <b>these are two prohibitions. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> He violates <b>three prohibitions, as it is stated:</b> “Only <b>observe for yourself, and guard your soul diligently, lest you forget the matters</b> that your eyes saw.” The term “Guard your soul” is derived from the same root as “observe” and is considered an additional prohibition.
The Gemara qualifies this statement: One <b>might</b> have thought this applies <b>even</b> to one who forgot his Torah knowledge <b>due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond his control.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And lest they depart from your heart.”</b> This indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of one who</b> willingly <b>causes them to depart from his heart. Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yannai, says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if <b>his studies were</b> too <b>hard for him</b> to remember. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only,”</b> which excludes one who is unable to recall his studies.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say:</b> The <b>Torah was given in forty</b> days, when Moses ascended to Mount Sinai to receive it, <b>and</b> similarly the <b>soul</b> of man <b>is formed in forty</b> days, as the formation of the fetus in the womb takes forty days from the time of conception. This teaches that <b>anyone who preserves his Torah</b> studies, <b>his soul is</b> likewise <b>preserved, and anyone who does not preserve his Torah</b> studies, <b>his soul is not preserved</b> either.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> This can be illustrated by <b>a parable,</b> as it is comparable <b>to a person who delivered a sparrow to his slave</b> for safekeeping, and <b>said</b> to him: <b>Are you under the impression that if you lose it I will take from you an <i>issar</i>,</b> a small coin, <b>which is the value</b> of the bird? It is not so; <b>I will take your soul from you</b> as punishment, meaning I will kill you. Similarly, one who fails to preserve the Torah entrusted to him will be severely punished.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There were two tables in the Entrance Hall, on the inside</b> of the Entrance Hall, next <b>to the entrance to the Temple,</b> i.e., next to the entrance to the Sanctuary. <b>One</b> was <b>of marble and one</b> was <b>of gold. On</b> the table <b>of marble,</b> the priests <b>place the</b> new <b>shewbread</b> that has been baked, <b>before its entrance</b> into the Sanctuary, so that the loaves may cool a little from the heat of the oven and not spoil. <b>And</b> when the old shewbread is removed from the shewbread Table it is placed <b>on</b> the table <b>of gold upon its exit</b> from the Sanctuary, where it remains until the frankincense is burned on the altar.
The reason the shewbread is placed on a gold table when it is removed, rather than on a marble or silver table, is <b>that one elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Since it is set on the gold shewbread Table all week, it cannot be downgraded to a marble or silver table upon its removal. <b>And</b> there was <b>one</b> Table <b>of gold within</b> the Sanctuary, <b>upon which the shewbread</b> is <b>always</b> found.
The mishna describes the manner in which it is ensured that the shewbread is constantly on the Table: <b>And four priests enter, two</b> with the <b>two arrangements</b> of the new shewbread <b>in their hands and two</b> with the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense <b>in their hands. And four</b> priests <b>precede</b> them, entering the Sanctuary <b>before them, two to take</b> the <b>two arrangements</b> of the old shewbread from the Table, <b>and two to take</b> the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense.
<b>Those bringing</b> the new shewbread <b>into</b> the Sanctuary <b>stand in the north and their faces are to the south, and those removing</b> the old shewbread <b>stand in the south and their faces are to the north. These</b> priests <b>draw</b> the old shewbread from the Table <b>and those</b> priests <b>place</b> the new shewbread on the Table, <b>and for</b> each <b>handbreadth of this</b> old shewbread that is removed from the Table a <b>handbreadth of that</b> new shewbread is placed upon the Table, so that the Table is never without loaves upon it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall set upon the Table shewbread <b>before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30).
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if <b>these</b> priests were to <b>remove</b> the shewbread from the Table entirely, <b>and</b> only afterward <b>those</b> priests were to <b>place</b> the new shewbread upon the Table, this <b>too would</b> fulfill the requirement that the shewbread <b>always</b> be on the Table. It is unnecessary to ensure the uninterrupted presence of the shewbread upon the Table, as long as it does not remain a single night without shewbread upon it.
The mishna describes the manner in which the shewbread is distributed: The priests who carried the old shewbread loaves <b>came out</b> of the Sanctuary <b>and placed them on the table of gold that was in the Entrance Hall.</b> The priests then <b>burned</b> on the altar <b>the</b> frankincense that was in the <b>bowls. And the loaves were</b> subsequently <b>distributed to the priests.</b> This occurred on Shabbat, the day that the priestly watch that served in the Temple during the preceding week was replaced by the priestly watch that would serve during the following week. The shewbread was distributed to the priests of both watches.
If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat, the loaves are distributed at night,</b> at the conclusion of the fast, since they may not be eaten during the day. If Yom Kippur <b>occurs on Friday,</b> i.e., when the holy day begins on Thursday evening, <b>the goat</b> sin offering <b>of Yom Kippur is eaten</b> by the priests <b>at night,</b> i.e., on Friday night, as it may be eaten only on the day that it is sacrificed or during the following night, until midnight. <b>And</b> since there is no possibility of cooking the meat, as one may not cook on Yom Kippur or Shabbat, <b>the Babylonians,</b> i.e., priests who had emigrated from Babylonia, <b>eat it when it is raw, due to</b> the fact <b>that they are broad-minded</b> with regard to their food, i.e., they are not particular and will eat meat even when it is not cooked.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Yosei, even if the priest first removes the old shewbread entirely, and only then places the new shewbread upon the Table, this fulfills the requirement that the shewbread always be on the Table. Moreover, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if the priest <b>removed the old</b> shewbread on the <b>morning</b> of Shabbat, <b>and arranged the new</b> shewbread toward <b>evening,</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that. Rather, how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: “And you shall set upon the Table shewbread <b>before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30)? This means <b>that</b> the <b>Table should not be left overnight without bread</b> upon it.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that according to Rabbi Yosei, even if the old shewbread remained on the Table for a short while in the morning, and the new shewbread was placed on the Table toward evening, and even though it did not reside constantly on the Table, this fulfills the requirement that the shewbread should always be on the Table. <b>Rabbi Ami says: From Rabbi Yosei’s statement we may learn</b> that <b>even</b> if <b>a person learned only one chapter</b> of the Mishna in <b>the morning and one chapter</b> of the Mishna in <b>the evening, he has</b> thereby <b>fulfilled the mitzva of: “This Torah scroll shall not depart from your mouth,</b> and you shall contemplate in it day and night, that you may take heed to do according to all that is written in it, for then you shall make your ways prosperous, and then you shall have good success” (Joshua 1:8).
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Even</b> if <b>a person recited only the recitation of <i>Shema</i></b> in <b>the morning and</b> in <b>the evening,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> the mitzva of: “This Torah scroll <b>shall not depart</b> from your mouth.” <b>And it is prohibited to state this matter in the presence of ignoramuses [<i>amei ha’aretz</i>],</b> as they are likely to get the impression that there is no need to study Torah beyond this. <b>And Rava says:</b> On the contrary, it is <b>a mitzva to state</b> this matter <b>in the presence of ignoramuses,</b> as they will realize that if merely reciting the <i>Shema</i> leads to such a great reward, all the more so how great is the reward of those who study Torah all day and night.
<b>Ben Dama, son of Rabbi Yishmael’s sister, asked Rabbi Yishmael:</b> In the case of one <b>such as I, who has learned the entire Torah, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to studying Greek wisdom?</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>recited this verse about him: “This Torah scroll shall not depart from your mouth, and you shall contemplate in it day and night.” Go and search</b> for <b>an hour that is neither</b> part <b>of the day nor</b> part <b>of the night, and learn Greek wisdom in it.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this statement of Rabbi Yishmael’s <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: This verse is neither an obligation nor a mitzva, but a blessing.</b> Rabbi Yonatan explains: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, saw Joshua</b> and observed <b>that</b> the <b>words of Torah were very precious to him, as it is stated:</b> “And the Lord spoke to Moses face-to-face…<b>and his servant Joshua, son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the Tent”</b> (Exodus 33:11). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Joshua: <b>Joshua, are</b> the <b>words of Torah so precious to you?</b> I bless you that <b>“this Torah scroll shall not depart from your mouth.”</b>
<b>The <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> teaches: The <b>words of Torah should not be</b> considered as <b>an obligation upon you,</b> i.e., one should not treat Torah study as a burden, <b>but</b> at the same time <b>you are not permitted to exempt yourself from them.</b>
<b>Ḥizkiyya said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “He delivers the afflicted due to His affliction, and opens their ear by tribulation; <b>and also He has allured you out of a narrow opening to a broad place without confines below it,</b> and that which is set on your table is full of fatness” (Job 36:15–16)? <b>Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that <b>a person allures another from</b> the <b>paths of life to</b> the <b>paths of death, but the Holy One, Blessed be He, allures the person from</b> the <b>paths of death to</b> the <b>paths of life, as it is stated: “And also He has allured you out of a narrow opening,”</b> i.e., <b>from Gehenna, the opening of which is narrow</b> so <b>that its smoke is collected</b>

Daf 100a

<b>within it. And lest you say: Just as the opening</b> of Gehenna <b>is narrow, so</b> too, <b>all of</b> Gehenna <b>is narrow, the verse states:</b> “For Gehenna has been arranged of old, it has been prepared even for the king, <b>deep and large,</b> its pile is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord kindles it like a stream of brimstone” (Isaiah 30:33).
<b>And lest you say</b> that Gehenna is prepared only for ordinary people, but <b>it is not prepared for</b> important individuals such as <b>a king, the verse states: “It has been prepared even for the king.” And lest you say there is no wood in</b> Gehenna, <b>the verse states: “Its pile is fire and much wood.” And lest you say</b> that <b>this,</b> i.e., escaping Gehenna, <b>is</b> the only <b>reward</b> for Torah study, <b>the verse states: “And that which is set on your table is full of fatness”</b> (Job 36:16). This indicates that one who obeys God and turns from the paths of death to the paths of life is not only saved from Gehenna, he also attains tranquility and prosperity.
§ The mishna states: If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat,</b> the loaves are distributed on Saturday night. If Yom Kippur occurs on Friday, the goat sin offering of Yom Kippur is eaten Friday night, on Shabbat. Since there was no possibility of cooking the meat, the Babylonian priests would eat it raw. The Gemara notes: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> These priests <b>are not</b> actually <b>Babylonians. Rather, they are Alexandrians,</b> i.e., priests who came from Egypt. <b>But since</b> the Jews of Eretz Yisrael <b>hate</b> the Jewish <b>Babylonians, they would call</b> the gluttonous Alexandrians <b>by the name Babylonians.</b>
<b>This</b> interpretation of the mishna <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> These priests <b>are not</b> actually <b>Babylonians. Rather, they are Alexandrians. But since</b> the Jews of Eretz Yisrael <b>hate</b> the <b>Babylonians, they would call</b> the gluttonous Alexandrians <b>by the name Babylonians. Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whose family originated from Babylonia, <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei, after hearing this explanation: <b>May your mind be at ease, because you have put my mind at ease.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>arranged the bread</b> on the Table <b>on Shabbat but</b> arranged <b>the bowls</b> of frankincense only <b>after Shabbat,</b> then if he subsequently <b>burned</b> the frankincense placed in <b>the bowls on the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> the loaves are <b>unfit</b> for consumption, since the frankincense had not been on the Table for the entire week. Since the burning of the frankincense did not render the loaves permitted for consumption, <b>one is not</b> ever <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> or <b><i>notar</i>, or</b> for partaking of the shewbread when one is <b>ritually impure.</b> One violates these prohibitions only if the frankincense is burned in a manner that permits consumption of the shewbread.
If one <b>arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>on Shabbat but</b> then <b>burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls after the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> that burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>And</b> since the frankincense was not burned in a manner that permits consumption of the shewbread, <b>one is not</b> ever <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> or <b><i>notar</i>, or</b> for partaking of the shewbread when one is <b>ritually impure.</b>
If <b>one arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>after Shabbat and burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls on the</b> subsequent <b>Shabbat,</b> the burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>How should</b> one <b>act</b> to prevent the shewbread from being rendered unfit? One should not remove the shewbread and frankincense from the Table on the subsequent Shabbat. Rather, <b>he should leave it</b> on the Table <b>until the following Shabbat,</b> so that it remains on the Table for a full week from Shabbat to Shabbat. It is permitted to leave the bread and frankincense on the Table beyond seven days, <b>as even</b> if <b>it is on the Table</b> for <b>many days</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that,</b> i.e., it is not rendered unfit.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Yoma</i> 28a) with regard to the Yom Kippur service in the Temple: <b>The appointed</b> priest <b>said to</b> the other priests: <b>Go out</b> and stand on a high point in the Temple <b>and see if</b> it is day and <b>the time for slaughtering</b> the daily offering <b>has arrived,</b> as one may not slaughter offerings at night. <b>If</b> the time <b>has arrived, the observer says: There is light [<i>barkai</i>]. Mattitya ben Shmuel</b> maintained that one should wait until greater light is observed. Therefore, when he was the appointed priest, he <b>would say: Is the entire eastern</b> sky <b>illuminated,</b> even <b>to Hebron? And</b> the observer <b>would say: Yes.</b>
The mishna asks: <b>And why did they need to</b> institute <b>this,</b> to send someone to observe the first light from a high place? The mishna explains that this was deemed necessary <b>because once, the light of the moon rose and</b> the priests <b>imagined that the eastern</b> sky <b>was illuminated</b> with sunlight. <b>They</b> then <b>slaughtered the daily offering, and</b> when they realized that it had been slaughtered too early <b>they had to take it out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning</b> and burn it. In order to prevent similar errors in the future, the Sages instituted that they should carefully assess the situation and ensure that day has begun before slaughtering the daily offering.
The mishna continues: Once the daylight was observed on Yom Kippur, the priests <b>led</b> the <b>High Priest down to the Hall of Immersion.</b> The mishna comments: <b>This was the principle in the Temple: Anyone who covers his legs,</b> a euphemism for defecating, <b>requires immersion</b> afterward; <b>and anyone who urinates requires sanctification of hands and feet</b> with water from the Basin afterward.
<b>The father of Rabbi Avin teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Not only</b> in <b>this</b> case, with regard to slaughtering the daily offering, did the Sages say that if it is performed at night it is disqualified, <b>but even</b> in the case of <b>a bird burnt offering whose</b> nape <b>was pinched at night, and</b> in the case of <b>a meal offering</b> from <b>which a handful was removed at night,</b> the offering is disqualified and <b>must be taken out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, a bird burnt offering</b> is disqualified if pinched at night, <b>as it cannot be restored</b> to its former state. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a meal offering</b> whose handful was removed at night, why is it burned? It is <b>possible</b> to remedy the situation, <b>as</b> the priest <b>can restore</b> the <b>handful to its</b> original <b>place and</b> then <b>remove a handful</b> from the meal offering once again <b>during the day.</b>
The Gemara replies that the father of Rabbi Avin <b>teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he says its</b> explanation: <b>Service vessels sanctify</b> their contents even <b>when</b> those contents are <b>not</b> placed in the vessel <b>at</b> the appointed <b>time for</b> that service. Once the handful is placed in the service vessel it acquires the sanctity inherent to the handful and the situation can no longer be remedied.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed during the day is consecrated</b> by a service vessel only <b>during the day,</b> and any offering that is sacrificed <b>at night is consecrated</b> by a service vessel only <b>at night,</b> and any offering that is sacrificed <b>both during the day and at night is consecrated both during the day and at night.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed during the day is consecrated during the day,</b> from which one can infer that <b>during the day, yes,</b> it is consecrated, but it is <b>not</b> consecrated <b>at night.</b> This indicates that the handful of the meal offering is not consecrated at night, contrary to the explanation of Rabbi Avin’s father. The Gemara answers: When an offering is placed in a service vessel not at the appointed time, the contents <b>are not</b> sufficiently <b>consecrated to be sacrificed</b> on the altar, <b>but they are</b> sufficiently <b>consecrated to be disqualified.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from the mishna: If <b>one arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>after Shabbat and burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls on the</b> subsequent <b>Shabbat,</b> the burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>How should</b> one <b>act</b> to prevent the shewbread from being rendered unfit? One should not remove the shewbread on the subsequent Shabbat. Rather, <b>he should leave it</b> on the Table <b>until the following Shabbat,</b> so that it remains on the Table for a full week from Shabbat to Shabbat. It is permitted to leave the bread and frankincense on the Table beyond seven days, <b>as even</b> if <b>it is on the Table</b> for <b>many days</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that,</b> i.e., it is not rendered unfit.
Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>service vessels sanctify</b> their contents <b>to</b> the extent that those contents <b>are disqualified</b> even <b>when</b> they are <b>not</b> placed in the vessel <b>at</b> the appointed <b>time,</b> then even if the shewbread is arranged after Shabbat <b>it should be sanctified</b> by the Table <b>and</b> subsequently <b>disqualified</b> by being left overnight.
<b>Rabba said: The one who raises the objection,</b> Rabbi Zeira, <b>raises the objection well.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the father of Rabbi Avin is also stating a <i>baraita</i>,</b> and the difficulty must therefore be resolved. Rabba explains: The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> cited by Rabbi Avin’s father <b>maintains</b> that in the case of a rite that should be performed during the day, if it is performed during the preceding <b>night</b> it is <b>not</b> considered a rite <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, as the night and day are considered a single unit. Therefore, if one places the handful in a service vessel at night the service vessel sanctifies the handful, and since the rite is not valid the offering is disqualified. <b>But</b> if a rite is performed several <b>days</b> earlier it is considered a rite <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. Therefore, the Table does not sanctify shewbread that is placed on it on any day except Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b>

Daf 100b

if a rite performed during the night preceding its appointed time is not considered a rite whose time has not yet arrived, then <b>when the night arrives,</b> i.e., the <b>twilight</b> of Shabbat eve, the arrangement of loaves remaining on the Table should <b>be consecrated and</b> subsequently <b>disqualified</b> by being left overnight. <b>Rava says:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>removed</b> the shewbread from the Table <b>before</b> nightfall on Shabbat eve in order to prevent its consecration, and arranged it again the following day.
<b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>did not remove</b> the shewbread <b>before</b> nightfall, the loaves are not consecrated by the Table. <b>Since</b> the priest <b>arranged</b> the shewbread at a time <b>that was not in accordance with</b> the procedure dictated by <b>its mitzva, it is considered as though a monkey had arranged</b> the shewbread, and it is not consecrated by the Table.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The two loaves</b> that are brought on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>are eaten</b> by the priests <b>no less than two</b> days <b>and no more than three</b> days after they were baked. <b>How so? They are</b> generally <b>baked on the eve of the festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> and <b>they are eaten on the</b> day of the <b>Festival,</b> which is <b>on the second</b> day. If <b>the Festival occurs after Shabbat,</b> on Sunday, the loaves are baked on Friday, in which case <b>they are eaten on the third</b> day.
<b>The shewbread is eaten no less than nine</b> days <b>and no more than eleven</b> days after it is baked. <b>How so? It is</b> generally <b>baked on Shabbat eve and eaten on the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> which is <b>on the ninth</b> day. If <b>a Festival occurs on Shabbat eve</b> the shewbread is baked on the eve of the Festival, on Thursday, in which case <b>it is eaten on the tenth</b> day.
If the <b>two festival days of Rosh HaShana</b> occur on Thursday and Friday, the shewbread is baked on Wednesday, in which case <b>it is eaten on the eleventh</b> day. <b>And</b> this is because the preparation of the two loaves and the shewbread <b>overrides neither Shabbat nor a Festival. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of the deputy</b> High Priest: Their preparation <b>overrides a Festival but does not override</b> the <b>fast day</b> of Yom Kippur.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ravina said: According to the statement of the one who says vow offerings and voluntary offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival, do not say they are fit</b> to be sacrificed on a Festival <b>by Torah law and it is the Sages who decreed</b> they may not be sacrificed. The Sages might have issued such a decree so <b>that</b> one <b>would not delay</b> sacrificing his offerings until he ascends to Jerusalem for the Festival. <b>Rather,</b> vow offerings and voluntary offerings <b>are unfit</b> to be sacrificed on a Festival <b>also by Torah law.</b>
Ravina explains this may be inferred from the mishna, <b>as</b> the offering of <b>the two loaves is an obligation of the day</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>. It is therefore <b>not</b> possible <b>to say</b> that the Sages decreed they may not be prepared on the Festival <b>lest</b> one <b>delay</b> bringing them. <b>And</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that baking and preparing the two loaves <b>overrides neither Shabbat nor a Festival.</b> All the more so that vow offerings and voluntary offerings, which do not need to be sacrificed specifically on a Festival, may not be sacrificed on a Festival by Torah law.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the</b> fine flour for <b>meal offerings or the</b> wine for <b>libations that became ritually impure,</b> as long as they <b>have not yet been consecrated in</b> a service <b>vessel</b> and assumed inherent sanctity, <b>their redemption</b> is possible. If they are redeemed, their sanctity will be transferred to the redemption money. <b>Once they have been consecrated in</b> a service <b>vessel</b> and have assumed inherent sanctity, <b>their redemption</b> is <b>no</b> longer possible, and they are burned like any other offerings that became ritually impure.
With regard to consecrated <b>birds, wood</b> for the altar, <b>frankincense, and service vessels, once</b> they <b>became ritually impure they have no</b> possibility of <b>redemption, as redemption</b> of items consecrated for the altar <b>was stated only with regard to</b> a consecrated <b>animal</b> that developed a blemish, not with regard to other consecrated items.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> According to the mishna, impure meal offerings and libations may be redeemed as long as they have not yet been placed in a service vessel. <b>Shmuel says: Even if they are ritually pure, they</b> also may be <b>redeemed. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As long as they have not been consecrated in</b> a service <b>vessel,</b> they possess <b>sanctity</b> that inheres only in their <b>value,</b> and items whose <b>sanctity</b> inheres only in their <b>value</b> may be <b>redeemed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The meal offerings and libations that <b>became ritually impure</b> are redeemed? The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true even if they had not become ritually impure. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> mentions a case where they became ritually impure <b>since</b> he <b>wants</b> to <b>teach the latter clause,</b> which states: <b>Once they were consecrated in</b> a service <b>vessel</b> and have assumed inherent sanctity, <b>they have no</b> possibility of <b>redemption,</b> meaning <b>that even</b> when <b>they became ritually impure</b> and are disqualified from use as an offering, they <b>still</b> have <b>no</b> possibility of redemption. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught the first clause: That became ritually impure before they were consecrated in</b> a service <b>vessel.</b>
With regard to flour or oil that has been consecrated in a service vessel, the Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that they are not redeemed, as <b>they are</b> consecrated with <b>inherent sanctity?</b>
The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state that items consecrated in a service vessel cannot be redeemed, as it may <b>enter your mind to say: Since a blemished</b> animal <b>is called impure,</b> as the Gemara will explain shortly, this analogy could be reversed and <b>an impure</b> animal could <b>also</b> have a status <b>similar to</b> that of <b>a blemished</b> animal. <b>And</b> just as in the case of a blemished animal, <b>even though</b> it is <b>consecrated</b> with <b>inherent sanctity, when it develops a blemish it is redeemed,</b> so too <b>these</b> impure items discussed in the mishna <b>may also be redeemed</b> despite their possessing inherent sanctity. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that</b> it <b>is not</b> in <b>this</b> context that <b>the Merciful One called a blemished</b> animal <b>“impure.”</b>

Daf 101a

One cannot draw the conclusion that these substances can be redeemed, <b>since we do not find</b> a case <b>where</b> an item that has been consecrated in <b>a service vessel is redeemed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> is <b>a blemished</b> animal <b>called “impure”</b> in the Torah? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to redeeming an offering, that the Torah states: <b>“And if it be any impure animal, of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord,</b> then he shall set the animal before the priest. And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as you the priest values it, so shall it be. But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:11–13). <b>The verse is speaking of blemished</b> animals <b>that are redeemed,</b> and they are referred to as impure because they are not fit to serve as offerings.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse is referring <b>to blemished</b> animals <b>that were redeemed, or is it</b> referring <b>only to an actual non-kosher [<i>tamei</i>] animal,</b> as the plain sense of the verse indicates? The Gemara responds: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> later in that section: <b>“And if it be of an impure [<i>tamei</i>] animal, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation,</b> and shall add to it the fifth part thereof” (Leviticus 27:27), an actual <b>non-kosher animal is mentioned</b> as being subject to redemption. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And if it be any impure [<i>tamei</i>] animal”</b> (Leviticus 27:11)? <b>The verse is speaking of blemished</b> animals <b>that were redeemed,</b> i.e., that have the possibility of being redeemed.
The Gemara continues to discuss this <i>halakha</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that offerings <b>are redeemed</b> even <b>due to</b> the presence of <b>a temporary blemish.</b> Therefore, the continuation of <b>the verse states: “Of which they may not bring an offering to the Lord,”</b> which is referring to an animal <b>that is not sacrificed to God at all.</b> The verse serves to <b>exclude this</b> animal with a temporary blemish, <b>which is not sacrificed today,</b> while it remains blemished, <b>but is sacrificed tomorrow,</b> after the blemish disappears.
<b>Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s opinion that even meal offerings and libations that are pure may be redeemed if they have not yet been consecrated in a service vessel. The mishna states: With regard to consecrated <b>birds, wood</b> for the altar, <b>frankincense, and service vessels, once</b> they <b>became ritually impure, they have no</b> possibility of <b>redemption, as redemption</b> of consecrated items <b>is stated only with regard to an animal</b> consecrated for the altar that became blemished. <b>Granted, birds</b> are not redeemed, since <b>they are</b> imbued with <b>inherent sanctity, and</b> the Torah <b>stated</b> that <b>only with regard to</b> blemished <b>animals,</b> not birds, is redemption possible for items of inherent sanctity.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>wood, and frankincense</b> that is not consecrated with inherent sanctity until it is placed in a service vessel, <b>and service vessels</b> themselves that became impure, since none of these possess inherent sanctity, <b>let them be redeemed. Rather, is it not</b> that these items are not redeemed <b>because pure</b> sacrificial items <b>in general are not redeemed,</b> even when they do not possess inherent sanctity?
<b>And these</b> items <b>too,</b> i.e., the wood, frankincense, and service vessels, <b>even though they became impure,</b> they <b>are</b> treated <b>like</b> they are <b>pure.</b> Their impurity is incomplete <b>because wood and frankincense are not capable of becoming food,</b> and consequently they should not be susceptible to impurity at all. <b>Rather, the regard for the sanctity</b> of sacred property <b>transforms their</b> status into that of <b>food,</b> which renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.
<b>With regard to wood, as long as</b> one does <b>not trim it into logs,</b> it <b>does not become susceptible</b> to impurity. With regard to <b>frankincense as well, as long as</b> it is <b>not consecrated in a service vessel,</b> it <b>does not become susceptible</b> to impurity. With regard to <b>service vessels also, since they have</b> the capacity to attain <b>purity in a ritual bath,</b> their impurity is revocable. Apparently, the reason the mishna teaches that these items are not redeemed is because they are in some sense still regarded as pure, and consecrated items that are considered ritually pure are not redeemed, contrary to the opinion of Shmuel.
The Gemara responds: <b>No, actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>in general, pure</b> items <b>are redeemed; and these</b> items are not redeemed, despite the fact that they are not imbued with inherent sanctity, <b>because they are not</b> readily <b>available.</b> If these items can be redeemed when they are pure, then they may not be available for the Temple service.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted, frankincense and service vessels are not</b> readily <b>available, but wood</b> is <b>readily available.</b> Why, then, may it not be redeemed? The Gemara answers: <b>Wood</b> usable for the Temple service is <b>also</b> difficult to procure. This is apparent <b>since the Master said</b> that <b>any wood in which a worm is found</b> is <b>disqualified for</b> use on <b>the altar. Consequently,</b> wood suitable for the altar is <b>not</b> readily <b>available.</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss the opinion of Shmuel that libations and the flour for meal offerings are redeemed even when pure, as long as they have not been consecrated in a service vessel. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>if Shmuel had heard that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>, he would have retracted his opinion. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: In the case of one <b>who consecrates unblemished</b> animals <b>for Temple maintenance</b> rather than for the altar, <b>they are redeemed only for</b> use <b>on the altar.</b> They may not be redeemed for any other use, in accordance with to the principle <b>that any</b> consecrated item <b>that is fit</b> to be sacrificed <b>on the altar may never leave the altar. And even though these</b> animals possess only <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in their <b>value, they are not redeemed, since they are ritually pure</b> and fit for the altar. Had Shmuel known this <i>baraita</i>, <b>he would have retracted</b> his opinion.
The Gemara responds: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so;</b> this <i>baraita</i> was <b>heard by him, and</b> he still <b>did not retract</b> his opinion. Rather, he explained it as follows: <b>Didn’t you say there,</b> i.e., earlier in the discussion of the mishna, that the reason one may not redeem wood, frankincense, and service vessels that were consecrated for Temple maintenance is that <b>since</b> they are <b>not</b> readily <b>available,</b> the Sages decreed that they <b>are not redeemed?</b>
<b>Here, too,</b> with regard to an unblemished animal that was consecrated for Temple maintenance, <b>since blemishes that disqualify an animal</b> as an offering <b>are common, as even</b> a blemish as insignificant <b>as</b> one <b>on</b> the <b>cornea of the eye also disqualifies</b> the animal, <b>therefore,</b> unblemished animals that are fit to be sacrificed on the altar are <b>not</b> readily <b>available.</b> That is why the Sages decreed that unblemished animals, even when consecrated for Temple maintenance, may be redeemed only for use as an offering on the altar. By contrast, meal offerings and libations, which were the subject of Shmuel’s statement, are readily available, and may be redeemed even when they are still pure.
§ After analyzing Shmuel’s opinion permitting the redemption of meal offerings and libations that are pure and have not yet been consecrated in a service vessel, the Gemara now cites a dissenting opinion: <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that only meal offerings and libations that are <b>impure are redeemed,</b> but those that are <b>pure are not redeemed. And Rabbi Oshaya similarly said</b> that those meal offerings and libations that are <b>impure are redeemed,</b> but those that are <b>pure are not redeemed. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: Even pure</b> ones <b>are redeemed.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard <b>to all</b> meal offerings, if they are <b>impure</b> they <b>are redeemed,</b> and if they are <b>pure,</b> they <b>are not redeemed, except for the tenth of an ephah</b> of fine flour <b>of a meal offering of a sinner,</b> which is redeemed even if it is pure.
The reason for this is <b>that the Torah stated</b> with regard to an extremely destitute individual who brings a tenth of an ephah of fine flour: “And the priest shall effect atonement for him <b>for his sin [<i>meḥattato</i>]</b> that he has sinned of one of these, and it shall be forgiven for him” (Leviticus 5:13). By contrast, with regard to a wealthy person who brings a lamb as a sliding-scale offering, the verse states: “And the priest shall effect atonement for him <b>from his sin [<i>al ḥattato</i>]</b> that he has sinned” (Leviticus 5:6). The word “<i>al</i>,” which can also mean on, indicates that if an extremely destitute individual designates a tenth of an ephah for his meal offering and then becomes wealthy, he redeems his meal offering and adds money on to the original sum in order to purchase an offering that is appropriate for his current financial status. In that case, the meal offering is redeemed even if it is pure.
§ The Gemara cites another statement that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: I heard</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> when one <b>rendered a meal offering <i>piggul</i></b> by sacrificing it with the intent to consume it beyond its designated time, it is not susceptible <b>to the ritual impurity of food. As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Okatzin</i> 3:12): <b><i>Orla</i>, diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b>

Daf 101b

the flesh of <b>an ox that is stoned, a heifer whose neck is broken,the birds</b> sacrificed by <b>a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:4–7), <b>a firstborn donkey</b> whose neck was broken, <b>and meat</b> cooked together <b>with milk are all</b> susceptible to <b>the ritual impurity of food,</b> despite the fact that they are forbidden for consumption.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: None of them are susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> since they are all items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, and they are therefore not considered food. <b>And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to meat</b> cooked together <b>with milk that it is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food since it,</b> i.e., both the meat and the milk, <b>had a time</b> that it was <b>fit</b> for consumption before it was rendered forbidden.
<b>And Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s</b> opinion that an item from which it is prohibited to derive benefit is not susceptible to impurity of food? It is because it is stated: <b>“All food which may be eaten [<i>ha’okhel asher ye’akhel</i>],</b> that on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The redundancy in the phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that specifically <b>food that you are able to feed to others,</b> in this case, gentiles, <b>is termed food</b> for the purposes of susceptibility to the impurity of food, but <b>food that you are not able to feed to others is not termed food.</b> Therefore, items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit and which it is therefore prohibited to feed to others are not considered food in this context.
Rabbi Oshaya explains how this can be applied to <i>piggul</i>: <b>A meal offering</b> that one <b>rendered <i>piggul</i> is also food that you are not able to feed to others,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from it. Consequently, it is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food according to Rabbi Shimon.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why doesn’t he <b>also</b> derive that <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk</b> is susceptible to impurity <b>because it is food that you may feed to others,</b> as Rabbi Shimon maintains that it is permitted to derive benefit from meat and milk cooked together?
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, eating</b> it <b>is prohibited and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And elsewhere</b> the verse <b>states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an animal torn by animals, which is forbidden as a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., an animal possessing a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>eating</b> it <b>is prohibited but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, where being a holy people is also mentioned, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted.</b>
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> that cites Rabbi Shimon’s opinion <b>states one</b> reason why meat cooked in milk is susceptible to impurity <b>and</b> adds <b>another. One</b> reason is <b>that</b> it <b>is food that you can feed to others.</b> Therefore, it is called food for the purpose of being susceptible to impurity. <b>And another</b> reason is that <b>even for him,</b> i.e., a Jew, although it is currently prohibited to eat the milk and meat, <b>it had a time</b> when each was <b>fit</b> to be eaten, i.e., before they were cooked together; therefore, they remain susceptible to impurity.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Oshaya from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>there is</b> a case of the <b>leftover</b> of an offering <b>that is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, but there is</b> also a case of the <b>leftover</b> of an offering <b>that is not susceptible to the impurity of food.</b>
<b>How so?</b> If it was <b>left overnight before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood on the altar, it is not susceptible <b>to the ritual impurity of food,</b> as it never became fit for consumption. But if it was left overnight <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> since from after the sprinkling of the blood until it was left overnight, it was fit for consumption.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> with regard to <b><i>piggul</i>, both in</b> cases of <b>offerings of the most sacred order as well as in</b> cases of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> the meat of the offering is not susceptible to <b>the impurity of food.</b> This is because it was rendered forbidden for consumption at the beginning of the sacrificial rite, and was never fit for consumption. If the priest <b>rendered a meal offering <i>piggul</i>,</b> it <b>is</b> susceptible to <b>the impurity of food,</b> since it did have a period of time when it was acceptable, i.e., when it was still flour before it was consecrated as a meal offering. This ruling contradicts Rabbi Oshaya’s understanding that according to Rabbi Shimon, a meal offering that became <i>piggul</i> is not susceptible to the impurity of food.
The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> where Rabbi Shimon ruled that the meal offering that became <i>piggul</i> is susceptible to the impurity of food, it is referring to a case <b>where it had a time</b> in which <b>it</b> was <b>fit</b> for consumption. <b>There,</b> where it is not susceptible to the impurity of food, it is referring to a case <b>where it did not have a time</b> in which it was <b>fit</b> for consumption.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances where it did not have a time</b> in which it was <b>fit</b> for consumption? Before the flour was consecrated as a meal offering, it was certainly permitted for consumption. The Gemara answers: This would occur <b>where he consecrated</b> the wheat <b>while</b> it was still <b>attached</b> to the ground and was therefore not yet susceptible to impurity. Once harvested, it was already prohibited for consumption.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: The flour may still have a time in which it was fit. <b>Let him redeem it</b> before it is placed in a service vessel. Why is it regarded as not having a time in which it was fit for consumption? The Gemara qualifies the question: <b>This</b> distinction, between flour that came from wheat that was consecrated before it was harvested and wheat or flour that was consecrated at a later point, <b>works out well according to this version of</b> that which <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: Impure</b> meal offerings and libations that have not been consecrated in a service vessel <b>are redeemed;</b> if they are <b>pure,</b> they <b>are not redeemed.</b> Accordingly, it works out <b>well</b> that the flour does not have a time in which it was fit for consumption when it came from wheat that was consecrated before being harvested. It could not be redeemed and made fit for consumption.
<b>But according to this version of</b> what Rabbi Oshaya <b>said: Even pure</b> meal offerings and libations <b>are redeemed,</b> there remains the possibility of <b>letting him redeem</b> the meal offering while it is pure and before is consecrated in a service vessel. Therefore, it should be considered as having a time in which it is fit for consumption.
The Gemara answers: <b>In any event, now he has not redeemed it.</b> Therefore, it is not considered to have had a time in which it is fit for consumption.
The Gemara asks: How can the flour be considered as not having a time in which it is fit for consumption merely because he has not redeemed it, even though he could have redeemed it? <b>Since</b> in a case <b>where if</b> he <b>wants,</b> he <b>may redeem it,</b> don’t <b>we attribute to Rabbi Shimon that he said</b> that for <b>any</b> item <b>that stands to be redeemed,</b> it <b>is as if it</b> already <b>is redeemed?</b>
The Gemara cites a source for this assertion: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> A red <b>heifer,</b> even if it has been slaughtered and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, since it had a time in which it was fit. And Reish Lakish said,</b> explaining how it is possible to derive from this <i>halakha</i> that any item that could be redeemed is considered as though it has been redeemed: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say</b> that a red <b>heifer is redeemed</b> with money even when it has already been slaughtered and placed <b>upon its pyre</b> in preparation for being burned. If so, a meal offering that could be redeemed should also be considered fit for consumption, as it is considered as though it has been redeemed.
The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted,</b> with regard to the red <b>heifer,</b> it <b>is</b> considered to be an item that <b>stands to be redeemed, since if he found another</b> animal <b>choicer than it,</b> there is <b>a mitzva to redeem</b> the first one and purchase the choicer one with the money. <b>But</b> is there <b>a mitzva to redeem these meal offerings?</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> there is a case where sacrificial meat <b>remained</b> overnight <b>before the sprinkling</b> of the blood occurred, <b>where there was a mitzva to sprinkle</b> the blood the day before, <b>and if he had wanted</b> he <b>could have sprinkled</b> it, and the offering would not have been disqualified. <b>And</b> yet, Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> sacrificial meat that remained overnight <b>is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> even though it should have been considered fit for consumption on the day the offering was slaughtered, as the blood stood to be sprinkled and there was a mitzva to sprinkle it.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where there was not</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day to sprinkle</b> the blood, as the offering was slaughtered close to sunset. Therefore, the blood did not stand to be sprinkled and the meat was therefore never fit for consumption.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in a case where the offering was slaughtered when <b>there was</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood, <b>what</b> would then be the <i>halakha</i> according to Rabbi Shimon? Would meat left overnight <b>be susceptible to the ritual impurity of food?</b>
If so, <b>rather than</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teaching</b> the following: Sacrificial meat that was left overnight before the blood was sprinkled is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, but if <b>left overnight after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> instead <b>let him distinguish within</b> the case <b>itself: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> When is sacrificial meat left overnight without the blood of the offering having been sprinkled not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food? It is in a case <b>where there was not</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood; but if <b>there was</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood, it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>That is indeed what he is saying</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, that if the offering was <b>left overnight before</b> it was <b>available for sprinkling,</b> i.e., if it was slaughtered so late in the day that there was no time left to sprinkle the blood, it is not susceptible <b>to the ritual impurity of food.</b> By contrast, if it was left overnight <b>after</b> it was <b>available for sprinkling,</b> i.e., there was still time to sprinkle the blood, then it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b>
The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Shimon in fact hold that an item that stands to be redeemed is treated as though it has already been redeemed, and is therefore considered to have had a time in which it is fit, even if it was never actually redeemed? <b>But isn’t</b> it so that when one <b>renders either offerings of the most sacred order or offerings of lesser sanctity <i>piggul</i>,</b> there was <b>a mitzva to sprinkle</b> the blood once the offering was slaughtered,

Daf 102a

<b>and if he had wanted,</b> he could have <b>sprinkled</b> the blood of these offerings properly? Nevertheless, Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> the meat of an offering that was rendered <i>piggul</i> <b>is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> he <b>rendered</b> it <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the rite of <b>sprinkling?</b> If so, since the offering stood to have its blood sprinkled, it is considered as though it has been sprinkled, and the offering was considered fit for consumption before he rendered it <i>piggul</i>; therefore, it should be susceptible to the impurity of food. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> he <b>rendered</b> it <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the rite of <b>slaughtering,</b> and the blood never stood to be sprinkled.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if he <b>rendered</b> it <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the rite of <b>the sprinkling, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is the <i>halakha</i> that the meat of the offering <b>indeed becomes susceptible to</b> the <b>ritual impurity of food?</b>
The Gemara challenges: If so, <b>rather than</b> continuing and <b>teaching</b> that if he <b>rendered the meal offering <i>piggul</i></b> it <b>is</b> susceptible to the <b>ritual impurity of food,</b> i.e., instead of contrasting the animal offering case with a case involving an meal offering, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish within</b> the case of the animal offering <b>itself</b> in the following way: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that if one renders an offering <i>piggul</i> the meat is not susceptible to the impurity of food, <b>said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> he <b>rendered</b> it <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the rite of <b>slaughtering, but</b> if he <b>rendered</b> it <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the rite of <b>sprinkling,</b> it <b>is</b> susceptible to <b>the impurity of food.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for him</b> to contrast it with a case of one who rendered <b>a meal offering <i>piggul</i></b> in order to teach <b>that even though he</b> already <b>rendered it <i>piggul</i> at</b> the time of the <b>removal of the handful,</b> and the principle is that <b>the removal of the handful of a meal offering is equivalent to the slaughtering</b> of an animal offering, and an offering that was rendered <i>piggul</i> at the time of slaughtering is not susceptible to the impurity of food, <b>even so,</b> the meal offering <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, since it initially had a time that was fit for consumption,</b> when the flour was not yet consecrated as a meal offering.
<b>Rav Ashi said: I related</b> this <b>discussion in the presence of Rav Naḥman</b> and explained Rabbi Shimon’s opinion differently: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the case in the <i>baraita</i> is one in which the meat was <b>actually left overnight</b> and there was time to sprinkle the blood during the day, <b>and even</b> if <b>you say</b> that he <b>rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> at</b> the time of the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood rather than during the slaughtering, Rabbi Shimon does not consider those to be cases in which the offering had a time when it was fit for consumption.
Rabbi Shimon <b>said</b> only that <b>if he had wanted,</b> he <b>would have redeemed</b> it, and therefore an item that stands to be redeemed is treated as if it were already redeemed. Redemption is simple and requires only a verbal statement. According to Rabbi Shimon <b>we do not say that if he had wanted,</b> he <b>would have sprinkled</b> it, i.e., that the sprinkling of the blood and similar actions that stand to take place are treated as having taken place already.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Ashi’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 2a): <b>Rabbi Yehoshua states a principle</b> about the misuse of offerings that became disqualified: With regard to <b>any offering that had a time</b> that it was <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests</b> before it became disqualified, one is not liable for <b>misusing it, and</b> with regard to <b>any</b> offering <b>that did not have a time</b> that it was <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests</b> before it became disqualified, one is liable for <b>misusing it.</b> Misuse of consecrated property applies only to offerings that are considered fully reserved for God. Once the priests are permitted to partake of the offering it is no longer categorized as consecrated property.
Rabbi Yehoshua clarifies: <b>And what is</b> a disqualified offering that had <b>a time</b> that it was <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests?</b> Examples of such a situation are as follows: <b>When,</b> after the blood was sprinkled, the meat of the offering <b>was left overnight; or when</b> the meat of an offering <b>became ritually impure; or when</b> an offering <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard. One is not liable for misuse in these cases, since the meat of these offerings became permitted to the priests once the blood was sprinkled and only subsequently was it disqualified.
<b>And what is</b> a disqualified offering <b>that did not have a time</b> that it was <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests?</b> Examples of such a situation are as follows: <b>When,</b> at the time that it <b>was slaughtered,</b> he intended to eat it, sprinkle the blood, or burn the sacrificial potions on the altar <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area; or when</b> priests who were <b>disqualified</b> for Temple service <b>collected or sprinkled its blood.</b> In these cases, since there was never a time that it was permitted for the priests to consume the meat of the offering, one is liable for the misuse of consecrated property.
The Gemara addresses the objection to Rav Ashi’s opinion: <b>In any event, the first clause teaches</b> that meat of an offering <b>that was left overnight, and</b> meat <b>that became impure, and</b> meat <b>that left</b> the courtyard all had a time when they were permitted to the priests. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where it was <b>actually left overnight,</b> i.e., both the blood and the meat of the offering, <b>and here</b> the case <b>is</b> an instance <b>of: If he had wanted, he could have sprinkled</b> the blood, and for that reason the mishna <b>teaches that</b> one is not liable for <b>misusing</b> it? It is considered as having had a time that it was permitted to the priests since he could have sprinkled the blood during the day, and therefore the offering is treated as if the sprinkling already happened, counter to Rav Ashi’s claim that such reasoning does not apply with regard to the sprinkling of the blood.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring to cases where the meat left the courtyard at a time when it was <b>fit to leave, and</b> the meat became impure when it was <b>fit to become impure, and</b> was left over when it was <b>fit to be left over,</b> i.e., the mishna is discussing cases where these occurred after the blood was sprinkled, rendering the meat fit to be consumed by the priests. For that reason it was not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property.
The Gemara again challenges Rav Ashi’s opinion: <b>But</b> according to this, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case where the whole offering, including the blood, was <b>actually left overnight?</b> Is <b>that indeed</b> a case where one is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, as the priests never had a time when it was permitted to consume the meat? If so, <b>those</b> statements in the mishna: <b>Any</b> offering <b>that had a time</b> that it was <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests, and any</b> offering <b>that did not have a time</b> that it was <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests,</b> are imprecise. They indicate that the critical factor is whether the meat had a time that it was potentially permitted, even if it was ultimately disqualified.
Instead, the mishna <b>should have</b> stated: With regard to <b>any</b> offering <b>that has,</b> in actuality, <b>a time</b> that it is <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests,</b> one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing it. And,</b> similarly, with regard to <b>any</b> offering <b>that does not have a time</b> that it is <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests,</b> one is liable for <b>misusing it.</b>
It must be that Rav Ashi concedes that the mishna in <i>Me’ila</i> should be understood to include the case where both the blood and the meat were leftover, and that under such circumstances one is not liable for misuse of the offering due to the fact that once the blood could have been sprinkled, the offering is already considered permitted to the priests. Rav Ashi nevertheless claims that this mishna does not pose a difficulty to his understanding of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion with regard to an offering’s status as susceptible to the impurity of food. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi says: Are you raising a contradiction between</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property and the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity?</b>
These cannot be compared, as liability for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property is <b>due to the sanctity or lack of sanctity</b> of an item, i.e., on whether it is classified as fully reserved for God. Therefore, <b>after the sanctity</b> of the offering <b>has lapsed,</b> which occurs when the blood is ready to be sprinkled, as at that point it is already regarded as permitted to the priests, <b>how</b> can it <b>return</b> and <b>be inured in it?</b>
But with regard to <b>impurity,</b> the offering’s susceptibility to the impurity of food <b>is due to</b> whether it is considered <b>food or not</b> considered <b>food.</b> Therefore, in <b>any</b> case <b>where if</b> he <b>wants</b> to <b>sprinkle</b> the blood he <b>could sprinkle it,</b> it is only in sprinkling the blood that he <b>grants</b> the meat the status of <b>food, and</b> then it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b> But in a case <b>where if</b> he <b>wants</b> to <b>sprinkle</b> the blood he <b>cannot sprinkle it</b> for some reason, and the offering is subsequently disqualified, he <b>does not grant it</b> the status of <b>food,</b> since it never became permitted to eat <b>and</b> it therefore <b>is not susceptible to the impurity of food.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 23b) to Rav Ashi’s opinion that with regard to susceptibility to the impurity of food, blood that is ready to be sprinkled is not considered as if it were sprinkled: With regard to <b>one who brings a provisional guilt offering</b> to be sacrificed, because he is uncertain as to whether he committed a sin that requires a sin offering (see Leviticus 5:17–19), <b>and</b> later <b>it becomes known</b> to him <b>that he has not sinned,</b> the status of the offering is as follows: <b>If it became known to him</b> that he had not sinned <b>before</b> the offering <b>was slaughtered,</b> the consecrated ram <b>should go out and graze in the flock</b> as a non-sacred animal, as the consecration was performed in error. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say</b>

Daf 102b

it is treated as a guilt offering that was disqualified and it <b>should graze until it becomes blemished, and</b> then <b>it is sold, and its money</b> that is received from the sale is <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It <b>should be sacrificed</b> in its current state, <b>since if it does not come</b> to atone <b>for this sin, it will come for a different sin,</b> as he certainly committed some sin of which he is unaware.
If, <b>after</b> the provisional guilt offering <b>was slaughtered, it became known to him</b> that he had not sinned, <b>the blood</b> collected in a cup to sprinkle on the altar <b>should be spilled</b> into the Temple courtyard drain <b>and the meat should be burned</b> in the place of burning, in accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> of a disqualified offering.
If <b>the blood was</b> already <b>sprinkled</b> on the altar when it became known to him that he had not sinned, <b>the meat</b> of the offering <b>is eaten</b> by the priests in the normal manner. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if he discovered that he had not sinned while <b>the blood</b> was still <b>in the cup,</b> it is <b>sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat is eaten.</b>
<b>And Rava says</b> in explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>Rabbi Yosei stated</b> this ruling <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that for <b>any</b> blood <b>that stands to be sprinkled</b> on the altar, <b>it is as if</b> it has already been <b>sprinkled.</b> Therefore, once the blood is in the cup and is ready to be sprinkled, the meat is permitted as though the blood already had been sprinkled. This statement contradicts Rav Ashi’s opinion that with regard to the status of the meat as food, an offering whose blood stands to be sprinkled is not necessarily considered as though it has already been sprinkled.
The Gemara responds: <b>Is that the reason</b> for Rabbi Yosei’s opinion? They <b>say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, that this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei:</b> His reasoning is <b>that he holds</b> that <b>a service vessel sanctifies disqualified</b> offerings <b>to be sacrificed</b> on the altar <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> and in this case the blood was already in the service vessel.
<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: Since Rabbi Shimon said</b> that for <b>any</b> blood <b>that stands to be sprinkled</b> on the altar it <b>is as if</b> it has already been <b>sprinkled,</b> and for <b>any</b> item <b>that stands to be burned</b> it <b>is as if</b> it is already <b>burned, why</b> does he hold, as the Gemara mentioned previously (101b), that meat from an offering that is <b>leftover, and the</b> meat of a red <b>heifer</b> that is not yet burned on its pyre, <b>are</b> both <b>susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> since there was a time that they were fit for consumption by the priests? <b>They are merely dust,</b> as they stand to be burned, and therefore should no longer retain the status of food. Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi in response: Nevertheless, <b>regard for the sanctity</b> of sacred property <b>renders them susceptible</b> to the impurity of food.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Granted that the regard for the sanctity</b> of sacred property <b>is effective</b> in order <b>to disqualify the</b> meat <b>itself</b> if it becomes impure, but is it <b>also considered impure</b> to the extent <b>that</b> one <b>counts first- and second-</b>degree with regard to it, as indicated by the language: Susceptible to the ritual impurity of food? Accordingly, if the meat came into contact with a primary source of impurity, it would have first-degree impurity and it would subsequently transfer second-degree impurity to an item that comes into contact with it.
If that were the case, one could <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>that Reish Lakish raises:</b> With regard to <b>a dry portion of</b> flour taken from one of the <b>meal offerings</b> that has not come into contact with a liquid and is therefore susceptible to impurity due only to regard for its sanctity, does one <b>count first- and second-</b>degree impurity <b>with it, or</b> does one <b>not count first- and second-</b>degree impurity <b>with it?</b> Since Reish Lakish’s inquiry is unresolved, presumably the same uncertainty applies here.
The Gemara responds: <b>When Reish Lakish raises the dilemma,</b> it is with regard to the status of the dry mass of the meal offering <b>by Torah law,</b> as consecrated items are burned only when rendered impure by Torah law. <b>When we said</b> that leftover meat and the meat of the red heifer are susceptible to the impurity of food, we were inquiring about the status of the leftover meat and of the red heifer <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore nothing can be derived from the dilemma raised by Reish Lakish.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in</b> a shallow <b>pan, and he brought</b> a meal offering prepared <b>in a deep pan</b> instead; or if he said: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> a meal offering prepared <b>in</b> a shallow <b>pan</b> instead, the meal offering <b>that he brought, he brought</b> as a voluntary meal offering, <b>but he has not fulfilled his obligation</b> that he undertook with his vow and he must therefore bring another meal offering.
If he said: <b>This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering <b>to bring in</b> a shallow <b>pan, and he brought</b> it prepared <b>in a deep pan</b> instead; or if he said: This tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering to bring <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> a meal offering prepared <b>in</b> a shallow <b>pan, this</b> offering <b>is not valid,</b> because he did not fulfill what he had stated concerning that tenth of an ephah of flour.
In the case of <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me to bring</b> one meal offering of <b>two tenths</b> of an ephah <b>in one vessel, and he</b> divided it and <b>brought</b> it <b>in two vessels,</b> removing a handful from each; or if he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring two tenths of an ephah for two meal offerings <b>in two vessels, and he brought</b> one meal offering of two tenths of an ephah <b>in one vessel</b> and removed one handful from it, then the meal offering <b>that he brought, he brought</b> as a voluntary meal offering, <b>but he has not fulfilled his obligation.</b>
If he says: <b>These</b> two tenths of an ephah before me are a meal offering <b>in one vessel, and he</b> divided them and <b>brought</b> them <b>in two vessels,</b> removing a handful from each; or if he says: These tenths of an ephah are two meal offerings <b>in two vessels, and he brought</b> them <b>in one vessel,</b> both of <b>these</b> offerings <b>are not valid,</b> because in both cases he deviated from the number of handfuls that he vowed to remove.
In the case of one who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering of <b>two tenths</b> of an ephah <b>in one vessel, and he</b> divided them and <b>brought</b> them <b>in two vessels,</b> and others <b>said to him: You vowed</b> to bring a meal offering <b>in one vessel,</b> then if <b>he sacrificed</b> the two tenths of an ephah <b>in two vessels</b> they are <b>not valid</b> even as voluntary meal offerings, and he must bring another meal offering to fulfill his obligation. His failure to respond and explain that it was not his intention to fulfill his vow with this offering indicates that he does intend to fulfill his vow with it. Since he deviated from his vow, the offering is not valid. If he sacrificed the two tenths of an ephah <b>in one vessel</b> after he was reminded, it is <b>valid,</b> as he fulfilled his vow.
Likewise, in a case where one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring two meal offerings totaling <b>two tenths</b> of an ephah <b>in two vessels, and he brought</b> it all <b>in one vessel,</b> and others <b>said to him: You vowed</b> to bring meal offerings <b>in two vessels,</b> then if <b>he sacrificed</b> the two tenths of an ephah <b>in two vessels</b> as he had originally vowed, they are <b>valid.</b> If <b>he placed it</b> all <b>in one vessel,</b> its halakhic status is <b>like</b> that of <b>two meal offerings that were intermingled</b> prior to removal of the handfuls. Therefore, if one can remove a handful from each meal offering in and of itself, they are valid. If not, they are not valid, as the Gemara explained on 23a.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna cites cases where one vowed to bring a meal offering prepared in a shallow pan and instead brought one prepared in a deep pan and vice versa, as well as cases where one vowed to bring two tenths of an ephah in one vessel and instead brought them in two vessels and vice versa. In all these cases, the offering is accepted but he has not fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to mention both types of changes from the initial vow.
It is necessary <b>because had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, one might think that perhaps this individual does not fulfill his obligation <b>because he said: In</b> a shallow <b>pan, and he brought</b> it instead <b>in a deep pan. But here, where</b> he changes the number of offerings but <b>both this,</b> the offering specified in his vow, <b>and that,</b> the offering that he actually brought, are <b>in</b> a shallow <b>pan, or both this and that</b> are <b>in a deep pan, I would say</b> that <b>he has indeed fulfilled his vow,</b> as the difference in number of offerings brought is not significant. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> taught the second case as well, to teach that the change in the number is in fact significant.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only <b>this</b> case, where there was a discrepancy between the number of offerings he vowed to bring and the number he actually brought, one might think that he does not fulfill his obligation only <b>because he divided</b> the two tenths of an ephah that were supposed to be brought together. <b>But there, where</b> he changed the type of pan but did <b>not divide</b> the flour to be used, <b>I would say</b> that it is <b>not</b> a case where he failed to fulfill his obligation. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that where he changes the type of pan, he does not, in fact, fulfill his obligation.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> a case similar to that of the mishna: If one brings a meal offering somewhat different from that which he vowed to bring, then the one <b>that he brought, he brought</b> as a voluntary meal offering, <b>but he has not fulfilled his vow. Rabbi Shimon says: He has even fulfilled his vow,</b> as Rabbi Shimon maintains that the type of pan or the number of offerings is not significant.
§ The mishna teaches that if he says: <b>This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering <b>to bring in</b> a shallow <b>pan,</b> and he brought a meal offering prepared in a deep pan instead, it is not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in this case <b>the service vessel does not consecrate</b> the flour, since he brought it in a different service vessel than he had vowed? Therefore, the meal offering is still non-sacred and can be used. The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> should be understood according to that which <b>Abaye says:</b> Under such circumstances, the service vessel <b>does not sanctify them with regard to being sacrificed</b> on the altar, <b>but</b> it does <b>sanctify them</b> in order <b>to become disqualified.</b>
<b>And Abaye says</b> an additional comment about the previous case: The Sages <b>taught</b> in the mishna that in the case of a change in the type of meal offering, the meal offering not valid

Daf 103a

<b>only when he assigned it at the time of the vow. But</b> if at the time of the vow he simply said: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering, and <b>at the time of the designation</b> of the fine flour as a meal offering he specified a particular type of meal offering, he is <b>not</b> obligated to bring that type, and if he brought a different type, he has still fulfilled his obligation.
The reason for this is that the Torah states: “That which has emerged from your lips you shall observe and do; <b>according to what you have vowed</b> freely to the Lord your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). Since it states: “According to what you have vowed,” <b>and not: According to what you have designated</b> to fulfill your vow, only matters specified as part of the vow are essential to its content.
It <b>was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> <b>taught</b> in the mishna that meal offerings are not valid <b>only</b> when <b>he established their</b> type <b>at the time of the vow</b> and subsequently brought a different type of meal offering. <b>But</b> if he mentioned one type of meal offering <b>at the time of the designation</b> of the flour, and then brought it differently, it is <b>not</b> invalid, as the Torah states: <b>“According to what you have vowed,” and not: According to what you have designated</b> for your vow.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering from barley, should bring</b> the meal offering <b>from wheat,</b> as voluntary meal offerings are brought exclusively from wheat. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering from <b>flour, should bring</b> the meal offering from <b>fine flour,</b> as it is written: “His offering shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 2:1). If one vows to bring a meal offering <b>without oil and without frankincense, he should bring</b> it with <b>oil and frankincense,</b> as voluntary meal offerings require oil and frankincense.
If one vows to bring as a meal offering <b>half a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>he should bring a complete tenth</b> of an ephah, the minimum measure of a voluntary meal offering. If one vows to bring a meal offering of <b>a tenth and a half</b> an ephah, <b>he should bring two</b> tenths, as there are no partial tenths of an ephah brought in meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> one <b>exempt</b> from bringing a meal offering in all these cases. This is because the vow does not take effect, <b>as he did not pledge in the manner of those who pledge.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the vow to bring a meal offering from barley valid? <b>It is</b> seemingly a case of <b>a vow and its extenuation together.</b> The statement: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering, is a valid vow, while the next term: From barley, constitutes a retraction, as the speaker knows that a meal offering may not be brought from barley.
<b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say:</b> In the case of one who stated a declaration comprising two contradictory statements, <b>attend</b> only to <b>the first statement. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 9a): If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite from dried figs and from</b> pressed <b>figs,</b> which is a contradictory statement, as figs are not prohibited to a nazirite, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> He is a full-fledged <b>nazirite,</b> as one attends only to the first statement, i.e., I am hereby a nazirite, and the second part is discounted. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The second part of his statement is not discounted, and therefore <b>he is not a nazirite,</b> as he did not accept naziriteship upon himself.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna here is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> It is referring <b>to</b> one who, upon being informed that such a vow is not effective, <b>says: Had I known that</b> one <b>cannot vow</b> in <b>this</b> manner to bring barley for a meal offering, <b>I would not have vowed</b> in <b>this</b> manner <b>but rather</b> in <b>that</b> manner, by vowing to bring wheat instead.
§ The Gemara cites another disagreement between Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan about the mishna: <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that the Sages <b>taught</b> in the mishna <b>only</b> that <b>where he says:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering from barley,</b> he can bring a meal offering from wheat instead, <b>but</b> if he <b>says:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering from lentils,</b> the vow is <b>not</b> valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>his tradition</b> of interpreting the mishna is that it is <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion? It is <b>in accordance with Beit Shammai’s</b> opinion, <b>and Beit Shammai’s</b> ruling is <b>due to</b> the principle that one should <b>attend</b> only to <b>the first statement.</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether he vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from barley</b> or <b>from lentils?</b> In either case, that principle should require him to bring a meal offering from wheat. The Gemara answers: Ḥizkiyya <b>retracted his</b> initial explanation that the mishna is in accordance with Beit Shammai, and subscribes to the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>he retracted</b> his explanation? <b>Rava said: The mishna</b> posed <b>a difficulty for him: Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> using the example of <b>a meal offering from barley? Let it teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> using the example of a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> which is a greater novelty.
<b>Rather, learn from</b> it that the reason the vow takes effect <b>is because</b> one may <b>err. With regard to barley,</b> it is reasonable that one may <b>err,</b> since one of the individual meal offerings, the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>, comes from barley. But <b>with regard to lentils,</b> one would <b>not err</b> in thinking that one may bring a meal offering from them. Therefore, one can presume that by saying: Lentils, he intended to negate his initial statement.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> According to the mishna, <b>even</b> if he vowed to being a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> the vow takes effect. The Gemara asks: <b>Now, Rabbi Yoḥanan states</b> that <b>his tradition</b> in interpreting the mishna is that it is <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, and Beit Hillel</b> understand that the reason the meal offering takes effect <b>is because</b> one may reasonably <b>err.</b> One may <b>err with regard to barley</b> being fit for a meal offering, but <b>with regard to lentils,</b> he will <b>not err</b> that they are fit. Why then, does Rabbi Yoḥanan hold that the meal offering takes effect even if he said: Lentils?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan does in fact hold that when he vows to bring a meal offering from lentils it is not valid. What he said was in response <b>to the statement of Ḥizkiyya.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is saying to him: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you retracted</b> your explanation of the mishna as being in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai? It is <b>because</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> using the example of one who vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> which would have been a greater novelty.
Rabbi Yoḥanan questions this reasoning: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. It is not necessary</b> to say that when one vows to bring a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> the vow takes effect and he brings a meal offering from wheat. He brings it <b>because one has</b> reason <b>to say</b> that he in fact intended to vow and then <b>retracted</b> his initial statement, <b>and</b> yet the vow takes effect in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai that one should <b>attend</b> only to <b>the initial statement</b> and his retraction is disregarded. <b>But even</b> if he vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from barley, where one has</b> reason <b>to say he made an error,</b> and had he known that a meal offering is not brought from barley, he would not have vowed at all, <b>nevertheless,</b> the vow takes effect and he must bring a meal offering, due to the principle: <b>Attend</b> only to <b>the first statement.</b>

Daf 103b

The Gemara cites another comment concerning the ruling in the mishna that a vow to bring a meal offering from barley takes effect: <b>Ze’eiri said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the first portion of one’s statement is accepted <b>only where he said</b> in his vow: <b>Meal offering [<i>minḥa</i>],</b> but not in the Hebrew construct where it is attached to the term: From barley [<i>minḥat se’orim</i>]. <b>But</b> if he did <b>not say</b> the word <b>meal offering</b> independently, but either said <i>minḥat se’orim</i> or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring barley, the vow does <b>not</b> take effect, and he does not bring a meal offering.
<b>Rav Naḥman was sitting and reciting this <i>halakha</i></b> of Ze’eiri. <b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the mishna: One who vows to bring a meal offering from regular <b>flour,</b> which is not used for a meal offering, <b>should bring</b> the meal offering from <b>fine flour. Is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he did not say:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering,</b> but rather said: It is incumbent upon me to bring regular flour? Apparently, the vow takes effect even if one did not state the term meal offering in an independent form. Rav Naḥman responded: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>where he said:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering</b> of regular flour.
Rava raised another, similar objection from the continuation of the mishna: With regard to one who vows to bring a meal offering <b>without oil and frankincense,</b> his vow takes effect, and <b>he shall bring</b> it with <b>oil and frankincense. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he did not say</b> the word <b>meal offering</b> in his vow, and yet it still takes effect? Rav Naḥman responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he said:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering</b> without oil or frankincense.
Rava asks again based on the mishna: If one vows to bring a meal offering of <b>half a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>he should bring a complete tenth</b> of an ephah. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he did not say</b> the term <b>meal offering</b> in his vow, and yet it still takes effect? Rav Naḥman responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he said:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering</b> of half a tenth of an ephah.
Rava asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that in all the cases in the mishna his vow included the term meal offering, <b>say the last clause:</b> If one vows to bring a meal offering of <b>a tenth and a half</b> of an ephah, <b>he should bring two</b> tenths. <b>Once he said</b> the term <b>meal offering, he is obligated in</b> bringing <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour. Therefore, <b>when he states</b> the words: <b>Half a tenth, he is not saying anything,</b> as he did not say the term meal offering with it, and would not have to bring two tenths. In what case is the ruling in the latter clause relevant?
Rav Naḥman answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case <b>where he said: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering of half a tenth and a tenth. Since he said</b> the term <b>meal offering, he is obligated in</b> bringing <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah for it. <b>When he said: Half a tenth, he is saying nothing,</b> since a meal offering is not brought with that amount of flour. <b>When he then said</b> the word <b>tenth,</b> he therefore <b>brings another tenth,</b> totaling two tenths.
Rava asks: <b>If so,</b> then when the mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> one <b>exempt</b> from bringing a meal offering in all these cases, <b>as he did not pledge in the manner of those who pledge, why</b> is this his opinion? Once he said the term meal offering, the vow should be valid. <b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion <b>according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that <b>the conclusion of a person’s statement is also accepted.</b> Therefore, even when he said the term meal offering at the beginning of the vow, since at the end he also made declarations that do not apply to a voluntary meal offering, the vow does not take effect.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>pledge a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of fine flour, <b>and bring</b> all sixty tenths <b>in one vessel. If he says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>sixty tenths</b> of an ephah, <b>he brings it in one vessel. If he says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of an ephah, <b>he brings sixty</b> tenths <b>in one vessel and one</b> tenth <b>in another vessel, as</b> the greatest number of tenths of an ephah that <b>the community brings</b> as meal offerings in one day is <b>on the first festival day of <i>Sukkot</i> when</b> it <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> when <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of an ephah of fine flour are brought.
It <b>is sufficient for an individual that</b> the maximum amount he can bring at once is <b>one</b> tenth of an ephah <b>less than</b> that of <b>the community.</b> When the first day of <i>Sukkot</i> occurs on Shabbat, thirteen bulls, two goats, and fourteen lambs are sacrificed as the additional offerings of <i>Sukkot</i>, two lambs are sacrificed as the daily offerings, and two lambs are sacrificed as the additional offering of Shabbat. Three tenths of an ephah are brought for each bull, two tenths for each goat, and a tenth for each lamb. Altogether, that is sixty-one tenths of an ephah.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> What is the relevance of the tenths of an ephah sacrificed on <i>Sukkot</i> that occurs on Shabbat? <b>Aren’t these</b> meal offerings <b>for bulls and those for lambs, and they are not mixed with each other</b> (see 89a)? <b>Rather,</b> the reason that one may not bring more than sixty tenths of an ephah in one vessel is because <b>up to sixty</b> tenths of fine flour can <b>be mixed</b> with one <i>log</i> of oil.
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Is it so that <b>sixty</b> tenths of flour <b>can be mixed</b> with a <i>log</i> of oil, <b>but sixty-one</b> tenths <b>cannot be mixed?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: All the measures of the Sages</b> are <b>so:</b> For example, <b>in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>one immerses</b> for purification, <b>and in</b> a ritual bath with <b>forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> the small measure of <b>a <i>kortov</i>, one cannot immerse in it</b> for purification.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>asked a question above,</b> i.e., in front of, <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Elai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> one <b>who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering of <b>sixty-one</b> tenths, <b>brings sixty</b> tenths <b>in one vessel and one</b> tenth <b>in another vessel?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Elai, the first speaker on every occasion, began</b> his speech <b>and said: Since we find</b> that the greatest number of tenths of an ephah that <b>the community brings</b> in one day is <b>on the first festival day of <i>Sukkot</i> when</b> it <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> when <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of fine flour are brought, it <b>is</b> therefore <b>sufficient for an individual that</b> the maximum amount he can bring at once is <b>one</b> tenth of an ephah <b>less than</b> that of <b>the community.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Aren’t these</b> meal offerings brought with <b>bulls and those</b> brought with <b>lambs?</b> Don’t <b>these,</b> the meal offerings brought with the bulls, have <b>a thick mixture,</b> as six <i>log</i> of oil are mixed with three tenths of an ephah of flour, <b>and those,</b> the meal offerings brought with the lambs, have <b>a thin mixture,</b> as three <i>log</i> of oil are mixed with a tenth of an ephah of flour? Isn’t <b>the mixture</b> of <b>these</b> meal offerings, the daily offering and the additional offerings, performed <b>in the morning, and the mixture</b> of <b>those</b> meal offerings, brought with the afternoon daily offering, performed in the <b>afternoon,</b> and isn’t it the case that <b>they are not mixed with one another?</b> The communal offerings cannot serve as precedent because they never bring sixty-one tenths in one vessel.
The Sages <b>said to him: You</b> should <b>state</b> a reason why a meal offering of more than sixty tenths of an ephah must be brought in more than one vessel. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: It says</b> in the Torah: <b>“And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry,</b> shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another” (Leviticus 7:10). <b>The Torah has already stated</b> here: <b>Bring a meal offering that is capable of being mixed.</b>
Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> Is it so that if the mixture consists <b>of sixty</b> tenths of flour, it can <b>be mixed</b> with a <i>log</i> of oil, <b>and</b> if it consists <b>of sixty-one</b> tenths, it <b>cannot be mixed?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>All the measures of the Sages are so: In</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>one immerses</b> for purification, and <b>in</b> a ritual bath with <b>forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> the small measure of <b>a <i>kortov</i>, one cannot immerse</b> and be purified.
Similarly, food in the volume of <b>an egg-bulk transmits the ritual impurity of food,</b> while food in the volume of <b>an egg-bulk less</b> a small amount equal to the volume of <b>a sesame</b> seed <b>does not transmit impurity of food.</b> Similarly, a garment that is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading</b> if a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] sits or lies on it, while if it is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>less one thread,</b> a tiny measurement, it <b>is not susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b>
The Gemara asks: Even <b>if</b> sixty tenths <b>do not mix</b> with one <i>log</i> of oil, <b>what of it? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that although there is a mitzva to mix the oil with the flour in a meal offering, <b>if he did not mix</b> them, it is still <b>valid?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> For <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing does not invalidate</b> the meal offering. Although there is a mitzva to mix the oil and the flour <i>ab initio</i>, the meal offering is fit for sacrifice even if the oil and the flour are not mixed. <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>not suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing invalidates</b> the meal offering.
The Gemara relates an incident involving halakhic measurements: <b>Rabbi Beivai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a mule</b> belonging <b>to the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>that died, and the Sages estimated</b> the amount of <b>its blood</b> that emerged <b>as a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, which is the minimum measurement for it to impart ritual impurity.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Bisna raises an objection: Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira testified</b> that they had a tradition <b>concerning the blood of</b> unslaughtered animal <b>carcasses that it is ritually pure.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira said: An incident</b> occurred where people <b>were killing wild donkeys</b> in order to feed the meat <b>to the lions</b> that were <b>in the king’s stadium [<i>be’istarya</i>], and</b> those <b>ascending to Jerusalem on the pilgrimage festival were wading up to their knees [<i>rekhuboteihen</i>] in</b> the donkeys’ <b>blood, and</b> the Sages <b>did not say anything to them</b> about them becoming impure. Apparently, the blood of an animal carcass does not transmit ritual impurity, even though the carcass itself does.
Rabbi Beivai <b>was silent</b> and did not answer. <b>Rabbi Zerika said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master does not respond</b> to the question? Rabbi Beivai <b>said to him: How can I respond to him?</b> My circumstances can be described <b>as Rabbi Ḥanin said</b> in interpreting the verse: “And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and you shall have no assurance of your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66). <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who purchases grain from one year for the next,</b> because he is not certain that he will find grain to eat in the next year.
<b>“And you shall fear night and day”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who purchases grain</b> from one <b>Shabbat eve to another</b> because he does not have the resources to provide for himself further. <b>“And you shall have no assurance of your life”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who relies on the baker [<i>hapalter</i>]</b> to give him bread because he has no grain of his own.

Daf 104a

Rabbi Beivai concludes: <b>And that man,</b> i.e., I, <b>relies on a baker.</b> Therefore, my mind is not sufficiently settled to answer the question properly.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this question? <b>Rav Yosef said: Rabbi Yehuda was the halakhic decisor of the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, and he instructed</b> them <b>according to his tradition</b> that the blood of an animal carcass is impure.
<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>six matters are among the leniencies of Beit Shammai and among the stringencies of Beit Hillel.</b> They include <b>the blood of a carcass,</b> which <b>Beit Shammai deem ritually pure,</b> as in their opinion only the flesh of a carcass imparts impurity; <b>and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>ritually impure. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said: Even when Beit Hillel deemed</b> it <b>impure, they deemed</b> it <b>impure only</b> when it is <b>in</b> the quantity of at least <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, <b>since</b> that amount, were it <b>to congeal, could constitute an olive-bulk,</b> which is the minimum amount of the flesh of a carcass that is deemed impure.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not pledge</b> a libation of one <b><i>log</i>, two</b> <i>log</i>, <b>or five</b> <i>log</i> of wine, because there are no existing libations with those measures of wine. <b>But one pledges</b> a libation of <b>three</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a lamb, <b>or four</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a ram, <b>or six</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a bull. <b>And</b> one may pledge a libation of <b>six</b> <i>log</i> <b>and beyond,</b> as any greater amount can be composed of combinations of these three.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is there a fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> in that when one vows to bring a certain number of <i>log</i> of wine they are not offered separately, <b>or is there no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> and it is permitted to divide them and offer them in smaller amounts?
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> It is a case <b>where he brought five</b> <i>log</i> of wine. <b>If you say</b> that <b>there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> then <b>he removes and offers four of them, as</b> those <b>are suitable for</b> the libations of <b>a ram, and the other</b> <i>log</i>, which is not of sufficient volume, <b>is</b> allocated for communal <b>gift</b> offerings. Either it itself is offered, or it is redeemed and the money is used to buy offerings for the repletion of the altar, i.e., for times when the altar is idle. But <b>if you say</b> that <b>there is a fixed</b> amount <b>for libations</b> and the wine may not be divided and offered separately, then it <b>is not offered</b> itself or redeemed with money and offered <b>until he adds to</b> the existing measurement such that the total number of <i>log</i> may be offered as an independent libation.
<b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the answer from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:5): There were <b>six</b> collection horns <b>for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings, <b>and we say: For what</b> were they <b>designated?</b> They were designated <b>for</b> funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of <b>sin offerings,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from <b>the</b> purchase of <b>guilt offerings,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from <b>the</b> purchase of a <b>guilt offering of a nazirite,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of the <b>guilt offering of a leper,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of <b>pairs</b> of birds, and for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of the <b>meal offering of a sinner.</b>
<b>And if it is so</b> that there is no fixed amount for libations, and if one vowed to bring five <i>log</i> then four are offered as a ram’s libation and the fifth can be redeemed and its money used for a communal gift offering, then <b>let them institute an additional</b> collection <b>horn</b> in the Temple for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase <b>of libations.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> six horns are dedicated to funds that <b>go to communal gift offerings,</b> and <b>these</b> <i>log</i> of wine left over from libations <b>are common,</b> so there is no need to store them, since it is <b>possible</b> that the libation <b>of this person</b> will <b>be combined with</b> the libation of another <b>person together</b> in order to reach the desired amount, <b>and</b> then it <b>is offered</b> immediately. Therefore, no additional horn was necessary for the money from the redemption of libations.
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to libations: “All that are <b>home born</b> shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Numbers 15:13). As this verse is superfluous, the various terms in it are used to derive <i>halakhot</i>. The term <b>“home born” teaches that one may pledge libations</b> even when they are not sacrificed together with an offering. <b>And how much</b> is the minimum volume that is offered? <b>Three <i>log</i>,</b> which is the smallest measurement of a libation in the Torah, i.e., the libation that is offered with a lamb.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one desires to add</b> to this amount <b>he may add? The verse states</b> with regard to libations associated with the additional offerings for the New Moon: “And their libations: Half a <i>hin</i> of wine <b>shall be</b> for the bull, and one-third of a <i>hin</i> for the ram, and one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> for the lamb” (Numbers 28:14). From the superfluous “shall be” one may understand that there are others, and derive that independent libations may also be brought. <b>Can</b> one <b>decrease</b> the amount of wine in a libation to less than three <i>log</i>? <b>The verse states:</b> “All that are home born shall do these things, <b>in this manner”</b> (Numbers 15:13), i.e., one may not bring less than three <i>log</i> of wine.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says that <b>one may add</b> to the minimum of three <i>log</i> for an independent libation? <b>If we say</b> it means that it is permitted to offer <b>four or six</b> <i>log</i>, then <b>what is different</b> about <b>three</b> <i>log</i> that it was specified? It is <b>because it is suitable for</b> the libations of <b>a lamb.</b> If so, then <b>four or six</b> <i>log</i> are <b>also suitable,</b> as four <i>log</i> is offered as the libation <b>for a ram and</b> six <i>log</i> is offered as the libation for <b>a bull. Rather,</b> in saying that one may add, <b>isn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> referring to <b>five</b> <i>log</i> of wine, despite the fact that it is not a measurement used with any of the offerings? <b>And learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations.</b> The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is so.
<b>Rav Ashi said: But didn’t we learn this</b> in the mishna: <b>One does not pledge</b> a libation of one <b><i>log</i>, two</b> <i>log</i>, <b>or five</b> <i>log</i> of wine? Rav Ashi continues: In phrasing the mishna in this manner, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that the status of <b>five</b> <i>log</i> is <b>similar</b> to the status <b>of two</b> <i>log</i>: <b>Just as two</b> <i>log</i> <b>are not suitable at all</b> to be offered independently, <b>so too, five</b> <i>log</i> are <b>also not suitable at all</b> to offer, as there are no libations of this size. This demonstrates that there is a fixed amount to libations, and one may not divide them into two.
The Gemara responds: <b>Are the cases comparable? This,</b> two <i>log</i>, is <b>as it is, and that,</b> five <i>log</i>, is <b>as it is,</b> and there is no reason to compare them. Four of the five <i>log</i> are offered, with the fifth allocated for a communal gift offering.
<b>Abaye said: If you say</b> that <b>there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations, then there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> and no further discussion is necessary. <b>If you say</b> that <b>there is a fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> then the <i>halakha</i> of <b>up to ten</b> <i>log</i> of wine is <b>obvious to me.</b> One <i>log</i>, two <i>log</i>, or five <i>log</i> may not be brought, since these amounts are not offered as standard libations, but three, four, or six <i>log</i> are brought, as their amount is equivalent to those of standard libations. Between six and ten <i>log</i> may also be brought, since these amounts can be composed of a combination of the various wine libations. With regard to <b>eleven</b> <i>log</i>,

Daf 104b

<b>I ask, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does <b>the man</b> who vowed to bring eleven <i>log</i> <b>intend</b> to bring an amount of wine corresponding to that which is brought in association with an offering <b>of two bulls,</b> i.e., twelve <i>log</i>, <b>and until he accumulates that</b> amount, the libation <b>is not brought? Or perhaps he intends</b> to bring an amount equal to that associated <b>with two rams and one lamb,</b> i.e., four for each ram and three for the lamb, totaling eleven. <b>Do we say</b> that he intended to bring <b>two</b> libations associated <b>with one type,</b> i.e., a ram, <b>and one</b> libation associated <b>with another type,</b> i.e., a lamb, <b>or not? What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may pledge</b> to bring independent libations of <b>wine, but one may not pledge oil</b> alone; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Tarfon says: One may pledge oil</b> as well.
<b>Rabbi Tarfon said: Just as we found that wine comes</b> as <b>an obligation and comes</b> as <b>a gift offering</b> independent of any offering, <b>so too,</b> we find <b>that oil comes</b> as <b>an obligation and comes</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, if you said</b> that this is true <b>with regard to wine, as</b> it is <b>sacrificed with its obligatory</b> offering <b>by itself, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is also the case <b>with regard to oil, which is never sacrificed with its obligatory</b> offering <b>by itself but only</b> mixed with the flour?
The mishna concludes with a ruling concerning a voluntary meal offering: <b>Two</b> people <b>do not pledge</b> a meal offering of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah as partners, <b>but they may pledge a burnt offering and a peace offering. And</b> they may pledge to bring even <b>an individual bird,</b> not only a pair.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva about whether one can pledge oil, <b>Rava said: From the statements of both of them, we learn</b> that <b>a person may pledge a meal offering</b> like those brought <b>with the libations</b> that accompany animal offerings every day.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: It needed to be said, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> the nature of <b>a voluntary meal offering</b> (see Leviticus, chapter 2). Perhaps only <b>those five meal offerings</b> detailed there are <b>indeed</b> brought as voluntary offerings, but any <b>additional</b> types, such as a meal offering brought with libations, are <b>not.</b> Rava therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <b>these matters</b> in the Torah apply only <b>where</b> his pledge of a meal offering was <b>unspecified, but where he specified</b> that the oil and flour about which he vows should be brought in the manner of a meal offering with libations, then <b>he has specified,</b> and the vow takes effect.
§ The mishna stated that <b>two</b> people <b>do not pledge</b> a tenth of an ephah together. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when an individual <b>brings</b> a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), in the singular, that is not a proof, as with regard to <b>a burnt offering as well, it is written</b> in the singular: “When any man of you <b>brings</b> an offering” (Leviticus 1:2). Nevertheless, two people may bring a burnt offering together, as stated in the mishna.
<b>Rather, what is the reason</b> that <b>a burnt offering</b> is brought by two people? The reason is <b>that it is written</b> in second person plural: “These you shall offer…beside <b>your burnt offerings [<i>le’oloteikhem</i>],</b> or your meal offerings, or your drink offerings, or your peace offerings” (Numbers 29:39). The Gemara points out: With regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> it is <b>also written</b> in the plural: <b>“Your meal offerings [<i>leminḥoteikhem</i>].” Rather,</b> the reason that one may not bring a meal offering as a partnership is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when <b>an individual</b> brings a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), indicating that only one individual may offer it, but not two together.
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>states</b> an explanation of the following verse: “Anyone <b>that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will offerings that they sacrifice to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). It is evident from the use of the plural in the second part of the verse that <b>any</b> offering can <b>be brought in a partnership, and the verse excludes only a meal offering</b> from this principle, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And when <b>an individual</b> brings a meal offering.”
The Gemara cites another comment about the fact that the Torah introduces the voluntary meal offering by emphasizing that it is brought by an individual. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: For what</b> reason <b>is the meal offering different</b> from other offerings in <b>that</b> the term <b>“an individual [<i>nefesh</i>]” is stated with regard to it? The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Whose practice</b> is it <b>to bring a meal offering?</b> It is that of a <b>poor</b> individual; and <b>I will ascribe him</b> credit <b>as if he offered up his soul [<i>nafsho</i>] in front of Me.</b>
§ The Gemara cites another comment made by Rabbi Yitzḥak about meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What is</b> the reason that the <b>meal offering is differentiated</b> from other offerings in <b>that</b> the Torah <b>stated these five types of preparations with oil</b> with regard to it? The five types of voluntary meal offerings are: A meal offering of fine flour, a meal offering in a shallow pan, a meal offering in a deep pan, a meal offering of loaves baked in an oven, and a meal offering of wafers baked in an oven. All are brought with oil. This can be explained by <b>a parable of a flesh-and-blood king whose friend made a festive meal for him, but</b> the king <b>knows that</b> the friend <b>is poor.</b> The king <b>said to him: Make for me</b> foods <b>from five types of fried</b> dishes, <b>so that I may benefit from you.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah for a meal offering, <b>must bring</b> a meal offering of <b>one</b>-tenth. If he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>tenths</b> of an ephah, <b>he must bring two</b>-tenths, as that is the minimum plural amount. If he says: <b>I specified</b> several tenths of an ephah <b>but I do not know which</b> number <b>I specified, he must bring sixty-tenths,</b> as that is the maximum amount of a meal offering. The flour beyond the amount that he actually specified is rendered a voluntary meal offering.
If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering, he may bring whichever</b> meal offering <b>that he wishes,</b> i.e., the fine-flour meal offering, the shallow-pan or deep-pan meal offering, or the meal offering baked in an oven in the form of loaves or wafers. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He must bring the fine-flour meal offering, as it is the</b> most <b>notable of the meal offerings.</b>
If one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering, or:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a type of meal offering, he must bring one</b> meal offering. If he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>meal offerings, or:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>meal offerings of</b> a certain <b>type, he must bring two.</b> If he says: <b>I specified</b> a meal offering <b>but I do not know which</b> meal offering <b>I specified, he must bring all five</b> types of meal offerings.
If one says: <b>I specified a meal offering of tenths</b> of an ephah <b>but I do not know how many</b> tenths <b>I specified, he must bring</b> a meal offering of <b>sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> His obligation is satisfied only when <b>he brings meal offerings of</b> all sizes, in increments of <b>tenths</b> of an ephah, ranging <b>from one</b>-tenth of an ephah <b>to sixty</b>-tenths, for a total of sixty meal offerings with a total volume of 1,830 tenths of an ephah, or 183 ephahs. He fulfills his vow with one of the meal offerings, and the rest are rendered voluntary meal offerings.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a tenth of an ephah for a meal offering, must bring a meal offering of a tenth. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> Why is it necessary to teach this in the mishna? The Gemara answers that it <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to mention this case as a preamble to the following <i>halakha</i>, that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>tenths</b> of an ephah he must <b>bring two</b>-tenths. The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>this also obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach that the <b>minimum</b> amount that the word <b>tenths</b> is used in reference to is <b>two</b>-tenths.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>I specified</b> several tenths of an ephah <b>but I do not know what</b> number <b>I specified, he must bring sixty-tenths.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this?
<b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> This statement is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi mentioned at the end of the mishna. <b>As if</b> it was the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>didn’t he say</b> that such a person <b>must bring meal offerings of</b> all sizes, in increments of <b>tenths</b> of an ephah, ranging <b>from one</b>-tenth of an ephah <b>to sixty</b>-tenths?
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed and <b>said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that this statement is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, because the case at the end of the mishna is a case where one specified that he would bring the tenths of an ephah in a single vessel. In such a case Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that one must bring sixty different amounts in sixty different vessels. By contrast, the former case in the mishna is one <b>where</b> the person <b>says: I specified</b> several <b>tenths</b> of an ephah <b>but I did not establish</b> that <b>they</b> must be brought <b>in</b> one <b>vessel.</b> In such a case all agree <b>that he must bring sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah <b>in sixty vessels,</b> a tenth in each vessel.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> holds <b>he may bring whichever</b> meal offering <b>he wishes,</b> whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that he must bring the fine-flour meal offering, as it is the most notable of the meal offerings. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda says that he must bring the fine-flour meal offering, <b>since</b> in the passage of the Torah that discusses the meal offering (Leviticus, chapter 2) <b>the verse opens with</b> the fine-flour meal offering <b>first,</b> mentioning it before the other meal offerings.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so, one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering,</b> without specifying which type of animal, <b>must bring a young bull</b> as his burnt offering, <b>since the verse opens with it</b>

Daf 105a

<b>first,</b> in the passage discussing burnt offerings (see Leviticus 1:3).
Similarly, one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering <b>from the flock, must bring a lamb</b> as his burnt offering, <b>since the verse opens with it first</b> in the passage discussing burnt offerings of the flock, as it is stated: “And if his offering is of the flock, whether of the lambs, or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish” (Leviticus 1:10).
Similarly, one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering <b>from</b> a type of <b>bird, must bring doves</b> as his burnt offering, <b>since the verse opens with it first</b> in the passage discussing burnt offerings of birds, as it is stated: “And if his offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of doves or of pigeons” (Leviticus 1:14).
If so, <b>why did we learn</b> in a mishna (107a): One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering, must bring a lamb,</b> which is the least expensive land animal sacrificed as an offering. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> He may bring either <b>a dove or pigeon</b> as a bird burnt offering. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not disagree.</b>
The Gemara provides a new interpretation: <b>Rather, what</b> does Rabbi Yehuda mean when he says that the fine-flour meal offering is the most <b>notable of the meal offerings?</b> He means <b>that it has no modifier.</b> Only a fine-flour offering is referred to simply as a meal offering, with no other qualification.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>says</b> that one must bring a fine-flour meal offering <b>since the verse opens with it first?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Which meal offering</b> is the most <b>notable of the meal offerings, as it has no modifier?</b> It is <b>this,</b> i.e., the fine-flour meal offering, <b>with which the verse opens first.</b> The reason that Rabbi Yehuda holds that one must bring a fine-flour meal offering is not because the verse opens with it, but because it has no modifier.
The Gemara challenges: If so, the explanation of the <i>baraita</i> is unnecessary; isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is referring to <b>the fine-flour meal offering,</b> as <b>he says</b> so explicitly? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> explains that the reference to the meal offering with which the passage opens <b>merely</b> serves as <b>a mnemonic,</b> so one should not forget which type of meal offering Rabbi Yehuda is referring to.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering,</b> or: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a type of meal offering,</b> he must bring one meal offering. This is because he stated his intent in the singular. But if he says in the plural: It is incumbent upon me to bring meal offerings, or: Meal offerings of a certain type, he must bring two meal offerings. <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>types of a meal offering,</b> using a combination of singular and plural forms, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara explains the dilemma: Perhaps it should be reasoned that <b>since he said: Types,</b> in the plural, apparently <b>he was saying</b> that he intends to bring <b>two</b> meal offerings. <b>And</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the reason he used the singular word: <b>Meal offering?</b> He used it <b>because the entire</b> category of <b>meal offerings is also referred to as: Meal offering,</b> in the singular, <b>as it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And this is the law of the meal offering:</b> The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7).
<b>Or perhaps</b> it should be reasoned that <b>since he said: Meal offering,</b> in the singular, apparently <b>he was saying</b> that he intends to bring only <b>one meal offering. And</b> if so, <b>what</b> did he mean by using the plural phrase: <b>Types of a meal offering? This</b> is what <b>he was saying: Of</b> the various <b>types of a meal offering,</b> it is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>one.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that his intent is to bring two meal offerings, from that which is stated in the mishna: If one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering,</b> or: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a type of meal offering, he must bring one. This</b> indicates that if he said: <b>Types of a meal offering,</b> he must bring <b>two.</b>
The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>Say the latter clause:</b> If one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>meal offerings,</b> or: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>meal offerings of</b> a certain <b>type, he must bring two. This</b> indicates that if he says: <b>Types of a meal offering,</b> he must bring only <b>one. Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> mishna, as the potential inferences are contradictory.
The Gemara suggests another resolution to Rav Pappa’s dilemma: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If one says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>meal offerings of</b> a certain <b>type, he must bring two meal offerings of one type. This</b> indicates that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>of</b> the various <b>types of a meal offering,</b> he is required to bring only <b>one.</b>
The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>Perhaps</b> the correct inference from the <i>baraita</i> is that <b>this</b> indicates that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>types of a meal offering, he must bring two meal offerings, of two</b> different <b>types.</b>
The Gemara challenges the rejection. <b>But this is not taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, as the full <i>baraita</i> reads as follows: If one says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>meal offerings of</b> a certain <b>type, he must bring two meal offerings of one type.</b> If he says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>types of meal offerings, he must bring two meal offerings, of two</b> different <b>types. This</b> indicates that if he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>types of a meal offering,</b> he brings only <b>one.</b>
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> is not in accordance with all opinions; rather, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> with regard to one who vows to bring a meal offering baked in an oven that if he wants to bring <b>half</b> of the meal offering as <b>loaves and half</b> of it as <b>wafers, he may bring</b> it in that manner. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Types of a meal offering?</b> It means <b>a meal offering that has two types</b> of baked dough. Therefore, bringing one such meal offering is sufficient.
<b>But</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that if one wishes to bring <b>half</b> of the meal offering as <b>loaves and half</b> of it as <b>wafers, he may not bring</b> it in this manner, as they hold that all of the baked items in a meal offering must be of the same type, <b>he</b> consequently <b>must bring two meal offerings of two</b> different <b>types.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>I specified</b> a meal offering <b>but I do not know what</b> meal offering <b>I specified, he must bring all five</b> types of meal offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. As, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, since he said</b> that if one wants to bring <b>half</b> of his baked meal offering as <b>loaves and half</b> of it as <b>wafers he may bring</b> it in that manner, why does one have to bring only five meal offerings to cover all possible vows that he may have made? He should be required to bring several meal offerings baked in an oven to cover all the possible combinations of loaves and wafers.
Therefore, <b>even if</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>all meal offerings are brought</b> as <b>ten</b> items, as opposed to the opinion of Rabbi Meir that all meal offerings are brought as twelve items, <b>there is</b> cause <b>for uncertainty,</b> which renders <b>fourteen</b> different <b>meal offerings</b> necessary. In addition to the shallow-pan meal offering, the deep-pan meal offering, and the fine-flour meal offering, there are another eleven combinations of baked meal offering that he may have intended. He may have intended to bring ten loaves, or ten wafers, or one loaf and nine wafers, two loaves and eight wafers, three loaves and seven wafers, and so forth.
<b>Abaye</b> rejected Rabbi Yirmeya’s explanation and <b>said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. We have heard that Rabbi Shimon said:</b> One who is uncertain whether he is obligated to bring a certain offering <b>may bring</b> the offering <b>and stipulate</b> that if he is obligated to bring an offering, this is his offering, and if he is not obligated, it is a voluntary offering. Therefore, in the case of the mishna, one can bring the five types of meal offerings, with his baked meal offering including ten loaves and ten wafers, and stipulate that whichever items were included in his vow serve as fulfillment of his obligation, and all the others are voluntary offerings.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nazir</i> 6:1): How should one whose status as a leper is uncertain bring his guilt offering and <i>log</i> of oil on the eighth day of his purification? <b>Rabbi Shimon says: On the following day,</b> after his seven days of purification, <b>he brings his guilt offering and his <i>log</i></b> of oil

Daf 105b

<b>with it and says</b> the following stipulation: <b>If this</b> offering is one <b>of a leper,</b> i.e., if I am a leper, <b>this is his guilt offering and that is his <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>And if</b> I am <b>not</b> a leper, <b>this</b> animal that I brought for <b>a guilt offering</b> shall be <b>a gift peace offering,</b> because their sacrificial rites are equivalent.
<b>And that</b> uncertain <b>guilt offering requires slaughter in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, as does a guilt offering; <b>and placement</b> of the blood on the right <b>thumb, and</b> right <b>big toe,</b> and right ear of the leper, as described in Leviticus 14:14; <b>and</b> it requires <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the animal, <b>and</b> the accompanying wine <b>libations, and waving of the breast and thigh,</b> as does a peace offering. <b>And it is eaten by males of the priesthood for</b> one <b>day and</b> the following <b>night</b> like a guilt offering, and not for two days and the intervening night like a peace offering.
The Gemara relates to the problem that arises from this stipulation, as treating an offering as two different types of offerings due to a stipulation can cause a situation where an offering is unduly disqualified. In the case of an offering that is sacrificed as both a peace offering and a guilt offering, if its meat is not eaten by dawn of the following day, it is disqualified, even though it might be a peace offering, which can be eaten for another day. The Gemara comments: <b>And even though a Sage resolves</b> this issue <b>in</b> the tractate of: <b>The slaughter of sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>, in a manner that would not enable a stipulation to be made in this case (see 76b), there is a distinction between the case discussed there and the case discussed here.
The resolution given there was: <b>Say that Rabbi Shimon said</b> that in a case of uncertainty <b>one may bring</b> an offering <b>and stipulate</b> with regard to its type <b><i>ab initio</i></b> only <b>for the remedy of a man,</b> e.g., in order to purify a person from his uncertain status as a leper, as there is no other way for him to purify himself. <b>But in general, after the fact,</b> after uncertainty arose with regard to the status of a certain offering it is <b>indeed</b> permitted to sacrifice the offering in a manner that may reduce the amount of time allotted for eating it, but one may <b>not</b> consecrate such an offering <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>
The Gemara explains why here it would nevertheless be permitted to make the stipulation <i>ab initio</i>: Nevertheless, <b>this statement</b> that one may stipulate with regard to an offering only after the fact applies only <b>to a peace offering, as</b> sacrificing it as a guilt offering <b>reduces its</b> allotted time for <b>eating, which</b> may bring <b>sacrificial</b> meat <b>to the status of disqualification. But</b> stipulation with regard to <b>meal offerings</b> when one does not remember which type he vowed to bring is permitted <b>even <i>ab initio</i>,</b> as this does not reduce its allotted time for eating. Therefore, the mishna could be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> How can you explain that the mishna could be in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that if one wants to bring <b>half</b> of his baked meal offering as <b>loaves and half</b> of it as <b>wafers he may bring</b> it in that manner, as one can bring a meal offering of ten loaves and ten wafers and stipulate that some of them are brought in order to fulfill his obligation and the rest are a voluntary offering? This cannot be, as the twenty loaves and wafers constitute a total of two-tenths of an ephah in volume, and must therefore be sanctified in two separate service vessels. This causes a situation where <b>one brings one-tenth</b> of an ephah, which constitutes one meal offering as fulfillment of the individual’s obligation, <b>from two</b> separate <b>tenths</b> of an ephah. <b>And</b> similarly, the two meal offerings require two <i>log</i> of oil, each of which is sanctified in a separate vessel, and it turns out that each meal offering includes <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>from two</b> separate <b><i>log</i>.</b>
Abaye answered: This is not difficult, as <b>we have heard that Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>if one brought one-tenth</b> of an ephah as a meal offering <b>from two</b> separate <b>tenths, and</b> similarly, if one brought <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>from two</b> separate <b><i>log</i>, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.
The Gemara asks: <b>But how does one remove a handful</b> from this meal offering, which consists of both loaves and wafers? The Gemara answers <b>that he stipulates and says: If</b> I specified in my vow that I would bring <b>loaves only, or</b> similarly if <b>I said</b> that I would bring <b>wafers only, let the handful that I remove from the loaves be for the loaves,</b> and <b>let the handful that I remove from the wafers be for the wafers. If I said</b> in my vow that I would bring a meal offering that is <b>half wafers and half loaves, let the handful that I remove from the loaves be for half the loaves and half the wafers, and let the handful that I remove from the wafers be for half the wafers and half the loaves.</b>
The Gemara challenges this suggestion: <b>But</b> if the vow was to bring a meal offering that is half loaves and half wafers, <b>it requires removing one handful from the loaves</b>

Daf 106a

<b>and wafers</b> together; <b>and</b> according to this suggestion, <b>he removes a handful from the loaves for the wafers and</b> a handful <b>from the wafers for the loaves.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>We have heard that Rabbi Shimon said: If</b> one brought a meal offering that is part loaves and part wafers, and the priest <b>removed a handful, and</b> that which <b>came up in his hand</b> was only <b>from one of the two</b> types, either only loaves or only wafers, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation of removing a handful.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> a problem with <b>the surplus oil?</b> The Gemara (75a) states that if a meal offering is brought half as loaves and half as wafers, the oil is divided equally between them; half is mixed with the loaves and half is applied to the wafers. The surplus oil from the wafers may also be mixed in with the loaves. But if the meal offering is baked entirely as wafers, the oil that remains is given to the priests. Therefore, Abaye’s explanation of the mishna is problematic, <b>because if</b> the person <b>said</b> in his vow that he would bring <b>half loaves and half wafers, one brings back the surplus oil</b> and mixes it in <b>with the loaves.</b> But <b>if he said</b> that <b>the entire</b> offering shall be <b>wafers, the surplus oil</b> should be <b>eaten by the priests.</b>
The Gemara resolves this problem <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon</b> that the oil of a meal offering baked half as loaves and half as wafers is applied as follows: <b>One anoints</b> the wafers <b>in the shape of</b> the Greek letter <b>chi,</b> Χ, <b>and the surplus oil is eaten by the priests.</b> Consequently, the surplus oil of a meal offering baked half as loaves and half as wafers is used the same way as that of a meal offering baked entirely as wafers.
§ <b>Rav Kahana said to Rav Ashi:</b> If one specifies in his vow which meal offering he will bring, and subsequently forgets, why does he bring only five types of meal offerings? <b>Isn’t there</b> room <b>to be uncertain</b> with regard to another type of meal offering, namely, the <b>meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany various burnt offerings? This meal offering can also be brought independently as a gift, <b>as Rava said: A person may volunteer a meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations every day,</b> if he so wishes.
The Gemara answers that there is no uncertainty with regard to the possibility that he said that he would bring a meal offering brought with the libations, because it is completely different than the other types of meal offerings. <b>When one is uncertain</b> as to which meal offering he vowed to bring, the uncertainty is only with regard to certain meal offerings. The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for these differences: <b>Individual, due to, frankincense, with a <i>log</i>, removes a handful of it.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: The uncertainty with regard to which meal offering one vowed to bring is with regard to a meal offering that <b>is brought</b> exclusively <b>due to</b> the obligation of <b>an individual.</b> But <b>one is not uncertain</b> with regard to a meal offering that <b>is brought due to</b> the obligation of <b>the public,</b> e.g., a meal offering brought with libations, which accompany communal offerings as well as individual ones; he certainly did not vow to bring this type of meal offering.
Furthermore, <b>when one is uncertain</b> it is with regard to a meal offering that <b>is brought due to its own</b> obligation. But <b>one is not uncertain</b> with regard to a meal offering <b>brought</b> with libations <b>due to</b> the requirements of <b>an offering.</b>
<b>When one is uncertain</b> it is with regard to a meal offering that <b>requires</b> that <b>frankincense</b> be brought with it. But <b>one is not uncertain</b> with regard to a meal offering brought with libations, <b>which does not require frankincense.</b>
<b>When one is uncertain,</b> it is with regard to a type of meal offering that <b>is brought with</b> one <b><i>log</i></b> of oil. But <b>one is not uncertain</b> if it <b>is brought with three <i>log</i></b> of oil or more, which is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to meal offerings brought with libations (see Numbers 15:5–6, 9).
<b>When one is uncertain</b> it is only with regard to a meal offering that <b>requires removal of a handful.</b> But <b>one is not uncertain</b> with regard to a meal offering <b>that does not require removal of a handful,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering brought with libations.
§ The mishna teaches: If one says: <b>I specified a meal offering of tenths</b> of an ephah but I do not remember how many I specified, according to the Rabbis he must bring a meal offering of sixty-tenths of an ephah. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi he must bring sixty meal offerings, each with a different number of tenths, from one to sixty.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one says: <b>I specified</b> that I would bring <b>a meal offering, and I established</b> that they must be brought <b>in</b> one <b>vessel of tenths</b> of an ephah, <b>but I do not know what</b> number of tenths <b>I specified, he must bring</b> one <b>meal offering of sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah. This is <b>the statement of the Rabbis. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He must bring</b> sixty <b>meal offerings of tenths</b> in sixty vessels, each containing an amount <b>from one</b>-tenth <b>until sixty</b>-tenths, <b>which are</b> in total <b>1,830</b> tenths of an ephah.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If one said: <b>I specified</b> a certain type of meal offering with a certain number of tenths of an ephah to be brought in one vessel, <b>but I do not know what I specified, or which</b> type <b>of</b> meal offering <b>I specified, and I do not know how many</b> tenths of an ephah <b>I specified, he must bring</b> the <b>five</b> different types <b>of meal offerings,</b> and each one must contain <b>sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah, <b>which are</b> in total <b>three-hundred-</b>tenths of an ephah. This is <b>the statement of the Rabbis. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He must bring five</b> different types of <b>meal offerings,</b> and for each type he must bring <b>sixty</b> meal offerings, each with a different number of tenths, <b>from one until sixty, which are</b> in total <b>9,150</b> tenths of an ephah.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagree? Rav Ḥisda said: They disagree with regard to</b> whether it is <b>permitted to bring non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>it is prohibited to bring non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to bring sixty meal offerings of each type, as if one merely brings one meal offering of sixty-tenths of an ephah in a single vessel, he may be in violation of this prohibition, as it is possible that he vowed to bring less than that amount, and the surplus amount is non-sacred. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>it is permitted to bring non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Therefore, even if the meal offering is of a greater volume than necessary, it is inconsequential.
<b>Rava said</b> that the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is with regard to a different issue: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that <b>it is prohibited to bring non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether it is permitted <b>to mix</b> an offering that fulfills <b>an obligation</b> together <b>with a gift</b> offering.
<b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>it is permitted to mix</b> an offering that fulfills <b>an obligation</b> together <b>with a gift</b> offering, and therefore one may bring sixty-tenths in one vessel and stipulate that the amount beyond his obligation will be a gift offering. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>it is prohibited to mix</b> an offering that fulfills <b>an obligation</b> together <b>with a gift</b> offering, and therefore one cannot make such a stipulation; every possible meal offering requires its own vessel. Concerning each vessel, he stipulates that if this one can fulfill his vow, it should count as fulfillment of his vow, and otherwise it should serve as a gift offering.
<b>Abaye said to Rava: According to the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>it is permitted to mix</b> an offering that fulfills <b>an obligation</b> together <b>with a gift</b> offering, and one vessel with sixty-tenths of an ephah can serve in part to fulfill the obligation and in part as a gift offering, there is a difficulty: <b>Don’t we require</b> the removal of <b>two handfuls,</b> one for the obligatory meal offering and one for the gift offering? Rava answered: According to the Rabbis, it is required <b>that</b> the priest <b>removes a handful and again removes a handful.</b>
Abaye said to Rava: <b>But</b> if so, since the tenths that fulfill an obligation and the tenths that are a gift are mixed together in a single vessel, when the priest removes a handful, <b>isn’t he removing a handful from</b> tenths that fulfill <b>an obligation</b> to account <b>for</b> tenths that are <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>and</b> removing a handful <b>from</b> tenths that are <b>a gift</b> offering to account <b>for</b> tenths that fulfill <b>an obligation?</b>
Rava answered Abaye: This is not difficult, <b>as</b> the one who brings the meal offering <b>renders it dependent on the intent of the priest, as he says: Wherever the priest’s hand reaches now,</b> when he removes the first handful, shall be the location of the tenths that fulfill my <b>obligation, and</b> wherever his hand reaches <b>at the end,</b> when removing the second handful, shall be <b>a gift</b> offering.
Abaye asked Rava: <b>But how does</b> the priest <b>burn</b> the handful upon the altar? If the priest <b>will burn</b> the handful from the <b>gift</b> offering <b>first, how can he</b> then <b>burn</b> the handful <b>of the</b> tenths that fulfill the <b>obligation? Perhaps the entire</b> meal offering <b>is</b> for the <b>obligation,</b> as the vow was to bring sixty-tenths of an ephah, and everything apart from the first handful, including the second handful, is the remainder, <b>and</b> by burning part of it the priest causes <b>the remainder to be lacking.</b>
<b>And the Master said:</b> With regard to the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>that became lacking between the removal of the handful and the burning</b> of the handful upon the altar, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>one does not burn the handful on its</b> account, as it is not considered a valid meal offering.
Alternatively, if the priest <b>will burn</b> the handful that fulfills the <b>obligation first, how can he burn</b> the handful <b>of the gift</b> offering?

Daf 106b

<b>But perhaps</b> the vow was to bring sixty-tenths of an ephah, in which case <b>the entire</b> meal offering <b>is</b> necessary to fulfill the <b>obligation.</b> Consequently, only one handful may be removed, and all the rest is considered the remainder. <b>And</b> there is a principle: <b>Whatever is partly</b> burned <b>in the fire</b> on the altar <b>is subject to</b> the prohibition of: <b>You may not make as an offering</b> (see Leviticus 2:11). This principle states that if part of an item, such as the blood of an animal offering or the handful of a meal offering, has been sacrificed, one who sacrifices any other part of it that is not designated for sacrifice has violated a prohibition. In this case, the second handful is considered part of the remainder of the meal offering, and burning it is prohibited.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, said:</b> The priest does not burn the oil as an offering but <b>burns it for the sake of wood,</b> i.e., not as a sacrificial rite, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The verse states: “No meal offering that you shall bring unto the Lord shall be made with leaven; for you shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke from it as an offering made by fire unto the Lord. As an offering of first fruits you may bring them unto the Lord; but they shall not come up for a pleasing aroma on the altar” (Leviticus 2:11–12). This verse indicates that <b>you may not offer up</b> leaven and honey <b>as a pleasing aroma,</b> i.e., as an offering. <b>But you may offer up</b> leaven and honey and other substances <b>for the sake of wood,</b> not as an offering.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: But perhaps everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted to mix</b> an offering that fulfills <b>an obligation</b> together <b>with a gift</b> offering, <b>and here</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that it is permitted to burn on the altar as fuel even items that are prohibited from being burned as offerings. <b>As the Rabbis accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> and therefore they allow one to bring one meal offering of sixty-tenths of an ephah, since the handful removed from it may be burned, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This cannot be the dispute, as <b>if it enters your mind</b> that <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>it is permitted to mix</b> an offering brought as <b>an obligation</b> together <b>with a gift</b> offering, <b>and he does not accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would not require sixty separate vessels. Instead, <b>one could bring sixty-</b>tenths of an ephah <b>in one vessel, and one</b> additional tenth <b>in one</b> other <b>vessel,</b> from which the handful of the gift offering would be removed. <b>And</b> he could <b>touch them,</b> i.e., place them so they touch each other, so that they are considered as one, <b>and</b> the priest could then <b>remove a handful</b> from that tenth for the gift, and remove another handful from the vessel with sixty-tenths to fulfill the obligation.
<b>Rava said</b> that there is an alternative explanation of the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted to mix</b> an offering brought as <b>an obligation</b> together <b>with a gift</b> offering, <b>and everyone accepts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. And here they disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Rabbis.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (88a): Each tenth of an ephah of flour requires one <i>log</i> of oil. Accordingly, <b>even</b> if one brings <b>a meal offering of sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>one adds to it sixty <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Each meal offering, irrespective of its volume, <b>even a meal offering of sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, requires <b>only its</b> single <b><i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offering brought by a poor leper on the day of his purification: “And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil <b>for a meal offering, and a <i>log</i> of oil”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The juxtaposition of “a meal offering” with “a <i>log</i> of oil” teaches a principle that pertains to all meal offerings, that each offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil.
Rava explains: <b>The Rabbis</b> in the mishna <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and <b>who said:</b> A meal offering of sixty-tenths of an ephah requires <b>sixty <i>log</i></b> of oil. Therefore, in a case of uncertainty, it is possible to bring sixty-tenths of an ephah, <b>and each and every</b> measurement of <b>one-tenth takes</b> one <b><i>log</i>.</b>
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, who said</b> that a meal offering of sixty-tenths of an ephah <b>has only its</b> one <b><i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>And</b> therefore, when one is uncertain about his vow and brings sixty-tenths, he cannot bring them with one <i>log</i> of oil, as <b>we do not know whether</b> the entire sixty-tenths <b>is one meal offering,</b> so <b>that one <i>log</i> suffices for it,</b> or <b>whether they are two meal offerings,</b> one that is obligatory and one that is a gift, <b>which require two <i>log</i></b> of oil. For this reason, there is no way of resolving the uncertainty except by bringing sixty separate meal offerings, with one <i>log</i> of oil for each.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that there is alternative explanation of the disagreement between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>They disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who is obligated to bring <b>a small</b> offering <b>and</b> instead <b>brings a large</b> offering. <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that if one is obligated to bring <b>a small</b> offering <b>and brings a large</b> one instead <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that in such a case <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. Therefore, in the case of the uncertainty in the mishna, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that by bringing one meal offering of sixty-tenths of an ephah one does not fulfill his obligation if he vowed to bring a smaller offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t they</b> already <b>disagree about this</b> topic <b>once? As we learned</b> in a mishna (107b) that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull, <b>and he brought a large</b> bull instead, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the value of a small bull is included in the value of a large bull. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the offering that he brought did not correspond to his vow.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> for the dispute to be mentioned with regard to both cases, <b>as had</b> their dispute <b>been stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case of one who vows to bring a small meal offering and brings a large one instead, there would be room to reason that it is only <b>in this</b> case that <b>the Rabbis say</b> that he has fulfilled his obligation, <b>because</b> both <b>this</b> small meal offering <b>and that</b> large meal offering are identical with regard to the portion of the offering that is sacrificed on the altar; in both cases <b>it is a handful. But there,</b> in the case of one who vows to bring a small bull but brings a large one, <b>since the sacrificial portions are greater,</b> i.e., larger, there is room to <b>say</b> that the Rabbis <b>concede to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that he has not fulfilled his obligation.
<b>And had</b> their dispute <b>been stated</b> only <b>in that</b> case of one who vows to bring a small bull and brings a big one, there would be room to reason that only <b>in that</b> case <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the person has not fulfilled his obligation, because the sacrificial portions are larger. <b>But in this</b> case of bringing a large meal offering instead of a small one, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both cases.
§ The Gemara gives <b>a mnemonic</b> for the <i>halakhot</i> discussed in the upcoming <i>mishnayot</i>: <b>Wood, gold, wine, burnt offering, thanks offering, bull.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate pieces of <b>wood</b> as fuel for the altar, <b>must</b> donate <b>no fewer than two logs.</b> One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>frankincense, must</b> bring <b>no less than a handful.</b>
The mishna states tangentially: <b>There are five</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>handfuls. One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring an offering of <b>frankincense, may not</b> bring <b>less than a handful. One who pledges</b> to bring <b>a meal offering must bring with it a handful of frankincense. One who</b> intentionally <b>offers up a handful</b> of a meal offering <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>liable</b> to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]. The <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread are <b>required</b> to have <b>two handfuls</b> of frankincense.
One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>gold</b> to the Temple treasury, <b>must</b> give <b>no less than a gold dinar.</b> One who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>silver</b> to the Temple treasury, <b>must</b> give <b>no less than</b> the value of <b>a silver dinar.</b> One who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>copper</b> to the Temple maintenance, <b>must</b> give <b>no less than</b> the value of <b>a silver <i>ma’a</i>.</b> One who says: <b>I specified</b> the amount of gold, silver, or copper, <b>but I do not know what I specified, must bring</b> the maximum amount of gold, silver, or copper, <b>until</b> it reaches an amount <b>where he says:</b> I am certain that <b>I did not intend to</b> donate <b>that</b> much.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to one who pledges to donate wood, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when one brings a meal offering [<i>korban minḥa</i>]<b>”</b> (Leviticus 2:1). The superfluous word “<b><i>korban</i></b>” <b>teaches that one can voluntarily give wood</b> as an offering for the altar. <b>And how much</b> wood must one bring if he does not specify an amount? <b>Two logs. And</b> the support for the fact that wood can be brought as a voluntary offering is <b>as</b> the verse <b>states: “And we cast lots for the wood offering”</b> (Nehemiah 10:35). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This voluntary donation of <b>wood is an offering</b> like a meal offering, <b>and</b> therefore it <b>requires salt and requires bringing</b> to the corner of the altar, like a meal offering.
<b>Rava says: According to the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>wood</b> donated in this manner <b>requires</b> the <b>removal of a handful;</b> just as in the case of a meal offering, a portion of the wood must be removed and sacrificed separately. <b>And Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, since it is an offering for the altar, the <b>wood</b> that is brought as an offering <b>needs</b> to be placed on other <b>wood</b> to burn, like any other offering that is burned on wood on the altar.
The mishna teaches: One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>frankincense, may not</b> bring <b>less than a handful.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And he shall take up from it his handful, of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense</b> which is upon the meal offering, and shall make the memorial part of it smoke upon the altar for an aroma pleasing to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:8). The Torah <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>frankincense with the taking up</b> of a handful <b>of the meal offering.</b> This indicates that <b>just as</b> the <b>taking up from a meal offering</b> is referring to <b>a handful, so too,</b> the minimum size of <b>a frankincense</b> offering is <b>also a handful.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> which discusses vows to bring frankincense that one who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>to the altar,</b> and does not specify what he will bring, <b>must bring frankincense, as you have nothing that is</b> entirely <b>sacrificed on the altar other than frankincense.</b> One who says: <b>I specified</b> what I intended to bring to the altar, <b>but I do not know what I specified, must bring</b> one <b>of everything that is sacrificed on the altar.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there nothing else</b> that is entirely sacrificed on the altar other than frankincense? <b>But isn’t there a burnt offering,</b> which is entirely burned on the altar? The Gemara answers that <b>there is its hide,</b> which is given <b>to the priests</b> and not burned on the altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there a bird burnt offering,</b> which is entirely burned on the altar, including its skin? The Gemara answers: <b>There are</b>

Daf 107a

<b>the crop and feathers,</b> which are thrown on the ground next to the altar and are not burned.
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b> wine <b>libations,</b> which are poured entirely onto the altar? The Gemara answers that the wine is not actually poured onto the altar; it is poured into ducts on the side of the altar and <b>goes</b> down <b>to the drainpipes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there a meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations,</b> which is entirely burned on the altar? The Gemara answers that when one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring to the altar, his intent is clearly to bring a type of offering that is only sacrificed on the altar. A meal offering brought with libations is a type of meal offering. Therefore, <b>since there are</b> other types of <b>a meal offering from which the priests eat,</b> after a handful has been removed from it and burned, a meal offering brought with libations <b>is not a clear</b> example of an offering that is sacrificed on the altar in its entirety, and certainly was not <b>his</b> intent. Therefore, his intent must have been to bring frankincense.
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>gold</b> to the Temple treasury, <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than a gold dinar.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention in using the word gold is not to a coin at all, but to a small <b>piece [<i>naskha</i>]</b> of gold. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The case of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>where he said</b> the word <b>coin.</b> The Gemara challenges further: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention is not to a dinar, but to smaller coins, such as <b><i>perutot</i>. Rav Pappa said: People do not make <i>perutot</i> of gold.</b> Therefore, it is unlikely that this was his intent.
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>silver</b> to the Temple maintenance, <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the value of a silver <b>dinar.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention in using the word silver is not to a coin at all, but to a small <b>piece</b> of silver. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The case of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>where he said</b> the word <b>coin.</b> The Gemara challenges further: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention is not to a dinar, but to smaller coins, such as <b><i>perutot</i>. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a place where silver <i>perutot</i> do not circulate.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>copper</b> to the Temple maintenance, <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the value of <b>a silver <i>ma’a</i>. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: He must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the amount needed to forge <b>a small copper hook.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> use <b>is</b> that <b>suitable</b> in the Temple? <b>Abaye said: They scrape</b> the <b>wicks</b> from the Candelabrum <b>with it and clean</b> the <b>lamps</b> of the Candelabrum <b>with it.</b>
The mishna discusses pledges of gold, silver, and copper. What is the <i>halakha</i> if one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>iron? It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>others say:</b> He <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the amount that can be made into a base and spike designed to <b>eliminate the ravens [<i>mikkalya orev</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is that? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> One <b>cubit</b> in width <b>by</b> one <b>cubit</b> in length.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> another version of this <i>baraita</i> and the subsequent explanation: One who pledges to donate iron <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> one <b>cubit</b> in width <b>by</b> one <b>cubit</b> in length. The Gemara asks: <b>For what is</b> this amount of iron <b>suitable? Rav Yosef said:</b> It is suitable <b>for</b> a base and spike designed to <b>eliminate the ravens.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a libation of <b>wine, must</b> bring <b>no less than three <i>log</i>,</b> as that is the minimum amount of wine brought as a libation accompanying an animal offering. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>oil, must</b> bring <b>no less than a <i>log</i>,</b> as the smallest meal offering includes one <i>log</i> of oil. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> He must bring no less than <b>three <i>log</i>,</b> as that is the amount of oil in the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of a lamb, which is the smallest amount in any of the meal offerings that accompany the sacrifice of an animal.
One who says: <b>I specified</b> how many <i>log</i> I vowed to bring <b>but I do not know what</b> amount <b>I specified, must bring</b> an amount of oil <b>equivalent to</b> the amount brought on the <b>day</b> that the <b>largest</b> amount of oil is sacrificed in the Temple.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Torah states with regard to libations: “All that are native born shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Numbers 15:13). As this verse is superfluous, the various terms in it are used to derive <i>halakhot</i>. The term <b>“native born” teaches that one may pledge libations</b> independently, even when they are not sacrificed together with an offering. <b>And how much</b> is the minimum size that is offered? <b>Three <i>log</i>,</b> which is the smallest measurement of a libation in the Torah and is offered with a lamb.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one desires to add</b> to this amount, <b>he may add</b> to it? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to libations associated with the additional offerings for the New Moon: “And their libations: Half a <i>hin</i> of wine <b>shall be</b> for the bull, and the third part of a <i>hin</i> for the ram, and the fourth part of a <i>hin</i> for the lamb (Numbers 28:14). From the superfluous “shall be” one may understand that there are other amounts of wine that may be brought as independent libations. One <b>might</b> have thought that he can <b>decrease</b> the amount of wine in a libation to less than three <i>log</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “All that are native born shall do these things, <b>in this manner”</b> (Numbers 15:13), i.e., one may not bring less than three <i>log</i> of wine.
The mishna teaches that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>oil, he must</b> bring <b>no less than a <i>log</i>,</b> as the smallest meal offering includes a <i>log</i> of oil. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> He must bring no less than <b>three <i>log</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do they <b>disagree?</b>
<b>The Sages said before Rav Pappa:</b> The Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagree with regard to</b> the proper method of logical derivation when deriving the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one matter from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to another matter. One opinion holds that the proper method is to <b>infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it,</b> i.e., equate the two cases in all aspects, while the other holds that the comparison extends only to one specific issue derived from the primary case, in accordance with the principle: <b>Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., in all other aspects the cases are not equated.
The Sages explained: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> by the principle: <b>Infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it.</b> The Gemara explains the application of this principle: <b>Just as a meal offering is contributed, so too oil is contributed,</b> as inferred from the verse addressing the meal offering. <b>And</b> again one infers <b>from</b> this source: <b>Just as a meal offering</b> requires <b>a <i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>so too here,</b> an offering of oil alone must be <b>a <i>log</i> of oil.</b>
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the proper method is to <b>infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place: Just as a meal offering is contributed, so too oil is contributed. But</b> with regard to all other aspects of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> and its status is <b>like</b> that of <b>libations,</b> which are similar to oil in that they are also poured onto the altar: <b>Just as</b> one contributes <b>libations</b> of <b>three <i>log</i>, so too</b> when one contributes <b>oil,</b> one contributes <b>three <i>log</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said to</b> the Sages who suggested this interpretation: <b>If Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derived</b> the source of the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> the verse addressing the <b>meal offering,</b> he would not disagree with the Rabbis, <b>as everyone</b> employs the principle of: <b>Infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it. Rather, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> a verse concerning libations: “All that are <b>native born</b> shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire” (Numbers 15:13). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi derives from here that just as one may contribute wine libations, so too one may contribute oil. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi compares oil to wine libations: Just as one contributes libations of three <i>log</i>, so too one contributes three <i>log</i> of oil.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: And how can you say that</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the source of the gift offering of oil is not from the meal offering? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when one brings a meal offering <b>[<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), that the superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one may contribute oil. And how much</b> must one contribute? <b>Three <i>log</i>.</b> The Gemara explains the question: <b>Who did you hear that says</b> the gift offering of oil is <b>three <i>log</i>? This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> yet he <b>cites</b> the source of the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> the word <b><i>korban</i>,</b> which is referring to a meal offering. Rav Pappa <b>said to him: If</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it.
The mishna teaches that one who says: <b>I specified</b> how many <i>log</i> I vowed to bring <b>but I do not know what</b> number <b>I specified, must bring</b> an amount of oil <b>equivalent to</b> the amount brought on the <b>day</b> that the <b>largest</b> amount of oil is sacrificed in the Temple. The Sages <b>taught:</b> He must bring an amount of oil <b>equivalent to</b> the amount that is brought on <b>the first day of the Festival,</b> i.e., <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>when it occurs on Shabbat.</b> The offerings brought on that day include the additional offerings for <i>Sukkot</i> and also the additional offerings for Shabbat, and the total amount of oil brought on that day is 140 <i>log</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering, must bring a lamb,</b> which is the least expensive land animal sacrificed as an offering. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> He may bring <b>either a dove or a pigeon,</b> as a bird burnt offering.
One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering, and <b>I specified</b> that it would be <b>from the herd, but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a male calf,</b> as a burnt offering is brought only from male animals. One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering and I specified that it would be <b>from the animals but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a male calf, a ram, a large male goat, a small male goat, and a male lamb.</b> One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering, and <b>I specified</b> what type of burnt offering it would be, <b>but I do not know what I specified,</b>

Daf 107b

<b>adds a dove and a pigeon</b> to the previous list.
One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering and a peace offering, must bring a lamb,</b> which is the least expensive land animal sacrificed as an offering. One who says: I vowed to bring a peace offering <b>and I specified</b> that it would be <b>from the herd but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a cow,</b> and <b>a male calf and a female calf.</b> One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering and specified that it would be <b>from the animals, but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a cow, a male calf and a female calf, a ram and a ewe, a large,</b> i.e., adult, <b>male goat and a large female goat, a small,</b> i.e., young, <b>male goat and a small female goat,</b> and <b>a male lamb and a female lamb.</b>
One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a bull</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the bull, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the total value of <b>one hundred dinars.</b> One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a calf, must bring</b> the calf, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the total value of <b>five</b> <i>sela</i>, which equal twenty dinars. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a ram, must bring</b> the ram, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the value of <b>two</b> <i>sela</i>, which equal eight dinars. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a lamb, must bring</b> the lamb, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> which equals four dinars.
One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the bull <b>with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b> One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a calf with</b> the value of <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the calf <b>with</b> the value of <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> <b>excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b> One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a ram with</b> the value of <b>two</b> <i>sela</i> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the ram <b>with</b> the value of <b>two</b> <i>sela</i> <b>excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b> One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a lamb with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i></b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the lamb <b>with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i> excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b>
If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>and he brought two</b> bulls <b>with</b> a combined value of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>this</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar and that</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar.</b>
If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a black</b> bull, <b>and he brought a white</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a white</b> bull, <b>and he brought a black</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a large</b> bull, <b>and he brought a small</b> bull, in all these cases <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. But if he said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull, <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the value of a small bull is included in the value of a large bull. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the offering that he brought did not correspond to his vow.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one vows to bring a burnt offering and does not specify which animal he will bring, according to the first <i>tanna</i> he must bring a lamb, and according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya he may bring a dove or a pigeon. The Gemara explains: <b>And they do not disagree</b> in principle. This <b>Sage</b> rules <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale, and</b> that <b>Sage</b> rules <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale.</b> In the locale of the first <i>tanna</i>, when people would say: Burnt offering, they would be referring to a land animal, whereas in the locale of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, when people would say: Burnt offering, they would also be referring to a bird.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i> for the altar, must bring a lamb; as you have no</b> animal <b>that is sacrificed on the altar</b> and has the value <b>of</b> one <b><i>sela</i> but a lamb.</b> One who says: When I made my vow <b>I specified</b> that I will bring an item <b>that is sacrificed</b> on the altar and has the value <b>of</b> one <b><i>sela</i>, but I do not know what I specified, must bring</b> one <b>of every</b> animal <b>that is sacrificed on the altar</b> and has the value <b>of</b> one <b><i>sela</i>.</b> Although this condition generally indicates a lamb, since the person specified a particular animal but does not remember which, one cannot be certain that he specified a lamb.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: I vowed to bring a peace offering, and <b>I specified</b> that it would be <b>from the herd, but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, he must bring a bull and a calf.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why? Let him bring a bull,</b> as <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it he has fulfilled his vow. If he vowed to bring a bull, he has done so. If he vowed to bring a calf, he has fulfilled his vow, because the value of a calf is included in the value of a bull.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull, <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars, and he brought two</b> bulls <b>with</b> the combined value of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>and</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>this</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar and that</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar.</b>
If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a black</b> bull, <b>and he brought a white</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a white</b> bull, <b>and he brought a black</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a large</b> bull, <b>and he brought a small</b> bull, in all these cases <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. But if he said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull, <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the value of a small bull is included in the value of a large bull. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the offering that he brought did not correspond to his vow.
If the first clause, which teaches that one who vowed to bring an offering from the herd must bring both a bull and a calf, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, then it turns out that <b>the first clause and the last clause</b> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and the middle clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Can that be so?
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, the first clause and the last clause</b> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and <b>the middle clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: This matter,</b> i.e., the ruling that one who vows to bring an offering from the herd must bring a bull and a calf, is not universally accepted. Rather, it <b>is</b> subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis.</b>
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 18b): There were <b>six</b> collection horns in the Temple <b>for</b> the collection of donations for communal <b>gift</b> offerings, i.e., burnt offerings that were sacrificed when the altar was idle. The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> did these six horns <b>correspond?</b> The Gemara gives <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the five Sages who give answers to this question: <b><i>Kuf</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>ayin</i>.</b>
<b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> These six collection horns <b>corresponded to</b> the <b>six</b> extended <b>patrilineal families of priests</b> who served each week in the Temple. There was one collection horn for each family, <b>which the Sages installed for them so that there would be peace between one another</b> and they would not quarrel. The hides of the burnt offerings are given to the priests, and by keeping the money for the offerings sacrificed by each family separate, they would not come to quarrel over those hides.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Since the</b> money for the communal <b>gift</b> offerings was <b>plentiful,</b> as much money was donated for this purpose, there was a concern that if too many coins were placed in one collection horn, only the uppermost coins would be taken and the bottom ones would deteriorate. Therefore, the Sages <b>installed many</b> collection <b>horns for them, so that</b> each horn would contain fewer coins and <b>the coins would not decay.</b>
<b>And Ze’eiri says:</b> The six collection horns <b>correspond to</b> the six types of animals from which burnt offerings can be brought: <b>A bull, a calf, a ram, a lamb, a small goat, and a large goat. And</b> each type of animal required its own collection horn, because the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the offering that he brought did not correspond to his vow.
<b>And bar Padda says:</b> The six collection horns <b>correspond to</b> the six types of animals from which sin offerings and guilt offerings can be brought. If an animal designated for a guilt offering or a communal sin offering was lost, another animal was consecrated in its stead, and then the first animal was found, the value of that animal is placed into one of these collection horns, and a communal gift offering is brought with it. One was for the value of <b>the bulls</b> brought as communal sin offerings. <b>And</b> one was for the value of <b>the rams</b> brought as guilt offerings for robbery or for misuse of consecrated property,

Daf 108a

<b>And</b> one was for the value of <b>the lambs</b> brought as a nazirite’s or a leper’s guilt offering. <b>And</b> one was for the value of <b>the goats</b> brought as communal sin offerings on Festivals. <b>And</b> one was for <b>the surplus</b> coins of one who designated money to purchase one of those offerings and had money left over after purchasing the animal. <b>And</b> one was for <b>the</b> additional silver <b><i>ma’a</i></b> paid as a premium in a case when two people brought their half-shekel jointly as one shekel.
After citing these four opinions, the Gemara explains: <b>All of</b> the other Sages <b>do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Ḥizkiyya</b> that the six collection horns are to prevent quarrels between the families of priests, <b>as</b> they hold that <b>we are not concerned about quarreling</b> between the priests. There is no reason for them to fight, <b>as each and every</b> family <b>serves on its</b> own <b>day</b> and receives the hides of the animals sacrificed on that day.
The other Sages <b>do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the six horns are to prevent the coins from decaying, as <b>we are not concerned that</b> the coins will <b>decay.</b>
The other Sages <b>do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Ze’eiri</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, because <b>we do not interpret</b> a mishna <b>in accordance with an individual</b> opinion against the majority opinion.
The other Sages <b>also do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>bar Padda</b> that the six collection horns were for the value of bulls, rams, lambs, and goats that had been lost, for the surplus coins left over after purchasing an offering, and for the <i>ma’a</i> paid as a premium in addition to the half-shekel of two people. This is because they hold that there is no reason to differentiate between <b>the surplus</b> and the value of specific animals, as <b>all of</b> the animals that were lost and another offered in their place are <b>also surplus,</b> and their value is surplus after the replacement offering was purchased.
The other Sages <b>also</b> do not agree with bar Padda’s explanation that the sixth collection horn was for the <b><i>ma’a</i>,</b> because they hold that the <i>ma’a</i> <b>goes toward</b> the same purpose as the regular <b>shekels, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>ma’a</i>: <b>Where would this premium [<i>kalbon</i>] go,</b> i.e., what was done with it? It would be added <b>to the shekels</b> themselves, which would be used to buy the daily and additional offerings; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It would be used <b>for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.
The Gemara cites two additional explanations for the purpose of the six collection horns. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> These six horns <b>correspond to</b> the surplus coins left over after purchasing six offerings, namely: The <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a sin offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a nazirite’s guilt offering,</b> brought if he comes into contact with a corpse during his term of naziriteship; <b>and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a leper’s guilt offering,</b> brought as part of his purification process; <b>and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a meal offering of a sinner;</b> and the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering sacrificed <b>by the High Priest</b> each day, half in the morning and half in the evening.
<b>And Rabbi Oshaya says</b> that there is a different explanation for the six collection horns: They <b>correspond to</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a sin offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a nazirite’s guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a leper’s guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after the purchase of <b>pairs</b> of doves or pigeons by women after childbirth, by <i>zavim</i> as part of their purification process, and others; <b>and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a meal offering of a sinner.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Shmuel does not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> that one of the collection horns was for the surplus coins left over after purchasing pairs of birds? The Gemara answers: A collection horn for coins for <b>pairs</b> of birds is already <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna in tractate <i>Shekalim</i> (18a), among the list of seven collection horns that served purposes other than the communal gift offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Oshaya teach</b> the mishna <b>without teaching</b> that one of the collection horns was for <b>pairs</b> of birds? Does he have a different version of the mishna? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Oshaya teach</b> the mishna explicitly, <b>teaching</b> in his version of the mishna that there was a collection horn for <b>pairs</b> of birds? The Gemara answers that <b>one</b> of the collection horns was for coins designated <b>for</b> purchasing <b>pairs</b> of birds, <b>and one</b> collection horn was <b>for the surplus</b> coins remaining after purchasing <b>pairs</b> of birds.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya does not say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>he holds like the one who says</b> that the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are not used to purchase other offerings but are left to <b>rot; as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the meal offering of</b> are used for the purchase of a communal <b>gift</b> offering. <b>The surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a meal offering</b> are left to <b>rot.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the opaque wording: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: The surplus</b> coins left over from the purchase of <b>a meal offering of a sinner</b> are used for the purchase of a communal <b>gift</b> offering. <b>The surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are left to <b>rot.</b>
<b>Rabba</b> offered an alternative interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> and <b>said: Even the surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are <b>also</b> used for the purchase of a communal <b>gift</b> offering. <b>Rather, the surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the loaves</b> accompanying <b>a thanks offering</b> are left <b>to rot.</b>
The Gemara points out that the opinions of Rav Ḥisda and Rabba correspond to opinions raised <b>in the dispute</b> among earlier <i>amora’im</i>, as with regard to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that they are used to buy a communal <b>gift</b> offering, while <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that they must be left <b>to rot.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6b): <b>The surplus</b> coins that had been designated for <b>shekels are non-sacred</b> property; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> meal offering, <b>and the surplus</b> money that had been designated to purchase offerings that are brought due to ritual impurity or a sin, such as <b>the pairs</b> of birds <b>of <i>zavim</i>, the pairs</b> of birds <b>of <i>zavot</i>, the pairs</b> of birds <b>of women after childbirth, and sin offerings, and guilt offerings,</b> in these cases, <b>the surplus</b> coins must be used for a communal <b>gift</b> offering.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: The tenth of an ephah meal offering? <b>Is it not</b> referring to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the High Priest’s tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which is also brought from a tenth of an ephah of fine flour (Leviticus 5:11).
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Yitzḥak said: It is reasonable</b> to accept the opinion of <b>the one who said: The surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are left to <b>rot.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a sinner’s meal offering: The verse states: “But if his means are not sufficient for two doves or two pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; <b>he shall put no oil upon it, nor shall he put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:11). <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that the phrase “it is a sin offering” is interpreted as a restriction: <b>It is called a sin offering, and no other</b> meal offering <b>is called a sin offering.</b> This <b>taught that with regard to the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest, it is not called a sin offering, and</b> consequently it <b>requires frankincense.</b>
Rav Naḥman inferred: <b>And since it is not called a sin offering, its surplus</b> coins should not be used to buy communal gift offerings like the surplus coins of sin offerings; rather, they should be left to <b>rot.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to one who said: <b>This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and</b> subsequently <b>it became blemished [<i>venista’ev</i>]</b> and was disqualified from sacrifice, he should redeem the bull and with that money purchase another bull as an offering in its stead. <b>If he wishes, he may bring two</b> bulls <b>with its</b> redemption <b>money</b> instead of one. If one says: <b>These two bulls are</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and</b> subsequently <b>they became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring one</b> bull <b>with their</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> this <b>prohibited,</b> and holds that he must bring two bulls.
In a case where one said: <b>This ram is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, if he wishes he may bring a lamb with its</b> redemption <b>money.</b> In a case where one said: <b>This lamb is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, if he wishes he may bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for one to bring one type of animal with redemption money from another type of animal.

Daf 108b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one vows to bring a certain bull as a burnt offering and it became blemished, he may bring two bulls with its redemption money. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say in the first clause,</b> i.e., in the previous mishna (107b), that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>and he brought two</b> bulls <b>with</b> a combined value of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? If so, why does the mishna here teach that one may bring two bulls with the redemption money of one bull?
The Gemara answers that these two cases are not comparable. The previous mishna was referring to a case where one vowed to bring a bull worth one hundred dinars, without referring to a specific bull. Therefore, he is obligated to fulfill the specific conditions of his vow. By contrast, this mishna is referring to a case where one said: <b>This bull</b> is hereby a burnt offering, <b>and</b> therefore, if the bull <b>becomes blemished</b> and disqualified as an offering the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different.</b> Since he was only ever obligated to sacrifice this bull, and is no longer able to sacrifice it, he is no longer obligated by his vow, and may bring any number of offerings with its value.
The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>These two bulls are</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and they became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring with</b> the <b>money</b> of <b>their</b> redemption <b>one</b> bull. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> this <b>prohibited,</b> and holds that he must bring two bulls. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deems it prohibited to bring only one bull?
The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is</b> similar to a case where one vowed to bring <b>a large</b> bull <b>and he brought a small</b> bull, in which case he has not fulfilled his vow. Similarly, in this case, he vowed to bring two bulls and brought only one. <b>And although</b> he is not actually obligated to bring two bulls, as the bulls that he consecrated <b>became blemished</b> and he needs only to bring an offering with their redemption money, nevertheless <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not permit</b> bringing two bulls instead of one <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagree in the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>as well,</b> which states that if one consecrated a specific bull as a burnt offering and it subsequently became blemished, he may purchase two bulls with its redemption money. There, too, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi should prohibit bringing two bulls <i>ab initio</i>, as it is similar to a case where one vowed to bring a small bull and brought a large one, in which case Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi also holds that he has not fulfilled his obligation.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagrees with</b> this <b>entire matter,</b> both in the first and latter clauses of the mishna; <b>but he waited until the Rabbis had completed their statement, and then disagreed with them</b> with regard to both cases.
<b>Know</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi disagrees with the statement of the Rabbis in the first clause of the mishna as well, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if one said: <b>This ram is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring a lamb with its</b> redemption <b>money.</b> In a case where one said: <b>This lamb is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for one to bring one type of animal with the redemption money of another type of animal, even if he wishes to bring a ram with the redemption money of a lamb. Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi disagrees with the Rabbis even in a case where one consecrated a small animal and wishes to bring a large animal with its redemption money. <b>Conclude from it</b> that he also disagrees in a case where one vowed to bring a certain animal which subsequently became blemished; the person may not bring two animals with the redemption money.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: According to the Rabbis, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who wishes to use the redemption money <b>from</b> an animal of one <b>species</b> which became blemished <b>to</b> purchase a different <b>species</b> of animal? For example, if one vowed to bring a bull which subsequently became blemished, may he bring rams with its value instead?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If one said: <b>This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, he may not bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money,</b> as a ram is not worth as much as a bull. <b>But he may bring two rams with its</b> redemption <b>money,</b> if together they are equal in value to the bull. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> this <b>prohibited,</b> the reason being that one must bring two meal offerings to accompany his two rams. These meal offerings must be brought in two vessels, <b>because there is no mixing</b> permitted. Accordingly, bringing two offerings runs counter to the person’s vow, which involved bringing only one meal offering. <b>Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that according to the Rabbis it is permitted to use the redemption money from one species of animal to purchase a different species.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the Rabbis deem it permitted to bring a different species of animal, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically</b> state that one may bring <b>two</b> rams in place of a bull? The same <i>halakha</i> would apply <b>even</b> for <b>one</b> ram, <b>as</b> although one ram is smaller than one bull, <b>in</b> a case where the animal <b>became blemished, according to the Rabbis, there is no difference whether</b> one brings <b>a large</b> animal <b>or a small</b> animal. If one vowed to bring a ram he may bring a lamb instead, so why not a ram in place of a bull?
The Gemara answers: There are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that the Rabbis deem it permitted to bring a small animal in place of a large animal that became blemished. The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that the Rabbis do not deem it permitted to bring a small animal in place of a large animal.
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to bring two rams with the redemption money of a bull, <b>because there is no mixing.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that he deems it prohibited is <b>because there is no mixing. But</b> had there <b>been mixing,</b> then according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi it would be <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if one said: <b>This ram is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring a lamb with its</b> redemption <b>money.</b> If one said: <b>This lamb is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, he may bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for one to bring one type of animal with the redemption money of another type of animal. Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prohibits any kind of divergence from the animal that was consecrated, regardless of whether mixing is permitted.
The Gemara answers: There are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that Rabbi Yehuda deems it prohibited to switch to a different type of animal only if it affects the accompanying meal offering, whereas the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deems any kind of change prohibited.
The Gemara cites the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>: All of the cases in the mishna and <i>baraita</i> are referring to a case where the animal became blemished; <b>and with regard to pure</b> animals, i.e., those that are not blemished, if one vowed to bring <b>a calf and brought a bull</b> instead, or he vowed to bring <b>a lamb and brought a ram</b> instead, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara explains that the <b>unattributed</b> last clause of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would disagree in this case as well.
§ The mishna teaches that if one vows to bring a certain bull as a burnt offering, and it became blemished, if <b>he wishes, he may bring two</b> bulls <b>with its</b> redemption <b>money. Rabbi Menashya bar Zevid says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one said: This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering. But</b> if he <b>said: This bull</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring as <b>a burnt offering,</b> his responsibility for it in a case where it became blemished <b>is fixed,</b> and he must bring one bull with its redemption money, not two.
The Gemara challenges Rav’s opinion: <b>But perhaps</b> when <b>he said:</b> This bull is incumbent upon me, he meant: It is incumbent <b>upon me to bring it</b> as an offering, but he did not intend to accept responsibility in case it becomes blemished.
<b>Rather, if it was stated</b> that there is a case where one is responsible if the animal becomes blemished, <b>it was stated as follows: Rabbi Menashya bar Zevid says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one said: This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, or he said: This bull</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring as <b>a burnt offering. But</b> if <b>he said: This bull and its value</b> are incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring as <b>a burnt offering,</b> his responsibility for it in a case where it becomes blemished <b>is fixed,</b> and he must bring one bull with its redemption money, and not two.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who says: One of my lambs is consecrated, or: One of my bulls is consecrated, and he has two</b> lambs or bulls, <b>the larger of them is consecrated.</b> If he has <b>three</b> lambs or bulls, <b>the middle-sized</b> animal <b>among them is consecrated.</b> If one says: <b>I specified</b> the lamb or bull that is to be consecrated <b>but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified</b> in my vow, <b>or</b> he says <b>that: My father said to me</b> before his death that he consecrated one of the lambs or the bulls, <b>but I do not know what</b> animal he consecrated, <b>the largest of them is consecrated.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The first clause of the mishna teaches that if one says: One of my lambs is consecrated, and he has two lambs, the larger one is consecrated. The Gemara infers: <b>Apparently, one who consecrates, consecrates generously.</b> But <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If he has three lambs, <b>the middle-sized</b> animal <b>among them is consecrated. Apparently, one who consecrates, consecrates sparingly.</b> How can this contradiction be resolved?
<b>Shmuel said:</b> The presumption is that one who consecrates, consecrates generously. When the latter clause of the mishna states that the middle-sized animal is consecrated, it does not mean that only the middle-sized animal is consecrated. Rather, the larger animal is consecrated, and additionally <b>we are concerned,</b> i.e., we must take in consideration the possibility, <b>that the</b> middle-sized animal is consecrated, as <b>compared to</b> consecrating <b>the small</b> animal, consecrating the middle-sized animal <b>is generous.</b> Therefore, the vow could have been referring to either the large animal or the middle-sized animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>How should he act?</b> He consecrated only one of them, and it is uncertain which animal should be sacrificed. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav said: He should wait until</b> the middle-sized animal <b>becomes blemished and</b> then <b>desacralize it</b> by transferring its sanctity <b>onto the large</b> animal, which is then sacrificed on the altar.
§ The mishna teaches that if one had three lambs or bulls, the middle-sized animal is consecrated. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the middle-sized animal is consecrated <b>only when he said: One of my bulls is</b> hereby <b>consecrated. But</b> if <b>he said: A bull</b> from <b>among my bulls is</b> hereby <b>consecrated,</b> only <b>the largest of them is consecrated.</b> It is as if <b>he said: The</b> most valuable <b>bull</b> from <b>among my bulls [<i>tora betorai</i>]</b> is consecrated.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said in the name of Ulla: One who says to another: I am selling you a house</b> from <b>among my houses, can show him an loft [<i>aliyya</i>],</b> since he did not specify which house he is selling? Is this <b>not because</b> the loft is the <b>worst</b> of his houses? If so, when one says: A bull from among my bulls is hereby consecrated, he is presumably referring to the least valuable of his bulls. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Ulla did not say that the seller gives the purchaser a loft, but rather <b>the best [<i>me’ula</i>] of</b> his <b>houses.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba bar Avuh from a <i>baraita</i>: If one said: <b>A bull</b> from <b>among my bulls is consecrated, or similarly</b> if <b>a consecrated bull became mixed with other</b> non-consecrated bulls, <b>the largest of them is consecrated, and all of the</b> other bulls <b>must be sold</b> to people who vowed to bring burnt offerings, <b>for the purpose of</b> bringing them as <b>burnt offerings,</b> since it is uncertain which one of them was consecrated, <b>and the payment for them is non-sacred.</b> Evidently, if one says: I hereby consecrate a bull from among my bulls, all of his bulls have uncertain consecrated status.
The Gemara answers: <b>Interpret</b> this as referring only <b>to a consecrated bull that became mixed with others.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>say: And similarly,</b> indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to both cases? The Gemara answers: <b>Interpret</b> it as referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the largest</b> of the bulls is consecrated. That <i>halakha</i> does apply to both cases, but the <i>halakha</i> that the rest of the bulls have uncertain consecrated status applies only to the latter case.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba bar Avuh from a <i>baraita</i>: If one says to another: <b>I am selling you a house</b> from <b>among my houses, and</b> one of the houses subsequently <b>fell, he can show him</b> the <b>fallen</b> house, and say to him: This is the one I sold you. Similarly, if one says to another: <b>I sell you a slave</b> from <b>among my slaves, and</b> one of the slaves <b>dies, he can show him</b> the <b>dead</b> slave and say: This is the slave I sold you.

Daf 109a

<b>But</b> according to the opinion of Rabba bar Avuh, <b>why</b> can the seller automatically give the purchaser the fallen house or the dead slave? <b>Let him see which</b> house <b>fell,</b> or <b>which</b> slave <b>died,</b> as according to Rabba bar Avuh, the sale should apply to the house or slave that was the most valuable at the time of the sale.
The Gemara answers: <b>Are you saying</b> that the statement of Rabba bar Avuh applies in the case of <b>a purchaser? A purchaser is different, as</b> there is a principle in the <i>halakhot</i> of commerce that in a case involving a dispute between the seller and the purchaser, <b>the owner of the document</b> of sale, i.e., the purchaser, <b>is at a disadvantage,</b> as a document is always interpreted as narrowly as possible. Therefore, the seller can claim that he has sold the buyer the fallen house or the dead slave.
The Gemara adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation, the objection posed earlier to the statement of Rabba bar Avuh from the statement of Ulla can be rejected easily. Ulla said that if one says to another: I am selling you a house from among my houses, since he did not specify which house he is selling, he can show him an attic [<i>aliyya</i>]. Although this was explained above as referring not to a loft but to the best [<i>me’ula</i>] of his houses, now <b>you</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is referring to <b>a loft, which is the worst</b> of his houses, due to the principle that <b>the owner of the document is at a disadvantage.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering, must sacrifice it in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem. <b>And if he sacrificed it in the temple of Onias</b> in Egypt, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering that I will sacrifice in the temple of Onias, must sacrifice it in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem, <b>but if he sacrificed it in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering that I will sacrifice in the temple of Onias, <b>it is not</b> consecrated as <b>a burnt offering;</b> such a statement does not consecrate the animal at all.
If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite,</b> then when his term of naziriteship is completed <b>he must shave</b> the hair of his head and bring the requisite offerings <b>in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem; <b>and if he shaved in the temple of Onias, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite</b> provided <b>that I will shave in the temple of Onias, he must shave in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem; <b>but if he shaved in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that one who says: I am hereby a nazirite provided that I will shave in the temple of Onias, <b>is not a nazirite</b> at all, as his vow does not take effect.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering that I will sacrifice in the temple of Onias, and sacrifices it in the temple of Onias, has fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara asks: How has he <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation? By sacrificing it in the temple of Onias, <b>hasn’t he</b> merely <b>killed it</b> without sacrificing it properly?
<b>Rav Hamnuna says:</b> The mishna does not mean that he has fulfilled his vow to bring an offering. Rather, <b>he is rendered like one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering on the condition that I will not be responsible for it</b> if I kill it beforehand. When the mishna says that he has fulfilled his obligation it simply means that if the animal he consecrated is no longer alive, he does not have to bring another animal in its place.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Hamnuna: <b>If that is so,</b> what about <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which teaches</b> that if one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite</b> provided <b>that I will shave in the temple of Onias, he must shave in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem, <b>but if he shaved in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation? In this case do you <b>also</b> maintain <b>that he is rendered like one who says: I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that I will not be responsible for</b> bringing <b>its offerings</b> if I kill them beforehand? Such a condition cannot exempt <b>a nazirite</b> from bringing his offerings, because <b>as long as he does not bring his offerings, he is not fit</b> to conclude his term of naziriteship and is still bound by all of the restrictions of a nazirite.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> there is a different explanation: The animal was never consecrated at all, as <b>this person intended</b> merely <b>to</b> bring the animal as <b>a gift [<i>doron</i>],</b> but not to consecrate it as an offering. He presumably lives closer to the temple of Onias than to the Temple in Jerusalem, and must have <b>said</b> to himself: <b>If it is sufficient</b> to sacrifice this animal <b>in the temple of Onias, I</b> am prepared to <b>exert</b> myself and bring it. But if it is necessary to do <b>more</b> than that, i.e., to bring it to Jerusalem, <b>I am not able to afflict myself.</b> The mishna teaches that although the person never intended to bring the offering to Jerusalem, ideally, he should sacrifice the animal properly, in the Temple in Jerusalem. If he did not bring it there, but sacrificed it in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled his obligation, and is not required to bring any other offering in its place.
This is the explanation of the latter clause of the mishna <b>as well:</b> If one said that he would be <b>a nazirite</b> provided that he will shave in the temple of Onias, <b>this man</b> did not intend to accept upon himself the halakhic status of naziriteship. Rather, he merely <b>intends to practice abstinence</b> by not drinking wine, along with observing the other restrictions of a nazirite. Therefore, <b>he said</b> to himself: <b>If it is sufficient</b> to shave <b>in the temple of Onias, I</b> am prepared to <b>exert</b> myself and do so. But if it is necessary to do <b>more</b> than that, i.e., to go to Jerusalem to shave and bring the required offerings, <b>I am not able to afflict myself.</b> The mishna teaches that ideally, he should go to the Temple in Jerusalem to shave and bring all his offerings. If he shaved and brought his offerings in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled his vow and has no further obligation.
<b>And Rav Hamnuna</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response to Rava’s challenge: With regard to the case of one who vowed to become <b>a nazirite</b> on the condition that he would shave and bring his offerings in the temple of Onias, the interpretation of the mishna is <b>as you said.</b> But with regard to one who vows to bring <b>a burnt offering</b> in the temple of Onias, his intent is as I explained, and it is as if <b>he says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering on the condition that I will not be responsible for it</b> if I kill it beforehand.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also</b> holds in accordance with <b>that which Rav Hamnuna</b> said, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that if one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering</b> on the condition <b>that I will sacrifice it in the temple of Onias, and he sacrificed it in Eretz Yisrael</b> but not in the Temple, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but</b> his actions <b>are</b> also <b>punishable by excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]</b> because he sacrificed an offering outside of the Temple. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Hamnuna that the animal is consecrated.
<b>This</b> explanation of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering</b> on the condition <b>that I will sacrifice it in the wilderness</b> of Sinai, thinking that the wilderness of Sinai still has sanctity since the Tabernacle had been located there, <b>and he sacrificed it on</b> the east <b>bank of the Jordan, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but</b> his actions <b>are</b> also <b>punishable by <i>karet</i></b> because he sacrificed an offering outside of the Temple.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The priests who served in the temple of Onias may not serve in the Temple in Jerusalem; and needless to say,</b> if they served <b>for something else,</b> a euphemism for idolatry, they are disqualified from service in the Temple. <b>As it is stated: “Nevertheless the priests of the private altars did not come up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they did eat <i>matza</i> among their brethren”</b> (II Kings 23:9). The halakhic status of <b>these</b> priests is <b>like</b> that of <b>blemished</b> priests in that <b>they receive a share</b> in the distribution of the meat of the offerings <b>and partake</b> of that meat, <b>but they do not sacrifice</b> offerings or perform any of the sacrificial rites.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a priest who slaughtered</b> an offering <b>for idol worship</b> and who subsequently repented and came to the Temple in Jerusalem to serve, <b>his offering is</b> acceptable and considered to be <b>an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? The verse states: <b>“Because they served them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity unto the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up My hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity”</b> (Ezekiel 44:12). <b>And it is written afterward: “And they shall not come near to Me, to serve Me in the priestly role”</b> (Ezekiel 44:13). This indicates that <b>if</b> a priest <b>performed a service</b> for an idol that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple, he <b>is</b> disqualified from serving in the Temple, but the <b>slaughter</b> of an offering <b>is not</b> considered <b>service,</b> as it is not considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple and can be performed in the Temple even by a non-priest.
<b>It was stated:</b> If a priest <b>unwittingly</b> performed the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of an idolatrous offering and then repented and came to serve in the Temple, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>his offering</b> is accepted and <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not a pleasing aroma</b> to the Lord, as he is not fit to serve in the Temple.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say</b> that if a priest sprinkled blood unwittingly for idol worship he cannot serve in the Temple? <b>As it is written: “And they became a stumbling block of iniquity unto the house of Israel.” What, is it not</b> referring to one who served in idol worship <b>either</b> as <b>a stumbling block or</b> as <b>an iniquity?</b> Accordingly, neither may perform the service in the Temple. <b>And</b> the term <b>“stumbling block”</b> is a reference to one who sins <b>unwittingly, and</b> the term <b>“iniquity”</b> is a reference to <b>an intentional</b> sinner. Therefore, even one who unwittingly served in idol worship may not subsequently serve in the Temple.
<b>And Rav Naḥman</b> interprets the verse to mean <b>a stumbling block of iniquity,</b> i.e., only one who serves in idol worship intentionally is disqualified from serving in the Temple, but not one who serves in idol worship unwittingly.
<b>Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say</b> that if a priest sprinkled the blood of an idolatrous offering unwittingly his subsequent offering in the Temple is accepted? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to one who unwittingly committed idolatry: “And if one person sin through error, then he shall offer a she-goat in its first year for a sin offering. <b>And the priest shall effect atonement for the soul that errs unwittingly, when he sins unwittingly,</b> before the Lord, to effect atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven” (Numbers 15:27–28). The phrase: “For the soul that errs unwittingly” <b>teaches that a priest</b> who sins unwittingly <b>may receive atonement</b> by sacrificing his sin offering <b>on his own.</b>
Rav Naḥman clarifies: <b>In what</b> manner did this priest commit idolatry? <b>If we say</b> he sinned <b>through slaughtering</b> an idolatrous offering, <b>why</b> does the verse indicate <b>specifically</b> that a priest who slaughtered an idolatrous offering <b>unwittingly</b> can bring his own sin offering? This is obvious, as <b>even</b> one who did so <b>intentionally</b> may serve in the Temple after repentance. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a priest who committed idolatry <b>by sprinkling</b> the blood of an idolatrous offering? Accordingly, if he did so unwittingly his subsequent service in the Temple is valid, but if he did so intentionally, he is disqualified from serving in the Temple.
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rav Sheshet</b> interpret that <i>baraita</i>? He could have <b>said to you: Actually,</b> the verse is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest sinned <b>through slaughtering</b> an idolatrous offering. <b>And</b> although Rav Yehuda said that a priest who slaughtered an idolatrous offering may serve in the Temple after repentance, that statement applies only to one who slaughtered an idolatrous offering unwittingly. But if he did so <b>intentionally,</b> the priest is disqualified from serving in the Temple. Rav Yehuda’s reasoning is that slaughter is not a sacrificial rite in the Temple; but <b>does</b> one who slaughters an idolatrous offering intentionally <b>not become a servant of idol worship?</b>
<b>And</b> Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet <b>follow their</b> respective lines of <b>reasoning, as it was stated</b> that if a priest acted <b>intentionally in</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an idolatrous offering and subsequently repented, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord, i.e., it is not disqualified, <b>and Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord, i.e., it is disqualified.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord, <b>because he did not perform service</b> for an idol that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple. And <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>his offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord,

Daf 109b

as by slaughtering the idolatrous offering intentionally <b>he became a servant of idol worship.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say</b> that even a priest who intentionally slaughters an idolatrous offering is nevertheless fit to serve in the Temple if he repents? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a priest who served</b> in <b>idol worship and repented, his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable.
Rav Naḥman clarifies: <b>In what</b> manner did he serve in idol worship? <b>If we say</b> that he served in idol worship <b>unwittingly, what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>And repented? He is already repentant,</b> as he never intended to sin in the first place. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of intentional</b> idol worship. <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to sprinkling</b> the blood of an idolatrous offering, <b>when he repents, what of it? Hasn’t he performed</b> idolatrous <b>service,</b> thereby disqualifying himself from serving in the Temple in any event? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an idolatrous offering? Evidently, even if the priest slaughtered it intentionally, once he repents he is fit to serve in the Temple.
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rav Sheshet, he</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to unwitting</b> slaughter. <b>And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If</b> the priest <b>is repentant from the outset, as when he served</b> in idol worship <b>he served unwittingly,</b> then <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable. <b>But if not,</b> i.e., he slaughtered an idolatrous offering intentionally, <b>his</b> subsequent <b>offering</b> in the Temple is <b>not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.
§ The Gemara lists other similar disagreements between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet. In a case where a priest <b>bowed to</b> an object of <b>idol worship, Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. In a case where a priest <b>acknowledges</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> as a divinity, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.
Having listed four similar disputes between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet, namely, with regard to a priest who unwittingly sprinkled the blood of an idolatrous offering, a priest who intentionally slaughtered an idolatrous offering, a priest who bowed to an idol, and a priest who acknowledged an idol as a divinity, the Gemara explains: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to teach the dispute with regard to all four cases. <b>As, had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, where a priest sprinkles the blood of an idolatrous offering unwittingly, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified, <b>because he performed a service for</b> idolatry that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple. <b>But</b> in a case where the priest merely performed <b>slaughter, since he did not perform a service for</b> idolatry that is a sacrificial rite in the Temple, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet <b>concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman.</b>
<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the dispute with regard to a priest intentionally performing <b>slaughter</b> for an idolatrous offering, one might have thought that Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he merely <b>bowed</b> to the idol, <b>since he did not perform</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.
<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the case of a priest <b>bowing</b> to an idol, one might have thought that in this case Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed an action for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he only <b>acknowledged</b> the idol as a divinity, <b>which is mere speech,</b> there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. The Gemara concludes: Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And needless to say,</b> if priests served for <b>something else,</b> a euphemism for idolatry, they are disqualified from service in the Temple. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it says: Needless to say,</b> if they served for <b>something else, by inference, the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship,</b> but rather a temple devoted to the worship of God.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>like the one who says</b> that <b>the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship. As it is taught:</b> During <b>the year in which Shimon HaTzaddik died, he said to</b> his associates: <b>This year, he will die,</b> euphemistically referring to himself. <b>They said to him: From where do you know?</b>
Shimon HaTzaddik <b>said to them:</b> In previous years, <b>every Yom Kippur,</b> upon entering the Holy of Holies, I had a prophetic vision in which <b>I would be met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in white, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in white, and he would enter</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, and he would leave with me.</b> But <b>this year, I was met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in black, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in black, and he entered</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, but he did not leave with me.</b> Shimon HaTzaddik understood this to be a sign that his death was impending.
Indeed, <b>after the pilgrimage festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>he was ill for seven days and died. And his fellow priests refrained from reciting the</b> Priestly <b>Benediction with the</b> ineffable <b>name</b> of God.
<b>At the time of his death, he said to</b> the Sages: <b>Onias, my son, will serve</b> as High Priest <b>in my stead. Shimi,</b> Onias’ <b>brother, became jealous</b> of him, <b>as</b> Shimi <b>was two and a half years older than</b> Onias. Shimi <b>said to</b> Onias treacherously: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. Shimi <b>dressed</b> Onias <b>in a tunic [<i>be’unkeli</i>] and girded him with a ribbon [<i>betziltzul</i>]</b> as a belt, i.e., not in the vestments of the High Priest, and <b>stood him next to the altar.</b> Shimi <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>
<b>The fellow priests of</b> Onias <b>wanted to kill him</b> because he had disgraced the Temple service with his garments. Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them and they ran after him. He went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of idol worship. When the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this</b> person, Shimi, <b>who did not enter</b> the position of High Priest, acted with <b>such</b> jealousy, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who enters</b> a prestigious position rebel if that position is taken away from him. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the temple of Onias was built for idol worship.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him:</b> The <b>incident was not like this. Rather, Onias did not accept</b> the position of High Priest <b>because his brother Shimi was two and a half years older than him,</b> so Shimi was appointed as High Priest. <b>And even so,</b> even though Onias himself offered the position to Shimi, <b>Onias was jealous of his brother Shimi.</b> Onias <b>said to</b> Shimi: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. <b>And</b> Onias <b>dressed</b> Shimi <b>in a tunic and girded him in a ribbon and stood him next to the altar.</b> Onias <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man, Shimi, <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>
<b>His fellow priests wanted to kill</b> Shimi. Shimi then <b>told them the entire incident,</b> that he had been tricked by his brother Onias, so the priests <b>wanted to kill Onias.</b> Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them, and they ran after him.</b> Onias <b>ran to the palace of the king, and they ran after him. Anyone who saw him would say: This is him, this is him,</b> and he was not able to escape unnoticed. Onias <b>went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven. As it is stated: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border, to the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 19:19). According to Rabbi Yehuda, the temple of Onias was dedicated to the worship of God.
<b>And when the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this one,</b> Onias, <b>who fled from</b> the position of High Priest and offered it to his brother, still was overcome with <b>such</b> jealousy to the point where he tried to have Shimi killed, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who wants to enter</b> a prestigious position be jealous of the one who already has that position.
§ As a corollary to the statement of the Sages with regard to one who is jealous and wants the position of another, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Peraḥya said: Initially,</b> in response to <b>anyone who would say</b> to me: <b>Ascend to</b> the position of <i>Nasi</i>, <b>I would tie him up and place him in front of a lion</b> out of anger for his suggestion. <b>Now</b> that I have become the <i>Nasi</i>, in response to <b>anyone who tells me to leave</b> the position, <b>I</b> would <b>throw a kettle [<i>kumkum</i>] of boiling</b> water <b>at him</b> out of anger at his suggestion.
It is human nature that after one ascends to a prestigious position he does not wish to lose it. <b>As</b> evidence of this principle, <b>Saul</b> initially <b>fled from</b> the kingship, as he did not wish to be king, as stated in the verse: “When they sought him he could not be found…Behold he has hidden himself among the baggage” (I Samuel 10:21–22). <b>But when he ascended</b> to the kingship <b>he tried to kill David,</b> who he thought was trying to usurp his authority (see I Samuel, chapters 18–27).
§ <b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Abaye: What does Rabbi Meir do with this verse of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Since Rabbi Meir holds that the temple of Onias was dedicated to idol worship, how does he explain the verse in Isaiah?
Abaye answered Mar Kashisha and said that Rabbi Meir uses this verse <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>After the downfall of Sennacherib,</b> the king of Assyria who besieged Jerusalem (see II Kings, chapters 18–19), King <b>Hezekiah emerged</b> from Jerusalem <b>and found the</b> gentile <b>princes</b> Sennacherib had brought with him from his other conquests, <b>sitting in carriages [<i>bikronot</i>] of gold. He made them vow that they would not worship idols,</b> and they fulfilled their vow, <b>as it is stated</b> in Isaiah’s prophecy about Egypt: <b>“In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan</b>

Daf 110a

<b>and swear to the Lord of hosts;</b> one shall be called the city of destruction” (Isaiah 19:18). <b>They went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt,</b> and a pillar at its border, to the Lord” (Isaiah 19:19).
The verse states: <b>“One shall be called the city of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 19:18). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the verse: <b>“One shall be called the city of destruction”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Yosef translates</b> into Aramaic: Concerning <b>the City of the Sun, which will be destroyed in the future, it will be said that it is one of them. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the phrase: <b>“The city of destruction [<i>heres</i>],” the term</b> <i>heres</i> <b>is</b> referring <b>to the sun? As it is written: “Who commands the sun [<i>ḥeres</i>], and it does not rise;</b> and seals up the stars” (Job 9:7).
§ After mentioning the Jewish community in Egypt, the Gemara discusses Jewish communities in other locations. The verse states: “Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your seed from the east and gather you from the west; I will say to the north: Give up, and to the south: Keep not back, <b>bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth”</b> (Isaiah 43:5–6). What is the meaning of <b>“bring My sons from far”? Rav Huna says: These are the exiles of Babylonia, whose minds are calm, like sons,</b> and who can therefore focus properly on Torah study and mitzvot. What is the meaning of <b>“and My daughters from the end of the earth”? These are the exiles of other countries, whose minds are unsettled, like daughters.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba bar Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The gentiles living <b>from Tyre to Carthage recognize the Jewish people,</b> their religion, <b>and their Father in Heaven. But</b> those living <b>to the west of Tyre and to the east of Carthage recognize neither the Jewish people nor their Father in Heaven.</b>
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Rav</b> from the verse: <b>“From the rising of the sun until it sets, My name is great among the nations; and in every place offerings are presented to My name, and a pure meal offering;</b> for My name is great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 1:11). This indicates that God’s name is known across the entire world, even to the west of Tyre and the east of Carthage. Rav <b>said to him: Shimi,</b> is it <b>you</b> who is raising such an objection? The verse does not mean that they recognize God and worship him. Rather, it means <b>that</b> although they worship idols, <b>they call Him the God of gods.</b>
§ The verse states: “And <b>in every place offerings are presented to My name,</b> and a pure meal offering; for My name is great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts.” Does it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that it is permitted to sacrifice offerings <b>in every place?</b> Rather, <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: These are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah</b> study <b>in every place.</b> God says: <b>I ascribe them</b> credit <b>as though they burn and present</b> offerings <b>to My name.</b>
Furthermore, when the verse states: <b>“And a pure meal offering,” this</b> is referring to <b>one who studies Torah in purity,</b> i.e., one who first <b>marries a woman and afterward studies Torah.</b> Since he is married, he is not disturbed by sinful thoughts.
The Gemara cites another verse that praises Torah scholars. <b>“A Song of Ascents, Behold, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the House of the Lord at night”</b> (Psalms 134:1). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“at night,”</b> given that the Temple service is not performed at night and all the offerings must be sacrificed during the daytime? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah</b> study <b>at night. The verse ascribes them</b> credit <b>as though they engage in the</b> Temple <b>service.</b>
§ The Gemara cites another verse that is interpreted in a similar vein. King Solomon said to Hiram of Tyre: “Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to Him, and to burn before Him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the <i>Shabbatot</i>, and on the New Moons, and on the Festivals of the Lord our God. <b>This is an ordinance forever for Israel”</b> (II Chronicles 2:3). Since the Temple was eventually destroyed, what did Solomon mean when he said that it is “an ordinance forever”? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: This</b> is referring to the <b>altar</b> that remains <b>built</b> in Heaven even after the earthly Temple was destroyed, <b>and</b> the angel <b>Michael, the great minister, stands and sacrifices an offering upon it.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that there is an alternative explanation of the verse: <b>These are Torah scholars, who engage in</b> studying <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of</b> the Temple <b>service. The verse ascribes them</b> credit <b>as though the Temple was built in their days</b> and they are serving in it.
§ The Gemara cites similar interpretations of verses: <b>Reish Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the law [<i>torah</i>] of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering,</b> and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37)? This teaches that <b>anyone who engages in Torah</b> study is considered <b>as though he sacrificed a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, and a guilt offering.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> an objection to this interpretation: <b>This</b> verse states: <b>“Of the burnt offering, of the meal offering.”</b> If the interpretation of Reish Lakish is correct, the verse <b>should have</b> written: <b>“Burnt offering and meal offering.” Rather, Rava says</b> that the correct interpretation of this verse is: <b>Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>need not</b> bring <b>a burnt offering, nor a sin offering, nor a meal offering, nor a guilt offering.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), <b>and: “This is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1)? These verses teach that <b>anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of the sin offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a sin offering, and anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of a guilt offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a guilt offering.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a bird burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:2). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> from which this principle is derived? <b>“Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man, whether he consumes little or much”</b>(Ecclesiastes 5:11).The verse is interpreted as referring to one who brings an offering, and teaches that one who brings a substantial offering and one who brings a meager offering can be equally assured that their offering will be accepted.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “When goods increase, those who consume them increase; and what advantage is there to the owner,</b> except seeing them with his eyes?” (Ecclesiastes 5:10). One who brings a substantial offering, who thereby increases the number of priests who partake of it, does not have more merit than one who brings a meager offering. Rather, the offering that God desires is one where He recognizes, i.e., “seeing them with His eyes,” that its owner has the proper intent.
The Gemara addresses the expression “an aroma pleasing to the Lord” stated in the verses mentioned in the mishna. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai says: Come and see what is written in the portion of offerings: As</b> in these verses, the divine names <b><i>El</i> and <i>Elohim</i> are not stated, but</b> only <b>“the Lord.”</b> This is <b>so</b> as <b>not to give a claim to a litigant to argue.</b> Only one name of God is used in conjunction with all the various offerings, to prevent heretics from claiming that different offerings are brought to different gods.
<b>And it is stated with regard to a large bull</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a small bird</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b>
<b>And lest you say</b> that God <b>needs</b> these offerings <b>for consumption,</b> in which case a larger offering would be preferable to a smaller one, <b>the verse states: “If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and everything within it”</b> (Psalms 50:12). <b>And it is stated: “For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine”</b> (Psalms 50:10–11). Similarly, it is stated in the following verse: <b>“Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?”</b> (Psalms 50:13).
<b>I did not say to you: Sacrifice</b> offerings to me, <b>so that you will say: I will do His will,</b> i.e., fulfill His needs, <b>and He will do my will. You are not sacrificing to</b> fulfill <b>My will,</b> i.e., My needs, <b>but you are sacrificing to</b> fulfill <b>your will,</b> i.e., your needs, in order to achieve atonement for your sins by observing My mitzvot, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And when you sacrifice an offering of peace offerings to the Lord, <b>you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:5).
<b>Alternatively,</b> the verse: “And when you sacrifice an offering of peace offerings to the Lord, <b>you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted [<i>lirtzonkhem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), can be interpreted differently: <b>Sacrifice willingly [<i>lirtzonkhem</i>]; sacrifice intentionally.</b>
This is <b>as Shmuel asked Rav Huna: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares</b> in the case <b>of consecrated</b> items, i.e., if one slaughtered an offering without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, but rather appeared like one occupied with other matters, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to Shmuel: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), teaching that the mitzva is not performed properly <b>unless the slaughter is for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., with the knowledge that he is performing an act of slaughter.
Shmuel <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>We have this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already, that it is a mitzva to slaughter the offering for the sake of a bull, but <b>from where</b> is it derived that this requirement is <b>indispensable?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him</b> that the verse states: <b>“With your will you shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), i.e., <b>sacrifice intentionally,</b> in the form of a purposeful action.
