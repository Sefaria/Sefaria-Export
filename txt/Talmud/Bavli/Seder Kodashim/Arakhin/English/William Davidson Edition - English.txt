Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation</b> and is thereby obligated to donate to the Temple treasury the value fixed by the Torah (see Leviticus 27:3–7) for the age and sex of the person valuated. <b>And</b> similarly, everyone <b>is valuated,</b> and therefore one who vowed to donate his fixed value is obligated to pay. Likewise, everyone <b>vows</b> to donate to the Temple treasury the assessment of a person, based on his market value to be sold as a slave, and is thereby obligated to pay; <b>and</b> everyone is the object of <b>a vow</b> if others vowed to donate his assessment. This includes <b>priests, Levites and Israelites, women, and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves.</b>
<b>A <i>tumtum</i>,</b> whose sexual organs are concealed, <b>and a hermaphrodite [<i>androginos</i>], vow, and</b> are the object of <b>a vow, and take</b> vows of <b>valuation, but they are not valuated.</b> Consequently, if one says, with regard to a <i>tumtum</i>: The valuation of so-and-so is incumbent upon me to donate to the Temple treasury, he is not obligated to pay anything, <b>as only a definite male or a definite female are valuated.</b>
<b>A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> are the object of <b>a vow and are valuated, but neither vow</b> to donate the assessment of a person <b>nor take</b> a vow of <b>valuation, because they lack the</b> presumed <b>mental competence</b> to make a commitment.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the mishna’s statement: <b>Everyone [<i>hakol</i>] takes</b> vows of <b>valuation?</b> When a principle is stated in a mishna, it serves to include a particular case that it does not mention explicitly in its <i>halakha</i>. Which case is included by the broad statement here? The Gemara answers: The mishna teaches it <b>to add a discriminating</b> minor <b>on</b> the <b>brink of adulthood [<i>mufla samukh le’ish</i>],</b> i.e., during the year before a minor reaches majority.
The Gemara similarly asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement: And everyone <b>is valuated?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils,</b> who have no market value.
The Gemara explains why this addition is necessary: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as <b>it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), which juxtaposes one who is valuated to one who is the object of a vow, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments,</b> i.e., if he vows to pay his assessment he must pay it to the Temple, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations. But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> Since these people, a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils, are not subject to assessment, as they have no market value, perhaps they are also not subject to valuation.
Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that these too are subject to valuation, as the same verse also states: <b>“Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> indicating anyone who has <b>any amount</b> of life [<i>nefesh</i>] is subject to valuation.
The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the mishna’s statement: Everyone <b>vows</b> to donate the assessment of a person? The Gemara answers: Actually, this statement is not necessary, but it is mentioned because the continuation: And everyone is the object of <b>a vow, was necessary.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>What,</b> then, <b>is added</b> by the clause: And everyone is the object of <b>a vow? If</b> one were to suggest that this serves <b>to add a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> that cannot be correct, as they <b>are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna itself. <b>And if</b> one were to suggest that it serves <b>to add a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> they too <b>are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna.
And <b>if</b> you say that this clause serves <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a child who is <b>less than a month old,</b> who is not subject to valuation, is nevertheless subject to assessment, this too <b>is explicitly taught</b> in a mishna (5a). And <b>if</b> one were to say that it serves <b>to add a gentile,</b> that <b>is</b> also <b>explicitly taught</b> in a mishna (5b). The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the phrase: And everyone is the object of a vow, is mentioned in the mishna in order <b>to add</b> a child who is <b>less than a month old, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> in general terms <b>and then explains</b> it in detail later.
§ The Gemara inquires about similar general expressions that appear in other <i>mishnayot</i>. <b>What is added</b> by the mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 93a): <b>Everyone</b> who brings an offering <b>places hands</b> on the head of the animal? The Gemara answers: This clause serves <b>to add</b> that <b>an heir</b> places hands on the offering of the deceased, <b>and</b> the mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that an heir does not place his hands on an offering he inherited.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Temura</i> 2a): <b>Everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal? The Gemara answers: Here too, the mishna serves <b>to add</b> that <b>an heir</b> substitutes a non-sacred animal for his father’s consecrated animal, i.e., the non-sacred animal also becomes sanctified. <b>And</b> this mishna is also <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as he maintains that an heir cannot substitute a non-sacred animal for the consecrated animal he inherited.
The Gemara cites the source for these two opinions of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An heir places hands</b> on his father’s offering, and <b>an heir can effect substitution</b> for an offering inherited from his father. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: An heir does not place hands</b> and <b>an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> With regard to placing of hands, he expounds the term: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), as teaching that one places his hands only on his own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>his father’s offering. And</b> with regard to the ruling that an heir cannot effect substitution, Rabbi Yehuda <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution, in which a previously non-sacred animal is consecrated, <b>from the final stage of consecration,</b> the act of placing hands, which is performed upon an already-consecrated animal immediately before it is slaughtered: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir does not place hands, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration, an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>
<b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive their opinion? The verse states: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), with the doubled form of <i>hamer yamir</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one capable of effecting substitution. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>derive the final stage of consecration,</b> i.e., the placing of hands, <b>from the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration an heir can effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir can place hands.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> term: <b>“His offering,”</b> from which Rabbi Yehuda derives that an heir does not place his hands? The Gemara explains how the Rabbis expound each mention of the term, which appears three times (Leviticus 3:2, 7, 12). One instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on the <b>offering of a gentile.</b> Another instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on the <b>offering of another</b> person. The third instance of <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands,</b> i.e., they are all required to place their hands on the offering.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And</b> how does Rabbi Yehuda respond to this claim? The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not hold</b> that one of the mentions serves <b>to include all owners</b> of a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b> Rather, one of the owners places his hands on the offering on behalf of the entire group. Consequently, he is left with one spare mention of “his offering,” from which he derives that an heir does not place his hands. The Gemara adds: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can say that Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that one of the mentions serves to include owners of a jointly owned offering,

Daf 2b

but he maintains that the exclusion of <b>a gentile and</b> the exclusion of the offering of <b>another</b> person from the requirement of placing hands are <b>derived from</b> the same <b>one</b> mention of “his offering” in the <b>verse.</b> This <b>leaves two</b> mentions of “his offering” <b>for</b> Rabbi Yehuda. <b>One</b> he expounds to teach that he places hands on <b>“his offering,” but not</b> on <b>his father’s offering</b> that he inherited, <b>and the other</b> mention remains <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda, what does he do</b> with the use of the doubled form <b>in this</b> verse: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it to include a woman</b> among those who can effect substitution. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since the entire matter</b> of substitution <b>is stated</b> in the Torah <b>only in the masculine form, what</b> is the reason that <b>we ultimately</b> come <b>to include a woman? The verse states: “And if he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>],”</b> using a doubled form.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they learn that a woman can perform substitution? The Gemara answers: They derive it <b>from</b> the extra “and” in the phrase: <b>“And if</b> he shall substitute” (Leviticus 27:10). <b>But Rabbi Yehuda does not expound</b> the extra “and” in the term <b>“and if”</b> at all.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor who does not need his mother</b> when he awakes in the middle of the night. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 28a): <b>A minor who does not need his mother is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: This clause serves <b>to add a minor who knows</b> how <b>to wave</b> the <i>lulav</i>. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 42a): <b>A minor who knows</b> how <b>to wave</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i>.</b>
The Gemara continues to ask similar questions: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes?</b> The Gemara explains that this serves <b>to add a minor who knows</b> how <b>to wrap himself</b> in a garment. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A minor who knows</b> how <b>to wrap himself</b> in a garment <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>phylacteries?</b> The Gemara answers that it serves <b>to add a minor who knows</b> how <b>to preserve</b> the sanctity of <b>phylacteries</b> by maintaining a state of bodily cleanliness. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a minor who knows</b> how <b>to preserve</b> the sanctity of <b>phylacteries</b> in a state of cleanliness, <b>his father purchases phylacteries for him.</b>
§ The Gemara further inquires: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a): <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear in the Temple and to sacrifice an offering on the three pilgrimage Festivals. The Gemara answers: The mishna serves <b>to add one who is a half-slave half-freeman,</b> e.g., a Canaanite slave who was owned jointly, and only one of his owners freed him.
The Gemara explains: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina, who said: One who is half-slave half-freeman is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance</b> in the Temple, that clause serves <b>to add</b> one who was <b>lame on</b> the <b>first day</b> of the Festival and was unable to travel, and was therefore exempt at the time, <b>but</b> who <b>was healed on</b> the <b>second day</b> of the Festival. This man is obligated to appear in the Temple before the end of the Festival.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>all</b> seven days of a Festival <b>rectify one another,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear applies equally to all days of the Festival, not just the first. Consequently, one who was exempt on the first day is nevertheless obligated on the second day. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the main obligation is on the first day and that <b>all</b> the remaining days merely <b>rectify the first</b> day, a person who was lame on the first day of the Festival remains exempt throughout the rest of the Festival. If so, <b>what</b> does the statement of the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a serve <b>to add?</b>
The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> one who is <b>blind in one of his eyes,</b> and teaches that he is obligated to appear in the Temple, whereas one who is entirely blind is exempt. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this ruling is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> One who is <b>blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three times in the year all your males shall appear [<i>yera’eh</i>] before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). According to the way in which the verse is written, without vocalization, it can be read as <b><i>yireh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall see,</b> instead of <b><i>yera’eh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall appear.</b> This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear,</b> i.e., to be seen: <b>Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both of one’s eyes, so too,</b> the obligation <b>to appear</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> This is one possible explanation for what is added by the general statement of the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a, according to Ravina.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> that statement serves <b>to include one who is half-slave and half-freeman. And</b> with regard to <b>what was difficult</b> for you <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Ravina,</b> that he exempts such a person from the obligation of appearance, it is <b>not difficult: Here</b> the ruling is <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the initial</b> version of the <b>mishna,</b> whereas <b>there</b> it is <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the ultimate</b> version of the <b>mishna.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 88a): <b>One who is half-slave and half-freeman serves his master one day,</b> as he is half a slave, <b>and</b> works for <b>himself one day,</b> since he is half free. This is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>
<b>Beit Shammai said to them: You have</b> thereby <b>remedied</b> the situation of <b>his master,</b> who fully derives benefit from all his rights to the slave, <b>but you have not remedied his own</b> situation. How so? <b>He cannot marry a maidservant,</b> as half of him is free, and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <b>He is</b> also <b>unable</b> to marry <b>a free woman,</b> as half of him is still a slave, and a Jewish woman may not marry a Canaanite slave. And if you say <b>he should be idle,</b> i.e., refrain from marrying, <b>but isn’t it</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated:</b> “For so said the Lord that created the heavens…Who formed the earth and made it, He established it. <b>He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)?
<b>Rather, for the betterment of the world,</b> i.e., so that the slave will be able to engage in procreation, the court <b>forces his master to make him a freeman</b> by emancipating the half that he owns. <b>And</b> the slave <b>writes a bill to</b> his master accepting responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to him over time, as currently he has no property with which to redeem himself. <b>And Beit Hillel</b> ultimately <b>retracted</b> their opinion, <b>to rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that a half-slave must be emancipated. The ruling of the mishna that a half-slave must appear in the Temple is in accordance with this opinion, which holds that the master must free him. Ravina’s statement that he is not obligated to appear in the Temple is in accordance with the initial mishna, according to which Beit Hillel held that the master is not forced to free the half-slave.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to sound the shofar?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor who reached</b> the age of <b>training</b> in mitzvot. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 32b): <b>One</b> need <b>not prevent minors from sounding</b> the shofar <b>on</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana, despite the fact that they are not obligated in mitzvot.
The Gemara asks: With regard to the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>reading</b> the <b>Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, and the statement of the mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 19b): <b>Everyone is fit to read the Megilla,</b> these serve <b>to add</b>

Daf 3a

<b>what?</b> The Gemara answers: They serve <b>to add women, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Women are obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>reading</b> the <b>Megilla, as they too were</b> participants <b>in that miracle.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to form a <i>zimmun</i></b> and recite Grace after Meals as a group? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to add women and slaves. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Women form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves and slaves form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves.</b>
The Gemara further inquires: <b>What is added</b> by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is included in a <i>zimmun</i>?</b> This serves <b>to add a minor who knows to Whom</b> one <b>recites a blessing. As Rav Naḥman says:</b> A minor who <b>knows to Whom</b> one <b>recites a blessing is included in a <i>zimmun</i>.</b>
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the clause in the mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>]?</b> This serves <b>to add</b> that even <b>a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge becomes impure. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>A man. Why</b> does <b>the verse state:</b> “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2)? This serves <b>to include a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge, to teach <b>that</b> even <b>he becomes impure as</b> one who experiences <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that this amplification <b>is not necessary,</b> as the verse <b>states: “And of them that have an issue, whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“A male”</b> includes <b>anyone who is male, whether a small child or an adult; “a female”</b> includes <b>anyone who is female, whether a small child or an adult. If so, why</b> does <b>the verse state: “Any man”? The Torah spoke in the language of men,</b> i.e., this is a normal way to phrase the sentence, and therefore one should not derive a <i>halakha</i> from the extra word.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone becomes impure with impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse?</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches it <b>to add a minor.</b> The Gemara elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since the verse states: “But the <b>man that shall be impure and shall not purify himself”</b> (Numbers 19:20), one should derive from here that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>yes,</b> he becomes impure, but <b>a minor</b> does <b>not.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> in the context of purification with purification water from impurity imparted by a corpse: “And sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, <b>and upon the persons that were there”</b> (Numbers 19:18). This indicates that all persons who were there became impure, regardless of age.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> does the term “the <b>man”</b> serve <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude a minor from excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>],</b> which is mentioned in that verse: “That soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord” (Numbers 19:20). In other words, the term “the man” serves to teach that if a minor becomes impure and then enters the Temple, he is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>.
The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 3:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>leprous marks?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor.</b> As it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: “He is <b>a leprous man,</b> he is impure” (Leviticus 13:44), this is teaching that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>yes,</b> he does become impure, but <b>a minor</b> does <b>not.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a minor becomes impure by means of leprous marks.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>indeed so,</b> that a minor does not become impure by means of leprous marks? The Gemara answers that the verse states: <b>“When a person shall have in the skin of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 13:2), to include all people, <b>in any case,</b> irrespective of age.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>why do I</b> need the term: “He is a leprous <b>man”</b> (Leviticus 13:44)? The Gemara answers: It comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase “he is a leprous <b>man” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a leprous <b>man. From where</b> is it derived that leprous marks also render <b>a woman</b> impure? <b>When</b> the subsequent verse <b>states: “And the leper</b> in whom the affliction is” (Leviticus 13:45), <b>there are two</b> individuals indicated <b>here,</b> male and female, as this verse did not need to restate: “And the leper,” since the subject of this clause was clear from the previous verse.
<b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “A leprous <b>man”?</b> This is referring <b>to the matter of</b> the leper rending his clothes and letting his hair grow wild, which is stated in the verse <b>below:</b> “His clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose” (Leviticus 13:45). The verse therefore teaches that <b>a man</b> who is a leper <b>lets</b> his hair <b>grow and rends</b> his garments, <b>but a woman</b> who is a leper <b>does not let</b> her hair <b>grow and</b> does not <b>rend</b> her garments.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone may inspect leprous marks</b> in order to declare them pure or impure, and the clause of another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is fit to inspect leprous marks</b> in order to declare them pure or impure. The Gemara answers: These statements serve <b>to add</b> a priest who <b>is not expert in</b> distinguishing between <b>them,</b> the different types of leprous marks, <b>and in</b> identifying <b>their names.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Master say</b> that any priest who is <b>not expert in</b> distinguishing between <b>them and in</b> identifying <b>their names is not</b> authorized to <b>inspect the leprous marks</b> and make a decision with regard to them? <b>Ravina said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that the priest is fit, is referring to a situation <b>where</b> if <b>they explain to him he understands;</b> whereas <b>that</b> statement, that he is not fit, is referring to a case <b>where</b> even if <b>they explain to him he</b> still <b>does not understand.</b>
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): <b>Everyone</b> is <b>fit to sanctify</b> the ashes of the red heifer, i.e., to pour the water over them? The Gemara answers that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda</b> the statement serves <b>to add a minor, and according to the Rabbis,</b> who disqualify a minor, it serves <b>to add a woman. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): <b>Everyone is fit to sanctify</b> the ashes of the red heifer <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor. Rabbi Yehuda deems a minor fit, but deems a woman and a hermaphrodite,</b> who has both male and female characteristics, <b>unfit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:10): <b>Everyone is qualified to sprinkle</b> the purification waters on one who is ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse? The Gemara answers that this serves <b>to add one who is uncircumcised. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If <b>one who is uncircumcised sprinkled</b> the purification water, <b>his sprinkling is valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 2a, 15b): <b>Everyone slaughters?</b> The Gemara explains that the mishna teaches this <b>once to add a Samaritan</b> who slaughters, i.e., his slaughter is valid. <b>And</b> the <b>one</b> other mention of this serves <b>to add a Jew</b> who is <b>an apostate [<i>meshummad</i>].</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 110b): <b>Everyone</b> can force others <b>to ascend to Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., one can compel his family and household to immigrate to Eretz Yisrael?

Daf 3b

The Gemara answers: The mishna teaches this clause <b>to add slaves.</b> If a slave wishes to ascend to Eretz Yisrael, he can force his master to either ascend with him, or to sell him to someone who will ascend, or to free him. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who teaches slaves explicitly</b> in the mishna, <b>what</b> does this phrase serve <b>to add?</b> The Gemara answers that it serves <b>to add</b> the case of one who wishes to compel his family to move <b>from a pleasant residence</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>to a noxious residence</b> in Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara adds that when that same mishna teaches, in its continuation: <b>But all may not remove</b> others from Eretz Yisrael, this serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a slave who fled from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to Eretz</b> Yisrael. The master may not bring him back to outside of Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara discusses another statement of that same mishna: <b>All</b> can force their family <b>to ascend to Jerusalem.</b> This serves <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one may compel his family to move <b>from a pleasant residence</b> outside of Jerusalem <b>to a noxious residence</b> in Jerusalem. The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the next clause of that mishna: <b>And none can remove</b> them from Jerusalem? The Gemara explains that this serves <b>to add</b> that one cannot compel his family to leave Jerusalem, even <b>from a noxious residence</b> in Jerusalem <b>to a pleasant residence</b> elsewhere in Eretz Yisrael.
§ The Gemara discusses several other cases where a mishna or <i>baraita</i> states that everyone is obligated in a particular mitzva. A <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? If these</b> people <b>are not obligated</b> to perform the mitzva, then <b>who is obligated</b> to perform it?
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside</b> seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), one can argue as follows: <b>The Master said</b> that this teaches: <b>Reside seven days as you dwell</b> in your permanent home: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>dwelling,</b> a <b>man and his wife</b> typically reside together, <b>so too,</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i></b> must be performed by <b>a man and his wife</b> residing together. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are</b> occupied <b>with</b> the Temple <b>service</b> during the Festival and are not free to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> together with their wives, perhaps they <b>should not be obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, as <b>although</b> priests are <b>exempt at the time of</b> the Temple <b>service, when it is not the time of</b> Temple <b>service they are obligated, just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to travelers. As the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Travelers</b> who are on the move <b>during the day are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i> during the day but are obligated at night,</b> as they are not traveling at that time.
§ The Gemara cites a similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks again: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as <b>it may enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds,</b> wool and linen together. <b>You shall prepare yourself twisted cords</b> upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:11–12), <b>it is</b> only <b>one who is not permitted to wear diverse kinds who is obligated in the mitzva of ritual fringes. But</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since diverse kinds are permitted for them</b> when they perform the Temple service, as the belt of the priestly vestments contains diverse kinds, <b>they should not be obligated</b> in the mitzva of ritual fringes.
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>although</b> priests are <b>permitted</b> to wear diverse kinds <b>at the time</b> when they perform the Temple <b>service, when</b> it is <b>not the time of</b> the Temple <b>service</b> they are <b>not permitted</b> to wear diverse kinds. Consequently, they are obligated in ritual fringes, as they do not have an absolute dispensation from the prohibition of diverse kinds.
§ The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>phylacteries,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara again asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>it was necessary</b> to say that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:8), perhaps this juxtaposition teaches that <b>anyone included in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the phylacteries of the <b>arm</b> is also <b>included in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the phylacteries of the <b>head.</b>
<b>And</b> in the case of <b>these priests, since they are not included in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the phylacteries of the <b>arm, as it is written</b> with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“He shall put upon his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), which teaches <b>that nothing may interpose between</b> the priestly vestments <b>and his flesh,</b> and therefore he may not wear the phylacteries of the arm, which would interpose, perhaps one would <b>say</b> that priests <b>should also not be obligated in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the phylacteries of the <b>head.</b>
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> the absence of one of the two types of phylacteries <b>do not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the other. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 38a): Absence of the <b>phylacteries of</b> the <b>arm does not prevent fulfillment</b> of the mitzva of the phylacteries <b>of the head, and</b> likewise the absence of the phylacteries <b>of</b> the <b>head does not prevent fulfillment</b> of the mitzva of the phylacteries <b>of</b> the <b>arm.</b> If one has only one type, he dons it without the other. Consequently, the priests are obligated in the mitzva of phylacteries of the head during the time of their Temple service.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about the phylacteries <b>of the arm?</b> You claim that priests are exempt from this obligation, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“He shall put upon his flesh.”</b> If so, they should <b>also</b> be exempt from donning the phylacteries of the <b>head,</b> as <b>it is written</b> with regard to the High Priest: <b>“And you shall set the mitre upon his head”</b> (Exodus 29:6). Since the phylacteries of the head would interpose between his head and the mitre, he should be exempt from the mitzva of the phylacteries of the head.
The Gemara answers by citing a <i>halakha</i> that the Sages <b>taught:</b> The <b>hair of</b> the High Priest <b>was visible between the frontplate and the mitre.</b> The frontplate was set on the forehead, below the hairline, while the mitre was set above it. In <b>that</b> space <b>there</b> the High Priest <b>would don</b> his <b>phylacteries.</b> Consequently, the phylacteries did not interpose between the mitre and the High Priest’s head.
§ The Gemara cites yet another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to sound the shofar,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara once again asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since it is written:</b> “And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month…<b>it shall be a day of sounding for you”</b> (Numbers 29:1), you might have said that <b>one who is</b> obligated <b>to sound on only one day is obligated</b> to sound the shofar on Rosh HaShana.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>these priests</b> it is different, <b>since they are obligated to sound all year</b> long, as they sound trumpets when they sacrifice the offerings in the Temple on other Festivals, <b>as it is written: “And you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings,</b> and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings” (Numbers 10:10), you might therefore <b>say</b> that <b>they should not be obligated</b> to sound the shofar on Rosh HaShana. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that even priests are obligated to fulfill this mitzva. The Gemara questions this comparison: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable? There,</b> on the other special occasions throughout the year, the priests sound <b>trumpets,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> on Rosh HaShana, the issue is blowing the <b>shofar.</b>
Rather, <b>it was necessary</b> to say that priests are obligated to fulfill this mitzva for a different reason. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 26b): Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is the same as Rosh HaShana,</b> with respect <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> shofar <b>blasts and to the</b> three additional <b>blessings</b> that are recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer, I might have said <b>that one who is</b> fully included <b>in the mitzva of the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is</b> also included <b>in the mitzva of Rosh HaShana,</b> and <b>that one who is not</b> included <b>in the mitzva of the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is</b> likewise <b>not</b> included <b>in the mitzva of Rosh HaShana. But</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are not</b> fully included <b>in the mitzva of the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (see 26b): <b>Priests and Levites</b> may <b>sell</b> their fields <b>at any time,</b> even in the Jubilee Year,

Daf 4a

<b>and they</b> may also <b>redeem</b> lands that they sold <b>at any time,</b> i.e., even right after selling the field, and are not bound by the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year, one might <b>say</b> that <b>they should</b> also <b>not be obligated to fulfill the mitzva of</b> blowing the shofar on <b>Rosh HaShana.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. This is due to the fact that <b>although</b> priests <b>are not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>release of land, in any event they are</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>release of money</b> and in the <b>release of slaves</b> in the Jubilee Year. Therefore, the priests are obligated in the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShana.
§ The Gemara cites another similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in the reading of the Megilla</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks as before: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> teach that they <b>cancel their service</b> in the Temple and come to hear the reading of the Megilla, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance</b> with <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says. As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The priests at their</b> Temple <b>service, and the Levites on their platform</b> in the Temple where they sang the daily psalm, <b>and the Israelites at their</b> non-priestly <b>watches</b> for the offerings of the community, all <b>cancel their service and come to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b>
The Gemara cites yet another similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to form a <i>zimmun</i></b> and recite Grace after Meals, including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the priests <b>partake of sacrificial</b> meat. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made”</b> (Exodus 29:33), indicating that the owners of those offerings thereby achieve atonement, <b>and</b> therefore <b>this</b> consumption <b>is</b> an obligatory ritual act to bring about <b>atonement,</b> consequently, it is not considered a social meal requiring one to form a <i>zimmun</i>.
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And you shall eat, and be satisfied,</b> and bless the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10), the obligation to recite Grace after Meals is contingent upon eating and being satisfied. Since <b>there is</b> eating and satisfaction in the case of priests partaking of the sacrificial meat, they are obligated to form a <i>zimmun</i>, despite the fact that the purpose of the meal is to bring about atonement.
The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone joins a <i>zimmun</i>: Priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks again: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the <b>priests are partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of produce designated for priests, <b>or sacrificial</b> meat, <b>and a non-priest is eating non-sacred</b> food.
In such a case, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since if the non-priest wants to eat together with the priest he cannot eat</b> with him from the <i>teruma</i>, as it is forbidden to him, one could <b>say</b> that <b>he cannot join</b> with the priests for a <i>zimmun</i>. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that he can join them, as <b>although a non-priest cannot eat together with a priest</b> from his <i>teruma</i>, nevertheless, <b>a priest can eat together with a non-priest</b> from his food. Consequently, they can join together to form a <i>zimmun</i>.
§ The Gemara applies the same line of questioning to the mishna here: <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation…priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> Isn’t that <b>obvious? Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary only according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bukhri,</b> who holds that priests are not obligated to contribute a yearly half-shekel to purchase the communal supplies. Therefore, one might have thought that they are not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of valuations, as the Gemara will explain. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:4) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>ben Bukhri testified</b> before the Sages <b>in Yavne: Any priest who contributes</b> the half-<b>shekel</b> for communal offerings <b>is not</b> considered <b>a sinner,</b> despite the fact that he is not obligated to contribute.
Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, any priest who does not contribute his</b> half-<b>shekel</b> is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated in this mitzva like all other Jews. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the priests</b> who do not contribute the half-shekel, in order to excuse themselves from the mitzva they <b>interpret this verse to their own</b> advantage: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16).
Those priests claim as follows: <b>Since</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering, the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat, brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the shewbread</b> placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, which are all meal offerings, <b>are ours,</b> i.e., if we would contribute half-shekels we would have partial ownership of these communal offerings, as they are purchased with the half-shekels, <b>how</b> then <b>can they be eaten?</b> They would be regarded as priests’ meal offerings, which must be wholly burnt, in accordance with the aforementioned verse.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bukhri, as well,</b> why is a priest who contributes a half-shekel not considered a sinner? <b>Since he is not obligated to bring</b> the half-shekel <b><i>ab initio</i>, when he brings</b> the half-shekel <b>he is also a sinner, since he is</b> causing the <b>bringing</b> of <b>a non-sacred</b> item <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> The Gemara answers <b>that</b> the priest <b>brings and transfers</b> the half-shekel as a consecrated gift <b>to the community,</b> so it is considered part of the communal funds.
The Gemara explains the relevance of ben Bukhri’s opinion to the question of the priests’ status with respect to valuations. According to ben Bukhri, who exempts the priests from contributing the half-shekel, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25), perhaps this juxtaposition teaches that <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the obligation to contribute half-<b>shekels is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations. But</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are not</b> included <b>in</b> the obligation to contribute half-<b>shekels, they are</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even according to the opinion of ben Bukhri, priests are included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: One could not have thought that <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“And all your valuations</b> shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:25), might be coming to exempt the priests, as <b>it comes to</b> teach something else, namely that <b>all valuations that you assess should not be less than</b> the value of <b>a <i>sela</i></b> coin. In other words, a poor person, who gives according to his means rather than the amount prescribed in the Torah, does not fulfill his obligation unless he gives at least a shekel, which is a <i>sela</i> coin.
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> It <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that priests are included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> with regard to a firstborn: <b>“And their redemption money, from a month old you shall redeem them, shall be, according to your valuation,</b> five shekels of silver” (Numbers 18:16), one might have said that <b>anyone</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>redemption of the</b> firstborn <b>son is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations; but</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>redemption of the</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> they <b>are</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that priests are also included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations.
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If that is so,</b> that one can expound the term “according to your valuation” in this manner, one could expound similarly <b>with regard to</b> the <b>ram of</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> brought by one who robs and then takes a false oath. <b>As it is written</b> with regard to that offering: <b>“And he shall bring his guilt offering to the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 5:25). One can argue that <b>so too, anyone</b> who <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations is</b> included <b>in the ram of the guilt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite, who are not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations,</b> as stated in the mishna, should also <b>not</b> be included <b>in the ram of the guilt offering.</b> But that is not so, as there is no opinion that exempts them from this offering.
<b>Rather, Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Ashi:</b> It <b>was necessary</b> to teach that priests are included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation because <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> concerning valuations: “But if he is too poor for your valuation, <b>then he shall be set before the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:8), this indicates that a poor man is placed before the priest for valuation, <b>but a priest is not</b> placed <b>before</b> another <b>priest</b> for valuation. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that priests are also included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations.
§ The Gemara stated (2a) that the mishna’s statement: And everyone <b>is valuated,</b> serves <b>to add</b> that <b>a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils</b> are valuated in accordance with the Torah’s categories of age and sex despite their lack of market value. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived?
The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). The term serves <b>to include an unspecified valuation,</b> as explained below. <b>Alternatively,</b> the verse teaches that <b>one gives the valuation of his entire</b> self <b>and not the valuation of</b> his <b>limbs.</b> If someone vows that he will give the valuation of a limb, he is not obligated to give anything.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>exclude even</b> the valuation of <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent,</b> without which one would die, e.g., the liver. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> which teaches that if one valuated a limb upon which the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] is dependent, he is obligated to give the valuation of his entire self. The Gemara further derives from the term <b>“persons”</b> that one is obligated to pay the valuation only of a live person, <b>and not</b> the valuation of <b>the dead.</b> If one valuates a deceased person, his statement is of no effect.
Furthermore, one might have thought that <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the dead</b> from valuation, <b>but I should not exclude a moribund</b> person, who is about to die but is still alive, and who is therefore included in the category of “persons.” Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>setting,</b> i.e., he can stand, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuation. And anyone not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>setting,</b> who cannot stand, e.g., one who is on his deathbed, is <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuation.</b> Therefore, one who valuates a moribund individual is not obligated to pay anything.
<b>Alternatively,</b> since the verse states: <b>“Persons,”</b> in the plural, it is expounded as follows: Were the verse to have written: A person, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this applies to <b>one</b> person <b>who valuated one</b> person. <b>From where</b> is it derived that even if <b>one</b> person <b>valuated a hundred</b> people, it is also an effective evaluation? <b>The verse states: “Persons,”</b> in the plural. This teaches that in such a case he must pay the valuation of each and every one of the hundred. <b>Alternatively,</b> one interprets the plural form of <b>“persons”</b> as follows: Were the verse to have written only: A person, one might have said that

Daf 4b

<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies in a case of <b>a man who valuated</b> another, <b>whether a man or a woman,</b> as the section begins: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow” (Leviticus 27:2). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> of valuations also applies to <b>a woman who valuated a man,</b> or <b>a woman who valuated a woman?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> same <b>verse states:</b> “Vow of <b>persons</b> to the Lord, according to your valuation,” to include women.
<b>Alternatively,</b> the word <b>“persons”</b> serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils.</b> If one valuates such a person, he is obligated to give the set amount according to age and sex.
This derivation is necessary <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse states: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), it is juxtaposing a person who is valuated and one who is the object of a vow. Therefore, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments,</b> i.e., one who is obligated to pay his assessment to the Temple if he takes such a vow, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> If he vows to pay his valuation, he must pay. <b>But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> Having no market value, these people are not subject to assessment, and are consequently also not subject to valuation. <b>The verse,</b> therefore, <b>states: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> teaching that anyone who has any amount of life [<i>nefesh</i>] is subject to valuation.
A <i>baraita</i> teaches that the apparently superfluous phrase: <b>“Then your valuation shall be”</b> (Leviticus 27:3), serves <b>to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments,</b> despite the fact that they are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. If one assesses a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite, he is obligated to give that assessment. The <i>baraita</i> explains <b>that</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse states: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation,” anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments, but anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be,”</b> to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in the <i>halakha</i> of assessment.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This <i>halakha</i>, that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are not included in valuation, is derived from the term: <b>“The male”</b> (Leviticus 27:3). The definite article teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to <b>a male, and not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite <b>should not be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a man, but</b> they <b>should be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be for the male…and if it be a female”</b> (Leviticus 27:3–4). This teaches that valuation applies only to <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite,</b> who are categorized as neither male nor female.
§ <b>The Master said</b> above in the beginning of the <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include an unspecified valuation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>an unspecified valuation?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>an unspecified valuation,</b> without specifying any particular person, <b>gives</b> the amount <b>of the smallest of the valuations. And how much is the smallest of the valuations?</b> It is <b>three shekels,</b> which is the valuation of a female who is younger than five years old (Leviticus 27:6).
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that one who does not specify a person should give <b>fifty</b> shekels, which is the largest of the valuations, that of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty (Leviticus 27:3)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: This ruling is based on the principle that if <b>you grasped a lot you did not grasp</b> anything, but if <b>you grasped a little, you grasped</b> something. In other words, if one can derive two sums from the verses, one should choose the smaller number, as it is included within the larger number and is therefore considered certain.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that smallest of the valuations is one <b>shekel, as it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to affordability.</b> If one vows to donate the valuation of a person to the Temple treasury but does not have sufficient funds to fulfill his vow, he must pay at least a shekel.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> since the payment of three shekels can be derived from the principle of grasping the lesser amount, <b>why do I</b> need <b>the verse</b> “according to your valuation”? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The verse is required <b>to teach that</b> unlike other valuations, where a person who cannot afford the set amount can fulfill his obligation with one shekel, in the case of an unspecified valuation even a poor person’s obligation <b>is not determined by affordability,</b> and he must give at least three shekels. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: It is because it is <b>considered as though</b> he <b>explicitly</b> vowed that he is obligated to pay three shekels. The principle of affordability applies only to the valuations fixed by the Torah.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> the opposite: The term “according to your valuation” actually teaches that even an unspecified valuation is <b>determined based on affordability,</b> and a poor person fulfills his obligation by giving one shekel. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Why would one think that this case differs from any other valuation? The Gemara answers that the verse is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that one who obligates himself in an unspecified valuation is <b>considered as though</b> he <b>articulated</b> that he is obligated to pay three shekels, and may not pay less. Therefore, this verse <b>teaches us</b> that an unspecified valuation is also subject to affordability, like other valuations.
§ It is further stated in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>Alternatively,</b> the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> teaches that <b>one gives the valuation of his entire</b> self <b>and does not give the valuation of</b> the <b>value of limbs.</b> If one vows that he will give the valuation of a limb, he is not obligated to give anything. The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> from <b>this</b> term: “According to your valuation,” the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an unspecified valuation.</b> How can you then derive another <i>halakha</i> from the same source? The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> this term two sources, as it could have merely written: <b>“Valuation,”</b> and instead it wrote: <b>“According to your valuation.”</b>
The <i>baraita</i> adds: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>exclude</b> even the valuation of <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent,</b> without which one will die, e.g., the head. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> which teaches that if one valuated a limb upon which the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] is dependent, he is obligated to give the valuation of his entire self. In addition, we derive from <b>“persons”</b> that one is obligated to pay only the valuation of a live person, <b>and not</b> the valuation of <b>the dead.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> from <b>this</b> term: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],” that one who valuates a limb upon which the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] is dependent is obligated to give the valuation of his entire self. The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse two derivations, as it could have merely written: <b>Person,</b> and instead it wrote: <b>Persons.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Perhaps <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the dead</b> from valuation, as they no longer possess life [<i>nefesh</i>], <b>but I should not exclude a moribund</b> person, as he is still alive. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that anyone included in the category of setting, i.e., who can stand, is included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation. But one who is on his deathbed is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let me also derive</b> that the <b>dead</b> are not subject to valuation <b>from</b> the same verse: <b>“Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him,” as the dead cannot stand. Why do I need to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the fact that the verse wrote: “Persons,” instead of person? The Gemara answers that <b>so too,</b> this is correct, i.e., the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the dead is derived from that same verse. <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>why do I</b> need the derivation based on the difference between <b>person</b> and <b>“persons”?</b> The Gemara answers that this teaches a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>as we are about to state below,</b> i.e., to add a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils.
The Gemara continues its review of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Alternatively,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Persons,”</b> in the plural, it is expounded as follows. Were the verse to have written only: A person, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this applies to <b>one</b> person who <b>valuated one</b> person. <b>From where</b> is it derived that even if <b>one</b> person <b>valuated a hundred</b> people, this is also an effective evaluation? Thefore, <b>the verse states: “Persons,”</b> in the plural.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can expound the plural form of <b>“persons”</b> as follows: Were the verse to have written only: A person, one might have said that <b>I can</b> derive <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a man who valuates</b> anyone, <b>whether a man or a woman,</b> as the section begins: “When a man clearly utters a vow” (Leviticus 27:2). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> of valuations also applies to <b>a woman who valuated a man, or a woman who valuated a woman? The</b> same <b>verse states:</b> “Vow of <b>persons</b> to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to include women.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> the word <b>“persons”</b> serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>these</b> cases, i.e., one who valuated a hundred men or a woman who valuated, from “persons.” How, then, can you derive the <i>halakha</i> of a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils from this same word?
The Gemara answers: <b>These do not require</b> another <b>verse. What is the reason?</b> Each of these <i>halakhot</i> <b>is equivalent</b> to the others, i.e., each derivation from the word: Person, is equally valid. It teaches that one may valuate a limb that is vital to a person, that both men and women may take a vow of valuation, and that one may vow to give the valuation of multiple people. There is no reason to prefer one of these derivations over the others. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>all of them are derived</b> from the word: Person. <b>When the verse,</b> i.e., the plural term “persons,” <b>is required,</b> it <b>is required</b> only <b>to</b> include <b>a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> also teaches that the phrase: <b>“Then your valuation shall be”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments,</b> despite the fact that they are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to include them in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments?</b> Even <b>let</b> this <b>be</b> considered <b>only</b> like the <b>assessment of a tree; were</b> one to <b>say: The assessment of</b> that <b>tree</b> is incumbent upon me, <b>is he not</b> obligated to <b>give</b> its assessment?
<b>Rava said:</b> The verse serves <b>to say that</b> a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that one specified. If one vowed to give a vital part of his body, he is not merely obligated to pay the value of that organ but must give the value of his entire body.
As it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation,”</b> a person who is valuated is juxtaposed to one who is the object of a vow of assessments. Therefore, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of being <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that he specifies. <b>But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations,</b> such as a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite, <b>is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of being <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that he specifies. Therefore, the verse teaches that although a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are not included in valuations, they are nevertheless included in the <i>halakha</i> of being assessed by the significance of the body part in question.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>And is it true</b> that one who <b>is not</b> included <b>in valuations is</b> nevertheless <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that he specifies? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one says: The <b>head of this slave</b> is <b>consecrated property, he and the Temple</b> treasury are <b>partners in</b> the entire slave. Similarly, if one says to another: The <b>head of</b> this <b>slave</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> they <b>appraise</b> the slave and split the value <b>between them.</b> Likewise, if one says: The <b>head of this donkey</b> is <b>consecrated property, he and the Temple</b> treasury are <b>partners in</b> the donkey. And if one says to another: The <b>head of</b> this <b>donkey</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> they <b>appraise</b> the donkey and split the value <b>between them.</b>
But if one says to another: The <b>head of</b> this <b>cow</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> he has <b>sold him only the head of the cow. Moreover, even</b> if he says: The <b>head of</b> this <b>cow</b> is <b>consecrated property, the Temple</b> treasury <b>has</b> ownership <b>only</b> of the cow’s <b>head. And Rav Pappa said:</b> This difference between these cases is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>head of an ox is sold</b> independently <b>in the butcher shop.</b>
Abaye explains the difficulty that arises from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>But isn’t</b> it the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a donkey and a cow</b> are <b>not</b> included <b>in valuations, and</b> therefore are <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that is mentioned? If one consecrated their heads, their entire body is not consecrated. <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of assessment by the significance of the specified body part is contingent on inclusion in valuations, the case of <b>a slave should pose a difficulty for you:</b> A slave <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations,</b> as stated in the mishna, <b>and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> teaches that he is <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that is specified.
<b>Rather,</b> this is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that in the case of a slave or donkey the head alone is consecrated, is referring <b>to items consecrated</b> in order to purchase offerings for <b>the altar.</b> On the other hand, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that in the case of a <i>tumtum</i> one must pay his entire value, is referring <b>to items consecrated for Temple maintenance.</b> In such a case, it is assessed by the significance of the body part that is specified. Here we follow the paradigm of valuation, whose payment is also used for Temple maintenance.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret</b> the <i>baraita</i> that discusses consecrating the head of a slave? You interpreted it <b>as</b> dealing with a case of <b>items consecrated</b> in order to purchase offerings for <b>the altar.</b> But if so, <b>say the latter clause: Moreover, even</b> if he <b>says:</b> The <b>head of this cow</b> is <b>consecrated property, the Temple</b> treasury <b>has</b> ownership <b>only</b> of the cow’s <b>head.</b> According to this interpretation, that it is referring to items consecrated for the altar, <b>why</b> is the head alone consecrated? <b>Let</b> its <b>sanctity spread throughout the entire</b> cow. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>one says:</b>

Daf 5a

<b>The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all of</b> the animal <b>will be a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if it is an animal of those that they bring as an offering to the Lord, <b>anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The verse indicates that the part <b>of it</b> that one gives will be <b>sacred, but not all of</b> the animal will be <b>sacred.</b>
A non-sacred animal with a consecrated limb may not be sacrificed. Accordingly, one <b>might</b> have thought that the consecrated limb may be redeemed and thereby <b>transferred to non-sacred</b> status. Therefore <b>the verse states: “Shall be,”</b> meaning: <b>It shall be as it is,</b> i.e., the limb remains consecrated. <b>How</b> is <b>this</b> possible, i.e., what should one do in this case? The animal <b>should be sold for the needs of burnt offerings,</b> i.e., to an individual who will sacrifice the entire animal as a burnt offering, <b>and the payment</b> received <b>for</b> the animal will be <b>non-sacred, except for the payment</b> received in exchange <b>for that limb of it</b> that was consecrated. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering, all of</b> the animal <b>becomes a burnt offering? The verse states: “All that any man give of such to the Lord shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The term “shall be” serves <b>to include all of</b> the animal, indicating that it all becomes sacred.
<b>And even according to the one,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>who says</b> that if one states: The leg of this animal is a burnt offering, <b>not all of</b> the animal <b>is a burnt offering, that statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> one <b>consecrated an item that its life does not depend</b> on, e.g., its leg. <b>But</b> if he consecrated <b>an item that its life depends</b> on, such as its head, <b>the entire</b> animal is <b>consecrated.</b> This presents a difficulty for Rava, who holds that the <i>baraita</i> that discusses consecration of the head is referring to items consecrated in order to purchase offerings for the altar. Why, then, isn’t the entire animal consecrated?
Rava responds: <b>Rather,</b> both <i>baraitot</i> are referring to items consecrated for the altar, and even so it is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which indicates that if one consecrated the head the entire animal is consecrated, is referring <b>to inherent sanctity,</b> i.e., where he consecrated the head for the purpose of sacrificing it on the altar. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that if he consecrated the head it alone is consecrated, is referring <b>to sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value,</b> that is, where he consecrated the head for the sake of purchasing offerings.
Abaye responded: <b>But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said</b> that if one <b>consecrated a male</b> animal <b>for its value,</b> it is <b>sanctified</b> with <b>inherent sanctity</b> and it is itself sacrificed? This undermines the distinction that Rava is attempting to draw between inherent sanctity and sanctity that inheres in value.
Rava responds: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that an animal that was consecrated for its value attains inherent sanctity, applies only in a case <b>where he consecrated the entire</b> animal. <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> discussing the consecration of the head, it is referring to a situation <b>where he consecrated</b> only <b>one limb.</b> In such a case, the animal does not attain inherent sanctity.
Abaye replied: Actually, <b>we also raised a dilemma</b> with regard to a case where one consecrated only <b>one limb. As Rabba raised a dilemma:</b> If one <b>consecrated a limb for its value</b> in order to bring an offering with the proceeds, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether or not the entire animal is consecrated? If your interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is correct, Rabba can resolve his question based on the <i>baraita</i> and conclude definitively that the entire animal is not sanctified for the altar.
Rava responded: <b>We raised</b> this <b>dilemma</b> and entertained the possibility that the entire animal might be sanctified to the altar only <b>in</b> a case where the animal is <b>unblemished,</b> and is therefore fit to be used as an offering. But <b>here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a blemished</b> animal, <b>similar to</b> the parallel case of the <b>donkey,</b> which is unfit to be sacrificed. Since the animal in question is unfit for the altar, it is clear that the entire animal is not sanctified.
Abaye responded: In fact, <b>we also raised a dilemma</b> with regard to a case where the animal is <b>blemished</b> and unfit to be sacrificed. <b>As Rabba raised a dilemma:</b> If one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate the <b>value of my head</b> to purchase offerings <b>to</b> be sacrificed <b>on the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he obligated in his entire value or not? A person is certainly not fit to be an offering, and yet Rabba does not resolve his question based on the <i>baraita</i>. Rava answered: <b>We</b> only <b>raised</b> this <b>dilemma before hearing this <i>baraita</i>. Now that we</b> have <b>heard this <i>baraita</i>, we no</b> longer <b>raise</b> this <b>dilemma,</b> as we concluded from the <i>baraita</i> that the entirety of the animal is not consecrated.
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> aforementioned matter itself. <b>Rabba raised a dilemma:</b> If one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate the <b>value of my head</b> to purchase offerings <b>to</b> be sacrificed <b>on the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part in question, and since he consecrated a vital organ he is obligated in his entire value? <b>Or</b> perhaps it is <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part in question, and only the head is consecrated.
The Gemara explains the underlying issue: It can be argued that <b>we have not found</b> a case <b>of assessments that</b> is <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that was specified. Therefore, if one obligated himself in the value of a vital organ he should have to pay the entity’s entire value. <b>Or perhaps</b> he should be obligated only in the value of the head, as <b>we have not found</b> a case <b>of</b> an animal that is sacrificed <b>on the altar that</b> is <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part in question, i.e., that if one consecrates the value of one vital organ the entire animal is consecrated. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand [<i>teiku</i>]</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raised</b> a further <b>dilemma:</b> If one said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation for the altar,</b> rather than for Temple maintenance, as is usually the case, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this case <b>determined based on affordability</b> if he is poor, like regular valuations? <b>Or</b> perhaps it is <b>not determined based on affordability,</b> and he is obligated in the full valuation even if he is poor.
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: One can argue that <b>we have not found</b> a case <b>of valuations that is not determined based on affordability.</b> Therefore, the principle of affordability should apply even when one vows for the purpose of sacrificing offerings on the altar. <b>Or perhaps</b> this case should not be determined based on affordability, as <b>we have not found</b> an item that is consecrated for the purpose of sacrificing offerings <b>on the altar that</b> is <b>redeemed</b> in a manner <b>other than according to its value.</b> The Gemara again concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Ashi raised</b> a similar <b>dilemma:</b> If a person <b>consecrated an ancestral field for</b> the purpose of sacrificing offerings <b>on the altar,</b> rather than for Temple maintenance, as is usually the case, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>we have not found</b> a case of <b>an ancestral field that is redeemed other than</b> by the standard rate established by the Torah, which is that <b>an area</b> fit <b>for the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i>,</b> a <i>kor</i>, of <b>barley seed</b> is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels? Or perhaps</b> it should be redeemed according to its market value, as <b>we have not found</b> a case of an item that is consecrated for the purpose of sacrificing offerings <b>on the altar that</b> is <b>redeemed</b> in a manner <b>other than according to its value.</b> Once again, the Gemara states: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A child <b>less than one month old is</b> the object of <b>a vow</b> if others vowed to donate his assessment, <b>but is not valuated</b> if one vowed to donate his fixed value, as the Torah did not establish a value for anyone less than a month old.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a case of <b>one who takes</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> concerning a child <b>less than one month old, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The person who valuated is obligated to <b>give</b> the child’s <b>assessment. The Rabbis say: He has said nothing,</b> i.e., he is not obligated to give anything.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do they <b>disagree? Rabbi Meir holds: A person does not issue his statement</b> of consecration <b>for naught.</b> The assumption is that a person <b>knows that there are no valuations for</b> a child <b>less than one month old, and</b> therefore <b>he intended and said</b> his statement <b>for the sake of assessments,</b> i.e., he meant to vow to give the child’s market value. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a person does make his statement</b> of consecration <b>for naught.</b> Therefore, his statement is taken at face value, and he is not obligated to give anything.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>valuation of</b> this <b>utensil,</b> is obligated to <b>give its assessment?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that a person does not issue a statement of consecration for naught. Since utensils are not subject to valuation, he presumably intended to obligate himself in its assessment. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious that</b> Rav’s statement <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> Why was it necessary for the Gemara to state this?
The Gemara explains that it was necessary to state that Rav’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>lest you say</b> that it is <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who exempt one who valuates a child under a month old. The Gemara elaborates: One could say that <b>it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case of the child, <b>that one errs</b> and <b>thinks</b> that <b>just as there are valuations for</b> a child who is <b>one month old,</b> there are <b>also</b> valuations <b>for</b> a child <b>less than one month old.</b> Since his vow was based on an error, he is not obligated to pay anything.
<b>But here,</b> in the case of one who valuates a utensil, <b>where there is no</b> possibility <b>of erring,</b> it can be argued that <b>a person certainly knows that there is no valuation for a utensil, and he</b> therefore <b>intended and said</b> his statement <b>for the sake of assessments,</b> i.e., he meant to vow to donate the utensil’s value. Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that Rav’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir only, and not with that of the Rabbis. The Rabbis hold that a person does issue a statement of consecration for naught even in such a case, and therefore his declaration is taken at face value.

Daf 5b

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as Rav stated his <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that one who valuates a child less than a month old must pay his assessment, <b>for what</b> reason <b>was it necessary</b> for Rav to state his ruling? Isn’t this obvious?
The Gemara answers: It was necessary for him to state this <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that the <b>reason that Rabbi Meir</b> obligates him to pay the assessment <b>there,</b> in the case of the child, is <b>that</b> he <b>decrees</b> one must pay if the child is <b>less than a month old, due to</b> concern that otherwise people might mistakenly refrain from paying the valuation of a child who is <b>a month old. But here,</b> in the case of one who valuates a utensil, <b>where</b> there is no cause for such an error and therefore <b>no</b> need <b>to decree,</b> one might <b>say</b> that Rabbi Meir would <b>not</b> obligate him to pay. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that since the <b>reason of Rabbi Meir</b> is that <b>a person does not make his statement</b> of consecration <b>for naught,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between <b>here,</b> the case of a child, <b>and there,</b> with regard to a utensil. Rather, the <i>halakha</i> is the same in both cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabba bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yeiva bar Yosei says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who consecrates the animal of another</b> must <b>give its assessment. In accordance with whom?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that one does not issue a statement of consecration for naught. Since he knows that he cannot consecrate that which is not his, he meant to obligate himself in the animal’s assessment.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav</b> already <b>say</b> it <b>once? As Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>valuation of a utensil,</b> must <b>give its assessment.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav found it necessary to issue both statements, <b>lest you say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>there,</b> with regard to a utensil, <b>as</b> a person <b>knows that a utensil has no valuation,</b> i.e., that the term: Valuation, is not relevant to a utensil, <b>and</b> therefore it must be that he <b>decided</b> to donate money <b>and says</b> this expression as a reference <b>to</b> its monetary <b>value,</b> using the term: Valuation, imprecisely.
<b>But</b> in the case where one obligated himself in the valuation of another’s <b>animal, which is subject to consecration,</b> albeit not by him, <b>there is</b> room <b>to say that this</b> is what he <b>is saying</b> to himself: <b>Were I to say to the owner</b> that I want to buy it, <b>he would sell it to me.</b> Therefore, <b>let it be consecrated from now, and I will sacrifice it</b> once I purchase it from him. His intent is to consecrate the animal itself in order to sacrifice it. <b>But</b> since he did <b>not say</b> to himself that he would give its <b>assessment,</b> his statement is meaningless, as one cannot consecrate property that does not belong to him. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. Rather, his statement should be interpreted in such a manner that he is obligated to give the assessment of the animal to the Temple treasury.
<b>Rav Ashi says: And</b> Rav’s ruling applies only in a case <b>where</b> one <b>says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate to the Temple treasury. <b>But</b> if he <b>says: This</b> animal <b>is</b> consecrated, he is <b>not</b> obligated to pay its assessment. This formulation clearly indicates that he intended to consecrate this animal, which he cannot do, as it does not yet belong to him.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a gentile, Rabbi Meir says:</b> He <b>is valuated</b> in a case where a Jew says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the fixed value of this gentile. <b>But</b> a gentile <b>does not take</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> to donate his fixed value or the value of others. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He takes</b> a vow of <b>valuation, but is not valuated. And</b> both <b>this</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Meir, <b>and that</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agree that</b> gentiles <b>vow</b> to donate the assessment of another <b>and are</b> the object of <b>vows,</b> whereby one donates the assessment of a gentile.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the reasoning for the rulings of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. It is written in the beginning of the passage in the Torah delineating valuations: “Speak to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 27:2). This teaches that <b>“the children of Israel” can take</b> a vow of <b>valuation, but gentiles cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that this means that gentiles <b>cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation</b> either. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: “When <b>a man</b> shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in <i>halakhot</i> of valuations. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says</b> in explanation of his opinion: <b>Since one verse,</b> “a man,” <b>includes</b> gentiles, <b>and another verse,</b> “the children of Israel,” <b>excludes</b> gentiles, <b>for what</b> reason <b>do I say</b> that a gentile <b>can be</b> the object <b>of a valuation but cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation,</b> rather than the reverse?
It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse included more</b> people <b>in</b> the category of those <b>who are</b> the object <b>of a valuation than in</b> the category of those <b>who take</b> a vow of <b>valuation. As</b> the mishna teaches (2a): <b>A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> are the object of a vow and <b>are valuated, but</b> they can neither vow to donate the assessment of a person <b>nor take</b> a vow of <b>valuation.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the verses should be interpreted in the reverse manner: <b>“The children of Israel,” can be</b> the object <b>of a valuation but gentiles cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that gentiles <b>cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> either. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: <b>“A man”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Since one verse,</b> “a man,” <b>includes</b> gentiles, <b>and another verse,</b> “the children of Israel,” <b>excludes</b> gentiles, <b>for what</b> reason <b>do I say</b> that <b>a gentile can take</b> a vow of <b>a valuation but cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse included more</b> people <b>in</b> the category of those <b>who take</b> a vow of <b>valuation than in</b> the category of those <b>who are</b> the object <b>of a valuation. As</b> the mishna teaches (2a): <b>A <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite</b> vow, are the object of a vow, and <b>take</b> vows of <b>valuation, but they are not valuated.</b>
<b>Rava says: Rabbi Meir’s <i>halakha</i> is reasonable,</b> but <b>his explanation is not reasonable.</b> Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s explanation is reasonable,</b> but <b>his <i>halakha</i> is not reasonable.</b>
Rava elaborates: <b>Rabbi Meir’s <i>halakha</i></b> that gentiles cannot take a valuation vow <b>is reasonable, as it is written</b> that the Jews who returned to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia rejected the Samaritans’ request to assist them in the construction of the Second Temple, saying: <b>“You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God”</b> (Ezra 4:3). This supports Rabbi Meir’s contention that gentiles may not take vows of valuation, which are used for Temple maintenance. But <b>his explanation is not reasonable, as he adduces</b> proof <b>for</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the fact that <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> cannot take a vow of valuation. This proof is unconvincing, since <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor are different, as</b> unlike gentiles, they <b>lack the</b> presumed <b>mental competence</b> to make a commitment.
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s explanation is reasonable,</b> in <b>that he adduces</b> proof <b>for</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the case of <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite, as even though they possess the</b> presumed <b>mental competence</b> to make a commitment, nevertheless <b>the Merciful One excludes them</b> from being valuated. Since they are comparable to gentiles, they can serve as a precedent. But <b>his <i>halakha</i></b> that gentiles can take a valuation vow <b>is not reasonable, as it is written: “You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God,”</b> which indicates that they may not contribute anything to Temple maintenance.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that gentiles can take valuation vows and that the funds go to Temple maintenance, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“You have nothing to do with us”? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Avimi said:</b> He derives from it that if a gentile takes a vow of valuation <b>and</b> he brings the money to the Temple, <b>his valuation</b> money <b>is</b> not utilized but rather is <b>interred.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the valuation is not utilized for the Temple, <b>one</b> who uses it <b>should not</b> be considered to have violated the prohibition of <b>misuse.</b> One who unwittingly derived benefit from the valuation should not be obligated to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property, as the Temple treasury does not derive benefit from it. <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the five sin offerings</b> that may not be sacrificed and are left to <b>die, and</b> similarly, with regard to consecrated <b>money that is taken</b> and cast <b>into the Dead Sea,</b> as it is not fit for any purpose, one <b>may not derive benefit</b> from them <i>ab initio</i>. <b>But</b> after the fact, if one derived benefit from them he is <b>not liable</b> for <b>misuse,</b> as the Temple treasury has no use for them.
<b>Why</b> then <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <b>consecrations of gentiles: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that consecrations of gentiles are not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse, <b>said?</b> It is specifically <b>with regard to consecrations for the altar. But with regard to consecrations for Temple maintenance,</b> one who derives benefit <b>from</b> them is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. Why is this the <i>halakha</i>, given the fact that the consecrations of a gentile are interred?
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that actually Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the valuation of a gentile is given to Temple maintenance and is not interred. And as for that which the Jews said to the gentiles in the time of the Second Temple: “You have nothing to do with us,” that refusal was not for halakhic reasons. Rather, <b>it</b> was <b>due to</b> the gentiles’ attempt to foster <b>weakening of the hands</b> of those rebuilding the Temple. <b>As it is written: “Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and harried them while they were building”</b> (Ezra 4:4).

Daf 6a

§ The Gemara notes that there is an apparent contradiction with regard to the issue of whether or not a gentile may donate for the purpose of Temple maintenance. <b>It was taught in one</b> <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who pledged a gift for Temple maintenance, one accepts</b> it <b>from him. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not accept</b> it from him.
<b>Rabbi Ila says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the donation is not accepted, is stated <b>with regard to the beginning</b> of the building of the Temple. The donation is refused in order that the Jews not rely upon on the donations of gentiles. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the donation is accepted, is stated <b>with regard to the end</b> of the building of the Temple, i.e., after it is already built.
<b>As Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to donations of gentiles for Temple maintenance: <b>With regard to the beginning</b> of the building of the Temple, <b>one may not accept even water and salt from them. With regard to the end</b> of the building of the Temple, <b>one may not accept a defined item,</b> i.e., if it will be clear that this was donated by a gentile. But <b>one may accept</b> their gift of <b>an item that is not defined.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered</b> to be <b>a defined item? Rav Yosef says: For example, the cubit-</b>wide spiked plates placed on the roof of the Sanctuary, which were designed to <b>eliminate the ravens.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> to the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> as interpreted by Rabbi Yoḥanan, that with regard to the beginning of the building of the Temple nothing is accepted from gentiles. Nehemiah requested from the king of Persia: <b>“And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s park,</b> that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle that pertains to the house” (Nehemiah 2:8). Here Nehemiah clearly asked for material from gentiles. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: Actions taken by <b>the government are different, as</b> the government <b>does not retract</b> its decisions. <b>As Shmuel says: If the government says: I will uproot mountains, it will uproot mountains and not retract</b> what it said.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who separated <i>teruma</i> from his pile</b> of grain, <b>one examines him</b> to determine his intent. <b>If he separated it with</b> the <b>intent</b> that it be like the <i>teruma</i> of <b>Jews, it should be given to a priest. If not, it requires interment,</b> as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps his heart was</b> directed <b>toward Heaven,</b> i.e., his intent was to consecrate it to the Temple and he did not want it to be given to a priest. Since there is uncertainty with regard to his intent, nothing can be done with that produce.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who donated a</b> cross <b>beam</b> and brought it to a synagogue, <b>and</b> the <b>name</b> of God <b>is written on it, one examines him</b> to determine his intent. <b>If he says: I separated it with</b> the <b>intent</b> that it be like the donations of <b>Jews,</b> the name should be <b>cut off [<i>yagod</i>]</b> and interred, <b>and one uses the remainder</b> for a synagogue. <b>And if not,</b> the entire beam <b>requires interment,</b> as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps his heart was</b> directed <b>toward Heaven,</b> i.e., his intent was to consecrate it to the Temple, and therefore it may not be used.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: The <b>reason that</b> the beam <b>requires interment</b> is <b>that</b> the <b>name</b> of God <b>is written on it,</b> from which it may be inferred that if God’s <b>name</b> is <b>not written on it,</b> it <b>does not require interment.</b> Why, then, did Rav Yehuda say that if a gentile separated <i>teruma</i> it requires interment?
The Gemara answers: <b>Even though</b> the <b>name</b> of God is <b>not written on</b> the beam, <b>the same</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is true,</b> and the beam <b>requires interment,</b> due to the concern that he might have intended to consecrate it. <b>And</b> as for why the <i>baraita</i> specifically discusses the case where God’s name was written on the beam, <b>this teaches us that</b> if his intention was for it to be used in a synagogue, then <b>even though</b> God’s <b>name is written on it,</b> nevertheless the rest of the beam is not prohibited. Rather, the name should be <b>cut off</b> and interred, <b>and</b> one may <b>use the remainder</b> for a synagogue. The reason is <b>that</b> if God’s <b>name</b> is written on an item, only the place where it is written is sanctified, but that part of the item <b>that is not in its place is not sanctified.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one of the names of God <b>was written on the handles of vessels or on legs of a bed, one must cut off</b> the name <b>and inter</b> it, and the remainder is permitted.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Abbahu says: One who says:</b> I am contributing <b>this <i>sela</i> to charity, is permitted to change its</b> purpose, i.e., to use the money himself and later replace it. The Gemara comments: It was initially <b>understood from this</b> that if one wants to change its purpose <b>for his own</b> benefit, <b>yes,</b> this is permitted, as he originally had this stipulation in mind. But it is <b>not</b> permitted to lend it <b>to another.</b> Yet it <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rav Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is permitted to change its purpose <b>whether for himself or for another.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one may change the purpose of the coin, only in a case <b>where he said: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate a <i>sela</i> to charity. <b>But</b> if he <b>said: This</b> <i>sela</i> <b>is</b> for charity, then he is <b>required to give</b> the <i>sela</i> to charity <b>as is,</b> and he may not use it and replace it.
<b>Rava objects to this: On the contrary, the opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable.</b> In a case where one <b>said: This</b> <i>sela</i> is for charity, it makes sense to allow him to <b>use it, so that he should bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss from that point onward. <b>But</b> if he said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate a <i>sela</i> to charity, he should <b>not</b> be allowed to use the <i>sela</i>, as in any event he must donate a <i>sela</i>. <b>Rather,</b> as there is a reason in either situation to permit its use, there <b>is no difference</b> between the cases, and in both cases he may use the <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava: A vow</b> is <b>charity, but consecrated</b> property <b>is not charity.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying?</b> After all, <b>neither a vow nor consecrated</b> property <b>is charity.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Charity</b> is like a vow to consecrate property, in that it <b>is</b> subject to the prohibition <b>of: You shall not delay,</b> which is derived from the verse: “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22). <b>But</b> nevertheless <b>it is not like consecrated</b> property, <b>as</b> in the case of <b>consecrated</b> property it is <b>prohibited to use it, while</b> in the case of <b>charity</b> it is <b>permitted to use it.</b> Since with regard to the option of using the money the <i>baraita</i> does not distinguish between a case where one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate a <i>sela</i> to charity, and a case where he says: This <i>sela</i> is for charity, it evidently supports the opinion of Rava.
<b>Rav Kahana said: I said</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> of Rav Naḥman’s, with regard to one who says: This <i>sela</i> is for charity, along with the accompanying discussion, <b>before Rav Zevid from Neharde’a. He said</b> to me: <b>You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in this manner,</b> that Rav Naḥman merely stated that it is permitted to change the purpose of the <i>sela</i>, and the Sages clarified that it is permitted in all cases. But <b>we teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in this manner,</b> that it was all stated citing Rav Naḥman: <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who said:</b> I am contributing <b>this <i>sela</i> to charity, is permitted to change its</b> purpose, <b>whether for himself or for another,</b> and <b>whether</b> he <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> or <b>whether he said: This</b> <i>sela</i> <b>is</b> for charity.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> which further deals with these matters. One who said: <b>This <i>sela</i> is for charity,</b> is <b>permitted to change</b> its purpose and replace it, as long as it has <b>not</b> yet <b>come into the possession</b> of the <b>charity collectors.</b> But <b>once it has come into the possession</b> of the <b>charity collectors</b> it is <b>prohibited to change</b> its purpose.

Daf 6b

The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But Rabbi Yannai,</b> who was a charity collector, <b>borrowed</b> money belonging to charity <b>and repaid.</b> The Gemara answers: The case of <b>Rabbi Yannai is different;</b> it is <b>beneficial to the poor</b> that he be allowed to borrow and repay, <b>as the longer he leaves</b> the charity fund empty, the more he <b>impels</b> people to give charity, <b>and</b> he thereby <b>brings</b> more money <b>to</b> the poor.
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that deals with a similar matter: In the case of <b>a Jew who donated a candelabrum or a lamp to the synagogue,</b> it is <b>prohibited to change it</b> and use it for another purpose. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba thought to say</b> that there <b>is no difference</b> whether he wishes to change <b>for a voluntary matter or for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> as in both cases it is prohibited. <b>Rav Ami said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> When the Sages taught the <i>baraita</i>, they <b>taught only</b> that it is prohibited when he changes it <b>for a voluntary matter, but</b> it is <b>permitted to change it for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva.</b>
This <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who donated a candelabrum or a lamp to the synagogue, if</b> it is <b>before its owner’s name</b> has been <b>forgotten,</b> i.e., people still remember that he donated the item, it is <b>prohibited to change it</b> and use it for another purpose. <b>Once its owner’s name</b> has been <b>forgotten,</b> it is <b>permitted to change it.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what</b> purpose is it stated that one may not change it before the owner’s name was forgotten? <b>If we say</b> that it is prohibited to change it <b>for a voluntary matter, why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically</b> mention <b>a gentile?</b> It is prohibited to change it in this manner <b>even</b> if it was donated by <b>a Jew.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be dealing with a change <b>for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> and therefore it is prohibited only if the donor is a gentile and his name has not yet been forgotten. <b>And the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>that it is</b> specifically <b>a gentile who</b> would protest and <b>scream:</b> Where is the candelabrum that I donated? <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a Jew, who</b> would <b>not</b> protest and <b>scream</b> if they used his donation for a different mitzva, one may <b>well</b> change it.
The Gemara relates that <b>Sha’azrak, an Arab [<i>tayya’a</i>]</b> merchant, <b>donated a candelabrum to Rav Yehuda’s synagogue. Raḥava changed its</b> purpose before Sha’azrak’s name was forgotten as the donor, and <b>Rava became angry</b> at Raḥava for not waiting. <b>Some say</b> the opposite: <b>Rava changed its</b> purpose, and <b>Raḥava became angry</b> at Rava. <b>And some say</b> that the <b>attendants of Pumbedita,</b> the charity collectors, <b>changed</b> its purpose, and <b>Raḥava became angry</b> at them, <b>and Rabba became angry</b> at them as well.
The Gemara explains: The <b>one who changed</b> its purpose <b>holds that</b> it was permitted to change it, <b>as</b> it was <b>not common</b> for Sha’azrak to be in the city and it was unlikely that he would protest the change. <b>And</b> the <b>one who became angry holds</b> that even so, they should not have changed it, as <b>sometimes he happens to come</b> there.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who is moribund and one who is taken to be executed</b> after being sentenced by the court <b>is neither</b> the object of <b>a vow nor valuated. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Akavya says:</b> He is not the object of a vow, because he has no market value; but <b>he is valuated, due to</b> the fact <b>that one’s value is fixed</b> by the Torah based on age and sex. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> One with that status <b>vows</b> to donate the assessment of another person to the Temple treasury, <b>and takes</b> vows of <b>valuation, and consecrates</b> his property; <b>and if he damages</b> the property of others, he is <b>liable</b> to pay compensation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it makes sense that <b>one who is moribund is not</b> the object of <b>a vow, as he has no monetary</b> value. <b>And</b> it also stands to reason that he <b>is not valuated,</b> as <b>he is not subject to setting,</b> i.e., standing, <b>and</b> therefore is not subject to <b>valuation.</b> The verse states: “Then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that anyone who cannot stand, such as one who is dying, is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who is taken to be executed, granted,</b> he <b>is not</b> the object of <b>a vow, as he has no monetary</b> value, since no one would purchase him. <b>But</b> with regard to the mishna’s statement that he is <b>not valuated, why not?</b>
The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that in the case of <b>one who</b> is being <b>taken to be executed and</b> who <b>said: My valuation is upon me</b> to donate to the Temple, <b>that he did not say anything,</b> and the valuation is not collected from his estate? <b>The verse states: “Anything dedicated [<i>ḥerem</i>],</b> that may be dedicated of men, <b>shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:29). This teaches that with regard to one who is worthy of excommunication [<i>ḥerem</i>], i.e., condemned to death, one cannot redeem him, i.e., pay his valuation. One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even before his verdict is issued,</b> i.e., that this <i>halakha</i> applies even if one issued this statement before being sentenced to death. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of men,” and not all men,</b> i.e., only some men destined to be executed have no valuation, and not all of them.
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Akavya, who says</b> in the mishna that even a person taken to be executed <b>is valuated, due to</b> the fact <b>that one’s value is fixed, what does he do</b> with the phrase <b>“anything dedicated”?</b>
The Gemara answers that he requires it <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: Since we found with regard to those executed at the hand of Heaven that they give money and their</b> sins <b>are atoned, as it is stated</b> in the case of the owner of a forewarned ox that killed a person: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death. <b>If there be laid upon him a ransom,</b> then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him” (Exodus 21:29–30), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to those liable to receive the death penalty <b>at the hands of man</b> it is <b>so,</b> that one can pay in lieu of execution. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Anything dedicated</b> that may be dedicated of men, <b>shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:29).
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one cannot give payment in lieu of execution with regard to <b>severe</b> prohibitions punishable by the <b>death</b> penalty, e.g., blasphemy or cursing one’s father, <b>for which no atonement is designated</b> in the Torah <b>for their unwitting</b> violation. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>less severe</b> prohibitions punishable by the <b>death</b> penalty, e.g., violating Shabbat or killing, <b>for which atonement</b> of an offering or exile <b>is designated</b> in the Torah <b>for their unwitting</b> violation? <b>The verse states: “Anything dedicated,”</b> to include all prohibitions punishable by court-administered execution.
§ The mishna teaches, with regard to one who is taken to be executed, that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Such a person <b>vows</b> to donate the assessment of another person to the Temple treasury, <b>and takes</b> vows of <b>valuation,</b> and consecrates his property; and if he damages the property of others, he is liable to pay compensation. The Gemara asks: <b>And does the first <i>tanna</i> say</b> that such a person does <b>not</b> vow to donate the assessment of another person to the Temple treasury and take vows of valuation, such that Rabbi Yosei could be understood as disputing his opinion? The first <i>tanna</i> merely said that such an individual is not subject to vows and valuations. What is the difference between their opinions?
<b>Rather, with regard to</b> whether or not one who is taken to be executed can <b>vow</b> to donate the assessment of another person to the Temple treasury, <b>and take</b> vows of <b>valuation, and consecrate</b> his property, <b>everyone,</b> including the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>agrees</b> that he can. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> he <b>causes damage. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>if</b> he <b>causes damage</b> he is <b>not liable for payment, and Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>if</b> he <b>causes damage</b> he is <b>liable to pay</b> compensation.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree,</b> as it is an accepted principle that one who causes damage must pay? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> They <b>disagree</b> as to whether the payment can be collected from his estate. This depends on the question of whether or not one who is owed money from <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, i.e., a loan given without a document that places a lien on the land, can <b>collect from the heirs. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that one who is owed money from <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement <b>cannot collect from the heirs, and Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that one who is owed money from <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement can <b>collect from the heirs.</b>
<b>Rava says:</b> In fact, <b>everyone</b> agrees that one who is owed money from <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement <b>cannot collect from the heirs; and here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the status of <b>a loan that is written in the Torah,</b> i.e., a financial obligation decreed by Torah law, such as paying damages. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>a loan that is written in the Torah is not</b> considered <b>as though it is written in a document,</b> and may not be collected from the heirs. <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that such a loan <b>is</b> considered <b>as though it is written in a document,</b> and therefore it may be collected from the heirs.
<b>And there are those who teach</b> the dispute between Rava and Rav Yosef <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who is taken to be executed</b> after being sentenced by the court, if <b>he injured another</b> he is <b>liable</b> for payment. But if <b>others injured him</b> they are <b>exempt,</b> as they would be if they injured a dead person. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even if</b> it was <b>he</b> who <b>injured others,</b> he is <b>exempt, as</b> he <b>cannot be brought back to stand</b> before <b>the court</b> for judgment, since he must be executed without delay.

Daf 7a

The Gemara asks: If so, can one conclude <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that one who is being taken to be executed <b>can be brought back to stand</b> before <b>the court</b> for judgment? This is clearly erroneous, as the court is not permitted to delay his execution.
<b>Rav Yosef says:</b> Everyone agrees that his execution may not be delayed. Rather, they <b>disagree as</b> to whether or not one who is owed money from <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement can <b>collect from the heirs. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that one who is owed money from <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement can <b>collect from the heirs,</b> and therefore the injured party can collect from the heirs after the execution. <b>But Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds</b> that one who is owed money from a loan by oral agreement <b>cannot collect from the heirs,</b> and therefore the heirs are exempt from payment for the injury.
<b>Rabba said:</b> Actually, <b>everyone</b> agrees that one who is owed money from <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement <b>cannot collect from the heirs; and here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a loan that is written in the Torah,</b> e.g., one’s obligation to pay if he causes damage, is considered <b>as though it is written in a document. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that a loan that is written in the Torah is considered <b>as though it is written in a document,</b> and may be collected from the heirs. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds</b> that it <b>is not considered as though it is written in a document,</b> and therefore it may not be collected.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the opinion that one cannot collect a loan that is written in the Torah from the heirs, from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 6:2): If <b>one was digging a pit in the public thoroughfare, and an ox fell on</b> the digger of the pit <b>and killed him,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from paying damages, as the digger of the pit should not have dug the pit. <b>Moreover, if the ox died</b> as a result of the fall, <b>the heirs of the owner of the pit are liable to pay the value of</b> the <b>ox to its owner.</b> This shows that an obligation that is written in the Torah, such as compensation for damage, is collected from heirs.
<b>Rabbi Ila said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the digger of the pit <b>stood trial</b> for the damage before he died, and once judgment is rendered by a court the resulting financial obligation is comparable to a written loan, not one that is written in the Torah. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the ox <b>killed him. Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not mean that the ox literally killed him, rather, <b>that it rendered him as one who has a wound that will cause him to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> and there was enough time before his death to sentence him to pay damages.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Ḥagga teaches</b> a slightly different version of the <i>baraita</i>, that if the digger of the pit <b>died</b> from the impact of the ox, <b>and</b> the ox effectively <b>buried him</b> in the ground at the bottom of the pit, his heirs have to pay damages to the owner of the ox? In this scenario, how could it be possible for the digger to stand trial? The Gemara answers: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> in the <i>baraita</i>, that the owner of the ox collects from the heirs of the digger, is dealing with a case <b>where judges sat at the opening of the pit</b> and rendered the digger liable to pay damages before he died.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> another <i>baraita</i> on the same topic: With regard to <b>one taken to be executed, they sprinkle for his</b> sake on the altar <b>from the blood of his sin offering and from the blood of his guilt offering,</b> which he brought earlier. But if he <b>sinned at that time,</b> obligating him to bring a sin offering or a guilt offering, the court <b>does not attend to his</b> obligation, and his execution is not delayed so that he can sacrifice the offering. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>because</b> the court <b>may not afflict</b> him by forcing him to wait for <b>his judgment,</b> his execution, until the offering is sacrificed.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>If so,</b> if the offering is not sacrificed in order to avoid afflicting the sentenced by delaying his execution, then this should apply <b>even</b> in the <b>first clause as well,</b> where he had already brought the offering. Why does the court delay his execution until the blood is sprinkled? Rav Yosef answered: The first clause is referring to a case <b>where his offering</b> was already <b>slaughtered at that time,</b> and all that remained to be done was the sprinkling of the blood. Delaying the execution for such a short time is not a problem.
The Gemara asks: But then in a case where he set aside <b>his offering</b> but it was <b>not</b> yet <b>slaughtered, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it true that they do <b>not</b> delay his execution in order to sacrifice the offering? If so, <b>instead of teaching</b> a new case and stating: But if he <b>sinned at that time</b> and thereby became obligated to sacrifice a sin offering or a guilt offering, the court <b>does not attend to his</b> obligation, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>distinguish and teach</b> a distinction <b>within the</b> case of where he already brought the offering <b>itself: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the blood is sprinkled, <b>said? When</b> his <b>offering was</b> already <b>slaughtered at that time. But if</b> his <b>offering was not</b> yet <b>slaughtered,</b> his execution is <b>not</b> delayed.
The Gemara answers: <b>That is indeed what he is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When</b> his <b>offering was</b> already <b>slaughtered at that time. But if</b> his <b>offering was not</b> yet <b>slaughtered, it is</b> considered <b>as though</b> he <b>sinned at that time, and</b> therefore the court <b>does not attend to his</b> obligation.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a pregnant <b>woman who is taken</b> by the court <b>to be executed,</b> the court <b>does not wait to</b> execute <b>her until she gives birth.</b> Rather, she is killed immediately. But with regard to <b>a woman</b> taken to be executed <b>who sat on the travailing chair [<i>hamashber</i>]</b> in the throes of labor, the court <b>waits to</b> execute <b>her until she gives birth.</b> In the case of <b>a woman who was killed</b> through court-imposed capital punishment, <b>one may derive benefit from her hair.</b> But in the case of <b>an animal that was killed</b> through court-imposed execution, e.g., for goring a person, <b>deriving benefit</b> from the animal <b>is prohibited.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the court executes the pregnant woman rather than waiting? After all, <b>it is</b> part of <b>her body.</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written:</b> “And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her offspring depart…he shall be fined, <b>as the woman’s husband shall place upon him”</b> (Exodus 21:22), the fetus <b>is</b> considered to be the <b>property of the husband.</b> If so, the court should wait until she gives birth before executing her, <b>and not</b> cause <b>him to lose</b> the fetus. Consequently, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the court does not take this factor into account.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>indeed</b> the court should delay her execution until she gives birth? <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>verse states:</b> “If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then <b>they shall also both of them die,</b> the man that lay with the woman, and the woman” (Deuteronomy 22:22). The amplifying term “both of them” serves <b>to add</b> her <b>fetus,</b> teaching that it dies together with her.
The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> phrase is <b>required for</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: Neither of the two adulterers mentioned in the verse is punished <b>until both of them are equal,</b> i.e., they have both reached majority. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When you say</b> that the child also dies, it is derived from the word <b>“also,”</b> whereas the <i>halakha</i> that they must be equal is learned from the term “both of them.”
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to a woman taken to be executed who <b>sat on the travailing chair</b> in the throes of labor, the court waits to execute her until she gives birth. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for delaying the execution in this case? The Gemara answers: <b>Once</b> the fetus <b>uproots</b> from its place and begins to leave the woman’s body, <b>it is</b> considered <b>an independent body</b> and may not be killed together with the mother.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of a pregnant <b>woman who is taken</b> by the court <b>to be executed, one strikes her opposite the womb,</b> i.e., on the abdomen, <b>so that the fetus dies first</b> and <b>so that she not suffer disgrace</b> as a result of publicly bleeding from labor. The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> according to Shmuel if a pregnant woman dies, <b>she dies first, before</b> the fetus? It is clear that this is Shmuel’s assumption, as he mandates killing the fetus before the mother, lest the live fetus bring about the onset of labor as a reaction to the woman’s death. Were the fetus to perish first, before the woman, there would be no need for this. <b>But</b> this is difficult, as <b>we maintain that</b> the <b>fetus dies first.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 43b–44a): <b>A baby boy, one day old, inherits</b> the estate of his relatives who died on the day of his birth, <b>and</b> if he dies, <b>he bequeaths</b> that inheritance to his relatives. <b>And Rav Sheshet says:</b> This mishna is teaching that a day-old child <b>inherits his mother’s property</b> when she died after he was born, <b>to bequeath</b> it <b>to</b> his heirs who are not the mother’s heirs, e.g., <b>to</b> his <b>paternal brothers.</b>
The Gemara explains the difficulty: It is <b>specifically</b> in a case where the boy is <b>one day old</b> that he inherits and bequeaths, <b>but a fetus</b> who died while still in the womb does <b>not</b> inherit and bequeath. The reason is <b>that</b> we presume that the fetus <b>died first,</b> before its mother, <b>and a son does not inherit through his mother</b> while <b>in the grave, in order to bequeath</b> her property <b>to</b> his <b>paternal brothers.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This matter,</b> i.e., the presumption that the fetus dies first, applies only <b>in</b> a case of natural <b>death.</b> In such a situation, <b>since</b> the <b>fetus’s vitality is minimal, the Angel of Death’s drop</b> of poison <b>enters</b> his body and <b>cuts the two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter,</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet [<i>simanim</i>], thereby killing him before his mother. <b>But</b> in a case where the mother <b>was killed,</b> e.g., if she was executed, <b>she dies first.</b>
The Gemara asks: Is it true that the fetus always dies first when the mother dies naturally? <b>But there was an incident</b> where the mother died naturally <b>and</b> the fetus <b>made three spasmodic motions</b> afterward. The Gemara answers: That is <b>just as it is with the tail of the lizard, which jerks</b> after being severed from the lizard; it is just a spasmodic motion, which does not indicate that it is still alive.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>a woman who sat on the travailing chair</b> in the throes of labor, <b>and died on Shabbat, one brings a knife, and tears</b> open <b>her abdomen, and removes the fetus,</b> as it might still be alive, and it could be possible to save its life. The Gemara asks: But isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is permitted? After all, <b>what is</b> the person who cuts her abdomen <b>doing?</b>

Daf 7b

<b>It is</b> merely <b>cutting flesh,</b> and there is no reason why it should be prohibited. <b>Rabba said: No,</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning cutting open her abdomen is <b>necessary</b> only to teach that it is permitted <b>to bring a knife by way of the public thoroughfare</b> for that purpose, despite the fact that this constitutes a prohibited labor by Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> does <b>this teach us?</b> Does it teach <b>that</b> even in a case <b>of uncertainty we desecrate Shabbat</b> for the chance of saving a life? But <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 83a): With regard to <b>one upon whom a rockslide fell,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether <b>he is there</b> under the debris or whether <b>he is not there,</b> and there is also <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether he is still <b>alive</b> or whether he is <b>dead,</b> and finally there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether the person under the debris is <b>a gentile</b> or <b>a Jew, one clears the pile</b> from <b>atop him</b> on Shabbat.
The Gemara answers: It is necessary to teach that one may bring a knife in the case of a woman, <b>lest you say</b> that it is <b>specifically there</b> that one may desecrate Shabbat, <b>as</b> the person who was buried under the rockslide <b>had a presumptive status of being alive</b> and therefore he is assumed to still be alive. <b>But here, where</b> the child <b>had no prior presumptive status of being alive,</b> as he was not yet born, you might <b>say</b> that one may <b>not</b> desecrate Shabbat in order to save his life. Therefore, it is necessary for Shmuel to <b>teach us</b> that even here one may desecrate Shabbat for the possibility of saving the fetus’s life.
§ The mishna taught: In the case of <b>a woman who was killed</b> through court-imposed capital punishment, one may derive benefit from her hair. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is it permitted? After all, a corpse and its hair <b>are items from which deriving benefit is prohibited. Rav said</b> that this is referring to a case <b>where she says</b> before she dies: <b>Give my hair to my daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: Is the prohibition contingent on the deceased’s wishes? <b>Were she to say: Give my hand to my daughter, would we give</b> the hand <b>to her?</b>
Rather, <b>Rav said:</b> This is not referring to the actual hair of the deceased, but <b>to a wig [<i>pe’a nokhrit</i>],</b> which is not part of the deceased’s body. The Gemara infers from Rav’s statement that the <b>reason</b> it is permitted is <b>that</b> she <b>said</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, thereby indicating that she did not consider it part of her body. <b>But</b> if she <b>did not say</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, <b>it is</b> considered part of <b>her body, and</b> it <b>is forbidden</b> to derive benefit from it.
The Gemara explains why this implication is problematic: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raise this</b> as <b>a dilemma? As Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>hair of righteous women</b> in a city whose residents were incited to idolatry and, therefore, all of their property must be burned, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered their property and burned, or part of their body and not burned?
<b>And Rava said:</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, was not referring to actual hair, but rather <b>he raised</b> his <b>dilemma with regard to a wig.</b> This is difficult according to the opinion of Rav, as his ruling indicates that a wig should be considered part of a woman’s body unless she stipulated otherwise. The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raised</b> his <b>dilemma</b> as to whether a wig is considered part of the body, he was referring specifically to a case <b>where</b> the wig was <b>hanging on a peg.</b> The dilemma is whether it is considered part of her clothing, which, like her body, is not burned, or whether it is considered like any other property of hers, since she was not wearing it at the time.
On the other hand, <b>here</b> Rav is referring to a wig <b>that is</b> actually <b>attached to her.</b> In such a case, one may correctly infer that the <b>reason</b> that it is permitted is <b>that</b> the deceased <b>said</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, thereby indicating that she did not consider it part of her body. <b>But</b> if she <b>did not say</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, <b>it is</b> considered to be part of <b>her body and is prohibited.</b>
This claim, that the mishna is dealing with a wig rather than natural hair, is <b>difficult for Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.</b> He explains the difficulty: The mishna <b>teaches</b> the issue of the prohibition of the woman’s hair as being <b>similar</b> to the other prohibition it mentions, that <b>of</b> the <b>animal. Just as there,</b> in the case of the animal, it is referring to deriving benefit from <b>its body, so too here,</b> it must be referring to benefit from <b>her body</b> itself, not from a wig.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman</b> bar Yitzḥak <b>says:</b> The mishna is referring to natural hair, and there is a distinction between the hair of an animal and that of a woman. In the case of <b>this</b> woman, it is <b>her death</b> that <b>causes her to be forbidden.</b> Therefore, the hair, which does not undergo any change when she dies, remains permitted. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>that</b> animal, the <b>verdict causes it to be forbidden,</b> even before it is killed. It is prohibited to derive benefit from the animal as soon as the verdict is issued. Therefore, the hair that is attached to the animal is forbidden as well.
<b>Levi teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> and <b>Levi</b> also <b>teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Levi teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav:</b> In the case of <b>a woman who was being taken to be killed and</b> who <b>said: Give my hair to my daughter, one gives</b> it to the daughter. If she <b>died</b> without instructing that it be given to her daughter, <b>one does not give</b> it to the daughter, <b>because</b> it <b>is forbidden to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from <b>a corpse.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the reason her hair is prohibited? The Gemara explains that this is referring not to the hair itself, but <b>rather</b> to a wig, and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that it is <b>forbidden to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> even from the <b>adornments</b> of <b>the deceased,</b> such as a wig.
The Gemara further explains: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak,</b> as follows: Whereas in the case of <b>a woman who died, one may derive benefit from her hair,</b> with regard to <b>an animal that was put to death, it is forbidden to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. <b>And what is the difference between this</b> case <b>and that</b> one? In <b>this</b> case it is <b>her death</b> that <b>causes her to be forbidden, but</b> in <b>that</b> case the <b>verdict causes</b> the animal <b>to be forbidden.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One cannot be charged for a valuation less than a <i>sela</i>, nor</b> can one be charged <b>more than fifty <i>sela</i>. How so?</b> If <b>one gave one <i>sela</i> and became wealthy,</b> he is <b>not</b> required to <b>give anything</b> more, as he has fulfilled his obligation. If he gave <b>less than a <i>sela</i> and became wealthy,</b> he is required to <b>give fifty <i>sela</i>,</b> as he has not fulfilled his obligation.
If <b>there were five <i>sela</i> in</b> the <b>possession</b> of the destitute person, and the valuation he undertook is more than five <i>sela</i>, how much should he pay? <b>Rabbi Meir says: He gives only one</b> <i>sela</i> and thereby fulfills his obligation. <b>And the Rabbis say: He gives all</b> five. <b>One cannot be charged for a valuation less than a <i>sela</i>; nor</b> can one be charged <b>more than fifty <i>sela</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>One cannot be charged for a valuation less than a <i>sela</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this principle? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25). This verse indicates that <b>all valuations that you valuate shall not be less than a shekel,</b> which is the equivalent of a <i>sela</i>. One does not fulfill his obligation by giving less than this amount.
The mishna further teaches: <b>Nor</b> can one be charged <b>more than fifty <i>sela</i>.</b> This is the highest valuation specified in the Torah, <b>as it is written:</b> “Then your valuation shall be for the male from twenty years old unto sixty years old, your valuation shall be <b>fifty</b> shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:3).
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>there were five <i>sela</i> in</b> the <b>possession</b> of the destitute person, Rabbi Meir says: He gives only one <i>sela</i> and thereby fulfills his obligation, and the Rabbis say: He gives all five. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> with regard to a male between the ages of twenty and sixty: “Your valuation shall be <b>fifty</b> shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:3), and the verses likewise specify the valuations for other individuals. <b>And it is</b> also <b>written:</b> “Your valuations shall be according to the <b>shekel</b> of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:25). This teaches that the valuation is <b>either fifty</b> shekels for one who vows to donate the valuation of a man between twenty and sixty, <b>or</b> one <b>shekel,</b> if he cannot afford to pay fifty.
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this reasoning? According to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> second verse <b>comes</b> to teach <b>that all valuations that you valuate shall not be less than a shekel,</b> but in a case <b>where</b> the individual <b>has</b> more than a shekel, <b>the verse states: “According to the means of him that vowed</b> shall the priest value him” (Leviticus 27:8), <b>and</b> as <b>he has the means</b> to pay more than a shekel, he is required to pay the maximum that he can afford.
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> respond to this reasoning? According to Rabbi Meir, <b>that</b> verse <b>comes</b> to teach that the charge is calculated according to <b>the means of one who took the vow and not</b> according to <b>the means of the one about whom the vow was made.</b> Consequently, if a poor man vowed to donate the valuation of a rich man, the amount to be paid is calculated according to what the poor man, not the rich man, can afford. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this reasoning? They would say: <b>Doesn’t</b> it emerge <b>by itself</b> that <b>you</b> also <b>learn from</b> this verse <b>that</b> in a case <b>where he has the means</b> to pay more than a shekel, you should <b>take from him</b> the maximum that he can afford?
§ The Gemara cites a ruling based upon the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> If <b>one had five <i>sela</i> in his possession and said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation, and he</b> then <b>said again:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation, and he gave four</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for the second</b> vow <b>and one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for the first</b> vow, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation to pay for <b>both of the</b> vows. Consequently, even if he becomes wealthy, he is not required to make any further payments.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? There is a principle that with regard to <b>a creditor</b> holding a promissory note dated <b>later</b> than the notes of other creditors, <b>who collected</b> his debt <b>before</b> the other creditors collected theirs, <b>whatever he has collected he has collected,</b> and it is not expropriated from him even if the debtor does not have the means to pay back all his creditors.
In this case, since <b>at the time that he gave</b> the four <i>sela</i> <b>for the second</b> vow, his possessions were <b>liened for</b> the payment of his <b>first</b> vow, it is as though he had no possessions at all with which to pay the second vow, and he therefore fulfilled the second vow even though he paid less than the full amount of money in his possession. Then, <b>at the time he gave</b> one <i>sela</i> <b>for</b> payment of <b>the first</b> vow, <b>he</b> in fact <b>had no more</b> than one <i>sela</i>, as he had given the other four <i>sela</i> in payment of the second vow, and therefore he fulfills his obligation by paying one <i>sela</i>.

Daf 8a

By contrast, if <b>he</b> first <b>gave four</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for</b> payment of <b>the first</b> vow <b>and</b> then <b>one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for</b> payment of <b>the second</b> vow, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation with regard to the <b>second</b> vow, because all he had at that stage was one <i>sela</i>. But <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation with regard to the <b>first</b> vow, because <b>all</b> five <i>sela</i> in his possession were <b>liened for</b> payment of <b>the first</b> vow, and therefore he did not fulfill his obligation by paying only four.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>one had in his possession five <i>sela</i> and he said:</b> It is hereby <b>incumbent upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation twice,</b> and consequently both obligations take effect <b>simultaneously, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? One can claim that <b>since he vowed</b> both vows <b>simultaneously, they take effect together,</b> and therefore <b>he gives two and a half</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for this</b> vow <b>and two and a half</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for that</b> vow; <b>or perhaps all of the</b> five <i>sela</i> <b>are fit for this</b> vow <b>and all of them are</b> also <b>fit for that</b> vow, and therefore he must pay five <i>sela</i> for each vow? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches at its conclusion that <b>there is no</b> payment <b>of valuations less than a <i>sela</i>; nor</b> is there a payment <b>greater</b> than fifty <i>sela</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this</b> statement, as this <i>halakha</i> was already stated at the beginning of the mishna?
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> additional statement <b>teaches us</b> that <b>there is no</b> payment of valuations <b>less than a <i>sela</i>, but,</b> by inference, <b>there is</b> a payment of valuations <b>more than a <i>sela</i>.</b> Similarly, <b>there is no</b> payment of valuations for a sum <b>greater</b> than <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>, but <b>there is</b> a payment that is <b>less than fifty</b> <i>sela</i>. <b>And</b> this <b>unattributed</b> statement of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that if one cannot pay the full amount of the valuation, he pays however much he can afford, even if it is more than a <i>sela</i>, rather than paying only one <i>sela</i>, as stated by Rabbi Meir.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman experienced a discharge of blood and is <b>unsure</b> whether it was during her days of menstruation or during the eleven days that would render her a <i>zava</i>, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty does <b>not</b> occur in <b>fewer than seven</b> clean days, <b>nor</b> in <b>more than seventeen</b> clean days, depending on the number of days that she experiences the discharge.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages</b> elaborated on the principle of the mishna, as <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman who had a discharge of blood and is <b>unsure</b> whether it was during her days of menstruation or during the eleven days that would render her a <i>zava</i>, <b>who said: I saw one impure day,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for one day, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after <b>seventeen</b> clean days, i.e., seventeen days without any discharge. If her discharge occurred on the first of her days of menstruation, she has another six days of menstruation followed by eleven days of <i>ziva</i>; if she experiences a discharge after these seventeen clean days, she has certainly returned to her days of menstruation. If the initial discharge had been on any of the other days of the seven-day followed by eleven-day cycle, she would return to her days of menstruation after fewer days, but the definitive alleviation of her uncertainty does not occur until seventeen days.
If she said: <b>I saw two impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for two days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>seventeen</b> clean days. If the two days had been at the beginning of the days of her menstrual cycle, she would begin another menstrual cycle if she experienced her next discharge after sixteen clean days. Yet, there is a possibility that the first day of her discharge was on the last of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, and the second day was on the first of the days of her menstrual cycle. In that case, she would return to the beginning of her menstrual cycle only after the six remaining days of menstruation followed by eleven additional days, for a total of seventeen.
If she said: <b>I saw three impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for three days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>seventeen</b> clean days, as it is possible that the first two days of discharge were on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, and the third day of discharge was on the first of the days of her menstrual cycle.
If she said: <b>I saw four impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for four days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>sixteen</b> clean days. This is because the longest possible interval between these days of discharge and the beginning of her next menstrual cycle would occur if the first two days of discharge were at the end of her days of <i>ziva</i> and the other two were at the beginning of the days of her menstrual cycle. She would then require another five days of menstruation and the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, for a total of sixteen.
If she said: <b>I saw five impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for five days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>fifteen</b> clean days, to account for the possibility that the first two days of discharge occurred on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and the other three were on her days of her menstrual cycle. If she said: <b>I saw six impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for six days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>fourteen</b> clean days, to account for the possibility that the first two days of discharge occurred at the end of her days of <i>ziva</i> and the other four occurred at the beginning of her days of menstruation.
If she said: <b>I saw seven impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for seven days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>thirteen</b> clean days, to account for the possibility that the first two days of discharge occurred on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and the other five occurred at the beginning of her menstrual cycle. In that case, she would have another two days to conclude her days of menstruation, followed by the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, before she would start a new menstrual cycle.
If she said: <b>I saw eight impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for eight days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>twelve</b> clean days, to account for the possibility that the first two days of discharge occurred on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and the other six occurred at the beginning of her menstrual cycle.
If she said: <b>I saw nine impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for nine days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>eleven</b> clean days, to account for the possibility that the first two days of discharge occurred at the end of her days of <i>ziva</i> and the other seven occurred on the days of her menstrual cycle. In that case, she would have only the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> before beginning a new menstrual cycle.
If she said: <b>I saw ten impure days,</b> i.e., I had a discharge of blood for ten days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>ten</b> clean days, to account for the possibility that the first two days of discharge occurred on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and the other eight occurred on the seven days of her menstrual cycle and one additional day. If she said: I saw <b>eleven</b> impure days, i.e., I had a discharge of blood for eleven days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>nine</b> clean days, to account for the worst-case scenario that the first two days of discharge occurred on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and the other nine occurred on the seven days of her menstrual cycle, followed by two additional days.

Daf 8b

If she said: I saw <b>twelve</b> impure days, i.e., I had a discharge of blood for twelve days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>eight</b> clean days, to account for the worst-case scenario that the first two days of discharge occurred on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and the other ten occurred on the seven days of her menstrual cycle and the three subsequent days. If so, she would have another eight days until the end of the full eighteen-day cycle, and when she next experiences a discharge it is the beginning of her new menstrual cycle.
If she said: I saw <b>thirteen</b> impure days, i.e., I had a discharge of blood for thirteen days, the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after she experiences <b>seven</b> clean days, to account for the possibility that the first two days of discharge occurred on the last two of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and the others occurred on the seven days of her menstrual cycle and the four subsequent days. If so, she would be left with only seven more days until the end of the full eighteen-day cycle, and when she next experiences a discharge it is the beginning of her new menstrual cycle.
All this shows <b>that there is no alleviation of</b> a woman’s state of uncertainty if she had a discharge of blood and is <b>unsure</b> whether it was during her days of menstruation or during her days of <i>ziva</i> in <b>fewer than seven</b> clean days <b>and</b> in <b>no more than seventeen</b> clean days.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rabba: Why do I</b> need <b>all of these</b> clean days? <b>Let her count</b> a mere <b>seven</b> clean days <b>and be permitted</b> to her husband. Regardless of whether the bleeding occurred during her days of menstruation or during her days of <i>ziva</i>, a woman can immerse in a ritual bath and become ritually pure and permitted to her husband after a maximum of seven clean days.
Rabba <b>said to him: We say</b> that she must experience seventeen clean days only with regard <b>to setting her right concerning</b> her status as a <b>menstruating woman</b> and the <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty. It is true that a woman can always become permitted to her husband after seven clean days. The discussion in the mishna and <i>baraita</i> concerns the resolution of uncertainty about whether her next discharge of blood will render her a menstruating woman or a <i>zava</i>. This is significant because if she is menstruating she can become ritually pure and permitted to her husband after seven days even if none of them are clean days, whereas if the discharge occurred over one or two days during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, she becomes pure after one clean day; and if the bleeding lasts three days or more during that time, she must wait for seven clean days.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All</b> women <b>who</b> experience a discharge of blood and <b>are unsure</b> whether it is during the days of menstruation or the days of <i>ziva</i> are considered <b><i>zavot</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>they</b> must <b>bring</b> the <b>offering</b> of a <i>zava</i>, in case they have this status; <b>but it is not eaten</b> by the priests, due to the possibility they were not actually <i>zavot</i>. This is the case for all women, <b>except for</b> a woman who experiences a discharge for thirteen consecutive days, whose <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after <b>seven</b> clean days, <b>and</b> for a woman who experiences a discharge for twelve consecutive days, whose <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after <b>eight</b> clean days. In those two instances, the women <b>bring</b> the <b>offering</b> of a <i>zava</i> <b>and it is eaten</b> by the priests.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>all</b> women <b>who</b> experience a discharge of blood and <b>are unsure</b> whether it is during the days of menstruation or the days of <i>ziva</i> are considered <b><i>zavot</i>?</b> It is in fact unknown whether they are menstruating or are <i>zavot</i>. <b>And furthermore,</b> is a woman who experienced a discharge for <b>one day or</b> for <b>two days fit</b> to <b>bring an offering?</b> Only a <i>zava</i> who experienced a discharge for three consecutive days is required to bring an offering.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>all <i>zavot</i>,</b> i.e., women who experienced a discharge for three consecutive days, <b>who are unsure</b> whether their discharge took place during the seven days of menstruation or the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, can become ritually pure after seven clean days, at which point they <b>bring an offering, but it is not eaten</b> by the priests. This, the <i>baraita</i> continues, is the case for all women <b>except for</b> a woman who experiences a discharge for thirteen consecutive days, whose <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after <b>seven</b> clean days, <b>and</b> for a woman who experiences a discharge for twelve consecutive days, whose <b>alleviation</b> of her state of uncertainty occurs after <b>eight</b> clean days. These women <b>bring</b> the <b>offering</b> of a <i>zava</i> <b>and it is eaten</b> by the priests.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are symptoms of leprosy that a priest will immediately confirm to be ritually pure or ritually impure, and there are others for which the priest quarantines the leper in order to determine his status. <b>With regard to leprous marks, there is no</b> quarantine that is <b>less than one week and none greater than three weeks.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> When the mishna states that there is no period of quarantine <b>less than</b> one <b>week,</b> it is referring to <b>leprous marks</b> that affect <b>a person,</b> as the priest issues a definitive decision about leprous symptoms on an inflammation or a burn after one week (see Leviticus 13:18–28). When the mishna states: <b>And none greater than three weeks,</b> it is referring to <b>leprous marks</b> that affect <b>houses,</b> as there are instances when a definitive decision is rendered only after the house has been quarantined for three weeks.
§ <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> In the phrase: <b>“Your benevolence is like the mighty mountains”</b> (Psalms 36:7), <b>these</b> acts of benevolence are referring to <b>leprous marks</b> that affect <b>a person.</b> When God punishes someone with benevolence, He afflicts the individual with leprous symptoms on his body that can be resolved in just one week. When the verse continues with the phrase, <b>“Your judgments are like the great deep,” these</b> judgments are referring to <b>leprous marks</b> that appear on <b>houses,</b> the status of which can take up to three weeks to be determined.
The Gemara asks: <b>To what does the plain meaning of</b> the aforementioned <b>verse refer? Rav Yehuda said</b> that the plain meaning of the verse is as follows: <b>If not</b> for the fact that <b>Your benevolence is like the mighty mountains, who could withstand Your judgments,</b> which are <b>like the great deep? Rabba says</b> the verse should be understood differently: <b>Your benevolence is like the mighty mountains, because Your judgments are like the great deep.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do Rav Yehuda and Rabba <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers that they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the dispute between <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> about how God applies His attribute of “abundant in kindness” (Exodus 34:6) when He judges a person whose merits and sins are equal. <b>As it was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: He hides away</b> some sins and does not put them on the scale, thereby allowing the merits to outweigh the sins. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: He lifts</b> the side of the scale that holds the sins so that the merits outweigh the sins.
The Gemara explains the connection between the two disputes: <b>Rabba</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> and therefore he interprets the verse as saying that God is benevolent because He discards one’s judgments, i.e., sins, by throwing them to the great deep, thereby allowing his merits to outweigh his sins. <b>And Rav Yehuda</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> and therefore he interprets the verse to mean that God lifts the side of merits as high as the mighty mountains, and were it not for this act of benevolence no one could stand before God’s judgments, which are like the great deep.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>No fewer than four full</b> thirty-day <b>months</b> may be established <b>during</b> the course of <b>a year, and it did not seem</b> appropriate to establish <b>more than eight. The two loaves</b> that are brought to the Temple on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>are eaten</b> by the priests <b>not before the second and not after the third</b> day from when they were baked. <b>The shewbread is eaten not before the ninth</b> day from when it was baked, which is the situation in a regular week when the bread is baked on Friday and eaten on the following Shabbat; <b>and not after the eleventh</b> day, when the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana occur on Thursday and Friday, as the shewbread is baked on Wednesday and not eaten until the following Shabbat.
<b>A minor boy is not circumcised before the eighth</b> day after his birth <b>and not after the twelfth</b> day. Normally a newborn is circumcised on his eighth day. If he was born during twilight, which an uncertain period of day or night, he is circumcised on what would be the eighth day of his birth if he is was born at night, which is the ninth day if he was born during the day. If he was born during twilight on Shabbat eve, the circumcision cannot be performed on Friday, as he might have been born on Shabbat and therefore Friday is only the seventh day. And the circumcision cannot be on Shabbat, as perhaps he was born on Friday and only circumcision performed on the eighth day overrides Shabbat. Therefore, it is postponed until after Shabbat. If two days of Rosh HaShana occur on Sunday and Monday, the circumcision is postponed until Tuesday, the twelfth day after birth.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement of the mishna that <b>it did not seem</b> appropriate to establish <b>more than eight? Rav Huna says: It did not seem</b> appropriate <b>to the Sages to extend more than eight</b> months in a year and establish them as full, thirty-day months. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>nine</b> months, in <b>that</b> the Sages <b>did not</b> deem it appropriate to establish that many full months in one year? Apparently, the Sages were concerned that <b>if so,</b> i.e., if there were that many full months,

Daf 9a

then the new <b>moon</b> of Tishrei would <b>arrive three days before</b> Rosh HaShana. A lunar month is twenty-nine and a half days, and therefore a twelve-month period should have six full months of thirty days and six deficient months of twenty-nine days. If there were nine full months, this would cause subsequent months to start three days after the new moon. This in turn would lead people to deride the rabbinical court and accuse it of declaring the new month whenever it wanted, without regard for the astronomical facts. The Gemara explains its question: <b>Now, too,</b> when there are eight full months in one year, the new moon of Tishrei will <b>arrive two days before</b> Rosh HaShana, which will also cause people to disparage the court.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Mesharshiyya says,</b> with regard to a different question: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the year before <b>was a leap year. Here, too,</b> one can answer that it is a case <b>where the year before it was a leap</b> year, <b>and the extension</b> of the <b>year</b> was accomplished with an added <b>month</b> of twenty-nine days. Accordingly, <b>remove a full,</b> thirty-day <b>month</b> from the calculation of the current year <b>corresponding to the</b> extra <b>deficient,</b> twenty-nine-day <b>month</b> of the previous year, and the result is that only seven thirty-day months have an impact on the appearance of the new moon relative to the following Rosh HaShana. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even in a year with only seven thirty-day months the new moon would <b>still</b> precede Rosh HaShana by <b>one day.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>People do not pay attention</b> to a difference of one day, and therefore they will not deride the court.
Until this point the Gemara has discussed Rav Huna’s interpretation of the mishna, that the statement: It did not seem appropriate to establish more than eight, means that the Sages did not wish to establish more than eight full months in one year. The Gemara presents an alternative opinion. <b>Ulla says:</b> The mishna means that <b>it did not seem</b> appropriate <b>to the Sages to establish more than eight deficient,</b> twenty-nine-day months. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>is saying what</b> the <b>reason</b> is for the previous statement in the mishna, as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>no fewer than four full,</b> thirty-day <b>months</b> may be established <b>during a year?</b> It is <b>because it did not seem</b> appropriate <b>to the Sages to establish more than eight deficient,</b> twenty-nine-day months, so that the shortest possible year would comprise four full months and eight deficient months.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>nine</b> deficient months, in <b>that</b> the Sages <b>did not</b> deem it appropriate to have so many deficient months in one year? Apparently, the Sages were concerned <b>that if so,</b> i.e., if there were nine deficient months, the new <b>moon</b> of Tishrei would appear <b>three days after</b> Rosh HaShana. But <b>now, too,</b> if there are eight deficient months in one year, the new moon will appear <b>two days after</b> Rosh HaShana.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Mesharshiyya says</b> with regard to a different question: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the year before <b>was a leap year. Here, too,</b> one can answer that it is a case <b>where the year before it was a leap</b> year, and the added month was a thirty-day month. Accordingly, <b>remove a deficient,</b> twenty-nine-day month from the calculation of the current year <b>corresponding to the</b> extra <b>full,</b> thirty-day <b>month</b> of the previous year, and the result is that only seven deficient months have an impact on the appearance of the new moon relative to the following Rosh HaShana.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even in a year with seven deficient months <b>there is still one day</b> between Rosh HaShana and the appearance of the new moon, and therefore people will deride the court. The Gemara answers: People will <b>assume</b> that the new moon <b>was sighted</b> by witnesses and reported to the court, and they will say: The new moon was visible yesterday <b>but we did not pay attention</b> and did not notice it.

Daf 9b

The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rav Huna and Ulla <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>about</b> the length of the month added in the <b>intercalation of the year, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How many</b> days are added in the <b>intercalation of the year? Thirty</b> days. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> A deficient <b>month,</b> i.e., one of twenty-nine days. Rav Huna accepts the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, whereas Ulla accepts the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: The festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i> occurs only on</b> the same day of the week as <b>the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering, i.e., the sixteenth of Nisan, which is the second day of Passover. <b>And Rosh HaShana</b> also <b>occurs only on</b> the same day of the week as <b>the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering of the preceding year, <b>or</b> on the day of the week that occurs <b>on the night after</b> the waving, i.e., the seventeenth of Nisan, which is the third day of Passover. <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla,</b> who says <b>that we may establish eight deficient</b> months in a year but <b>we may not establish</b> eight <b>full</b> months in a year, <b>you find</b> that Rosh HaShana can occur on either of the two days mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara elaborates: There are six ends of months between the <i>omer</i> offering and Rosh HaShana. In an ordinary year the months alternate in length, so these six months will comprise three full and three deficient months. If so, Rosh HaShana will occur on the same day of the week as the third day of Passover. If a year has eight deficient months, one of the <b>two</b> extra <b>deficient</b> months will presumably occur in the summer, between the day of waving and Rosh HaShana, which would mean that Rosh HaShana would occur one day earlier, <b>on</b> the same day of the week as the second day of Passover, <b>the day of the waving</b> of the <i>omer</i> offering.
And if no extra deficient months are added that year, but the standard format of alternating lengths of months, <b>one full and one deficient,</b> is applied, Rosh HaShana will occur on the day of the week that occurs <b>on the night after</b> the waving of the <i>omer</i> offering.
<b>But according to Rav Huna, who says: We may establish</b> eight <b>full,</b> thirty-day months in a year, <b>there are</b> also <b>times when you find</b> that Rosh HaShana occurs <b>on the night</b> after <b>the night</b> after <b>the extra day,</b> i.e., the thirtieth of Nisan, two days after the day of the week of the <i>omer</i> offering. This would occur on a Rosh HaShana following a year with eight full months, i.e., two more full months than usual, when one of the extra full months would occur between Passover and Rosh HaShana. In such a case, Rosh HaShana would be delayed from occurring on the same day of the week as the third day of Passover, which is the usual situation, to the same day as the fourth day of Passover.
The Gemara responds with a counter objection. <b>Rav Huna</b> could <b>say to you: And does</b> the <i>baraita</i> really <b>work out well according to Ulla?</b> Even according to Ulla, <b>it is eight</b> full months <b>that we may not establish</b> in one year, <b>but we may establish seven</b> full months in a single year, one more than the usual. Consequently, there may be <b>times when we do not establish</b> the extra full month <b>in the winter, but we establish</b> it <b>in the summer,</b> between Passover and Rosh HaShana. In such a case, Rosh HaShana would <b>be two days after</b> the day of the week of the <i>omer</i> offering. Consequently, even according to Ulla, the <i>baraita</i> should have mentioned this possibility.
<b>Rather,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with <b><i>Aḥerim</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> that <b>the difference between <i>Shavuot</i></b> of one year <b>and <i>Shavuot</i></b> of the following year, <b>and</b> similarly, the difference <b>between Rosh HaShana</b> of one year <b>and Rosh HaShana</b> of the following year, <b>is only four days</b> of the week. In an ordinary year, when full and deficient months alternate, there are 354 days. Therefore, every year is exactly fifty weeks and four days long, which means that any calendar date one year would occur four days later in the week in the following year. <b>And if it was a leap year,</b> in which case the year contains 383 days, or fifty-four weeks and five days, there is a difference of <b>five</b> days between them.
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b> the <i>baraita</i> remains difficult, because <b>according to <i>Aḥerim</i> you do not find</b> that Rosh HaShana ever occurs <b>on</b> the same day of the week as <b>the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering. This is because <i>Aḥerim</i> maintain that the months always alternate between full and deficient months and therefore there is never an additional full month between Passover and Rosh HaShana.
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said</b> in response: Rosh HaShana can occur on the same day of the week as the day of the <i>omer</i> offering, in a case <b>where it was a leap year and</b> the intercalated month added to create the <b>leap year</b> was <b>thirty days.</b> This would cause Rosh HaShana to occur six days of the week later than the year before, but <i>Aḥerim</i> maintain that it must occur exactly five days of the week later. Consequently, one of the months after Passover must be changed from a full month to a deficient one: <b>Remove</b> from the calculation one full <b>month</b> after Passover <b>corresponding to</b> the extra full <b>month</b> added before Passover in order to ensure that Rosh HaShana occurs five days of the week later than the previous year. This ensures <b>that you</b> will <b>find</b> a case where Rosh HaShana occurs <b>on</b> the same day of the week as <b>the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rava:</b> Did <b><i>Aḥerim</i> come to teach us the number</b> of days between one Rosh HaShana and the next? Why didn’t <i>Aḥerim</i> simply say that the months of the year always alternate between full and deficient months, and the calculation of the number of days between the Festivals in one year and the next would be obvious? Rava answered: <b>This</b> statement of <i>Aḥerim</i> <b>teaches us that we do not need</b> to take into consideration the possibility that it is <b>a mitzva to sanctify</b> the new month <b>according to the sighting</b> of the new moon. Rather, if the order of the months dictates that a new month should be deficient, the start of the following month may be declared despite the fact that the new moon has not been sighted.
<b>Ravina objects to</b> the opinion of <i>Aḥerim</i> for a different reason: <b>But</b> how is it possible that there is always a difference of four weekdays between one Rosh HaShana and the next? The length of a lunar month is not precisely twenty-nine and a half days, but twenty-nine days, twelve hours and 793/1080 of an hour. This extra fraction beyond twenty-nine and a half days is compounded month after month and year after year, and as a result, eventually <b>there is an</b> additional <b>day</b> that must be added to the calendar every three years due to <b>the</b> accumulation of <b>hours, and</b> an additional <b>day</b> that must be added every <b>thirty years</b> due to a further accumulation of the extra parts of an hour. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> these days do <b>not</b> appear on the calendar <b>every year,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>did not account</b> for them.
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute between Rav Huna and Ulla over the interpretation of the mishna. <b>And Shmuel also holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> that it is permitted to establish eight full months in a year, <b>as Shmuel says: The year</b> in <b>a lunar</b> calendar has <b>no less than 352 days, and no more than 356 days.</b>
<b>How so?</b> An ordinary year, consisting of alternating full and deficient months, consists of 354 days. If <b>two</b> months that are generally deficient are made <b>full,</b> there are three hundred and fifty-<b>six</b> days in the year. If <b>two</b> months that are generally full are made <b>deficient,</b> there are three hundred and fifty-<b>two</b> days in the year. If the months alternate as usual, <b>one full and one deficient,</b> there are three hundred and fifty-<b>four</b> days in the year. This shows that according to Shmuel it is permitted to change two months from deficient to full months, which leads to a total of eight full months in one year.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>. If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite</b> for a duration that is <b>like the</b> number of <b>days</b> in <b>a solar</b> year, <b>he counts 365 days</b> for his term of <b>naziriteship, corresponding to the number of days</b> in <b>a solar</b> year. If he says: <b>Like the days</b> in <b>a lunar</b> year, i.e., a year comprising twelve lunar months, <b>he counts 354 days</b> for his term of <b>naziriteship, corresponding to the number of days</b> in <b>a lunar</b> year. The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And if it is so,</b> that there can be eight full months in a year, there are <b>times when you find</b> that a lunar year has three hundred and fifty-<b>six</b> days. Why, then, shouldn’t the period of naziriteship last for 356 days?
The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>with regard to vows,</b> you <b>follow the</b> ordinary <b>language of people.</b> The meaning of a vow is understood in accordance with the way its words are used in common speech. <b>And</b> when people speak of a lunar year, they are generally referring to one that is the length of <b>most years,</b> i.e., 354 days.
The Gemara adds: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> that it is permitted to establish eight full months in one year. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was an <b>incident</b> in which <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>established nine deficient</b> months in one year, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>the new moon was sighted in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> on Rosh HaShana, and not later. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expressed astonishment and said: We made nine</b> months <b>deficient</b> in one year <b>and</b> yet <b>the new moon was sighted in its</b> proper <b>time.</b> How could this be? <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said before him: Perhaps</b> last year <b>was a leap year</b>

Daf 10a

<b>and</b> the month that was <b>intercalated,</b> added for the <b>leap year,</b> was <b>thirty</b> days, and <b>last year we turned two</b> months that are generally deficient into <b>full</b> months, which meant that it had eight full months instead of the usual six. Consequently, <b>remove</b> from consideration the <b>three</b> months that were made deficient this year <b>corresponding to the three</b> extra months that were made full last year, <b>and</b> the moon is <b>restored to its place,</b> i.e., it is properly aligned with the months. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Lamp of Israel!</b> Indeed, <b>so it was.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>No fewer than twenty-one</b> trumpet <b>blasts are</b> sounded daily <b>in the Temple,</b> as each day three blasts were sounded for the opening of the gates in the morning, nine for the daily morning offering, and nine for the daily afternoon offering, totaling twenty-one. <b>And no more than forty-eight are</b> ever sounded on a single day. This would occur on the Friday of <i>Sukkot</i>, when they would sound an additional twelve blasts during the ritual of drawing the water for the water libation; nine for the additional offerings; three to signal the population to cease their work before Shabbat; and three more to mark the beginning of Shabbat.
When accompanying their song with instruments, the Levites <b>do not use fewer than two lyres and do not use more than six.</b> When flutes are played, <b>they do not use fewer than two flutes and do not use more than twelve. And</b> there are <b>twelve days during the year when the flute plays before the altar: At</b> the time of <b>the slaughter of the first Paschal offering,</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan; <b>and at</b> the time of <b>the slaughter of the second Paschal offering,</b> on the fourteenth of Iyyar; <b>and on the first festival</b> day <b>of Passover; and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>; and on</b> all <b>eight days of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>. And one would not play with a copper flute; rather, one would play with a flute of reed, because its sound is</b> more <b>pleasant. And one would conclude</b> the music <b>only with a single flute, because it concludes</b> the music <b>nicely.</b>
The Temple musicians <b>were slaves of priests;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The musicians were not slaves, but Israelites from <b>the family of the house of Pegarim and the family of the house of Tzippara from</b> the city of <b>Emaum,</b> and their lineage was sufficiently pure that <b>they would marry</b> their daughters <b>to</b> members of <b>the priesthood. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: They were Levites.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that no fewer than twenty-one trumpet blasts are sounded daily in the Temple and no more than forty-eight. The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not</b> blow <b>fewer than seven</b> blasts, and <b>one may not</b> blow <b>more than sixteen</b> blasts.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> A series of blasts consisting of <b><i>tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, <i>tekia</i> is</b> counted as <b>one</b> unit. <b>And the Rabbis hold: A <i>tekia</i></b> is counted as <b>a discrete</b> unit <b>and a <i>terua</i></b> is also counted as <b>a discrete</b> unit, <b>and</b> the final <b><i>tekia</i></b> is again counted as <b>a discrete</b> unit. They agree with regard to the sequence and the number of the blasts; their disgreement is only with regard to how the blasts are tallied.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> As <b>it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And you shall sound [<i>utkatem</i>] a <i>terua</i>”</b> (Numbers 10:5), <b>and it is written: “A <i>terua</i> they will sound [<i>yitke’u</i>]”</b> (Numbers 10:6). <b>Conclude from</b> the fact that the Torah uses a verb from the root <i>tekia</i> when referring to a <i>terua</i> that <b>a <i>tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, and <i>tekia</i></b> together constitute <b>one</b> unit. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret these verses? They explain that <b>these</b> verses <b>come</b> to teach that each <i>terua</i> blast is accompanied by <b>a plain</b> blast, a <i>tekia</i>, <b>preceding it and</b> another <b>plain</b> blast <b>following it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reasoning</b> of <b>the Rabbis? As it is written: “And when congregating the people you shall sound a <i>tekia</i> and shall not sound a <i>terua</i>”</b> (Numbers 10:7). <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that a series of <b><i>tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, and <i>tekia</i> are</b> considered <b>one</b> unit, would <b>the Merciful One say</b> to <b>perform</b> only <b>half a mitzva?</b> Rather, each sound constitutes a separate mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> explain this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> single <i>tekia</i> mentioned in the context of congregating the people was blown <b>merely as a signal</b> to the people to assemble, not for the purpose of fulfilling a mitzva, which, in Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, always comes in units of three sounds.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Kahana said?</b> As Rav Kahana said: <b>There is</b> to be <b>no</b> pause <b>between a <i>tekia</i> and a <i>terua</i> at all,</b> but rather they are sounded in one continuous series of blasts. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Why was it necessary to point this out?
The Gemara answers: It is not obvious that Rav Kahana’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Lest you say</b> that Rav Kahana <b>comes</b> to teach his <i>halakha</i> <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and that he is coming <b>to exclude</b> only the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says:</b> If <b>one heard nine blasts in nine</b> different <b>hours on the day</b> of Rosh HaShana, despite the considerable gap between them, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. One might have thought that Rav Kahana meant only that there should not be such long gaps between the sounds. Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that Rav Kahana’s ruling is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, as he does not allow any pause at all between the shofar blasts.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do you know that this was Rav Kahana’s intent? One can <b>say it is indeed so,</b> that Rav Kahana holds in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis and he merely excludes the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The Gemara answers that <b>if so, what is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“at all”</b> when Rav Kahana said that there is no pause between a <i>tekia</i> and a <i>terua</i> at all? This phrase indicates that Rav Kahana does not allow even a slight pause between blasts, which is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
§ The mishna teaches that there are <b>twelve days during the year when the flute plays</b> before the altar, and it proceeds to list them. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>these</b> days enumerated in the mishna that the flute is played before the altar specifically on those occasions? The Gemara answers: They are unique, <b>since</b> these are the days <b>on which the individual completes</b> the full <b><i>hallel</i>.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> There are <b>eighteen days</b> a year <b>on which the individual completes</b> the full <b><i>hallel</i>: The eight days of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, including the Eighth Day of Assembly; <b>and the eight days of Hanukkah; and the first festival day of Passover; and the festival day of Assembly,</b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>And in the Diaspora,</b> where a second day is added to each Festival due to uncertainty over the precise date, there are <b>twenty-one days: The nine days of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>; <b>and the eight days of Hanukkah; and the</b> first <b>two festival days of Passover; and the two festival days of Assembly,</b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>that we say</b> <i>hallel</i> <b>every day, and what is different</b> about <b>Passover, that we do not say</b> <i>hallel</i>

Daf 10b

<b>every day,</b> but only on the first day? The Gemara answers: The days <b>of</b> the <b>festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> are <b>distinct</b> from one another <b>with regard to their</b> additional <b>offerings,</b> as the number of bulls offered changes each day of <i>Sukkot</i> (see Numbers 29:12–38). Since each day is unique, the full <i>hallel</i> is recited on each day. By contrast, the days <b>of Passover are not distinct</b> from one another <b>with regard to their</b> additional <b>offerings</b> (see Numbers 28:24), and therefore the full <i>hallel</i> is recited only on the first day, which is the first day on which the additional offerings for a Festival are sacrificed.
The Gemara objects: On <b>Shabbat, which is</b> also <b>distinct</b> from the other days of the week <b>with regard to its</b> additional <b>offerings, let</b> us <b>say</b> <i>hallel</i>. The Gemara explains: Shabbat <b>is not called an appointed day</b> in the Torah, and <i>hallel</i> is recited only on days that are referred to in the Torah as appointed days (see Leviticus 23:4), which are days of rejoicing.
The Gemara objects: On the <b>New Moon, which is called an appointed day, let</b> us <b>say</b> <i>hallel</i>. The Gemara explains: The New Moon <b>is not sanctified with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>the performance of labor,</b> and <i>hallel</i> is recited only on a day that is sanctified, <b>as it is written: “You shall have a song as in the night when a festival is sanctified”</b> (Isaiah 30:29), which indicates that <b>a night that is sanctified as a Festival,</b> which includes a prohibition of labor, <b>requires song, but</b> one <b>that is not sanctified as a Festival does not require song.</b>
The Gemara objects: On <b>Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, which are called an appointed day and</b> also <b>are sanctified with regard to</b> the prohibition against the <b>performance of labor, let</b> us <b>say</b> <i>hallel</i>. The Gemara explains: <i>Hallel</i> is not recited on those days <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>the ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, for what</b> reason <b>do the Jewish people not recite songs</b> of praise, i.e., <i>hallel</i>, <b>before You on Rosh HaShana and on Yom Kippur? He said to them:</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that while <b>the King is sitting on the throne of judgment and the books of life and the books of death are open before Him, the Jewish people would be reciting</b> joyous <b>songs</b> of praise <b>before Me?</b> Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur are somber days of judgment whose mood is incompatible with the recitation of <i>hallel</i>.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about <b>Hanukkah, which</b> has <b>neither this or that,</b> i.e., there is no special offering on it, nor is labor prohibited, <b>and</b> yet <b>one says</b> <i>hallel</i>. The Gemara explains: <i>Hallel</i> is recited on Hanukkah not because of its status as a Festival, but <b>because of the miracle</b> that occurred on those days. The Gemara objects: If so, on <b>Purim, when there is</b> also this factor, i.e., <b>a miracle</b> occurred on that day, <b>let</b> us <b>say</b> <i>hallel</i>. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> <i>Hallel</i> is not recited on Purim <b>because one does not recite a song</b> of praise <b>for a miracle that</b> occurred <b>outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this</b> explanation: <b>But there is the exodus from Egypt, which was a miracle that</b> took place <b>outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>and</b> yet <b>we say <i>hallel</i></b> on Passover night in commemoration of it? The Gemara responds that this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Until the Jewish people entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>all lands were</b> deemed <b>fit</b> for <b>songs</b> of praise <b>to be recited</b> for miracles performed within their borders, as all lands were treated equally. But <b>once the Jewish people entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, that land became endowed with greater sanctity, and <b>all the</b> other <b>lands were no</b> longer deemed <b>fit</b> for <b>songs</b> of praise <b>to be recited</b> for miracles performed within them.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> an alternative answer as to why <i>hallel</i> is not recited on Purim: <b>The reading of</b> the Megilla, i.e., the Scroll of Esther, <b>is</b> equivalent to reciting <b><i>hallel</i>. Rava says</b> a third reason: <b>Granted,</b> <i>hallel</i> is said <b>there,</b> when recalling the exodus from Egypt, as after that salvation one can recite the phrase in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“Give praise, O servants of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 113:1), since after the Israelites’ servitude to Pharaoh ended with their salvation, they were truly servants of the Lord <b>and not servants of Pharaoh.</b> But can it be said <b>here,</b> after the salvation commemorated on Purim: <b>“Give praise, O servants of the Lord,”</b> which would indicate that after the salvation the Jewish people were only servants of the Lord <b>and not servants of Ahasuerus?</b> Not so, as even after the miracle of Purim, <b>we are still the servants of Ahasuerus,</b> since the Jews remained in exile under Persian rule.
The Gemara objects: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, who says</b> that <b>the reading of</b> the Megilla itself <b>is</b> an act of reciting <b><i>hallel</i>,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Once the Jewish people entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, that land became endowed with greater sanctity, <b>and all the</b> other <b>lands were no longer</b> deemed <b>fit</b> for <b>songs</b> of praise <b>to be recited</b> for miracles performed within them. How, then, may one recite a form of <i>hallel</i> by reading the Megilla? The Gemara answers: He maintains that <b>once</b> the people <b>were exiled</b> from Eretz Yisrael, the other lands <b>returned to their initial suitability,</b> and were once again deemed fit for reciting <i>hallel</i>, in commemoration of miracles performed within them.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one would not play a copper flute [<i>abuv</i>];</b> rather, one would play a flute [<i>abuv</i>] of reed, because its sound is pleasant. The Gemara asks: The mishna <b>opens by</b> referring to flutes and calls them <b><i>ḥalil</i> and</b> then <b>concludes by</b> referring to playing an <b><i>abuv</i>. Rav Pappa said: A <i>ḥalil</i> is</b> the same as <b>an <i>abuv</i>.</b> Its original name was <i>abuv</i>; <b>and why does</b> the mishna <b>call it a <i>ḥalil</i>?</b> The reason is <b>that its sound is sweet [<i>ḥali</i>].</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was a flute in the Temple; it was smooth</b> and <b>it was thin,</b> i.e., its sides were thin; <b>it was</b> made <b>from reed, and it was</b> in existence <b>from the days of Moses. The king issued a command and they plated</b> the flute with <b>gold, but</b> then <b>its sound was not</b> as <b>pleasant</b> as it was previously. <b>They</b> therefore <b>removed its plating and its sound was</b> then as <b>pleasant as it was</b> before. Similarly, <b>there was a cymbal in the Temple; it was</b> made <b>from copper and its sound was pleasant. It became damaged and the Sages sent for and brought artisans from Alexandria in Egypt and they repaired it, but its sound was not</b> as <b>pleasant</b> as before. <b>They removed</b> the materials with which the cymbal had been <b>repaired and its sound was</b> then as <b>pleasant as it had been</b> before the repair.
<b>There was a mortar in the Temple; it was</b> made <b>of copper and it was from the days of Moses, and it was</b> used to <b>compound the spices</b> for the incense. <b>It became damaged and they brought artisans from Alexandria in Egypt and they repaired it, but it did not compound</b> the spices <b>as</b> well as <b>it had</b> before. <b>They removed</b> the materials with which the mortar had been <b>repaired and it</b> then <b>compounded</b> the spices <b>as it had</b> before it was repaired.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>These two</b> copper <b>vessels,</b> the cymbal and the mortar, <b>were remnants from the First Temple and they were damaged and they</b> could <b>not be repaired</b> in an effective manner. <b>And</b> it was <b>with regard to</b> the copper vessels constructed for the First Temple that <b>David said:</b> “All these vessels, which Hiram made for King Solomon, in the House of the Lord, were of <b>burnished brass”</b> (I Kings 7:45), and, in a parallel verse, <b>“bright brass”</b> (II Chronicles 4:16). <b>And with regard to</b> these two items <b>it states</b> in the verse describing the vessels that Ezra brought to Jerusalem: <b>“And vessels of fine golden brass, two, precious as gold”</b> (Ezra 8:27).
<b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the meaning of the phrase: Two, precious as gold. <b>One said: Each and every one</b> of these brass vessels <b>was</b> as <b>valuable as two</b> vessels made <b>from gold. And</b> the other <b>one said: The two of them</b> together <b>were</b> as <b>valuable as one</b> vessel made <b>from gold.</b> Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef teaches</b> the following explanation found in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The two of them</b> together <b>were</b> as <b>valuable as one</b> vessel made <b>from gold.</b>
The Gemara cites another explanation of the verse in Ezra. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The cymbals and mortars <b>were pairs,</b> i.e., there were two cymbals and two mortars, <b>as it is stated</b> in the aforementioned verse <b>“two”; do not read</b> it as <b>two [<i>shenayim</i>], but as pairs [<i>sheniyyim</i>].</b>
§ <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Siloam</b> pool <b>used to spurt</b> forth <b>water through</b> an opening with a diameter <b>like</b> that of <b>an <i>issar</i></b> coin.<b>The king issued a command and they widened</b> the opening <b>so that its waters would increase, but</b> the waters actually <b>decreased. And they</b> subsequently <b>decreased</b> the size of the opening <b>again and it</b> once again <b>spurted</b> forth <b>water</b> as it had before. All this serves <b>to uphold that which is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might”</b> (Jeremiah 9:22), i.e., man should not think that he can accomplish anything he wishes.
<b>And likewise Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say,</b> with regard to the musical instruments in the Temple: <b>There was no <i>hirdolim</i> in the Temple.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is a <i>hirdolim</i>? Abaye said:</b> It is a <b>hydraulic organ.</b> It was not used in the Temple <b>because its sound is pleasant but it disrupts the melody.</b>
<b>Rava bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: There was</b> an instrument called <b><i>magreifa</i> in the Temple.</b>

Daf 11a

<b>There were ten holes in it</b> and <b>each and every one</b> would <b>emit ten types of tone. It</b> therefore <b>emerges</b> that the <b>entire</b> instrument <b>emitted one hundred types of tone. It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> The <i>magreifa</i> was <b>one cubit</b> wide <b>and one cubit tall, and a handle protruded from it.</b> It was hollow <b>and there were ten holes in it</b> and <b>each one</b> would <b>produce one hundred types of tone. It</b> therefore <b>emerges</b> that that the <b>entire</b> instrument <b>emitted one thousand types of tone. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And your mnemonic</b> to remember which of these two statements was said by Shmuel and which was taught in a <i>baraita</i> is that the <b><i>baraita</i></b> expresses itself with <b>exaggeration,</b> as it is common for <i>baraitot</i> to exaggerate numbers.
§ The mishna teaches that the Temple musicians <b>were slaves of priests</b> according to Rabbi Meir, whereas according to Rabbi Yosei they were Israelites of pure lineage, and according to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus they were Levites. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this; that the one who says they were slaves holds</b> that the <b>primary component</b> of <b>song</b> in the Temple service is singing <b>with the mouth, and</b> the <b>instrumental</b> music <b>was performed</b> merely <b>to sweeten the sound</b> of the singing. Since the instrumental music is mere accompaniment, it could be performed by slaves. <b>And the one who says that</b> the musicians <b>were Levites holds</b> that the <b>primary component</b> of <b>song</b> in the Temple service is the music played <b>with instruments.</b> Therefore, the musicians had to be Levites, who were tasked with the song that was part of the Temple service.
The Gemara responds: <b>And can you understand</b> the disagreement in this manner? According to this suggestion, <b>what does Rabbi Yosei,</b> who says that the musicians were Israelites of pure lineage, <b>hold? If he holds</b> that the <b>primary component</b> of <b>song</b> in the Temple service is singing <b>with the mouth,</b> then it should be <b>sufficient</b> if <b>slaves</b> play the instruments. Why would he require Israelites of pure lineage? And <b>if he holds</b> that the <b>primary component</b> of <b>song</b> in the Temple service is the music played <b>with instruments, we</b> should <b>require Levites</b> to play the instruments.
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>holds</b> that the <b>primary component</b> of <b>song</b> in the Temple service is singing <b>with the mouth. And here,</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree about</b> whether the musicians in the Temple may be <b>elevated from the</b> musical <b>platform to</b> the presumptive status of pure <b>lineage</b> with regard to marriage <b>and</b> eligibility <b>to</b> receive Levitical <b>tithes.</b>
<b>The one who says</b> that the musicians <b>were slaves holds</b> that people <b>cannot be elevated from the</b> Temple musical <b>platform to</b> the presumptive status of pure <b>lineage</b> with regard to marriage <b>and</b> eligibility <b>to</b> receive <b>tithes. The one who says that</b> the musicians <b>were Levites holds</b> that <b>one elevates from the platform both to</b> the presumptive status of pure <b>lineage and</b> eligibility <b>to</b> receive <b>tithes. And according to the one who says</b> that the musicians <b>were Israelites,</b> he <b>holds</b> that <b>one elevates from the platform to</b> the presumptive status of pure <b>lineage but not</b> with regard to the eligibility <b>to</b> receive <b>tithes.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The song</b> that the Levites sing while a communal offering is being sacrificed <b>is an indispensable</b> component of <b>the offering,</b> which means that if the Levites did not sing, the offering is invalid. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: It is not indispensable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir,</b> i.e., from where does he derive his opinion? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the verse states: “And I have given the Levites, they are given to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel,</b> to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, <b>and to make atonement for the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 8:19). The verse compares the atonement for the Jewish people, which is caused by the sprinkling of the blood of offerings on the altar, to the service of the Levites, which is their singing. This teaches that <b>just as the atonement</b> caused by the sprinkling of the blood <b>is an indispensable</b> component of the offering, <b>so too</b> the <b>song</b> of the Levites <b>is indispensable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from the comparison in this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> comparison serves <b>to</b> teach <b>another</b> <i>halakha</i>, which was stated <b>by Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: Just as</b> the <b>atonement</b> achieved by the sprinkling of the blood must take place <b>during the day, so too</b> the <b>song</b> must be sung <b>during the day.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: From where</b> is it derived that the <b>basic</b> requirement to accompany communal offerings with <b>song</b> applies <b>by Torah law? As it is stated</b> with regard to a Levite who serves in the Temple: <b>“Then he shall serve with the name of the Lord his God”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:7). <b>What is</b> this <b>service</b> that is performed <b>with the name</b> of God? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>song,</b> in which the Levites mention and praise the name of God.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that this service with the name of God is referring to the <b>lifting of the hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction, which also includes the mention of the name of God. If so, the verse is referring to priests, not ordinary Levites. The Gemara responds: <b>From the fact that it is written:</b> “At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi…<b>to serve Him, and to bless in His name”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:8), it can be derived <b>by inference that the Priestly Benediction is not</b> considered <b>service,</b> as the verse mentions service and the Priestly Benediction as distinct rituals.
<b>Rav Mattana said</b> that the source for the requirement to accompany the Temple offerings with song is derived <b>from here: “Because you did not serve the Lord your God with joyfulness, and with goodness of heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:47). <b>What is</b> this <b>service</b> of God <b>that is</b> performed <b>with joyfulness and with goodness of heart? You must say</b> that <b>this is song.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that this service is studying the <b>words of Torah, as it is written: “The precepts of the Lord are upright, rejoicing the heart”</b> (Psalms 19:9). The Gemara explains: Torah <b>is</b> indeed <b>called</b> a matter that <b>rejoices the heart,</b> but <b>it is not called “goodness.”</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that the joyful service of God referred to above is the bringing of the <b>first fruits, as it is written</b> in that context: <b>“And you shall rejoice in all the goodness</b> that the Lord your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 26:11). The Gemara answers: Bringing the first fruits <b>is</b> indeed <b>called goodness,</b> but <b>it is not called</b> something that involves <b>goodness of heart.</b>
The Gemara discusses a related matter. <b>Rav Mattana says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> bringing the <b>first fruits</b> to the Temple <b>requires</b> the accompaniment of <b>song?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>derived from here,</b> i.e., from the requirement to accompany communal offerings with song, by means of a verbal analogy of the word <b>goodness</b> in the verse “And with goodness of heart” and the word <b>goodness</b> in the verse “You shall rejoice in all the goodness.”
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>songs</b> of praise in the Temple <b>are recited only over</b> the <b>wine</b> libation accompanying the sacrifice? <b>As it is stated: “And the vine replied: Should I leave my wine, which gladdens God and man,</b> and go and wave above the trees” (Judges 9:13). <b>If</b> it is clear that wine <b>gladdens people, in what</b> way <b>does it gladden God?</b> Rather, derive <b>from here that songs</b> of praise in the Temple <b>are recited only over</b> the <b>wine</b> of libation, and it is this song that gladdens God. This is difficult, as since there is no wine libation associated with the bringing of first fruits, how can it be accompanied by song?
The Gemara answers: <b>You can find</b> cases where the first fruits are brought in the form of wine, <b>as Rabbi Yosei teaches:</b> The verse states with regard to the first fruits: “You shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land” (Deuteronomy 26:2). Since the verse mentions “fruit,” <b>you</b> must <b>bring</b> the actual <b>fruit</b> as your first fruits offering, <b>and you may not bring</b> it in the form of <b>beverages.</b> If one <b>brought grapes and</b> he had already <b>pressed them</b> into wine, <b>from where</b> is it derived that he has fulfilled his obligation of offering his first fruits? <b>The verse states: “You shall bring in</b> from your land.” This apparently superfluous phrase comes to teach that if one brings wine for the mitzva of first fruits, he has fulfilled his obligation.
The Gemara presents another source for the requirement that the song of the Levites must accompany the sacrificial service in the Temple. <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that this obligation is derived <b>from here: “And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites…he was master of lifting, because he was skillful”</b> (I Chronicles 15:22). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“he was master [<i>yasor</i>]</b> of lifting,” <b>but</b> as: <b>He shall sing [<i>yashir</i>]</b> with the lifting of his voice.
The Sage named <b>Balvatei</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the requirement for the Levites to accompany the Temple offerings with song is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the Levites: “Every one that entered in <b>to do the work of service”</b> (Numbers 4:47). <b>What is work that must</b> be performed in conjunction with another <b>service? You must say</b> that <b>this is song.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that the requirement to accompany the Temple offerings with song is derived <b>from here:</b> “Sing aloud to God…<b>Take up the melody, and sound the timbrel, the sweet harp with the lyre”</b> (Psalms 81:2–3). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that the obligation is derived <b>from here: “Those yonder lift up their voice, they sing for joy; for the majesty of the Lord they shout from the sea”</b> (Isaiah 24:14).
<b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> a derivation for the requirement for the Levites to accompany the Temple offerings with song <b>from here: “But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the holy things belonged to them: They bore them [<i>yisa’u</i>] upon their shoulders”</b> (Numbers 7:9). <b>By inference from that</b> which <b>is stated, “upon their shoulders,” don’t I know that they bore them? Why</b> must <b>the verse state “<i>yisa’u</i></b>”<b>?</b> The term “<b><i>yisa’u</i></b>” <b>is not</b> stated here in its meaning of “they bore them,” but <b>rather</b> as <b>an expression</b> of <b>song. And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states: “Take up [<i>se’u</i>] the melody, and sound the timbrel,” and</b> another verse <b>states: “They lift up [<i>yisu</i>] their voice, they sing for joy.”</b>
<b>Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, says</b> that the requirement for the Levites to sing in the Temple is derived <b>from here: “Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19).

Daf 11b

This indicates that God responded to Moses, who was a Levite, by commanding him <b>about matters</b> pertaining to the <b>voice,</b> i.e., that the Levites must accompany the sacrifices with song. <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that the obligation for the Levites to sing in the Temple is derived <b>from here: “It came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound</b> to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord” (II Chronicles 5:13). This indicates that just as there is a requirement for trumpets to be sounded during the sacrifice of communal offerings (see Numbers 10:10), there is likewise a requirement for the Levites to sing.
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says</b> that the requirement for the Levites to sing in the Temple is derived <b>from here:</b> The Torah commands the priests with regard to the Levites: “They shall not come near the altar, <b>that they die not, neither they nor you”</b> (Numbers 18:3). The verse equates the Levites with the priests, indicating that <b>just as you,</b> the priests, are obligated <b>to</b> perform the <b>service</b> on the <b>altar, so too they,</b> the Levites, are obligated <b>to</b> perform <b>a service</b> pertaining to the <b>altar,</b> i.e., the song that accompanies the offerings.
A derivation of <i>halakhot</i> based on the comparison between priests and Levites in <b>this</b> verse <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated: <b>“That they die not, neither they nor you.”</b> This indicates that if <b>you,</b> the priests, perform <b>their</b> duties, i.e., the Levites’ duties, <b>or they,</b> the Levites, perform <b>yours,</b> e.g., the sacrificial rites, the perpetrator is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. But if <b>they,</b> the Levites, perform a function that belongs to a different group of Levites, but is nevertheless a duty of <b>theirs,</b> i.e., the Levites in general, e.g., if Levites assigned to open and close the gates of the Temple decide instead to sing, <b>they are not</b> punished <b>with death; rather,</b> they have merely violated <b>a prohibition.</b>
<b>Abaye said: We hold</b> that a Levite designated to serve as <b>a singer who</b> instead <b>served in another</b> Levite’s position <b>as a gatekeeper</b> is liable to be put <b>to death, as it is stated: “And those that were to pitch tent before the Tabernacle eastward, before the Tent of Meeting</b> toward the sunrising, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the Sanctuary, for the charge of the children of Israel; <b>and the stranger that drew near was to be put to death”</b> (Numbers 3:38). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term <b>“stranger”</b> in this verse? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to <b>an actual stranger,</b> i.e., a non-Levite, <b>isn’t it written</b> already on <b>another occasion</b> that he is liable to be put to death (see Numbers 3:10)? <b>Rather,</b> this is <b>not</b> its meaning; instead, it is referring to one who is a Levite but is <b>a stranger to that service.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Abaye’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A singer who served as a gatekeeper and a gatekeeper who sang are not</b> punished <b>with death; rather,</b> they have merely violated <b>a prohibition.</b>
The Gemara explains that this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Yehoshua bar Ḥananya,</b> a Levite, <b>who went to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Gudgeda,</b> also a Levite, in order <b>to assist in closing</b> the <b>doors</b> of the Temple. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Gudgeda <b>said to him: My son, go back, as you are among the singers and not among the gatekeepers.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that these two Levite Sages <b>disagree about this, that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Gudgeda, <b>holds</b> that if a Levite who is a singer closes the gate by himself, <b>it is</b> a prohibition punishable by <b>death, and</b> therefore <b>the Sages decreed</b> that a Levite who is a singer should not even assist the gatekeepers in closing the gates; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua bar Ḥananya, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is a prohibition</b> that is not punishable by death, <b>and</b> therefore the Sages <b>did not decree</b> that a Levite who is a singer should not assist the gatekeepers in closing the gates?
The Gemara responds: No, that is not necessarily the correct analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. Rather, <b>everyone</b> agrees that one Levite performing another Levite’s task by himself is <b>a prohibition</b> that is not punishable by death. One <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>the Sages</b> nevertheless <b>decreed</b> that a Levite who is a singer should not even <b>assist</b> the gatekeepers, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>the Sages did not decree</b> that a Levite who is a singer should not assist the gatekeepers in closing the gates.
§ <b>Rabbi Avin raises a dilemma:</b> Does <b>a communal voluntary burnt offering require</b> an accompanying <b>song or</b> does it <b>not require song?</b> He explains the two sides of the dilemma: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “You shall blow with the trumpets <b>over your burnt offerings”</b> (Numbers 10:10). Does the term “burnt offerings” include <b>both an obligatory burnt offering and a voluntary burnt offering, or perhaps the Merciful One is saying</b> that the trumpets and song must accompany <b>the burnt offerings of the entire Jewish people,</b> i.e., they must be burnt offerings that are an obligation of the people?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a verse: <b>“And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar, and when the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel</b>…And Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto the Lord” (II Chronicles 29:27–30). The Gemara analyzes the description of this service: <b>This song, what was its purpose? If we say that</b> it accompanied <b>an obligatory burnt offering</b> that was brought on that day, <b>why</b> did they have <b>to seek authorization</b> from Hezekiah? Why did Hezekiah need to issue a specific command that they should accompany this offering with song? <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case <b>that</b> this song served to accompany <b>the voluntary burnt offering</b> that Hezekiah brought on that day?
<b>Rav Yosef said: No,</b> that day was a New Moon, and <b>it was the</b> additional <b>burnt offering of the New Moon,</b> an obligatory burnt offering, that was accompanied by the song. As for the need for Hezekiah’s approval, the explanation is as follows: It was the thirtieth day following the previous New Moon, <b>and they were asking</b> him <b>if the</b> current <b>New Moon was established in its time,</b> i.e., on that day, so <b>that</b> the burnt offering of the New Moon should <b>be sacrificed, or</b> if the New Moon had <b>not</b> been declared on that day. Hezekiah clarified that the court had declared the New Moon, and therefore they should sacrifice the offering.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>And how can you say</b> that that day was the New Moon? <b>Isn’t it written: “On the sixteenth day of the first month”</b> (II Chronicles 29:17), and later, in that context, it states: <b>“And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar”?</b>
<b>Rather, Rami, son of Rav Yeiva, said:</b> The question <b>they were asking</b> Hezekiah referred to the obligatory, communal burnt offering <b>lamb that comes with the <i>omer</i>,</b> i.e., the barley offering brought on the sixteenth of the first month, Nisan. They asked: <b>Was the New Moon</b> of Nisan <b>established in its</b> correct <b>time,</b> which means <b>that</b> it is now in fact the sixteenth of Nisan and the <i>omer</i> offering and the lamb brought with it should <b>be sacrificed, or</b> was it <b>not</b> really the sixteenth of Nisan?
<b>Rav Avya objects to this</b> explanation: How is it possible that they were unsure whether it was the sixteenth of Nisan? <b>Let them see how the Paschal offering was performed</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan and <b>how <i>matza</i> was eaten</b> the following night. The day of the sixteenth of Nisan could easily be determined from when those mitzvot were performed.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> They asked permission from Hezekiah before sacrificing the lamb that comes with the <i>omer</i> offering, <b>just as it is with</b> regard to <b>a prayer leader, who,</b> as a gesture of respect, <b>asks permission</b> from the congregation before leading them in prayer. Likewise, the people asked permission from Hezekiah as a formal gesture of respect, not because they required his advice. The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation, <b>you</b> may <b>even say</b> that it was a common <b>obligatory burnt offering,</b> e.g., the daily offering, and they asked permission of Hezekiah before sacrificing it, <b>just as it is with</b> regard to <b>a prayer leader, who asks permission</b> from the congregation before leading it in prayer.
The Gemara has still not proven whether or not a communal voluntary burnt offering must be accompanied with song. The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: A fortunate</b> matter <b>is brought about on an auspicious day, and a deleterious</b> matter <b>on an inauspicious day.</b>
As the Sages <b>said: When the Temple was destroyed for the first</b> time, <b>that day was the Ninth of Av,</b> a date on which several calamities had already occurred; <b>and it was the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> i.e., it was on the day after Shabbat, a Sunday; <b>and it was the year after a Sabbatical</b> Year; <b>and it was the week of the priestly watch of Jehoiarib; and the priests and Levites were standing on their platform and singing song. And what song were they singing?</b> They were singing the verse: <b>“And He brought upon them their own iniquity, and He will cut them off in their own evil”</b> (Psalms 94:23). <b>And they did not manage to recite</b> the end of that verse: <b>“The Lord our God will cut them off,” before gentiles came and conquered them. And likewise,</b> the same happened <b>when the Second</b> Temple was destroyed.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This song, what was its purpose? If we say that</b> it accompanied <b>an obligatory burnt offering, was there</b> any obligatory communal burnt offering sacrificed at that time? <b>The daily offering had</b> already <b>ceased</b> to be sacrificed, due to a lack of animals, <b>on the seventeenth of Tammuz,</b> three weeks before the Ninth of Av. <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say <b>that</b> this song accompanied <b>a voluntary burnt offering?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And can you understand</b> this to be the case? <b>What is different about an obligatory burnt offering, which was not</b> sacrificed at this time because they did not have animals to bring, <b>and what is different about a voluntary burnt offering, that it was</b> sacrificed? Just as there were no animals available for obligatory offerings, there were none available for voluntary burnt offerings either. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult. A young bull,</b> which cannot be sacrificed as the daily offering, for which lambs are required, <b>happened to come into their</b> possession <b>merely by coincidence,</b> and they sacrificed it as a voluntary burnt offering. This indicates that the Levites are required to sing as an accompaniment to the sacrifice of a communal voluntary burnt offering.
<b>Rava said, and some say Rav Ashi</b> said: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> the description of the destruction cited in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>The song of the day</b> for Sunday, which is when the <i>baraita</i> says that the Temple was destroyed, is the psalm that begins: <b>“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof”</b> (Psalms 24:1). And yet the verse that the <i>baraita</i> says that the Levites were singing, <b>“And He brought upon them their own iniquity,” is in the song for Wednesday,</b> not the song for Sunday. <b>Rather, it was merely</b> a portentous <b>lamentation</b> [<b><i>eiliyya</i></b>] <b>that came into their mouths,</b> not an actual song recited over an offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the Levites were <b>standing on their platform</b> near the altar, which is where they stood when they sang to accompany offerings? The Gemara answers: This can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, who says:</b> The Levites are permitted to <b>recite</b> songs on the platform even when it is <b>not for an offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the Levites may recite songs on the platform at will, <b>let</b> them <b>also recite</b> a song <b>for a voluntary burnt offering,</b> even if it is not required. The Gemara answers: That could <b>result in a mishap,</b> as the Levites might assume that just as singing for a voluntary burnt offering is optional, so too singing for an obligatory burnt offering is also optional.
The question of whether a song must be recited for a communal voluntary burnt offering has still not been resolved. The Gemara asks: <b>What came of it,</b> i.e., what is the resolution to that question? The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, teaches</b> that the verse: “You shall blow with the trumpets <b>over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings”</b> (Numbers 10:10), juxtaposes burnt offerings to peace offerings, which indicates that there is a relevant comparison between them with regard to the sounding of trumpets, and, by extension, to song.
There are two conclusions that are to be drawn from this comparison: <b>Just as</b> the <b>burnt offering is an offering of the most sacred order, so too,</b> the <b>peace offering</b> that must be accompanied by song is one that is <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> and the only peace offering of this kind is the lambs that are brought together with the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>And just as</b> this <b>peace offering has a set time</b> when it must be brought, <b>so too,</b> the <b>burnt offering</b> that must be accompanied by song is one that <b>has a set time,</b> which excludes voluntary burnt offerings. Consequently, voluntary burnt offerings are not accompanied by song.

Daf 12a

§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>libations that are brought by themselves,</b> without an animal offering, <b>do they require song</b> on the part of the Levites as the libations are poured on the altar, <b>or do they not require song?</b> The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Should it be assumed that <b>since Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>one recites a song</b> of praise in the Temple <b>only over wine,</b> it can be inferred that <b>we recite</b> songs whenever wine is poured on the altar? <b>Or perhaps we recite</b> songs only <b>upon the eating and drinking</b> of the altar, i.e., when both an animal offering is burnt and a libation is also poured upon the altar, but <b>upon the drinking</b> of the altar <b>alone, we do not recite</b> songs.
The Gemara seeks to resolve the dilemma through a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>a fortunate</b> matter <b>is brought about on an auspicious day,</b> and a deleterious matter on an inauspicious day, e.g., the Ninth of Av, on which several tragedies have already occurred. As the Sages said: When the Temple was destroyed for the first time, that day was the Ninth of Av; and it was the conclusion of Shabbat; and it was the year after a Sabbatical Year; and it was the week of the priestly watch of Jehoiarib; and the priests and Levites were standing on their platform and singing the verse: “And He brought upon them their own iniquity, and He will cut them off in their own evil” (Psalms 94:23).
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This song, what was its purpose? If we say that</b> it accompanied <b>an obligatory burnt offering, was there</b> any obligatory communal burnt offering sacrificed at that time? <b>The daily offering had ceased</b> to be brought <b>on the seventeenth of Tammuz,</b> three weeks before the Ninth of Av. <b>Rather,</b> it would seem that this song accompanied <b>a voluntary burnt offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, teach that</b> a voluntary burnt offering <b>does not require</b> song? <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case <b>that</b> the song accompanied <b>libations</b> brought without an animal offering? This would prove that the Levites sing when a wine libation is brought, even without an animal offering.
<b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Ashi</b> who said: <b>And can you understand</b> that this song was recited over any offering? <b>The song of the day</b> for Sunday, which is when the <i>baraita</i> says that the Temple was destroyed, is the psalm beginning with the verse: “A psalm of David. <b>The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof”</b> (Psalms 24:1). And yet the verse that the <i>baraita</i> says that the Levites were singing: <b>“And He brought upon them their own iniquity,” is in the song for Wednesday,</b> not the song for Sunday. <b>Rather, it was merely</b> a portentous <b>lamentation that came into their mouths,</b> not a song recited over an offering. Consequently, no proof can be offered from this <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the Levites were <b>standing on their platform</b> near the altar, which is the place where they sing to accompany offerings? The Gemara answers: This can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says:</b> The Levites are permitted to <b>recite a song</b> on the platform even when it is <b>not for an offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let</b> them <b>also recite</b> a song <b>for libations</b> that are brought without an animal offering, even if that is not required. The Gemara answers: This could <b>result in a mishap,</b> as the Levites might assume that just as singing for libations which are brought without an animal offering is optional, so too, singing for libations that accompany an animal offering is also optional.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: A fortunate</b> matter <b>is brought about on an auspicious day,</b> and a deleterious matter on an inauspicious day. As the Sages said: When the Temple was destroyed for the first time, that day was the Ninth of Av; and it was the conclusion of Shabbat; and it was the year after a Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara asks: <b>Can you find</b> such a possibility, that when the Temple was destroyed <b>for the first time</b> it was <b>in the year after a Sabbatical</b> Year? <b>But isn’t it written</b> in a verse that Ezekiel experienced a prophecy <b>“in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten”</b> (Ezekiel 40:1)? <b>Which</b> is the <b>year when the beginning of the year is on the tenth of the month? You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the Jubilee,</b> which begins on Yom Kippur, the tenth of Tishrei.
<b>But if it enters your mind</b> to say that the Temple was <b>destroyed in the first</b> year <b>of the Sabbatical cycle,</b> it is impossible that the Jubilee, which follows a Sabbatical Year, occurred on the fourteenth year after the destruction of the Temple: Counting <b>from the first</b> year <b>of the Sabbatical cycle to</b> the next <b>first</b> year <b>of the Sabbatical cycle,</b> one arrives at year <b>eight.</b> If one continues to count <b>to the first</b> year <b>of</b> yet <b>another Sabbatical cycle, it is the fifteenth</b> year after the year of the destruction of the Temple, not the fourteenth year.
The Gemara answers: <b>Ravina said:</b> The meaning of the verse is that it was <b>in the fourteenth year after the year that the city was smitten.</b> The year of the destruction is not counted as year one of the fourteen years; rather, year one was the following year. The destruction took place in the thirty-sixth year of the Jubilee cycle, and therefore the Jubilee occurred fourteen years later.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> when the verse states that Ezekiel’s prophecy fourteen years after the destruction of the Temple was <b>in the twenty-fifth year</b> of captivity, that is not precise; <b>it was</b> actually the <b>twenty-sixth</b> year of captivity. <b>As the Master says</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Jews <b>were exiled</b> first <b>in</b> Nebuchadnezzar’s <b>seventh</b> year, and <b>they were</b> also <b>exiled</b> first <b>in</b> Nebuchadnezzar’s <b>eighth</b> year. This first exile took place during Nebuchadnezzar’s eighth year counting from the beginning of his reign; it was Nebuchadnezzar’s seventh year counting from the year he subjugated Jehoiakim, king of Judah.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>They were</b> then <b>exiled</b> a second time <b>in</b> Nebuchadnezzar’s <b>eighteenth</b> year, and <b>they were exiled in</b> Nebuchadnezzar’s <b>nineteenth</b> year, when the Temple was destroyed. This statement will be explained later.
The Gemara explains the objection: Now, <b>from the seventh</b> year, when the first exile occurred, <b>until the eighteenth</b> year, when the second exile occurred, in conjunction with the Temple’s destruction, is <b>eleven</b> years, not counting the year of the destruction, <b>and</b> an additional <b>fifteen</b> years, until the date mentioned in the verse in Ezekiel, <b>equals twenty-six</b> years from the first exile, not twenty-five.
The Gemara explains that <b>Ravina</b> could have <b>said to you: And according to you,</b> who maintains that the fourteen years mentioned in the verse include the year of the destruction of the Temple, <b>does it work out well? Now, they were also exiled in the nineteenth</b> year, and it was then that the Temple was destroyed. <b>From the seventh</b> year <b>until the nineteenth</b> year is <b>twelve</b> years, <b>and</b> an additional <b>fourteen</b> years until the date mentioned in the verse in Ezekiel <b>equals twenty-six</b> years from the first exile, not twenty-five. <b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> That the twenty-five years are counted <b>separate from the year when they were exiled</b> for the first time. <b>According to my</b> opinion <b>also,</b> I can say that the twenty-five years are <b>separate from the year when they were exiled</b> for the first time.
The Gemara objects: <b>In any case,</b> the assertion of the <i>baraita</i> that the destruction of the Temple occurred in the <b>nineteenth</b> year is <b>difficult for Ravina,</b> because there are eleven years from the first exile until the year of the destruction, not counting the year of the exile or the year of the destruction, and then an additional fifteen years, including the year of the destruction, until the date mentioned in the verse in Ezekiel, which is a total of twenty-six years, not twenty-five.
The Gemara explains: <b>Do you hold</b> that <b>there were three</b> separate <b>exiles,</b> one in the seventh or eighth year, a second one in the eighteenth year, and a third one in the nineteenth year? In truth there were only two exiles: <b>They were exiled in the seventh</b> year <b>from</b> Nebuchadnezzar’s <b>subjugation of Jehoiakim, which was the eighth</b> year <b>of Nebuchadnezzar’s</b> reign. <b>They were</b> then <b>exiled</b> a second time, when the Temple was destroyed, <b>in the eighteenth</b> year <b>from the subjugation of Jehoiakim, which was</b> actually in <b>the nineteenth</b> year <b>of Nebuchadnezzar’s</b> reign. Consequently, there were eleven years from the first exile to the destruction of the Temple, not counting the year of the exile, and another fourteen years until the verse in Ezekiel, which equals a total of twenty-five years.
The Gemara corroborates its interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>As the Master says: In the first year</b> of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar <b>conquered Nineveh;</b>

Daf 12b

<b>in</b> his <b>second</b> year <b>he ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and conquered Jehoiakim.</b>
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches: When the Temple was destroyed for the first time, that day was the Ninth of Av; and it was the conclusion of Shabbat; and it was the year after a Sabbatical Year; <b>and likewise,</b> the same happened <b>when the Second</b> Temple was destroyed.
The Gemara asks: <b>Can you find</b> such a possibility, that the <b>Second</b> Temple was destroyed <b>in the year after a Sabbatical Year? Now,</b> for <b>how many</b> years did <b>the Second Temple stand?</b> It stood for <b>420</b> years. <b>Four hundred</b> years include exactly <b>eight Jubilees,</b> as the Jubilee cycle is fifty years. An additional <b>fourteen</b> years consist of <b>two Sabbatical cycles.</b> There are <b>six</b> years <b>remaining</b> during which the Temple stood, which means that the last year <b>was the sixth</b> year <b>of the Sabbatical cycle,</b> and therefore when the Temple was destroyed the following year it was a Sabbatical Year, not the year after the Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i> stated? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>the fiftieth year is counted for here and for there,</b> i.e., it is both the Jubilee Year and the first year of the next Sabbatical cycle and Jubilee cycle, and therefore each Jubilee cycle is only forty-nine years rather than fifty years. Consequently, when calculating the number of years of the Sabbatical and Jubilee cycles until the destruction of the Second Temple, <b>bring</b> an additional <b>eight</b> years <b>from the eight</b> complete Jubilee cycles during which the Temple stood. The eight years <b>and those six</b> years that remained according to the previous calculation <b>equal fourteen</b> years, which are two complete Sabbatical cycles. Therefore, <b>it is found that</b> the Second Temple <b>was destroyed in the year following the Sabbatical</b> Year.
The Gemara objects: But <b>if</b> one explains the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is problematic, as <b>you do not find</b> that <b>the first</b> time the Temple was destroyed was in the year after the Sabbatical Year. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish people counted seventeen Jubilees from when they entered Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>until they left,</b> when the First Temple was destroyed. <b>And you cannot say</b> that <b>they counted from the time they entered, because if you say this, the result is</b> that <b>the Temple was destroyed at the beginning of the Jubilee</b> cycle, <b>and you do not find</b> that the Jubilee Year was <b>“in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten”</b> (Ezekiel 40:1).
<b>Rather, remove from them</b> the <b>seven</b> years <b>when they conquered</b> the land <b>and</b> the <b>seven</b> years <b>when they divided</b> the land, as they did not start counting the first Jubilee cycle until after those events. <b>And you</b> then <b>find</b> that the Jubilee Year was <b>“in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten.”</b>
The Gemara explains the difficulty from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if</b> one holds in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that each Jubilee cycle is forty-nine years rather than fifty years, you must <b>bring</b> an additional <b>seventeen</b> years, one <b>from</b> each of <b>the seventeen Jubilee</b> cycles and <b>add</b> them <b>to these</b> seventeen cycles, and it turns out that the destruction of the Temple <b>was in the third</b> year <b>of the Sabbatical</b> cycle.
The Gemara answers: Throughout <b>those years from</b> when <b>Sennacherib exiled</b> the ten tribes <b>until Jeremiah came and returned them</b> to their land, <b>they did not count</b> the Jubilee cycle, as the Jubilee applies only when all twelve tribes are in their ancestral lands. When the exiles returned, a new Jubilee cycle was started, and the Temple was destroyed thirty-six years later, in the year after a Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara suggests a second answer to its question about the statement of the <i>baraita</i> which equates the destructions of the First Temple and the Second Temple. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and when it teaches: And likewise,</b> the same happened <b>when the Second</b> Temple was destroyed, it is not asserting that the Temple was destroyed in a year after a Sabbatical Year, because in fact the Second Temple was destroyed during a Sabbatical Year. Rather, it is referring <b>to the other</b> details the <i>baraita</i> provides with regard to the timing of the destruction, i.e., that it occurred on the Ninth of Av and on a Sunday.
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to conclude that not all of the details pertaining to the destruction of the First Temple also apply to the destruction of the Second Temple. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> then with regard to the statement that the destruction occurred during the week of the priestly watch of Jehoiarib, <b>was the priestly watch of Jehoiarib present during</b> the time of <b>the Second</b> Temple?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the watch of Jehoiarib did not exist during the Second Temple era? As it is taught: Only <b>four priestly watches ascended from the</b> Babylonian <b>exile,</b> while the other twenty stayed in Babylonia. And these are the watches who returned: The descendants of <b>Jedaiah, Harim, Pashḥur, and Immer. The prophets among</b> those who returned <b>arose and divided</b> these four families <b>into twenty-four watches.</b> They achieved this as follows: They wrote the names of these new twenty-four watches on pieces of paper, <b>mixed them up, and put them in a receptacle [<i>kalpi</i>]</b> from which lots were drawn. A representative from the family of <b>Jedaiah came and drew his portion and the lot of</b> five <b>other</b> watches, for a total of <b>six.</b>

Daf 13a

<b>Harim came and</b> also <b>drew his portion and the lot of</b> five <b>other</b> watches, for a total of <b>six. And likewise Pashḥur, and likewise Immer. The prophets among them stipulated that even</b> if the descendants of <b>Jehoiarib,</b> who originally <b>headed the priestly watches, would ascend</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>Jedaiah would not be demoted from its place</b> as the first of the watches. <b>Rather,</b> the watch of <b>Jedaiah</b> would retain <b>precedence, and Jehoiarib</b> would be <b>subordinate to it.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> when the <i>baraita</i> equates the details pertaining to the destruction of the two Temples, it is referring <b>to other</b> details, i.e., that both were destroyed on the Ninth of Av and on a Sunday, but it is not equating them with regard to all the details.
The Gemara cites a third answer to its question about how the <i>baraita</i> can claim that the Second Temple was destroyed in a year following a Sabbatical Year, when a calculation of the number of years that it stood indicates that it was destroyed in a Sabbatical Year. <b>Rav Ashi said: Those six years</b> from the time the Second Temple was built <b>until Ezra ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and sanctified</b> the land <b>are not counted,</b> as the Sabbatical cycle was not in effect during that period. Consequently, the Second Temple was destroyed in a year following a Sabbatical Year.
It is known that Ezra ascended to Eretz Yisrael six years after the beginning of the construction of the Second Temple, <b>as it is written: “Then ceased the work of the House of God, which is at Jerusalem;</b> and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia” (Ezra 4:24). This proves that construction on the Temple started in the second year of the reign of Darius. <b>And it is written: “And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king”</b> (Ezra 6:15), which was the fifth year from when they started building.
<b>And</b> the Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At that same time in the following year Ezra ascended</b> from Babylonia <b>together with his</b> company of <b>exiles, as it is written, “And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king”</b> (Ezra 7:8). Accordingly, Ezra came to Eretz Yisrael six years after the beginning of the construction of the Temple. It was at that time that the counting of the Sabbatical and Jubilee cycles began. The counting continued for 414 years until the destruction of the Temple, which means that the Temple was destroyed in a Sabbatical Year.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> that is taught in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier (12b): <b>The Jewish people counted seventeen Jubilees from when they entered Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>until they left</b> when the Temple was destroyed. <b>And you cannot say</b> that <b>they counted from when they entered, because if you say they counted from when they entered, the result is</b> that <b>the Temple was destroyed at the beginning of the Jubilee</b> cycle, <b>and you do not find</b> that the Jubilee Year was <b>“in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten”</b> (Ezekiel 40:1). Rather, remove from them the seven years when they conquered Eretz Yisrael and the seven years when they divided Eretz Yisrael, as the first Jubilee cycle began after the Jewish people conquered and divided Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that there were <b>seven</b> years during <b>which</b> the Jewish people <b>conquered</b> Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: <b>As Caleb said</b> to Joshua, when it came time to divide Eretz Yisrael at the conclusion of part of the conquest: <b>“Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-Barnea to spy out the land…and now,</b> behold, <b>I am this day eighty-five</b> years <b>old”</b> (Joshua 14:7, 10).
<b>And the Master says</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the first year</b> after the exodus, <b>Moses constructed the Tabernacle;</b> during the <b>second</b> year, <b>the Tabernacle was erected and</b> Moses <b>sent the spies.</b> Consequently, <b>how old was Caleb when</b> the Jewish people <b>crossed the Jordan? He was eighty less two,</b> i.e., seventy-eight years <b>old. When</b> Joshua <b>was dividing</b> Eretz Yisrael into <b>inheritances,</b> Caleb <b>said</b> to him: <b>I am eighty-five years old. It is</b> therefore <b>found that they conquered</b> the land for <b>seven</b> years.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that there were <b>seven</b> years during which the Jewish people <b>divided</b> up Eretz Yisrael into ancestral portions? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that they conquered</b> the land for <b>seven</b> years, it is reasonable to assume that <b>they divided</b> the land for <b>seven</b> years. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: It can be derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that you do not find</b> that <b>“the fourteenth year after the city was smitten”</b> (Ezekiel 40:1) was a Jubilee Year (see 12a) unless the Jewish people divided Eretz Yisrael for seven years.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One maintains <b>no fewer than six lambs that</b> have been <b>inspected</b> for blemishes <b>in the Chamber of the Lambs,</b> which are <b>sufficient for</b> the offerings of <b>Shabbat and for the</b> two <b>Festival days of Rosh HaShana</b> that may occur adjacent to it. <b>And one may add</b> inspected lambs <b>up to an infinite</b> number. One plays <b>no fewer than two trumpets</b> and no fewer <b>than nine harps</b> in the Temple, <b>and one may add up to an infinite</b> number. <b>And the cymbal</b> was played <b>alone,</b> and none may be added to it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara assumes that the mishna means that there must be at least six inspected lambs in the Chamber of the Lambs, so that if Rosh HaShana occurs on the two days adjacent to Shabbat, there will be enough lambs available for all the communal offerings that are sacrificed on those days. The Gemara therefore objects: But <b>there are more</b> than six lambs which are required for the <b>daily offerings and additional offerings</b> of a Shabbat and Rosh HaShana that are adjacent to one another, as one day of Rosh HaShana alone requires sixteen lambs.
The Gemara explains: The <b><i>tanna</i> is referring to</b> the <b>general</b> policy for the entire year, <b>and he is referring only to</b> the number of lambs necessary for <b>the daily offerings</b> sacrificed over the course of three ordinary days. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Sufficient for Shabbat and for the</b> two <b>Festival days of Rosh HaShana?</b> It is <b>merely a mnemonic</b> device, <b>and this</b> is what <b>he is saying:</b> One maintains <b>no fewer than six lambs</b>

Daf 13b

<b>that</b> have been <b>inspected in the Chamber of the Lambs</b> for <b>four days prior</b> to the time of their <b>slaughter.</b> The reserve of six lambs ensured that each lamb would be available for inspection for three days prior to the day of its sacrifice, for a total of four. <b>And whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Bag Bag says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the daily offering requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter?</b>
<b>The verse states</b> with regard to the daily offering: “My food that is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, of a pleasing aroma unto Me, <b>shall you safeguard to offer unto Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2); <b>and it states there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb…<b>and it shall be for you as a safeguard until the fourteenth day of</b> this <b>month”</b> (Exodus 12:3–6), i.e., <b>the first</b> month. Since the word “safeguard” appears in both verses, it is derived that <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>there,</b> the Paschal offering <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter, so too here,</b> the daily offering <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter.</b>
The Gemara notes: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise,</b> according to the explanation that the mishna is referring to Shabbat and Rosh HaShana merely as a mnemonic device, <b>as it teaches</b> that the six lambs are <b>sufficient for Shabbat</b> and the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana, <b>and it does not teach</b> that the six lambs are <b>for</b> use on <b>Shabbat</b> and the two days of Rosh HaShana. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> the language of the mishna that this explanation is correct.
§ The mishna teaches that one plays no fewer <b>than two trumpets, and one may add</b> to that number. The Gemara asks: <b>Until how many</b> trumpets may these additions be made? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Huna says, and some say Rav Zavdi says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> They may play <b>up to 120</b> trumpets, <b>as it is stated: “And with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets”</b> (II Chronicles 5:12).
The mishna teaches that one plays no fewer <b>than nine harps</b> and one may add up to an infinite number, <b>and the cymbal</b> was played <b>alone</b> and none may be added to it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Asi says that</b> it is as <b>the verse states: “And Asaph with the cymbals, sounding aloud”</b> (I Chronicles 16:5), which indicates that only one Levite played the cymbals. The Gemara asks: The word <b>cymbals</b> is in the plural, indicating that <b>there were two;</b> why, then, does the mishna say that there is only one cymbal? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> two cymbals <b>perform one act and one person plays them</b> by banging them together, the mishna <b>calls them one</b> instrument.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the Temple, there are <b>no fewer than twelve Levites standing on the platform</b> adjacent to the altar and singing, <b>and one may add</b> Levites on the platform <b>up to an infinite</b> number. <b>A minor</b> Levite may <b>enter the Temple courtyard for service only at a time when the Levites are engaging in song,</b> so that he may accompany them. <b>And</b> minors <b>would not engage in</b> playing <b>a lyre and in</b> playing <b>a harp; rather,</b> they would engage <b>in</b> singing with <b>the mouth, in order to provide flavor to the music</b> with their pure, high voices.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Minors <b>are not tallied in the</b> minimum <b>total</b> of twelve Levites, <b>and they do not ascend to the platform; rather, they would stand on the ground and their heads</b> would reach to <b>between the legs of the Levites, and they were called cadets [<i>tzoarei</i>] of the Levites.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that a minimum of twelve Levites would stand on the platform and sing. The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> does <b>this</b> number <b>correspond? Rav Pappa says:</b> It <b>corresponds to</b> the minimum number of instruments that were played: <b>Nine harps and two lyres and one cymbal.</b> This number is also alluded to in the Bible, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Instructed in singing unto the Lord…<b>he and his brethren and sons were twelve”</b> (I Chronicles 25:7–9).
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A minor</b> Levite may <b>enter the Temple courtyard for service only at a time when the Levites</b> are engaging in song. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: As the verse states: “Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to make music for the workmen in the House of God”</b> (Ezra 3:9). This verse shows that in making music it is preferable to have one’s sons, i.e., minors, as accompaniment.
The mishna teaches: The minors <b>would not engage in</b> playing <b>a lyre and in</b> playing <b>a harp; rather, in</b> singing with <b>the mouth</b> in order to provide flavor to the music with their pure, high voices. The Gemara notes: <b>That is to say that a lyre and a harp are</b> two <b>distinct</b> instruments. <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The harp</b> used <b>in the Temple was</b> an instrument <b>of seven strings, as it is stated: “In your presence is fullness [<i>sova</i>] of joy,</b> in your right hand sweetness for evermore” (Psalms 16:11). <b>Do not read</b> the word as “<b>fullness [<i>sova</i>]” but</b> as <b>seven [<i>sheva</i>].</b> This indicates that the “sweet harp” (see Psalms 81:3) played in the presence of God, i.e., in the Temple, has seven strings.
Rabbi Yehuda continues: <b>And</b> the harp that will be played <b>in the days of the Messiah</b> will have <b>eight</b> strings, <b>as it is stated: “For the Leader, on the eighth:</b> A Psalm of David” (Psalms 12:1). This indicates that the psalms that will be recited in the time of the Messiah, son of David, will be played <b>on the eighth string</b> that will be added to the harp.
And the harp that will be played <b>in the World-to-Come</b> will have <b>ten</b> strings, <b>as it is stated:</b> “A Psalm, a song. For the Shabbat…<b>With an instrument of ten strings and with the lyre, with a solemn sound upon the harp”</b> (Psalms 92:1–4). This indicates that in the World-to-Come, which is comparable to Shabbat, songs of praise to God will be played on a ten-stringed instrument, identified here as both a lyre and a harp.
<b>And</b> similarly, another verse <b>states: “Give thanks unto the Lord with the harp; sing praises unto Him with the lyre of ten strings. Sing unto Him a new song”</b> (Psalms 33:2–3), which is referring to the new song that will be sung only in the World-to-Come. This proof in support of Rabbi Yehuda’s claim that the harp used in the World-to-Come will have ten strings is from a verse that is referring to a ten-stringed lyre, which shows that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the lyre and harp are the same instrument. Therefore, his opinion apparently contradicts the mishna.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as even he agrees that the harp and lyre are essentially two different instruments. But <b>in the World-to-Come, since the strings</b> of the harp <b>will be increased, its sound will be increased like</b> that of <b>the lyre,</b> and therefore <b>he calls</b> the harp <b>a lyre.</b>
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> The minors <b>are not tallied in the</b> minimum <b>total</b> of twelve Levites…and they were called cadets [<i>tzoarei</i>] of the Levites. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they were called the helpers [<i>soadei</i>] of the Levites.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, why is he referring to them as <i>tzoarei</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Since these</b> minors had <b>high voices and those</b> adults had <b>deep voices,</b> and <b>these</b> minors would <b>sing in a high voice [<i>mekateti</i>], and those</b> adults could <b>not sing in</b> such <b>a high voice, they were called <i>tzoarei</i>,</b> as they caused the adult Levites anguish [<i>tza’ar</i>] due to the fact that they could not produce the same pleasant sounds as the minors.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to valuations that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; and</b> there are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to an ancestral field that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; and</b> there are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a forewarned ox that killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent;</b> and there are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a rapist, and a seducer, and a defamer that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent.</b>
<b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to valuations that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; how so? Both</b> in the case of one <b>who took</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> to donate the fixed value <b>of the</b> most <b>attractive among the Jewish people and</b> in the case of one who took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value of <b>the</b> most <b>unsightly among the Jewish people, he gives</b> the fixed payment of <b>fifty <i>sela</i>,</b> shekels, to the Temple treasury (see Leviticus 27:3). <b>And if</b> one <b>said: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>assessment</b> of another to the Temple treasury, <b>he gives the price</b> for that person if sold as a slave, a sum that can be more or less than fifty shekels.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to valuations that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; how so? Both</b> in the case of one <b>who took</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> to donate the fixed value of the most attractive among the Jewish people <b>and</b> in the case of one who took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value of the most unsightly among the Jewish people, he gives the fixed payment of fifty <i>sela</i> to the Temple treasury. The Gemara infers from this that if the vow of valuation referred <b>to a Jew, yes,</b> he pays the fixed value; but if one took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value <b>of gentiles,</b> he does <b>not</b> pay the fixed value.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (5b): With regard to <b>a gentile, Rabbi Meir says: He is valuated</b> in a case where a Jew says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the fixed value of this gentile; <b>but</b> a gentile <b>does not take</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> to donate his fixed value or the value of others.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as it can be claimed that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e. <b>that even</b> if one took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value of <b>a gentile,</b> he <b>also</b> pays the fixed amount. <b>But</b>

Daf 14a

by not mentioning gentiles, the mishna <b>teaches us another matter in passing, in accordance with</b> the statement <b>that Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says. As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: It is prohibited for a person to say: How beautiful is this gentile.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this is the only reason that a gentile is not mentioned, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> In the case of one who took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value <b>of the</b> most <b>attractive among the Jewish people and the</b> most <b>unsightly among the gentiles,</b> he gives the fixed payment of fifty <i>sela</i> to the Temple treasury. The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> prefers to <b>deal with one nation,</b> i.e., Jews, and does <b>not</b> wish to <b>deal with two nations,</b> Jews and gentiles.
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>And</b> does the mishna <b>not</b> deal with two nations? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (14b): One who raped or seduced a young woman, whether she is <b>the</b> most <b>prominent in the priesthood or the lowliest among the Israelites,</b> gives the payment of fifty <i>sela</i>, the fine stated in the Torah. Priests and Israelites are two distinct groups of people, analogous to Jews and gentiles. The Gemara answers: In that mishna <b>there it is one nation,</b> as although there are two groups they are both part of the Jewish people. It is <b>only</b> that <b>the priests have greater sanctity</b> than Israelites.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>since</b> the mishna <b>wants to teach</b> the case of an <b>ancestral field</b> in <b>the latter clause, which you find</b> in the case <b>of Jews,</b> but <b>you do not find</b> with regard <b>to gentiles, as they are unfit</b> to have <b>ancestral</b> land in Eretz Yisrael, it is <b>due to this</b> reason that the mishna <b>teaches</b> only cases <b>that</b> involve the <b>Jewish people.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to an ancestral field that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent. How so? Both</b> one <b>who consecrates</b> an ancestral field <b>in</b> the low-quality <b>sands of the</b> areas <b>surrounding</b> the city <b>and</b> one <b>who consecrates</b> the high-quality <b>orchards of Sebastia gives</b> a redemption payment of <b>fifty silver shekels for</b> every area that he consecrated that is fit for <b>sowing a <i>kor</i> of barley</b> (Leviticus 27:16). <b>And with regard to a purchased field</b> that one consecrates, <b>he gives its value</b> as redemption, a sum that can be more or less than fifty shekels for every area required for sowing one <i>kor</i> of barley.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>both a purchased field and an ancestral field,</b> one gives a redemption payment of fifty silver shekels for every area required for sowing a <i>kor</i> of barley that he consecrated. <b>What,</b> then, is the difference <b>between an ancestral field and a purchased field?</b> The difference is <b>that in</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field one gives</b> an additional payment of <b>one-fifth, but in</b> the case of <b>a purchased field one does not give</b> an additional payment of <b>one-fifth.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says:</b> In a case where one <b>consecrated a field full of trees, when he redeems</b> the trees and field, <b>he redeems</b> the <b>trees according to their value, and then redeems</b> the <b>land</b> according to the fixed formula, by which <b>an area</b> required <b>for the sowing of a <i>kor</i></b> of <b>barley</b> seed is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>evidently Rav Huna holds</b> that when <b>a person consecrates, he consecrates generously.</b> In this case he consecrated the trees and the land separately, so that he would have to redeem them each separately, rather than the trees being redeemed as part of the land.
<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to Rav Huna</b> from the mishna: <b>Both</b> one <b>who consecrates</b> an ancestral field <b>in</b> the low-quality <b>sands of the</b> areas <b>surrounding</b> the city <b>and</b> one <b>who consecrates</b> the high-quality <b>orchards of Sebastia gives</b> a redemption payment of <b>fifty silver shekels for</b> every area required for <b>sowing a <i>kor</i> of barley</b> that he consecrated. This indicates that when one consecrates orchards he does not redeem the land and the trees separately. Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: The mishna is <b>speaking of</b> land that <b>is suitable for orchards</b> but does not actually have trees planted on it.
Rav Naḥman <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: When discussing a consecrated ancestral field the Torah states: <b>“An area fit for sowing”</b> (Leviticus 27:16). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only an area fit for sowing; from where</b> do I derive that the same is true for <b>a field of vines and a field of reeds and a field of trees?</b>
<b>The verse states:</b> “And if a man shall consecrate to the Lord part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to an area fit for sowing; the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty silver shekels” (Leviticus 27:16). The word <b>“field”</b> teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case,</b> regardless of the type of field. It can be inferred from here that if one consecrates an orchard, the redemption of the trees is not valued separately from the land. Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that he first <b>redeems</b> the trees <b>and afterward redeems</b> the field, according to the formula of the Torah.
Rav Naḥman again <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one consecrated three trees</b> in a field <b>where ten</b> trees are <b>planted in an area required</b> for sowing <b>one <i>se’a</i></b> of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>], <b>he has consecrated</b> not only those trees, but also <b>the land and the</b> young <b>trees between them.</b> Therefore, if this is his ancestral field, <b>when he redeems</b> it, <b>he redeems</b> the land and everything contained within it according to the standard rate established by the Torah, where <b>an area</b> required <b>for the sowing of a <i>kor</i></b> of <b>barley seed</b> is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels.</b>
But if the ratio of land to trees was <b>less than that,</b> i.e., the trees were planted more densely, <b>or</b> if the ratio of land to trees was <b>more than that,</b> i.e., the trees were planted less densely, <b>or if he consecrated</b> each of the trees separately, <b>one after the other, this</b> person <b>has consecrated neither the land nor the</b> young <b>trees between them.</b> Therefore, when he redeems, he redeems the trees in accordance with their worth.
<b>And moreover, even if one consecrated its trees</b> when they are planted more densely, or less densely, or one after the other, <b>and then</b> afterward <b>he consecrated</b> the <b>land,</b> so that at this point everything belongs to the Temple treasury, <b>when he redeems</b> them, <b>he redeems the trees</b> separately <b>in accordance with their worth, and afterward he redeems</b> the <b>land</b> according to the standard rate, where <b>an area</b> required <b>for the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i>,</b> i.e., a <i>kor</i>, of <b>barley seed</b> is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels.</b>
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> in the first part of the <i>baraita</i>, it means that he <b>redeems</b> the field <b>and afterward redeems</b> the trees, <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> states that <b>he redeems and afterward redeems, by inference the first clause</b> is <b>not</b> referring to a case where he redeems the field and afterward redeems the trees.
<b>Rather,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that when one <b>consecrates,</b> he <b>consecrates sparingly. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who consecrates a field has consecrated all of it. Rabbi Shimon says: He only consecrated a grafted carob</b> tree <b>and a sycamore stump.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, say the latter clause: And moreover, even if one consecrates its trees and then</b> afterward <b>he consecrated</b> the <b>land, when he redeems</b> them <b>he redeems the trees</b> separately <b>in accordance with their worth, and afterward he redeems</b> the land according to the standard rate, where <b>an area</b> required <b>for the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i></b> of <b>barley</b> seed is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels.</b>
<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, let one follow</b> the status of the field at the time of its <b>redemption, and let</b> the trees <b>be redeemed along with their land,</b> as at the time of its redemption both the trees and the land are consecrated. <b>As we have heard that Rabbi Shimon follows</b> the time of the <b>redemption,</b> i.e., he determines the price at which a field is redeemed based on the time it is being redeemed.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who purchases a field from his father and consecrated it, and afterward his father dies,</b> which means that the field would now be his as an inheritance, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that it should be</b> considered <b>before him as an ancestral field,</b> rather than a field that he purchased, with respect to its redemption? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a field that was purchased: <b>“And if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields”</b> (Leviticus 27:22).
The verse speaks specifically of <b>a field that is not fit</b> at the time of its consecration <b>to be an ancestral field,</b> i.e., one that he could never have inherited in the future. This specification <b>excludes this</b> field <b>that was fit to be an ancestral field</b> from this <i>halakha</i>, since eventually it would have become his through inheritance, even had he not purchased it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Meir</b> learns a different <i>halakha</i> from this verse and <b>says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in a case of <b>one who purchases a field from his father and his father dies, and</b> only <b>afterward he consecrated</b> the field, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that it should be</b> considered <b>before him like an ancestral field?</b>

Daf 14b

<b>The verse states</b> with regard to a purchased field: “And <b>if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22). The verse is referring specifically to <b>a field that is not an ancestral field</b> at the time of its consecration. This requirement <b>excludes this</b> field, <b>as</b> currently, after the death of the father, <b>it is an ancestral field.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. That is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>whereas</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda and according to Rabbi Shimon it is</b> considered <b>an ancestral field even if he consecrated</b> the field <b>and afterward his father dies. What is the reason</b> for this opinion? <b>If</b> you suggest it is <b>due to the verse,</b> that cannot be, as <b>the verse comes</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> that was stated <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> i.e., it is referring to a case where the father died before he consecrated the field, as Rabbi Meir explained.
<b>Rather, is it not due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> he <b>follows</b> the status of the field at the time of the <b>redemption?</b> Since the father died before the son redeemed the field it is considered an ancestral field in the possession of the Temple treasury. Similarly, if one first consecrates the trees and afterward the field, he should redeem them both together, since at the time of the redemption they are both consecrated. Since this ruling is not in accordance with the <i>baraita</i> that states that the trees and field are redeemed separately, evidently the <i>baraita</i> cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that this source does not contradict Rav Huna’s claim that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. The reason is that <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon</b> do not, in fact, maintain that one follows the status of the field at the time of the redemption. Rather, they <b>found a verse and expounded it.</b>
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning: <b>If so,</b> that when one consecrated the field and his father died afterward, it is not considered an ancestral field, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah: And <b>if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not his ancestral,</b> i.e., the verse could have omitted the repetition of the phrase “of his field.” <b>What</b> does the Torah mean by stressing <b>“of his field”?</b> This teaches that only <b>a field that is not fit to be an ancestral field</b> at the time he consecrated it is redeemed for its value. But if he consecrated a field that he would inherit in the future, it is redeemed in the manner of an ancestral field.
§ <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> If one <b>consecrated</b> fields that are <b>rocky [<i>terashin</i>]</b> and unsuitable for planting, <b>he redeems them by their value,</b> not as ancestral fields. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states</b> that one redeems <b>an area</b> fit <b>for sowing</b> of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed for fifty silver shekels (see Leviticus 27:16), <b>and these</b> fields <b>are not fit for sowing.</b>
But if <b>he did not redeem</b> these fields before the Jubilee Year, <b>they go</b> to the priests <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year, like ancestral fields. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “And if he will not redeem the <b>field,</b> or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the Lord, as a field devoted; it shall belong to the priest” (Leviticus 27:20–21). This indicates that <b>any kind</b> of ancestral field at all, regardless of quality, goes to the priests if it is not redeemed by the Jubilee Year.
Furthermore, Rav Pappa says: If one <b>sold</b> fields that are <b>rocky</b> and unsuitable for planting, <b>they may be redeemed</b> from the purchaser <b>in</b> even <b>less than two years,</b> despite the fact that normally land must be left in the hands of the purchaser for at least two years (see 29b), as derived from the plural term “years of the crops” cited below. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and according to <b>the number of years of the crops</b> he shall sell it to you” (Leviticus 25:15), <b>and these</b> rocky fields <b>are not fit for crops.</b> But if <b>he did not redeem them</b> from the purchaser, <b>they return to the owner in the Jubilee</b> Year, like ancestral fields. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “Then let him count the years of its sale, and restore the extra to the man to whom he sold it; <b>and it shall return to its ancestral</b> heritage” (Leviticus 25:27), <b>and this</b> rocky field <b>is also</b> part of his <b>ancestral</b> heritage.
Rav Pappa further says: If one <b>consecrated trees</b> in his ancestral field, <b>he redeems</b> them according <b>to their value. What is the reason? The Merciful One states</b> that one redeems <b>an area</b> fit <b>for sowing</b> of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed for fifty silver shekels. This is referring specifically to land fit for sowing grain, <b>and not trees.</b> Furthermore, if <b>he did not redeem</b> the trees, they <b>do not go to the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year, unlike an ancestral field. The reason is that <b>the Merciful One states: “But the field,</b> when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the Lord, as a field devoted; it shall belong to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). This too is referring specifically to a field, <b>and not trees.</b>
Rav Pappa also says: If one <b>sold trees</b> of his ancestral field, <b>they may not be redeemed</b> from the purchaser if <b>less than two years</b> passed. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy it from your neighbor, and according to the number of <b>years of the crops</b> he shall sell it to you” (Leviticus 25:15), <b>and these</b> trees <b>are fit for crops,</b> as they produce fruit. But if <b>he did not redeem them</b> from the purchaser, the trees <b>do not return to the owner in the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states:</b> “Then let him count the years of its sale, and restore the extra to the man to whom he sold it; <b>and it shall return to its ancestral</b> heritage” (Leviticus 25:27). This includes only land, which remains forever, <b>and not trees,</b> which have a limited lifespan.
The Gemara asks: <b>The Master,</b> i.e., Rav Pappa, <b>says</b> that if one <b>consecrated trees</b> in his ancestral field <b>he redeems</b> them according <b>to their value.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is that so? <b>But let them be consecrated on account of their land and let them be redeemed on account of their land,</b> according to the valuation of fifty silver shekels for each area required for sowing a <i>kor</i> of barley seed.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>he consecrated the trees</b> and <b>did not consecrate land, but didn’t</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say:</b> If <b>one sells</b> a date <b>palm to another,</b> the purchaser <b>acquires it from the bottom</b> of the palm <b>until the depths</b> of the earth, i.e., including its land. The Gemara answers: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> ruling that it is referring only to a case <b>where</b> the purchaser <b>comes due to</b> a specific <b>claim</b> that he purchased the land under the date palm. But if he does not claim to have explicitly purchased the land, the seller or the one who consecrates does not intend to include land with the date palm.
§ The mishna teaches: And with regard to <b>a purchased field</b> that one consecrates, <b>he gives its value</b> as redemption, a sum that can be more or less than fifty silver shekels for an area required for the sowing of a <i>kor</i> of barley seed. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the <b>worth</b> of your valuation until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>What does this</b> word “worth” <b>come to teach? Since it is stated</b> with regard to an ancestral field: “An area fit for the <b>sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed is redeemed for fifty silver shekels”</b> (Leviticus 27:16), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a purchased field is also</b> redeemed using <b>this</b> formula. Therefore, <b>the verse states “worth,”</b> which means the market value of the field.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to purchased fields: “Then the priest <b>shall reckon</b> for him the worth of your valuation until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>And it is stated there,</b> with regard to an ancestral field: “But if he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, then the priest <b>shall reckon</b> for him the money according to the years that remain until the Jubilee Year, and it shall be deducted from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of an ancestral field, it is referring to <b>a fixed amount, so too here,</b> with regard to a purchased field, it means <b>a fixed amount.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the students: Do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer, <b>accept</b> that one derives <b>the verbal analogy</b> of “shall reckon,” <b>but they use it to</b> derive that one who redeems a consecrated purchased field must also add <b>one-fifth? Or perhaps they do not accept the verbal analogy</b> at all, <b>and they do not</b> hold that one who redeems a purchased field must add <b>one-fifth?</b>
<b>Rava said: It is reasonable</b> to assume that the Rabbis <b>do not accept the verbal analogy.</b> The reasoning is as follows: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah that one must add <b>one-fifth in</b> the case of one who redeems <b>an ancestral field and in</b> the case of one who <b>consecrates his house, these are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter. <b>And any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect, in this case, adding one-fifth, to apply to other cases. Therefore, it can be assumed that the Rabbis maintain that one who redeems his purchased field does not have to pay an additional fifth.
Rava continues: <b>And</b> even <b>according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do teach</b> their common aspect, <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah that one must add <b>one-fifth when</b> he redeems his second <b>tithe, and when</b> he redeems his <b>kosher animal</b> that he consecrated and became blemished, <b>and when</b> he redeems his <b>non-kosher animal</b> that he consecrated, <b>these are many</b> verses that come at one, <b>and</b> everyone agrees that multiple verses <b>do not teach</b> their common aspect to other cases.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling <b>of Rava, but not for his reason. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “Then the priest shall reckon for him <b>the worth of your valuation</b> until the Jubilee Year; and he shall give your valuation in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:23). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> this estimation <b>to</b> fixed <b>valuations. Just as</b> with regard to fixed <b>valuations</b> one does <b>not add one-fifth, so too</b> when redeeming <b>a purchased field</b> one does <b>not add one-fifth.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a forewarned ox that killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; how so? Both</b> in the case of an ox <b>that killed the</b> most <b>attractive among the slaves,</b> whose value is great, <b>and</b> likewise in the case of one that killed <b>the</b> most <b>unsightly among the slaves,</b> whose value is minimal, its owner <b>gives</b> payment of <b>thirty <i>sela</i>,</b> the fine stated in the Torah (Exodus 21:32), to the owner of the slave. If the ox <b>killed a freeman,</b> its owner <b>gives his price</b> as payment to his heirs. This sum can be more or less than thirty shekels. If the ox <b>injured this</b> slave <b>or that</b> freeman, <b>he gives</b> payment of the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> as compensation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> As the mishna first specifies that it is speaking of a forewarned ox, this indicates that <b>with regard to a forewarned ox</b> that injured a freeman, <b>yes,</b> one is liable for full payment, but <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox that injured a freeman one does <b>not</b> make full restitution, but pays only half the value of the victim. The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 33a) that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>that injured a person also pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference</b> between the damage the person inflicted on the ox and the damage the ox inflicted on the person. Evidently, Rabbi Akiva does not distinguish between an innocuous and a forewarned ox in a case where an ox injured a person.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and explain it as follows: <b>The same is true that even</b> the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox must make full restitution, <b>but since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wants to teach</b> in the first part of <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: An ox that <b>killed a slave</b> and an ox that <b>killed a freeman, which you find in</b> the case of <b>forewarned</b> ox but <b>in</b> the case of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>you do not find it,</b> as the penalty for killing a person does not apply to an innocuous ox, it is <b>for this</b> reason that the mishna <b>teaches</b> only the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a rapist and with regard to a seducer that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; how so? Both</b> one <b>who raped or seduced</b> a young woman <b>who is</b> the most <b>prominent in the priesthood and</b> one who raped or seduced a young woman who is <b>the lowliest among the Israelites gives</b> the payment of <b>fifty <i>sela</i>,</b> the fine stated in the Torah (see Deuteronomy 22:29). <b>And</b> the payments for <b>humiliation and</b> for <b>degradation</b> resulting from being raped or seduced are assessed differentially; it is <b>all based on the one who humiliates and the one who is humiliated.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must the rapist or seducer also pay for her humiliation and degradation? One can <b>say</b> that <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the verse: “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver” (Deuteronomy 22:29), that he is to pay a total of <b>fifty <i>sela</i> for all matters</b> associated with this act, i.e., the fine, degradation, humiliation, and pain.
<b>Rav Zeira says:</b> It cannot be that he pays a total of only fifty <i>sela</i>, as people <b>will say:</b> Does it make sense that <b>one who engaged in</b> forced <b>intercourse with,</b> i.e., raped, <b>a daughter of kings</b> pays a sum of <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>, when she suffers great humiliation, and <b>one who engaged in forced intercourse with the daughter of ordinary</b> people <b>[<i>hedyotot</i>]</b> also pays <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>?
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Zeira: <b>If so,</b> the same claim can be applied <b>with regard to a slave</b> killed by an ox. People <b>will also say:</b> Does it make sense that <b>a slave who pierces pearls [<i>margalit</i>]</b> is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, and <b>a slave who performs needlecraft</b> is also worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>? Nevertheless, the mishna clearly indicates that there is no distinction between the two slaves, as the Torah states a fixed payment. <b>Rather, Rav Zeira says</b> that there is a different proof:

Daf 15a

<b>Had two</b> men <b>engaged in</b> forced <b>intercourse with her, one in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, leaving her hymen untouched, <b>and one in a typical manner,</b> vaginal intercourse, in which case the second man pays the fine, people <b>will say:</b> Does it make sense that one who <b>engaged in</b> forced <b>intercourse</b> with <b>a tainted</b> woman, who has had anal intercourse, pays <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>, and one who <b>engaged in</b> forced <b>intercourse</b> with <b>an untainted</b> virgin also pays <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>? Apparently, the fifty <i>sela</i> is the fixed sum of the fine, while the rest of the payment varies on a case-by-case basis.
<b>Abaye</b> again <b>said to</b> Rav Zeira: <b>If so,</b> the same claim can be applied <b>with regard to a slave</b> who is killed by an ox. People <b>will say:</b> Does it make sense that <b>a healthy slave</b> is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> and <b>a slave afflicted with boils</b> is also worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>? Yet the mishna clearly indicates that there is no distinction, as the Torah states a fixed amount.
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the reason the payment of fifty <i>sela</i> does not cover all forms of damage is that <b>the verse states:</b> “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty silver shekels, and she shall be his wife, <b>because he tormented her;</b> he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). This means that the payment is only for the torment, i.e., the rape. It <b>may be inferred that there are</b> additional payments for <b>humiliation and degradation,</b> beyond payment of the fine.
<b>Rava says</b> a different answer, <b>that the verse states: “Then the man that lay with her</b> shall give to the young woman’s father fifty silver shekels” (Deuteronomy 22:29). Rava infers from here that payment for the <b>pleasure of lying</b> with the woman is <b>fifty</b> shekel. It <b>may be inferred</b> from here <b>that there are</b> other <b>matters</b> that must be paid by the rapist. <b>And what are they?</b> Compensation for <b>humiliation and degradation.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a defamer,</b> who falsely claims that his bride was not a virgin, <b>that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent. How so? Both</b> one <b>who defamed</b> a young woman who is the most <b>prominent in the priesthood and</b> one who defamed a young woman who is the <b>lowliest among the Israelites gives</b> payment of <b>one hundred <i>sela</i>,</b> the fine stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 22:19).
Based on the relative scope of the fines, with the defamer paying twice the sum of the rapist and the seducer, it <b>is apparent</b> that <b>one who utters</b> malicious speech <b>with his mouth</b> is <b>a more severe</b> transgressor <b>than one who performs an action.</b> And this is corroborated, <b>as we found that the sentence imposed on our ancestors in the wilderness was sealed only due to the malicious speech</b> disseminated by the spies, <b>as it is stated</b> at that time: “All those men that have seen My glory, and My signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, <b>yet they have tried Me these ten times</b> and have not listened to My voice” (Numbers 14:22).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who utters malicious speech with his mouth is a more severe sinner than one who performs an action. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this proven? <b>Perhaps</b> the punishment for the one who defames is more severe <b>because the</b> defamation has the potential <b>to cause</b> his wife’s <b>death. As it is written: “But if this thing be true,</b> that the signs of virginity were not found in the young woman, <b>then they shall bring out the young woman</b> to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die” (Deuteronomy 22:20–21).
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the young woman, <b>because he has defamed</b> a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:19). This indicates that he is punished severely for his words, <b>for the defamation,</b> not because she might be put to death.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>As we found that the sentence</b> imposed on our ancestors in the wilderness <b>was sealed only</b> due to the malicious speech disseminated by the spies. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is known that their punishment was due to the malicious speech of the spies? <b>Perhaps</b> until that time <b>their <i>se’a</i>,</b> the measure of their sins warranting punishment, <b>was not</b> yet <b>filled, as Rav Hamnuna says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish a person until his <i>se’a</i> is filled, as it is stated: “In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits”</b> (Job 20:22). In other words, one is punished only when he has committed a sufficient number of sins, and the malicious speech of the spies was simply the last of a series of transgressions.
<b>Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “All those men who have seen My glory, and My signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, <b>yet they have tried Me now [<i>zeh</i>] ten times</b> and have not listened to My voice” (Numbers 14:22). The extra word “now [<i>zeh</i>]” teaches that their <b>sentence was sealed for this</b> specific sin, i.e., the malicious speech of the spies.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Perata says: Come and see how great the power of malicious speech is. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From the</b> punishment received by the <b>spies. And if one who defames</b> the <b>wood and rocks</b> of Eretz Yisrael received <b>such</b> a severe punishment, then with regard to <b>one who defames another</b> person, <b>all the more so</b> will he be punished severely.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known that the punishment of the spies was for malicious speech? <b>Perhaps</b> their punishment was <b>due to</b> the sin explained <b>by Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa. As Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: The spies uttered a great statement</b> of blasphemy <b>at that time. As it is written:</b> “But the men that went up with him said: We are not able to go up against the people; <b>for they are stronger than us [<i>mimmennu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 13:31). <b>Do not read</b> this as <b>“for they are stronger than us [<i>mimmennu</i>]” but</b> rather read it as: For they are stronger <b>than Him [<i>mimmennu</i>].</b> i.e., stronger than God. They were saying, <b>as it were,</b> that <b>the owner,</b> i.e., God, <b>cannot remove His utensils,</b> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, <b>from there.</b> If so, one can explain that the spies were punished for their blasphemy rather than for their malicious speech.
<b>Rather, Rabba says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>the verse states: “Those men that brought up an evil report of the land died</b> by the plague before the Lord” (Numbers 14:37). This teaches that they were punished not for their blasphemy but <b>for the</b> evil <b>report of the land that they brought.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Our ancestors tried the Holy One, Blessed be He</b> with <b>ten trials: Two at the sea, and two with water, two with the manna, two with the quail, one with the</b> golden <b>calf, and one in the wilderness of Paran.</b>
The Gemara lists the ten trials in detail. <b>Two at the sea: One when</b> the Jews <b>descended</b> into the sea, <b>and one when</b> they <b>ascended</b> from the sea. The Jews tried God <b>when</b> they <b>descended</b> into the sea, <b>as it is written:</b> “And they said to Moses: <b>Because there were no graves in Egypt,</b> have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this you have done to us, to take us out of Egypt” (Exodus 14:11).
And they also tried God <b>when</b> they <b>ascended</b> from the sea, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: The Jewish people of that generation,</b> during the Exodus, <b>were of little faith.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement of <b>Rabba bar Mari. As Rabba bar Mari says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But they were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. Nevertheless, He saved them for His Name’s sake”</b> (Psalms 106:7–8)? This <b>teaches that the Jews were rebellious at that time, and they said: Just as we are ascending from one side, so too</b> perhaps <b>the Egyptians are ascending from</b> the <b>other side,</b> and we will not be saved.
<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the ministering angel of the sea: Spew out</b> the dead Egyptians <b>onto dry land.</b> The ministering angel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a servant whose master gives him a gift and then takes it from him?</b> Since the dead Egyptians were given to me for my fish to eat, how can You retract Your gift? God <b>said to</b> the sea: <b>I will give you one and a half</b> times <b>their</b> number. Although I am taking them back now, later I will give you one and a half times as many people. In the case of the Egyptians it is stated: “Six hundred chosen chariots” (Exodus 14:7), whereas with regard to Sisera, who was defeated at the Kishon Brook, it is written: “Nine hundred chariots of iron” (Judges 4:13).
The ministering angel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a servant who issues a claim against his master</b> for a gift promised to him? Who will be the guarantor? God <b>said to</b> the ministering angel: <b>The Kishon Brook will be a guarantor</b> for Me. <b>Immediately,</b> the sea <b>spewed</b> the Egyptians <b>out onto the land,</b> and the Jewish people came and saw that they were dead. <b>As it is written: “And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon</b> the seashore” (Exodus 14:30).
The Gemara continues its list of the Jewish people’s trials of God: <b>Two with water:</b> One <b>in Mara and</b> one <b>in Rephidim.</b> The Jewish people tested God <b>in Mara as it is written: “And when they came to Mara, they could not drink</b> of the waters of Mara, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Mara” (Exodus 15:23), as Mara means bitter. <b>And it is written: “And the people murmured against Moses,</b> saying: What shall we drink?” (Exodus 15:24).
The Jewish people also tested God <b>in Rephidim, as it is written:</b> “And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages, according to the commandment of the Lord, <b>and encamped in Rephidim; and there was no water</b> for the people <b>to drink”</b> (Exodus 17:1). <b>And it is written: “And the people fought with Moses,</b> and said: Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them: Why do you fight with me? Why do you test the Lord?” (Exodus 17:2).
The Gemara continues: <b>Two with manna, as it is written:</b>

Daf 15b

<b>Do not go out,</b> as indicated in the verse: “And Moses said: Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath for the Lord; today you will not find it in the field” (Exodus 16:25). <b>But</b> nevertheless there were people who <b>went out</b> to look for manna, as it is written: “And it came to pass on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none” (Exodus 16:27). The verse also states: “And Moses said to them: Let <b>no</b> man <b>leave any of it</b> until the morning” (Exodus 16:19), <b>and</b> there were people who <b>left it</b> until morning, as it states: “But they did not listen to Moses; and some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and rotted; and Moses was angry with them” (Exodus 16:20).
The Gemara continues its elucidation of the <i>baraita</i>: There were <b>two</b> trials relating to the quail, one was <b>on the first</b> occasion when the <b>quail</b> appeared, <b>and</b> the other <b>on the second</b> occasion the <b>quail</b> appeared. The Gemara clarifies: The trial <b>of the first quail</b> is described in the verse: “And the children of Israel said to them: Would that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, <b>when we sat by the meat pots,</b> when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger” (Exodus 16:3). Immediately afterward the quail arrived, as the verse states: “And it came to pass in the evening, that the quail came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp” (Exodus 16:13).
The <b>second</b> trial of the <b>quail</b> is described in the verse: <b>“And the mixed multitude that was among them</b> desired; and the children of Israel also wept on their part, and said: Would that we were given meat to eat” (Numbers 11:4). Later the verse states: “And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought across quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth” (Numbers 11:31).
The Gemara concludes its detailing of the Jewish people’s ten trials of God: The trial of <b>the</b> golden <b>calf</b> is <b>as it is</b> described in the Torah (Exodus, chapter 32), and the trial in <b>the wilderness of Paran</b> is <b>as it is</b> described in the Torah (Numbers, chapter 13).
§ The Gemara returns to the topic of malicious speech. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done for you, you deceitful tongue”</b> (Psalms 120:3)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He said to the tongue: All the</b> other <b>limbs of a person are upright, but you are lying</b> horizontally. <b>All the</b> other <b>limbs of a person are external, but you are internal. And moreover, I have surrounded you with two walls, one of bone,</b> i.e., the teeth, <b>and one of flesh,</b> the lips. <b>What shall be given to you and what more shall be done for you,</b> to prevent <b>you</b> from speaking in <b>a deceitful</b> manner, <b>tongue?</b>
Furthermore, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Anyone who speaks malicious speech</b> is considered <b>as though he denied the fundamental</b> belief in God. <b>As it is stated: “Who have said: We will make our tongue mighty; our lips are with us: Who is lord over us”</b> (Psalms 12:5).
<b>And Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra says: Anyone who speaks malicious speech</b> will be afflicted by <b>leprous marks coming upon him, as it is stated: “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him [<i>atzmit</i>];</b> whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him” (Psalms 101:5). <b>And it is written there:</b> “And the land shall not be sold <b>in perpetuity [<i>letzmitut</i>];</b> for the land is Mine; for you are strangers and settlers with Me” (Leviticus 25:23). <b>And we translate</b> this term <i>letzmitut</i> as <b><i>laḥalutin</i>,</b> in perpetuity or confirmed.
Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra continues: <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 8b): <b>The difference between a quarantined leper,</b> i.e., one examined by a priest who found his symptoms inconclusive, and who must therefore remain in isolation for a period of up to two weeks to see if conclusive symptoms develop, <b>and a confirmed [<i>muḥlat</i>] leper,</b> one whose symptoms were conclusive and the priest declared him a definite leper, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>letting</b> the hair on one’s head grow <b>wild and rending</b> one’s garments. A confirmed leper is obligated to let the hair on his head grow wild and rend his garments; a quarantined leper is not. The similarity in the terms teaches that one who speaks malicious speech will be afflicted with leprous marks.
<b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This shall be the law of the leper [<i>metzora</i>]</b> in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest” (Leviticus 14:2)? This means that <b>this shall be the law of a defamer [<i>motzi shem ra</i>].</b>
<b>And Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the serpent bites before it is charmed, then what advantage is there to the master of the tongue”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:11). What is the connection between the serpent and the master of the tongue? <b>In the future, all the animals</b> will <b>gather and come to the serpent and</b> will <b>say</b> to it: <b>A lion tramples</b> with its paws to kill its prey <b>and eats; a wolf tears</b> with its teeth to kill its prey <b>and eats.</b> But <b>you, what benefit do you have</b> when you bite, as you cannot eat every animal that you kill? The serpent will <b>say to them: And what is the benefit to the master of the tongue</b> that speaks malicious speech?
<b>And Reish Lakish says: Anyone who speaks malicious speech increases</b> his <b>sins until the heavens, as it is stated: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth”</b> (Psalms 73:9). In other words, while his tongue walks on the earth, his sin reaches the heavens.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says: Anyone who speaks malicious speech,</b> it is <b>appropriate to stone him with stones. It is written here:</b> “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, <b>I will destroy him [<i>atzmit</i>]”</b> (Psalms 101:5), <b>and it is written there: “They have destroyed [<i>tzamtu</i>] my life in the dungeon, and have cast stones upon me”</b> (Lamentations 3:53).
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who speaks malicious speech, the Holy One, Blessed be He says</b> about him: <b>He and I cannot dwell</b> together <b>in the world. As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him; whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him”</b> (Psalms 101:5). <b>Do not read</b> the phrase as: <b>“I will not suffer him [</b><i>oto</i><b>],” but</b> as: <b>With him [<i>ito</i>] I cannot</b> bear to dwell. God is saying that He cannot bear having this person in the world with Him. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who teach this</b> notion of God’s not being able to tolerate a certain type of person in reference <b>to the arrogant,</b> i.e., they apply it to the last part of the verse: Proud of heart.
<b>Rav Ḥisda</b> further <b>says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who speaks malicious speech, the Holy One Blessed be He says</b> about him <b>to Gehenna: I</b> will be <b>on him from above, and you</b> will be <b>on him from below,</b> and together <b>we will judge him</b> and punish him. <b>As it is stated: “Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom”</b> (Psalms 120:4), <b>and</b> the word <b>“arrow”</b> means <b>nothing other than the tongue, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks deceit.</b> One speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies in wait for him” (Jeremiah 9:7).
Mar Ukva continued: <b>And</b> the word <b>“mighty” in</b> Psalms 120:4 means <b>nothing other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord will go forth as a mighty man,</b> He will stir up jealousy like a man of war; He will cry; He will shout aloud, He will prove Himself mighty against His enemies” (Isaiah 42:13). And as for the <b>coals of</b> the <b>broom</b> tree [<b><i>gaḥalei retamim</i></b>] that burn for a long time, <b>this is</b> an allusion to <b>Gehenna.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina says: What is the remedy for those who speak malicious speech? If he is a Torah scholar,</b> let him <b>study Torah, as it is stated: “A soothing tongue is a tree of life,</b> but its perverseness is a broken spirit” (Proverbs 15:4). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tongue”</b> means <b>nothing other than malicious speech, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow;</b> it speaks deceit” (Jeremiah 9:7). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tree”</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them that lay hold of it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18). <b>And if he is an ignoramus,</b> let him <b>humble his mind, as it is stated: “Its perverseness is a broken spirit”</b> (Proverbs 15:4). In other words, one who perverts his tongue with malicious speech should remedy his behavior by cultivating a broken and humble spirit.
<b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> If one has already <b>spoken</b> malicious speech, <b>he has no remedy, as</b> King <b>David,</b> inspired <b>by Divine Spirit, has already</b> cut him off with the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, as it is stated: “May the Lord cut off [<i>yakhret</i>] all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks great things”</b> (Psalms 12:4). <b>Rather, what is his remedy</b> beforehand, <b>so that he does not come to</b> speak <b>malicious speech? If he is a Torah scholar,</b> let him <b>study Torah; and if he is an ignoramus</b> let him <b>humble his mind, as it is stated:</b> “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, <b>but its perverseness is a broken spirit”</b> (Proverbs 15:4). One who is humble will not come to speak badly about another.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anyone who speaks malicious speech increases</b> his <b>sins</b> to the degree that they <b>correspond</b> to the <b>three</b> cardinal <b>transgressions: Idol worship, and forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed.</b> This can be derived from a verbal analogy based on the word “great.” <b>It is written here:</b> “May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, <b>the tongue that speaks great things”</b> (Psalms 12:4). <b>And it is written with regard to idol worship:</b> “And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: <b>Oh, this people have sinned a great sin,</b> and have made for themselves a god of gold” (Exodus 32:31).
<b>With regard to forbidden sexual relations it is written</b> that when Potiphar’s wife attempted to seduce Joseph he responded: <b>“How can I do this great wickedness,</b> and sin against God” (Genesis 39:9). <b>With regard to bloodshed it is written,</b> after Cain murdered his brother: “And Cain said to the Lord: <b>My punishment is greater than I can bear”</b> (Genesis 4:13). The Torah describes each of these three cardinal sins with the word “great” in the singular, whereas malicious speech is described with the plural term “great things,” indicating that it is equivalent to all three of the other transgressions together.
The Gemara asks: Granted that with regard to malicious speech the verse uses the plural: <b>“Great things,”</b> but the plural indicates a minimum of two. If so, one can only <b>say</b> that malicious speech is equivalent to <b>two</b> of the cardinal transgressions. The Gemara responds: <b>Which of them</b> could be <b>taken out</b> as less than the other two? All three are equal. Therefore malicious speech must be equivalent to all three.
<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: Third speech,</b> i.e., malicious speech about a third party, <b>kills three</b> people. <b>It kills the one who speaks</b> malicious speech, <b>and the one who accepts</b> the malicious speech when he hears it, <b>and</b> the one <b>about</b> whom the malicious speech is <b>said.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Death and life are in the hand of</b> the <b>tongue”</b> (Proverbs 18:21). <b>Does the tongue have a hand?</b> Rather the verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a hand can kill, so too a tongue can kill. If</b> you were to claim that <b>just as the hand kills only from close by, so too the tongue kills only from close by,</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). The tongue kills like an arrow that is fired from a bow, at a great distance.
<b>If</b> you say that <b>just as an arrow</b> can kill only within the distance it can be shot, which is <b>up to</b> about <b>forty or fifty cubits, so too a tongue</b> can kill only from <b>up to forty or fifty cubits,</b> therefore <b>the verse teaches: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth”</b> (Psalms 73:9). This teaches that malicious speech can reach great distances, even the distance between heaven and earth.
The Gemara asks: <b>But since it is written: “They have set their mouth against the heavens,</b> and their tongue walks through the earth” (Psalms 73:9), which teaches that malicious speech reaches between heaven and earth, <b>why do I</b> need that which we derived from the verse: <b>“Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7), i.e. that a tongue can kill from the distance an arrow flies? The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that</b> a tongue <b>kills</b> in the <b>same</b> manner that <b>an arrow</b> kills.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But since it is written: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“Death and life are in the hand of the tongue”</b> (Proverbs 18:21), which merely teaches that a tongue can kill? The Gemara answers: This verse is necessary <b>for</b> a statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says: One who wants life</b> can attain it <b>by</b> means of <b>his tongue,</b> which he can use for speaking appropriately and studying Torah. <b>One who wants death</b> can also attain it <b>by</b> means of <b>his tongue,</b> by using it for inappropriate and malicious speech.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered malicious speech?</b> In other words, how is malicious speech defined and what are the limits of the prohibition? <b>Rava said: For example, if one says: There is</b> always <b>fire at so-and-so’s home,</b> indicating that they are always cooking food there. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>What did</b> this person <b>do</b> wrong by saying that there is always fire in that home? His statement <b>is merely revealing</b> the true <b>facts,</b> and is not malicious speech. <b>Rather,</b> it is considered malicious speech if he <b>expressed</b> this <b>in a slanderous</b> manner. For example, <b>if he says: Where</b> else can one <b>find fire except at so-and-so’s home,</b> because they are always cooking food there.
<b>Rabba says: Any statement that is said in the presence of its master,</b> i.e., if the subject of the statement was there, <b>does not have</b> any prohibition <b>due to malicious speech.</b> Abaye <b>said to him: All the more so</b> it is proscribed speech, as it is both <b>impudence and malicious speech.</b> Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yosei says: In all my days I never said something and then turned around</b> to see if the person I was speaking about was standing behind me listening, as I would say it even to the person involved. He <b>says,</b>

Daf 16a

i.e., <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> says: <b>Any matter that was said in the presence of three</b> people <b>does not have</b> the status <b>of malicious speech</b> if one subsequently repeats it. <b>What is the reason?</b> The reason is that <b>your friend has a friend, and your friend’s friend has a friend.</b> Once the information has been stated in the presence of three people, it can be assumed that it will spread and become public knowledge, as each person will tell someone else.
The Gemara continues its discussion of good and bad speech. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him”</b> (Proverbs 27:14)? <b>For example, when</b> one <b>is invited to a host, and they look after him very well. The following day</b> the guest <b>goes out and sits in the marketplace and says: May the Merciful One bless so-and-so, as this is how</b> well <b>he looked after me. And</b> all the <b>people</b> in the marketplace <b>hear and go</b> to this host <b>and afflict him</b> by expecting him to look after all of them in the same way, and he is compelled to spend his money on them. It turns out that the praise and blessing the guest lavished upon his host brought a curse upon him.
Similarly, <b>Rav Dimi, the brother of Rav Safra, teaches: A person should never speak about the goodness of another</b> in the presence of others, <b>as through</b> speaking about <b>his goodness he will come to</b> speak about <b>him</b> in <b>a derogatory</b> manner, as he will eventually note the exceptions to his goodness, or his listeners will temper his praise by mentioning that individual’s bad qualities.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Dimi did not actually make this statement himself. Rather, the following incident occurred: <b>Rav Dimi, the brother of Rav Safra, was ill. Rav Safra went in to inquire about his</b> condition. Rav Dimi <b>said to</b> those present: <b>I have</b> blessing and merit <b>coming to me, as I have fulfilled all of</b> the statements <b>that the Sages say.</b> Rav Safra <b>said to him: But have you fulfilled</b> the instruction of the Sages that <b>a person should never speak about the goodness of another</b> in the presence of others, <b>as through</b> speaking about <b>his goodness he will come to</b> speak about <b>him</b> in a <b>derogatory</b> manner? Rav Dimi <b>said to them: I never heard</b> this statement of the Sages, <b>but had I heard it, I</b> would have <b>fulfilled it.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Leprous marks come</b> and afflict a person <b>for seven</b> sinful <b>matters: For malicious speech, for bloodshed, for an oath</b> taken <b>in vain, for forbidden sexual relations, for arrogance, for theft, and for stinginess.</b>
The Gemara explains the source for the claim that each of these seven sins is punishable with leprosy. <b>For malicious speech</b> one is punished, <b>as it is written: “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him;</b> whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him” (Psalms 101:5). The Gemara explained above (15b) that this is referring to leprosy.
<b>For bloodshed, as it is written</b> about Joab, as punishment for murdering Abner: “A<b>nd let there not fail from the house of Joab a <i>zav</i>, or a leper,</b> or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that lacks bread” (II Samuel 3:29).
<b>And for an oath</b> taken <b>in vain, as it is written: “And Naaman said: Be content [<i>ho’el</i>], take two talents.</b> And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him” (II Kings 5:23). The Sages maintain that the term <i>ho’el</i> indicates an oath, and that Naaman requested of Gehazi, to whom this was stated, to take an oath that Elisha had sent him to accept gifts, which Elisha had not done, and Gehazi took the oath. When Elisha found out what Gehazi had done he cursed him, <b>and</b> so <b>it is written: “The leprosy of Naaman shall stick to you</b> and to your children forever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow” (II Kings 5:27).
<b>And for forbidden sexual relations, as it is written: “And the Lord afflicted Pharaoh</b> and his house with great <b>afflictions</b> because of Sarai, Abram’s wife” (Genesis 12:17).
<b>And for arrogance, as it is written</b> with regard to King Uzziah: <b>“But when he was strong his heart became arrogant so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against the Lord his God;</b> for he went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense” (II Chronicles 26:16). And it states: “Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests, <b>the leprosy broke forth in his forehead”</b> (II Chronicles 26:19).
<b>And for theft, as it is written: “And the priest shall command that they empty the house,</b> before the priest go in to see the mark, that all that is in the house not become impure; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house” (Leviticus 14:36). In explanation of this verse, the Sages <b>taught: He gathered property that is not his,</b> therefore let <b>the priest come and scatter his property.</b>
<b>And for stinginess, as it is written: “Then he that owns the house shall come</b> and tell the priest, saying: There seems to me to be as it were a mark in the house” (Leviticus 14:35). <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse calls him the one who owns the house <b>because</b> it is referring to <b>one who</b> was stingy and treated <b>his house</b> as being <b>exclusively his,</b> and did not allow others to share his property.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Doesn’t Rabbi Anani bar Sason say: Why</b> was the <b>passage</b> in the Torah that discusses the <b>priestly vestments</b> (Leviticus 8) <b>juxtaposed to</b> the <b>passage</b> that discusses <b>offerings</b> (Leviticus, chapters 1–7)? <b>To tell you</b> that <b>just as offerings atone, so too the priestly vestments atone.</b> For what does each garment atone? The <b>tunic [<i>ketonet</i>] atones for bloodshed, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph’s brothers after they plotted to kill him: <b>“And they killed a goat, and dipped the coat [<i>ketonet</i>] in the blood”</b> (Genesis 37:31). The <b>trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, as it is written</b> with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness”</b> (Exodus 28:42).
The <b>mitre atones for the arrogant, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is logical that <b>an item</b> placed <b>at an elevation,</b> i.e., on the head of a priest, <b>shall come and atone for</b> the <b>matter of an elevated</b> heart. The <b>belt atones for thought of the heart.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The belt atones for the sins occurring <b>where it is</b> situated, i.e., over the heart, <b>as it is written:</b> “And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Tummim; <b>and it shall be upon Aaron’s heart,</b> when he goes in before the Lord; and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually” (Exodus 28:30).
The <b>breastplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for</b> improper <b>judgments, as it is written: “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment”</b> (Exodus 28:15). The <b>ephod</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for idol worship, as it is written: “And without ephod or teraphim”</b> (Hosea 3:4), that is to say, when there is no ephod, the sin of teraphim, i.e., idol worship, is found. This indicates that if there is an ephod, there is no sin of idol worship. The <b>robe</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for malicious speech,</b> as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He says:</b> Let an <b>item that</b> produces <b>sound,</b> i.e., the bells of the robe, <b>come and atone for</b> an <b>act of</b> malicious <b>sound,</b> i.e., malicious speech.
Finally, the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for an act of brazenness.</b> From where is this derived? <b>Here,</b> with regard to the frontplate, <b>it is written: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), <b>and there,</b> with regard to brazenness, <b>it is written: “And you had a prostitute’s forehead”</b> (Jeremiah 3:3). The statement of Rabbi Anani bar Sason indicates that the robe worn by the High Priest atones for malicious speech, which means that one is not punished by leprosy, as claimed by Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the statement of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani is referring to a case <b>where his actions were effective</b> and caused damage. <b>There,</b> Rabbi Anani bar Sason is referring to a case <b>where his actions were not effective. If his actions were effective</b> and caused harm or quarrels, <b>leprous marks come upon him</b> as punishment. <b>If his actions were not effective</b> and did not cause any damage, <b>the robe atones</b> for his sin.
The Gemara asks: But <b>doesn’t Rabbi Simon say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> There are <b>two matters for which we do not find atonement through offerings,</b> but <b>we find atonement for them through another matter,</b> and they are: <b>Bloodshed and malicious speech.</b> With regard to <b>bloodshed,</b> its atonement comes <b>from</b> the <b>heifer whose neck is broken.</b> This is referring to a case where a murdered body is found but the murderer is unknown. In such an instance, the Torah mandates that the town nearest the body must break the neck of a heifer as atonement for the transgression (see Deuteronomy 21:1–9).
<b>And malicious speech</b> is atoned for <b>through incense, as Rabbi Ḥanina taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>We</b> have <b>learned that incense atones, as it is written</b> in the incident when the Israelites were afflicted with a plague for speaking slanderously against Moses and Aaron: <b>“And he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people”</b> (Numbers 17:12). <b>And</b> similarly, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: For what does incense atone? For malicious speech.</b> It is as though <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Let an item that</b> is sacrificed <b>in private,</b> i.e., the incense, which is burnt inside the Sanctuary, <b>come and atone for an action</b> generally performed in <b>private,</b> i.e., malicious speech.
The Gemara notes the apparent contradictions: One statement concerning <b>bloodshed</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the other statement about <b>bloodshed:</b> According to Rabbi Anani bar Sason the tunic atones for bloodshed, whereas the <i>baraita</i> states that the heifer whose neck is broken atones for this sin. Furthermore, one statement concerning <b>malicious speech</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the other statement about <b>malicious speech:</b> Rabbi Anani bar Sason maintains that the robe atones for malicious speech, whereas according to the <i>baraita</i> it is the incense that atones for this transgression.
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction <b>between</b> one statement about <b>bloodshed</b> and the other statement about <b>bloodshed</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this,</b> the tunic, atones for bloodshed in a case <b>where it is known who killed him,</b> and <b>that,</b> the heifer, atones in a case <b>where it is not known who killed him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If it is known who killed him,</b> the murderer <b>is deserving of death,</b> and there is no atonement for the community until he is put to death, as the verse states: “And no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed within it, but by the blood of him that shed it” (Numbers 35:33). The Gemara responds: There are certain instances where it is impossible to put him to death, e.g., if he murdered <b>intentionally but</b> witnesses <b>did not warn him</b> beforehand of the consequences of committing murder. In such a case, the court may not put the murderer to death, as there is no punishment without prior warning.
The Gemara continues: With regard to the apparent contradiction <b>between</b> one statement dealing with <b>malicious speech</b> and the other statement about <b>malicious speech,</b> it is also <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this,</b> the incense, atones for malicious speech spoken <b>in private,</b>

Daf 16b

whereas <b>that</b> robe atones for malicious speech spoken <b>in public.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nadav asked Rabbi Ḥanina, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nadav, the son-in-law of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who asked <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, and some say</b> that he asked it <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: What is different</b> and notable about <b>a leper, that the Torah states: “He shall dwell alone; outside of the camp shall be his dwelling”</b> (Leviticus 13:46)? He replied: By speaking malicious speech <b>he separated between husband and wife</b> and <b>between</b> one <b>person and another; therefore</b> he is punished with leprosy, and <b>the Torah says: “He shall dwell alone;</b> outside of the camp shall be his dwelling.”
<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Levi says: What is different</b> and notable about <b>a leper that the Torah states</b> that <b>he is to bring two birds for his purification</b> (Leviticus 14:4)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He says: He acted</b> by speaking malicious speech <b>with an act of chatter; therefore the Torah says</b> that <b>he is to bring an offering</b> of birds, who chirp and <b>chatter</b> all the time.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not hate your brother in your heart;</b> you shall rebuke [<i>hokhe’aḥ tokhiaḥ</i>] your neighbor, and do not bear sin because of him” (Leviticus 19:17). Why does the verse specify “in your heart”? One <b>might</b> have thought that the verse means: <b>Do not hit him, do not slap him, and do not ruin him</b> due to hatred. Therefore <b>the verse states “in your heart.”</b> This teaches that <b>the verse speaks</b> of <b>hatred in the heart.</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>sees an unseemly matter in another that he is obligated to rebuke him? As it is stated: “You shall rebuke [<i>hokhe’aḥ tokhiaḥ</i>]</b> your neighbor.” If one <b>rebuked him</b> for his action <b>but he</b> did not <b>accept</b> the rebuke, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that he must rebuke him again? The verse states: “You shall rebuke [</b><i>hokhe’aḥ <b>tokhiaḥ</b></i><b>],”</b> and the double language indicates he must rebuke <b>in any case.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that one should continue rebuking him <b>even if his face changes</b> due to humiliation. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Do not bear sin because of him”;</b> the one giving rebuke may not sin by embarrassing the other person.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Tarfon says: I would be surprised if there is</b> anyone <b>in this generation who can receive rebuke.</b> Why? Because <b>if</b> the one rebuking <b>says to him: Remove the splinter from between your eyes,</b> i.e., rid yourself of a minor infraction, the other <b>says to him: Remove the beam from between your eyes,</b> i.e., you have committed far more severe sins. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says: I would be surprised if there is</b> anyone <b>in this generation who knows</b> how <b>to rebuke</b> correctly, without embarrassing the person he is rebuking.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses before me that Akiva was lashed,</b> i.e., punished, <b>many times on my account, as I would complain about him before Rabban Shimon</b> ben Gamliel <b>the Great. And all the more so I</b> thereby <b>increased</b> his <b>love</b> for me. This incident serves <b>to affirm that</b> which <b>is stated: “Do not rebuke a scorner lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you”</b> (Proverbs 9:8). A wise man wants to improve himself and loves those who assist him in that task.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon, asked</b> his father: If one is faced with the choice of <b>rebuke for its</b> own <b>sake, or humility not for its</b> own <b>sake, which of them is preferable?</b> His father <b>said to him: Do you not concede that humility for its</b> own <b>sake is preferable? As the Master says: Humility is the greatest of all</b> the positive attributes. If so, humility <b>not for its</b> own <b>sake is also preferable, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A person should always engage in Torah and mitzvot even if not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., without the proper motivation but for ulterior motives, <b>as through</b> the performance of mitzvot <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake, one will come</b> in the end to do them <b>for their</b> own <b>sake.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered rebuke for its</b> own <b>sake and humility not for its</b> own <b>sake?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>like this</b> incident that occurred <b>when Rav Huna and Ḥiyya bar Rav were sitting before Shmuel. Ḥiyya bar Rav said to</b> Shmuel: <b>See, Master, that</b> Rav Huna <b>is afflicting me.</b> Rav Huna <b>accepted upon himself that he would not afflict</b> Ḥiyya bar Rav <b>anymore. After</b> Ḥiyya bar Rav <b>left,</b> Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Shmuel: Ḥiyya bar Rav <b>did such-and-such</b> to me, and therefore I was in the right to cause him distress. Shmuel <b>said to him: Why did you not say this in his presence?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: Heaven</b> forbid <b>that the son of Rav should be humiliated because of me.</b> This provides an example of rebuke for its own sake, as Rav Huna originally rebuked Ḥiyya bar Rav only when Shmuel was not present, and of humility not for its own sake, as Rav Huna did not forgive Ḥiyya bar Rav but simply did not wish to humiliate him.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> does the obligation of <b>rebuke</b> extend? <b>Rav says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>hitting,</b> i.e., until the person being rebuked hits the person rebuking him.<b>And Shmuel says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>cursing,</b> i.e., he curses the one rebuking him. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>reprimand.</b> The Gemara points out that this dispute between these <i>amora’im</i> is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>hitting; Rabbi Yehoshua says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>cursing; ben Azzai says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>reprimand.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: And</b> all <b>three of them expounded</b> the same <b>one verse,</b> from which they derived their respective opinions. After Jonathan rebuked his father, Saul, for the way he treated David, the verse states: <b>“Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him: You son of perverse rebellion,</b> do not I know that you have chosen the son of Yishai to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness” (I Samuel 20:30). <b>And it is written: “And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him,</b> whereby Jonathan knew that it had been determined by his father to put David to death” (I Samuel 20:33).
<b>According to the one who says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>hitting,</b> it is derived from that <b>which is written: “To smite him.” And according to the one who says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>cursing,</b> it is derived from that <b>which is written: “To the shame of your mother’s nakedness.” And according to the one who says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>reprimand,</b> it is derived from that <b>which is written: “Then Saul’s anger was kindled.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who says: Until</b> his rebuke is met by <b>reprimand, aren’t</b> both <b>hitting and cursing written</b> in that verse? The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as due to the special fondness that Jonathan had for David, he subjected himself</b> to <b>more</b> abuse than is required by <i>halakha</i>.
Apropos the topic of losing patience and hitting another, the Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> does the requirement that <b>a person should not change his</b> place of <b>lodging</b> extend, i.e., how much must one suffer before he may move elsewhere? <b>Rav says: Until</b> the point of the host’s <b>hitting</b> him. <b>And Shmuel says: Until</b> the host packs up the guest’s <b>clothes</b> and <b>places them on</b> his <b>back</b> to throw him out.
The Gemara comments: If it is a case <b>where</b> the host <b>hits</b> the guest <b>himself, everyone agrees</b> that the guest may move lodging. Similarly, if the host packs up the guest’s <b>clothes</b> and <b>places them on</b> his <b>back, everyone also agrees</b> that he may leave. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case where the host <b>hits his wife.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>since</b> the host <b>does not hurt</b> the guest <b>himself, what difference does it make to him?</b> Therefore, he should not change his lodging on that account. <b>And one Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that if he continues to stay in that place <b>he will come to fight</b> with his host about this matter.
<b>And why</b> is it <b>so</b> important that one should remain in the same lodging until he is forced to leave? It is <b>as the Master says: A guest</b> has the potential to <b>degrade and to be degraded.</b> If he moves from one place of lodging to another, people will assume that his host is unpleasant to him and that he is not a well-behaved guest, as the two of them cannot get along with one another, and the reputations of both of them will be tarnished.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where in the Torah</b> is it derived <b>that a person should not change his</b> place of <b>lodging? As it is stated</b> when Abraham returned from Egypt: “And he went on his journeys from the South to Beth El, <b>to the place where his tent had been at the beginning,</b> between Beth El and Ai” (Genesis 13:3). Abraham took pains to revisit the same places he had stayed on his journey to Egypt.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The source is <b>from here,</b> the beginning of the verse: <b>“And he went on his journeys,”</b> i.e., the same journeys he made on the way down to Egypt. <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>a temporary lodging.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Ḥanina, even one who is on a journey must return to stay in the same place where he originally lodged, whereas “his tent” indicates a measure of permanence.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a person should not change from his craft and from the craft of his fathers? As it is stated: “And King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass;</b> and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to King Solomon, and wrought all his work” (I Kings 7:13–14).
<b>And the Master says:</b> Hiram’s <b>mother</b> was also <b>from the house of Dan,</b> as the verse states about him: “The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan” (II Chronicles 2:13). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to those who constructed the Tabernacle: <b>“And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,</b> a craftsman, and a skillful workman, and a weaver in colors, in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen” (Exodus 38:23). This teaches that Hiram continued in the craft of brass work, the craft of his father’s family and also of his mother’s family from Dan.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> is the minimum <b>limit of suffering?</b> What is the least amount pain that is included in the definition of suffering? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Anyone</b> for whom <b>they wove a garment to wear and</b> the garment <b>does not suit him,</b> i.e., it does not fit him exactly. <b>Rava the Younger objects to this, and some say Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> objects: The <b>Sages said</b> an even <b>greater</b> statement than this, i.e., that even lesser inconvenience is still considered suffering: <b>Even if</b> people <b>intended</b> that <b>they would dilute</b> his wine <b>with hot</b> water, <b>but they</b> accidentally <b>diluted it for him with cold</b> water, it is considered suffering. Similarly, if he wanted it diluted <b>with cold</b> water, <b>but they diluted it for him with hot</b> water, this too is considered suffering. <b>And you say all this,</b> that it is considered suffering, only if the garment one ordered does not fit?
<b>Mar son of Ravina says: Even</b> if <b>one’s cloak turns around</b> as he puts it on, so that he has to take it off and put it on again, this too is considered a form of suffering. <b>Rava</b> said, <b>and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Ḥisda, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Even</b> if one <b>reached his hand into</b> his <b>pocket to take out three</b> coins, <b>but two</b> coins <b>came up in his hand,</b> it is considered a form of suffering.
The Gemara notes that it constitutes suffering <b>specifically</b> in a case where one reached into his pocket to take <b>three</b> coins, <b>and two</b> coins <b>came up in his hand. But</b> if he reached into his pocket to take <b>two,</b> and instead <b>three</b> coins <b>came up in his hand,</b> this is <b>not</b> considered to be suffering, <b>as it is not an exertion to drop</b> the extra coin back into his pocket.
<b>And why</b> is it <b>so</b> important to know the least amount of suffering? <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Anyone who passes forty days without suffering has received his World,</b> i.e., his reward, and he will have no further reward in the World-to-Come. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say:</b>

Daf 17a

<b>A calamity awaits him.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the topic of rebuke. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: Were the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> to have <b>entered into judgment with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, they would not have been able to stand before</b> the <b>rebuke. As it is stated: “Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous acts of the Lord, which He did to you and to your fathers”</b> (I Samuel 12:7). This indicates that God acted towards the patriarchs with righteousness, i.e., mercy, not as they deserved according to the strict letter of the law.
§ The verse states: <b>“This is the generation of them that seek after Him, that seek Your face, Jacob. Selah”</b> (Psalms 24:6). This verse teaches that the level of the generation and those who lead them, i.e., those who seek after Him, are the same. <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia and the Rabbis disagree about this. One says:</b> The level of the <b>generation follows</b> the level of the <b>leader, and one says:</b> The level of the <b>leader follows</b> the level of <b>his generation.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., matter, is this stated? <b>If we say for good, that</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>if</b> the <b>generation is good</b> then their <b>leader</b> will be <b>good, and</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>if</b> the <b>leader is good</b> then his <b>generation will be good,</b> this cannot be correct, as <b>there is</b> the case of King <b>Zedekiah, who was good, but his generation was not good. And</b> conversely, there is the case of <b>Jehoiakim who was not good, but his generation was good.</b>
The Gemara cites proof for these claims. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from the Lord, saying”</b> (Jeremiah 26:1), and similarly with regard to Zedekiah the verse states: “And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying” (Jeremiah 28:1). Why did the prophet use the term “in the beginning” exclusively with regard to these two kings, as opposed to: During the first year of his reign, or a similar formulation?
This term teaches that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to revert the world to chaos and void,</b> as it was in the beginning before Creation (Genesis 1:1–2), <b>on account of Jehoiakim,</b> who did evil in the eyes of God. <b>Once He observed the</b> people of <b>his generation, His mind was settled.</b> Likewise, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to revert the world to chaos and void, on account of the generation of Zedekiah,</b> but <b>once He observed Zedekiah, His mind was settled.</b> This shows that the leader and his generation are not necessarily on the same level in terms of righteousness.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, we are speaking in terms of harshness and gentleness.</b> One Sage holds that if the leader is harsh, then the generation will be harsh. If the leader is gentle and kind, the generation will be the same. The other Sage holds that if the people of a certain generation are harsh, they will have a harsh leader; if the generation is gentle and kind, the leader will be similar.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Affordability,</b> which is written in the Torah: “According to the means of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him” (Leviticus 27:8), is determined <b>in accordance with</b> the means of the <b>one taking the vow, and</b> the sum fixed by the Torah based on <b>the years</b> of age is <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the vow. And the</b> distinction based on sex that is written in the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations</b> is stated <b>with regard to the one valuated, and the</b> different <b>valuation</b> based on the age of the one valuated is determined <b>at the time</b> one takes <b>the</b> vow of <b>valuation.</b>
The mishna elaborates: <b>Affordability</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the means of the <b>one taking the vow; how</b> so? <b>A destitute person who valuated a wealthy person gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means <b>of a destitute person,</b> as determined by the priest. <b>And a wealthy person who valuated a destitute person gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means <b>of a wealthy person,</b> the sum of which is fixed in the Torah.
<b>But with regard to offerings that is not so, as</b> one <b>who</b> took a vow and <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to provide <b>the offering of this leper,</b> to a leper who requires it for his purification; if the one undergoing purification <b>was a destitute leper,</b> the one who took the vow <b>brings the offering of a destitute</b> leper, which is one male sheep, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, and two doves or two pigeons (see Leviticus 14:21–22). If the one undergoing purification <b>was a wealthy</b> leper, the one who took the vow <b>brings the offering of a wealthy</b> leper, which is two male sheep, a ewe, and three-tenths of a ephah of fine flour (see Leviticus 14:10).
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say: Even with regard to valuations</b> it is <b>so.</b> He explains: <b>For what</b> reason <b>does a destitute person who valuated a wealthy person give</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means <b>of a destitute person?</b> It is due to the fact <b>that the wealthy person is not obligated</b> to pay <b>anything,</b> as the debt was generated by the destitute person who vowed to donate the valuation of a wealthy individual. <b>But</b> in a case similar to that of the offerings of a leper, in the case of <b>a wealthy person who said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation, and a destitute person heard</b> him <b>and said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>that which he said,</b> the destitute person <b>gives the valuation of a wealthy person.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that affordability is determined in accordance with the means of the one taking the vow. The Gemara asks: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>affordability is</b> written in the Torah <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>one who valuates,</b> i.e., one who says he will give the Temple treasury the set sum assigned to a particular individual’s age and sex. Why, then, is the mishna referring to affordability in the context of one pledging another’s worth by taking a vow, in which the obligation is calculated individually rather than by predetermined assigned values? The Gemara answers: The mishna employs the language of the verse, which uses the word “vow,” <b>as it is written: “According to the means of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him”</b> (Leviticus 27:8).
Similarly, the Gemara asks: Is the mishna’s wording accurate when it states that the sum of the obligation based on <b>the years</b> of age is <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the vow?</b> The mishna should state that the sum based on years is determined <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the valuation,</b> not the vow. The Gemara answers: Although it is discussing valuations, <b>since</b> the mishna uses the term vow <b>when</b> it <b>says: Affordability</b> is determined <b>in accordance with</b> the means of the <b>one taking the vow,</b> the mishna <b>also</b> deploys the same term when it <b>says:</b> The sum of the obligation based on <b>the years</b> of age is <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the vow.</b>
The mishna further teaches: <b>Affordability</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the <b>one taking the vow; how</b> so? <b>A destitute person who valuated a wealthy person gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means of the <b>destitute person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? As the verse states: “According to the means of him who vowed,”</b> which teaches that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the matter <b>dependent on the one who vows,</b> not upon the subject of the vow.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But with regard to offerings that is not so, as</b> in the case of one <b>who</b> vowed and <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to provide <b>the offering of this leper,</b> if the one undergoing purification <b>was a destitute leper,</b> the one who vowed <b>brings the offering of a destitute</b> leper. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> it was <b>a wealthy person who takes the vow</b> to provide the offerings <b>for him?</b> But <b>the Merciful One states: “And if he is poor,</b> and his means do not suffice, then he shall take one sheep” (Leviticus 14:21). This indicates that the specified offering is only for the poor, <b>and</b> in this instance the one taking the vow <b>is not poor.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The mishna is referring specifically to a case <b>where it was a poor person who was taking the vow</b> to provide the offerings <b>for</b> the leper. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what is the basis for this ruling? <b>Perhaps the Merciful One had compassion on him,</b> i.e., the leper, and <b>not on the one taking the vow</b> to provide the offerings <b>for him. As isn’t it written:</b> “And if <b>he</b> is poor”? If so, the leniency that a destitute leper brings less expensive offerings should apply only to an actual leper, and not to one who vows to bring the leper’s offerings, even if he too is poor.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> The next clause in the verse: <b>“And his means do not suffice,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the <b>one taking the vow</b> to provide the offering, i.e., if he too is poor he provides the offering mandated for a destitute leper.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with the answer of Rabbi Yitzḥak: <b>But</b> according to this answer, when <b>a wealthy person takes the vow</b> to provide the offering <b>for him, so too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he brings</b> the offering of the leper brought <b>in</b> a situation of <b>wealth.</b>
<b>If so, what</b> is the meaning of the mishna’s statement that valuations are determined based on the means of the one making the commitment, <b>but with regard to offerings, that is not so?</b> This clause seems to indicate that unlike the previous ruling, where a wealthy person who valuated a destitute individual gives the valuation in accordance with the means of a wealthy person, here it all depends on the means of the one undergoing purification. Therefore, in this case a wealthy person brings the offerings of one who is destitute, contrary to the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak.

Daf 17b

The Gemara explains: The mishna states two different principles with regard to one who vows to provide the offering of a leper on behalf of another. <b>One</b> principle applies <b>to a destitute leper for whom</b> another <b>destitute person takes a vow</b> to provide his offering. In that case, he provides the offering of the destitute. <b>And</b> the <b>one</b> other principle, i.e., the statement that the <i>halakha</i> is different in the case of offerings, serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>a wealthy leper for whom a destitute person takes a vow</b> to provide his offering. In that situation, although the one who took the vow is destitute, he must provide the offering of a wealthy person.
The Gemara explains why this last ruling is necessary. It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> the destitute <b>were included</b> in the verse: “And his means do not suffice,” with regard to the leniency which allows them to bring the offering of the destitute when taking vows to provide for destitute lepers, they should likewise <b>be included</b> in this leniency when providing for all lepers, even wealthy ones. Consequently, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this leniency does not apply when the lepers are wealthy.
Similarly, it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since we find with regard to valuations</b> that <b>a destitute person who valuated a wealthy person gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means of <b>a destitute person,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that in <b>this</b> case, where one takes a vow to provide the offering of a wealthy leper, the <i>halakha</i> <b>is also so.</b> Consequently, <b>the verse states: “And if he is poor,”</b> from which it is derived that the offering of the destitute leper is brought only when the leper himself is destitute.
The Gemara objects: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, this is difficult. <b>As he says</b> in the mishna: <b>I say even with regard to valuations</b> it is <b>so,</b> i.e., that if a wealthy person said: It is incumbent upon me to donate my valuation, and a destitute person heard him and said: It is incumbent upon me to donate that which he said, then the destitute person gives the valuation of a wealthy person. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: We follow the obligation of</b> the original <b>person</b> valuated, even with regard to valuations. <b>And</b> if so, then the reasoning stated in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> does not apply, and therefore <b>a verse is not necessary to exclude</b> a destitute person who takes a vow to provide a wealthy leper’s offering from having the leniency of bringing the offering of a destitute leper. Consequently, when the verse specifies: “And if <b>he</b> is poor,” this serves <b>to exclude what?</b>
The Gemara explains: The verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>a destitute leper for whom a wealthy person takes a vow.</b> In that case, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: We follow the obligation of the</b> original <b>person</b> specified as the subject of the vow, therefore the wealthy person brings only the offering of the destitute leper. Consequently, the exclusion from the verse: “And if he is poor,” <b>teaches us</b> that in this case he brings the offering of a wealthy individual, not that of the destitute leper.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If when one took a vow of valuation <b>he was destitute and he became wealthy,</b> or if <b>he was wealthy and became destitute, he gives the valuation</b> in accordance with the means of <b>a wealthy person. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> not only in a case where one was wealthy either at the time he took the vow or at the time of payment; even if when one took a vow of valuation <b>he was destitute and he became wealthy and again became destitute, he gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means of <b>a wealthy person.</b>
<b>But with regard to</b> the <b>offerings</b> of a leper <b>that is not so,</b> as the offerings that one brings are determined by his status at the time he brings them. <b>Even</b> if it is common knowledge that <b>his father died and left him</b> an inheritance of <b>ten thousand</b> dinars, <b>or</b> that <b>his ship is at sea and</b> merchandise valued at <b>ten thousand</b> dinars <b>is coming into his</b> possession, <b>the Temple</b> treasury <b>has no</b> share <b>in it.</b> His payment is determined solely by his present situation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: If he was <b>destitute</b> when he took the oath <b>and he became wealthy,</b> he gives the valuation appropriate for a wealthy individual. The Gemara explains that this is derived from the verse: “According to <b>the means of him who vowed</b> shall the priest valuate him” (Leviticus 27:8), and in this case he had the means of a wealthy individual when he was ready to give the donation. The mishna further teaches that one who was <b>wealthy and became destitute</b> also gives the valuation as though he was wealthy. The Gemara explains that this is derived from the beginning of the same verse: <b>“According to [<i>al pi</i>] the means</b> of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him.” The phrase <i>al pi</i> serves to emphasize the moment when the person uttered the vow with his mouth [<i>peh</i>], and at that moment he was wealthy.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if one made a valuation when he was <b>destitute and he became wealthy and again became destitute, he gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> according to the means of <b>a wealthy person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “But if he is too poor for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). The word order serves to emphasize “he,” which indicates that he is considered poor <b>only if he</b> remains <b>in his</b> state of <b>poverty from his beginning until his end</b> of involvement with the vow.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the verse similarly states with regard to a destitute leper: <b>“And if he is poor”</b> (Leviticus 14:21), <b>so too,</b> Rabbi Yehuda should maintain that he is considered poor <b>only if he is in his</b> state of <b>poverty from his beginning until his end</b> of bringing the leper’s offering, but if he was wealthy in between he should be obligated to bring the offering of a wealthy individual, even if he is now poor.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:11): With regard to <b>a leper who brought his offerings</b> when he was <b>destitute, and</b> subsequently <b>became wealthy,</b> or he brought his offerings when he was <b>wealthy and</b> then <b>became destitute, everything follows</b> the <b>sin offering</b> that the leper brings. If he was wealthy when he brought the sin offering he brings the burnt offering of a wealthy individual; if he was destitute when he brought the sin offering he brings the burnt offering of a destitute individual. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Everything,</b> i.e., the sin offering and the burnt offering, <b>follows</b> his status at the time the leper’s <b>guilt offering</b> is brought. <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Everything follows</b> the offering of the <b>birds,</b> which are brought by the leper seven days earlier as part of his purification process. Clearly, everyone agrees that one brings the offerings of the destitute even if he is not destitute from the beginning until the end of the process.
The Gemara explains: It <b>was stated with regard to this</b> dispute that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: And</b> all <b>three of these</b> <i>tanna’im</i> <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse,</b> which deals with the destitute leper: “This is the law of him in whom is the mark of leprosy, <b>whose means do not suffice for that which pertains to his purification”</b> (Leviticus 14:32). <b>Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> The individual’s status depends on <b>an item that atones,</b> and <b>what is it?</b> The <b>sin offering.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> His status depends on <b>an item that renders him fit</b> to enter the Temple and eat consecrated food, <b>and what is it?</b> The <b>guilt offering. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds:</b> His status depends on that <b>which causes him ritual purity, and what is it?</b> The sacrificial <b>birds,</b> as the rite of the birds partially purifies him and enables him to bring the rest of his offerings and to complete his purification process. If so, in the particular case of a leper bringing his own offerings, it is a Torah edict that one does not need to be destitute throughout the entire process, which is why, with regard to one who takes a vow to bring the offerings of a leper, Rabbi Yehuda does not derive from the verse: “And if he is poor,” that he is considered poor only if he is in a state of poverty from the beginning, i.e., when he takes the vow, until the end, i.e., when he fulfills it.
<b>But</b> in that case <b>why do I</b> need the exclusion in the verse: “And if <b>he</b> is poor”? The Gemara answers: <b>According to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, it is necessary <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion stated earlier, that it serves to exclude a wealthy individual who vows to provide the offering of a destitute leper, i.e., he must bring the offering of a wealthy individual. <b>And according to the Rabbis,</b> it is necessary <b>in accordance with their</b> opinion, that it serves to exclude a destitute individual who vows to provide the offering of the wealthy leper, and he must bring the offering of a wealthy individual.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the phrase: “And if he is poor,” teaches that one is classified as destitute only if he is destitute from beginning to end, he should similarly derive from a verse that deals with testimony: <b>“And he is a witness,</b> whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1), that this applies <b>only if</b> the witness <b>is fit</b> to testify <b>from his beginning,</b> when he obtained the information about which he is testifying, <b>until his end,</b> when he testifies.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the qualification of a witness, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If someone <b>knew testimony about</b> another <b>before he,</b> the one who knew the testimony, <b>became</b> the other’s <b>son-in-law, and</b> then he <b>became his son-in-law;</b> or when he was <b>able to hear, and</b> then he <b>became a deaf-mute;</b> or when he <b>could see, and</b> he subsequently <b>became blind;</b> or while he was halakhically <b>competent, and</b> he then <b>became an imbecile;</b> in all these cases, <b>he is disqualified</b> from testifying. <b>But</b> if someone <b>knew testimony about</b> another <b>before he became his son-in-law, and</b> he then <b>became his son-in-law,</b>

Daf 18a

<b>and afterward his</b> wife, who was the <b>daughter</b> of the father-in-law, <b>died,</b> which means that the witness is no longer related to the party involved; or when he was <b>able to hear, and</b> then <b>became a deaf-mute, and again became able to hear;</b> or when he <b>could see, and</b> subsequently <b>became blind, and afterward could see</b> again; or when he was halakhically <b>competent, and</b> then <b>became an imbecile, and again became</b> halakhically <b>competent;</b> in all these cases he is <b>fit</b> to testify.<b>This is the principle: Any</b> individual <b>whose beginning and end</b> is <b>in</b> a state of <b>qualification</b> to serve as a witness is <b>qualified</b> to testify, even if he was unfit in the interim. Evidently, it is not derived from the verse: “And he is a witness,” that the witness must be fit from the beginning to the end.
The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different there,</b> with regard to testimony, <b>as the verse states:</b> “He is a witness, <b>whether he has seen</b>…<b>if he does not utter”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). This formulation indicates that <b>the Merciful One renders the matter</b> of testimony <b>dependent on seeing and recounting</b> the content of his testimony. <b>And</b> in this instance <b>there is</b> both valid seeing and valid recounting, despite the fact that the witness was disqualified in the interim. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the exclusion of the verse: <b>“And he</b> is a witness”?
The Gemara answers: The limiting clause is necessary <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If someone <b>saw a crowd of people standing, and his witnesses</b> were <b>among them, and he said: I</b> hereby <b>administer an oath to you, if you know any testimony</b> relating <b>to me, that you will come and testify for me,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this form of address suffices to single out the witnesses. This would mean that if the witnesses take a false oath that they do not know testimony with regard to the person who addressed them, they <b>would be obligated</b> to bring an offering of an oath of testimony. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he is a witness,”</b> to emphasize that the offering applies only to one who is singled out as a witness, <b>and</b> in this case the individual <b>did not single out his witnesses,</b> as he addressed a whole crowd of people. Consequently, the witnesses are exempt.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if this individual <b>said</b> to the crowd: I adjure <b>whoever</b> knows testimony relating to me that he will come and testify for me, that even in the case of this more specific address the witnesses are likewise exempt from the offering of an oath of testimony. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he is a witness,” and</b> by clarifying his appeal the individual <b>did single out his witnesses.</b> Consequently, in this situation the witnesses would be obligated to bring the offering.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But with regard to</b> the <b>offerings</b> of a leper <b>that is not so.</b> If the leper is destitute, even if his father died and left him ten thousand dinars, the Temple treasury has no share in it. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If his father</b> already <b>died and left him ten thousand</b> dinars, <b>he is wealthy.</b> How could he be considered destitute at all? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that one should <b>say</b> instead: His father is dying and <b>leaving him ten thousand</b> dinars, but he has not yet died.
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: If so, it is <b>obvious</b> that with regard to the Temple treasury he remains destitute, as at the time he is in fact destitute. The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> was stated with regard to a case <b>where his father is moribund. Lest you say</b> that as <b>the majority of moribund</b> people proceed <b>to die</b> the son should be considered wealthy even before the father dies, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the son retains his status as destitute until the father actually dies.
The mishna likewise teaches: If <b>his ship is at sea and</b> merchandise valued at <b>ten thousand</b> dinars <b>is coming into his</b> possession, this money is not taken into consideration by the Temple treasury. The Gemara asks: But isn’t <b>he wealthy? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case where his ship <b>was leased or rented to others,</b> and therefore the merchandise it contains belongs to someone else. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the <b>rent</b> money that will be paid to the leper? The Gemara answers: <b>Rent is paid only at the end</b> of the rental period, which means that the owner is destitute in the meantime.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But let</b> the mishna <b>derive</b> and determine that the leper is wealthy <b>due to</b> the fact that he owns <b>a ship.</b> The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> statement in the mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who maintains that with regard to determining one’s obligation to bring an offering as a wealthy or destitute individual, the property that he uses for business is not taken into account. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (23b): When someone’s property is repossessed in order to pay his debt to the Temple treasury, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If he was a farmer,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him</b> permission to keep <b>his pair</b> of oxen with which he plows the field. If he was <b>a donkey driver,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him</b> permission to keep <b>his donkey.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The sum fixed by the Torah based on <b>the years</b> of age is <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the vow; how</b> so? <b>A youth who valuated an elder gives the valuation of an elder, and an elder who valuated a youth gives the valuation of a youth. And the</b> distinction based on sex that is written in the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations</b> is stated <b>with regard to the one valuated; how</b> so? <b>A man who valuated a woman gives the valuation of a woman, and a woman who valuated a man gives the valuation of a man.</b>
<b>And the</b> different <b>valuation</b> based on the age of the one valuated is determined <b>at the time</b> one takes <b>the</b> vow of <b>valuation; how</b> so? If <b>one valuated</b> another when he was <b>less than five years old,</b> when his valuation is five shekels, <b>and</b> before payment to the Temple treasury the subject of the vow <b>became more than five years old,</b> when his valuation is ten shekels; or if <b>one valuated</b> another when he was <b>less than twenty years old,</b> when his valuation is ten shekels, <b>and</b> before payment to the Temple treasury the subject of the vow <b>became more than twenty years old,</b> when his valuation is fifty shekels, in all these cases <b>he gives</b> payment according to the age of the subject of the valuation <b>at the time of the valuation.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna: And the valuation is determined at the time one takes the vow of valuation, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>You</b> have <b>compared</b> pledges of <b>assessments</b> for the Temple treasury, i.e., one who takes a vow to donate a certain person’s assessment, <b>to</b> vows of <b>valuations.</b> This comparison applies with regard to <b>a pearl</b> belonging <b>to light</b> people, i.e., the poor. In other words, just as the assessment of a pearl is determined by the pearl’s location in a village of the poor rather than by the potential price of the pearl in the city market, so too, the valuation of a person is determined at the time of the valuation. <b>And</b> similarly, the comparison teaches that the court is required <b>to assess</b> the value of the limb <b>by its significance,</b> i.e., in the case of a limb that is vital to one’s survival, the valuation of the limb is equivalent to the valuation of the whole person.
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we should compare valuations to assessments</b> in <b>that</b> the one pledging must <b>give</b> a person’s valuation not corresponding to his value at the time of the pledge but <b>in accordance with</b> his value at <b>the time of giving,</b> as is the case with regard to vows of assessments. To counter this suggestion <b>the verse states: “According to your valuation it shall stand”</b> (Leviticus 27:17), which teaches that the one making the valuation <b>gives</b> his donation <b>only</b> according to the valuation of the person <b>at the time of the valuation,</b> as stated in the mishna.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Torah provides three age categories that determine the amount of the valuation: From the age of one month until age five, from age five until age twenty, and from age twenty until age sixty. For anyone less than one month old there is no valuation. The halakhic status of the <b>thirtieth day</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> thirty days, and therefore the one who took the vow is exempt. Likewise, the halakhic status of the <b>fifth year and</b> the <b>twentieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding them. As it is stated: “And if it is from sixty years old and upward”</b> (Leviticus 27:7), and <b>we derive all</b> the other age categories <b>from</b> the <b>sixtieth year: Just as</b> the halakhic status of the <b>sixtieth year,</b> where upward is written, is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding it, so too,</b> the halakhic status of the <b>fifth year and</b> the <b>twentieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding them.</b>
The mishna asks: Is that <b>so?</b> Can one derive a <i>halakha</i> in this manner? <b>If</b> the Torah <b>rendered</b> the halakhic status of the <b>sixtieth year like</b> that of the period <b>preceding it</b> in order <b>to be stringent</b> and require one who valuated a sixty-year-old person to pay his valuation to the Temple treasury, <b>shall we render</b> the halakhic status of the <b>fifth year and</b> the <b>twentieth year like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> them in order <b>to be lenient</b> and pay a lower sum?
Therefore, <b>the verse states “year”</b> with regard to the fifth and twentieth years (see Leviticus 27:3–6), and <b>“year”</b> with regard to the sixtieth year (Leviticus 27:7), <b>for a verbal analogy. Just as</b> the halakhic status of the <b>year stated with regard to</b> the <b>sixtieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> it, <b>so too,</b> the halakhic status of the <b>year stated with regard to</b> the <b>fifth year and</b> the <b>twentieth year</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> them, <b>both</b> in order <b>to be lenient and</b> in order <b>to be stringent. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Their halakhic status remains like that of the period preceding it, <b>until they will be</b> aged one <b>month and one day beyond the</b> fifth, twentieth, and sixtieth <b>years.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara notes: Evidently, the verbal analogy in the mishna is <b>free,</b> i.e., in each verse the word “year” is superfluous, and therefore can be used in the verbal analogy. This means that the <i>halakha</i> derived from the verbal analogy is considered as though it is written explicitly in the Torah. The significance of this fact is <b>that if</b> a verbal analogy <b>is not free,</b> it <b>can be refuted</b> by logical reasoning. In this case the refutation would be <b>as we refuted it</b> in the mishna, that if the fifth year and the twentieth year are considered the same as the respective periods preceding them, this generates a leniency. The Gemara confirms: The verbal analogy is free, as both the first <b>written</b> mention of <b>“year”</b> and the second written mention of <b>“year” are superfluous.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as, if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>doesn’t he say</b> that the word <b>“until”</b> means <b>until and including?</b> With regard to valuations, the Torah states: “From twenty years old until sixty years old…And if it is from five years old until twenty years old…And if it is from one month old until five years old” (Leviticus 27:3–6). Accordingly, in the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi there should be no need for a verbal analogy to include the fifth year and the twentieth year in the periods preceding them.
The Gemara provides the source of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the festival of Passover: The verse states: “For whoever eats leavened bread <b>from the first day until the seventh day”</b> (Exodus 12:15). One <b>might</b> have thought that the prohibition against eating leaven applies from the <b>first</b> day and onward <b>but</b> the <b>first</b> day <b>is not included,</b> and likewise that the prohibition continues until the <b>seventh</b> day <b>but</b> the <b>seventh</b> day <b>is not included.</b>

Daf 18b

This is <b>similar to the matter that is stated</b> with regard to a leper: “And the leprosy covers all the skin of him who has the mark <b>from his head to his feet,</b> as far as the priest can see…it is all turned white: He is pure” (Leviticus 13:12–13). This verse is understood as follows: The mark reaches from <b>his head, but his head is not included;</b> it reaches to <b>his feet, but his feet are not included.</b> Therefore, one might have thought the prohibition against consuming leaven on the festival of Passover likewise does not apply to the endpoints mentioned in the verse.
Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall eat unleavened bread, <b>until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening”</b> (Exodus 12:18). This proves that the seventh day of the Festival is included. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is not necessary</b> to cite this verse, as the prohibition against consuming leaven is from the <b>first</b> day of Passover, <b>and</b> the <b>first</b> day <b>is included;</b> and the ban continues until the <b>seventh</b> day, <b>and</b> the <b>seventh</b> day <b>is included.</b> Accordingly, with regard to valuations, even without a verbal analogy Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi should maintain that the twentieth year is included in the preceding period.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the opinion in the mishna is in accordance with that of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>the verses offset each other,</b> and therefore their meaning is unclear without the verbal analogy. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Since it is written: “From one month old until five years old”</b> (Leviticus 27:6), this ostensibly includes the fifth year within the stated category. If so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this</b> mention of five years <b>as well:</b> “And if it is <b>from five years old until twenty years old,</b> then your valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels” (Leviticus 27:5)? <b>Therefore,</b> with regard to the fifth year, as both verses mention that year, <b>the</b> verses <b>offset each other.</b> Consequently, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the verbal analogy is necessary.
<b>The Master said</b> above, with regard to a leper: The mark reaches from <b>his head, but his head is not included;</b> it reaches to <b>his feet, but his feet are not included.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this interpretation? <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is deduced logically: The <b>signs</b> of leprosy <b>of his body are different from</b> the <b>signs</b> of leprosy <b>of his head</b> with regard to the different colors of hair that indicate leprosy. Alternatively, <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived from the phrase in that verse: <b>“As far as the priest can see.”</b> This excludes a leprous mark on the head, which is obscured from the priest’s view by the hair, as well as leprous marks between the toes.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Their halakhic status remains like that of the period preceding it, <b>until they will be</b> aged one <b>month and one day beyond the</b> respective <b>years.</b> With regard to this opinion, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to valuations, <b>“upward”</b> (Leviticus 27:7), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the census of the Levites in the wilderness: “From <b>one month old and upward</b> you shall number them” (Numbers 3:15). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the census, the verse means: <b>From one month and one day old, so too here,</b> with regard to valuations, the verse means that each respective category is counted <b>from</b> one <b>month and one day old</b> beyond the stated ages of five years, twenty years, or sixty years.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer <b>say</b> that the verse dealing with valuation should be understood <b>like</b> the verse written <b>there,</b> with regard to the census, in the following manner: <b>Just as there</b> it is <b>one day</b> more than the enumerated age of thirty days, <b>so too here,</b> it should be <b>one day</b> more than the enumerated ages of five years, twenty years, and sixty years. Why does Rabbi Eliezer add a month? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that only one day should be added, <b>what purpose does</b> this <b>verbal analogy</b> from the census <b>serve?</b> Even without any connection to the verse dealing with the census, it would be understood in the case of valuations that the new period begins from the day after the respective year is fully completed.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the period of one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., “sheep in their first year” (Numbers 28:3); and the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities,</b> during which time it is permitted to redeem a sold house in a walled city (Leviticus 25:29); and the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> during which one may not yet redeem an ancestral field he has sold (Leviticus 25:15); <b>and</b> the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> (Exodus 21:2); <b>and similarly,</b> the years stated <b>with regard to a son and with regard to a daughter,</b> as explained below; <b>all of</b> these are calculated <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the start of the period <b>to</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the end of the period, i.e., these periods are units of whole years; they do not expire on predetermined dates, such as at the end of the calendar year.
The Gemara asks: With regard to the one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it is calculated by whole years rather than calendar years? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> that <b>the verse states: “A sheep in its first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). Since the verse does not state: A sheep in the first year, it means <b>a year</b> based on the calculation of <b>its</b> own life, <b>and not</b> a year based <b>on the counting of the world,</b> i.e., the calendar year.
The Gemara continues clarifying the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities</b> is calculated by a whole year and not a calendar year is derived from the fact <b>that it is written:</b> “Then he may redeem it <b>within a whole year after it is sold,</b> for a full year he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). The verse is referring to a year counted from the day <b>of its</b> own <b>sale, and not</b> the <b>year of the counting of the world.</b>
The Gemara states: Concerning the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> this is derived from the fact <b>that it is written: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form of both “years” and “crops” indicates that the number of years does not necessarily correspond to the quantity of crops. Consequently, there are <b>times when a person</b> might <b>eat three</b> yields of <b>crops in two years.</b> If one purchased a field at the end of the calendar year when its yield had not yet been harvested, and he harvested that yield and subsequently grew and harvested two more crops before the completion of two whole years from the sale, he would have eaten three yields in less than two years. This is not possible if one follows the calendar years, as a new year would start soon after the purchase.
The Gemara states: The <i>halakha</i> that the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> is calculated by whole years, not calendar years, is derived from the fact <b>that it is written: “Six years he shall work; and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). The word “and” in the phrase: “And in the seventh,” teaches that <b>sometimes</b> it turns out <b>that he shall also work</b> in the seventh calendar year, if six full years have not passed from when he was sold. For example, if he was sold in the month of Nisan, although five years and six months have passed when Tishrei, the first month of the seventh year, arrives, since he has not yet completed six years of service he must work in this seventh calendar year as well, until the day of the month in which he was sold.
The <i>baraita</i> also teaches: The years stated <b>with regard to a son and with regard to a daughter</b> are among these terms calculated from the time at the start of the period to the time at the end of the period. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: With regard to valuations,</b> i.e., that the age of a valuated male or female is calculated in whole years from the date of their birth, not by calendar years. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> the matters taught in the fifth <b>chapter of</b> tractate <i>Nidda</i>, which is called after its opening words: <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>,</b> i.e., an animal born by caesarean section. In other words, when a mishna in that chapter, which deals with various matters related to the ages of sons and daughters, mentions years, it means full years, even when it does not state this explicitly.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Do you</b> and Rav <b>dispute</b> this matter, i.e., when you apply the mention of a son and a daughter to different cases, do each of you reject the opinion of the other? Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>No,</b> we do not disagree; <b>I said one</b> matter <b>and he said one</b> different matter. The Gemara adds: <b>This too stands to reason, as if it enters your mind</b> that they <b>disagree</b> on this matter, then with regard to <b>the one who says</b> full years are required <b>for</b> determining <b>valuations,</b> does he <b>not</b> also <b>say</b> that full years are used <b>for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>? But doesn’t Rav say,</b> like Rav Yosef, that <b>the <i>halakha</i> in</b> that <b>entire chapter</b> is that the ages of the sons and daughters are determined <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> at the start of the period <b>to</b> the <b>time</b> at the end of the period, not by calendar years?
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the case, then <b>according to the one who says</b> that the reference to full years mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>for</b> determining <b>valuations,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>what is the reason</b> he <b>did not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav would claim that the years of a son and a daughter in the <i>baraita</i> are <b>similar to these</b> other cases mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> those numbers of years <b>are</b> explicitly <b>written</b> in the Torah, <b>so too these</b> years of the sons and daughters are referring to matters <b>where</b> the years <b>are written</b> in the Torah, i.e., the years of valuations, unlike the topics discussed in <i>Yotze Dofen</i>, where the years are not mentioned expressly in the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> Rav Yosef, how would he respond to this contention? He would maintain that <b>if it enters your mind</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the years of valuations, <b>which are written</b> in the Torah, then <b>this</b> phrase in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a son and with regard to a daughter,</b> is unsuitable.

Daf 19a

Rather, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated: <b>With regard to the male and with regard to the female,</b> which are the terms the Torah uses with regard to valuations. The terms son and daughter are used in <i>Yotze Dofen</i>.
With regard to valuations, the Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> with regard to <b>a female, that when she ages</b> past sixty years she <b>stands at</b> a valuation of ten shekels, <b>one-third</b> of her previous valuation of thirty shekels, <b>and what is different</b> with regard to <b>a male, that</b> when he ages past sixty, at which point he has a valuation of fifteen shekels, he does not <b>stand at</b> even <b>one-third</b> of his previous valuation of fifty shekels? <b>Ḥizkiya said</b> that <b>people say</b> a popular saying: If there is <b>an elderly man in the home,</b> there is <b>a burden [<i>paḥa</i>] in the home,</b> as he does not help with anything; if there is <b>an elderly woman in the home,</b> there is <b>a treasure in the home,</b>as she assists with various domestic labors.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my weight, gives his weight</b> to the Temple treasury; <b>if</b> he specified <b>silver</b> he donates <b>silver, and if</b> he specified <b>gold</b> he donates <b>gold.</b> There was <b>an incident involving the mother of Yirmatya, who said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my daughter, and she ascended to Jerusalem and paid her</b> daughter’s <b>weight</b> in <b>gold</b> to the Temple treasury.
In the case of one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my forearm,</b> how does he ascertain the weight of his forearm? <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He fills a barrel</b> with <b>water and inserts</b> his arm <b>up to his elbow</b> into the water. <b>And</b> in order to measure the displacement, <b>he weighs donkey flesh, and bones, and sinews and places</b> it <b>into</b> the barrel <b>until it fills,</b> and the water level reaches the top of the barrel. He then donates the weight of the meat and the bones to the Temple treasury. <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> Displacement is according to volume not according to weight, <b>and how then is it possible to match</b> the amount of the donkey <b>flesh with the flesh</b> of a person <b>and</b> the volume of the donkey’s <b>bones with</b> his <b>bones? Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises how much the forearm is likely to weigh.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the meaning of the mishna’s statement: <b>If silver, silver,</b> and <b>if gold, gold? Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one specified</b> that he vows to donate his weight in <b>silver</b> he donates <b>silver,</b> and if <b>he specified gold</b> he donates <b>gold.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching us: The reason</b> he donates silver or gold is <b>that he specified</b> silver or gold, from which it may be inferred that if <b>he did not specify</b> the means of payment, he may <b>exempt himself with any</b> material.
The Gemara adds: And this is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement of <b>Raḥava, as Raḥava says: In a place where</b> merchants <b>weigh pitch</b> when selling it, one who vows his weight <b>may exempt himself</b> by donating his weight <b>even in pitch.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the statement of Raḥava is <b>necessary</b> in a place <b>where there are</b> merchants <b>who weigh</b> pitch <b>and there are</b> others who <b>measure</b> its volume. <b>Lest you say: Since not all</b> merchants <b>weigh</b> pitch one may <b>not</b> fulfill his vow by donating his weight in pitch, Raḥava <b>teaches us</b> that as there are merchants there who sell pitch by weight, one can fulfill his vow in that manner.
<b>Rav Pappa says: In a place where</b> merchants <b>weigh onions</b> when selling them, one who vowed his weight <b>may exempt himself</b> by donating his weight <b>even in onions.</b> The Gemara again asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the statement of Rav Pappa is <b>necessary</b> in a place <b>where after they weigh</b> the onions the merchants <b>throw</b> in <b>two</b> or <b>three</b> extra onions to the buyer. <b>Lest you say</b> that its <b>status</b> as a place where onions are sold by <b>weight</b> is <b>void</b> due to the additional onions, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that it is still considered a place where onions are sold by weight.
§ The mishna teaches: There was <b>an incident involving the mother of Yirmatya,</b> who said: It is incumbent upon me to donate the weight of my daughter, without specifying silver or gold, and she ascended to Jerusalem and paid her daughter’s weight in gold to the Temple treasury. The Gemara asks: Was <b>an incident</b> cited <b>to contradict</b> the previous ruling of the mishna? The mishna had stated: If silver, silver, and if gold, gold, which indicates that if one did not specify the means of payment he may exempt himself with any material that merchants sell by weight, whereas it can be inferred from the incident that one must pay the weight in gold.
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: And if</b> the one who vowed <b>is a distinguished person, even though he did not specify</b> silver or gold <b>we say</b> he must fulfill his vow <b>in keeping with his</b> socioeconomic <b>status. And</b> likewise, there was <b>an incident involving the mother of Yirmatya,</b> a very wealthy woman, <b>who said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the weight of my daughter, and she ascended to Jerusalem and gave her</b> daughter’s <b>weight</b> in <b>gold</b> to the Temple treasury.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my height, gives</b> a thick <b>rod that cannot be bent</b> equivalent to his height. One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my full height,</b> may <b>give</b> even a thin <b>rod that</b> can be <b>bent,</b> provided it is equivalent to his height. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): With regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my height,</b> or: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my full height, he gives</b> a thick <b>rod that cannot be bent</b> and that is equivalent to his height.
The Gemara answers: Rav Yehuda <b>says</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who</b> holds that one can <b>draw an inference</b> from <b>superfluous language. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 64a): If one sold his house without specification, he has sold <b>neither the pit nor the cistern [<i>dut</i>]</b> with it, <b>even if he wrote</b> in the document of sale: With <b>its depth and its height.</b> This is because anything that is ancillary to the house, e.g., pits and cisterns, must be mentioned explicitly in the contract. <b>And</b> the seller <b>must purchase for himself a path</b> through to the pit or cistern that he kept back, as he sold his rights to the area surrounding the house along with the house, and therefore he may no longer walk through that area. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: He need not</b> purchase a path, as the seller clearly did not intend to keep the pit or cistern without maintaining access to it. <b>And Rabbi Akiva concedes</b> that <b>when</b> the seller <b>states to</b> the buyer in the document of sale: <b>Excluding these,</b> the pit and the cistern, <b>that he need not purchase for himself a path</b> through to the pit or cistern. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s reasoning is that <b>since</b> the seller <b>need not</b> specify that the pit and cistern are excluded from the sale, <b>and</b> yet <b>he says</b> that they were excluded, <b>he is coming</b> with this statement <b>to add an element</b> to the agreement, i.e., the right of access. <b>Here too,</b> when one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate my full height, <b>since</b> it is a case where <b>he need not</b> add the word full, <b>and</b> yet <b>he says</b> it, <b>he is coming to add an element</b> to his vow, i.e., the ability to exempt himself with a thin rod.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages. If one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>my stature, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

Daf 19b

If one vowed that it is incumbent upon him to donate <b>his width, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Likewise, if one vowed to donate <b>his sitting, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he referred to <b>his thickness, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Finally, if he spoke of <b>his girth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara states that these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that there is a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei concerning one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my forearm,</b> as to how he ascertains the weight of his forearm. <b>The Sages taught</b> this dispute in greater detail in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:2): With regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my forearm, and</b> with regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my leg, Rabbi Yehuda says: He brings a barrel and fills</b> it with <b>water, and</b> he <b>inserts</b> his <b>forearm up to the elbow or</b> his <b>leg up to the knee,</b> into the water.
<b>And</b> in order to measure the displacement, <b>he weighs donkey flesh, sinews, and bones, and places</b> it <b>into the barrel until it fills,</b> and the water reaches the same level as it was when his arm or leg was inserted. <b>And even though there is no proof for the matter,</b> that donkey flesh weighs the same as human flesh, nevertheless there is <b>an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “Whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20).
<b>Rabbi Yosei said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: Displacement is according to volume, not according to weight, and <b>how</b> then <b>is it possible to match</b> the amount of the donkey <b>flesh with the flesh</b> in one’s forearm, <b>the sinews with the sinews, and the bones with the bones? Rabbi Yehuda said to him:</b> One <b>estimates. Rabbi Yosei said to him: If one estimates, let one estimate</b> the weight of <b>the forearm</b> directly. <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to Rabbi Yosei? Rabbi Yehuda holds that <b>we do whatever is possible</b> in order to be more precise.
The <i>Tosefta</i> teaches with regard to one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the weight of my forearm [<i>yad</i>], that Rabbi Yehuda says: He brings a barrel and fills it with water and inserts his <b>forearm up to the elbow.</b> This indicates that the term <i>yad</i> denotes the forearm until the elbow. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Yadayim</i> 2:1): Since it is written: “And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands [<i>yedeihem</i>] and their feet” (Exodus 30:19), the priests are obligated to <b>sanctify</b> their <b>hands and feet in the Temple up to the wrist.</b>
The Gemara answers: The term <i>yad</i> written <b>in the Torah</b> indicates <b>up to the wrist,</b> but <b>with regard to vows</b> one <b>follows</b> the ordinary <b>language of people,</b> in which the word <i>yad</i> is referring to the forearm until the elbow. Consequently, the vow is interpreted in this manner. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does the word <i>yad</i> that is written <b>in the Torah</b> mean <b>up to the wrist? But with regard to phylacteries it is written:</b> “And it shall be for a sign to you upon <b>your hand [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:9), <b>and the school of Menashe taught: <i>Yadkha</i>; this</b> is referring to the bulge of the <b>biceps [<i>kibborit</i>]</b> on the upper arm.
The Gemara answers: Generally, the term <i>yad</i> that is written <b>in the Torah</b> includes the <b>entire biceps</b> area of the upper arm. But <b>with regard to vows</b> one <b>follows</b> the ordinary <b>language of people,</b> in which the word <i>yad</i> means the forearm until the elbow; <b>and</b> with regard to <b>sanctifying the hands and feet in the Temple</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is learned</b> as a tradition that the word <i>yad</i> is referring only to the hand up to the wrist.
It is further taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited above: His <b>leg [<i>regel</i>] until the knee,</b> which indicates that the term <i>regel</i> is defined as the foot until the knee. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: It is written in the Torah with regard to the obligation to ascend to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage Festivals: “Three <b>times [<i>regalim</i>]</b> you shall keep a feast for Me in the year” (Exodus 23:14). The term <i>regalim</i>, legs, serves to <b>exclude people with artificial legs [<i>ba’alei kabbayin</i>]</b> from this obligation. According to the <i>baraita</i>, one who has a stump in place of his foot is exempt from the pilgrimage. This indicates the term <i>regel</i> is referring to the foot, up to the ankle, not to the entire area below the knee.
The Gemara explains: The term <i>regel</i> that is written in the Torah is referring to the foot below the ankle, but <b>with regard to vows,</b> one <b>follows</b> the ordinary <b>language of people,</b> in which the word <i>regel</i> means the leg until the knee. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <i>regel</i> written <b>in the Torah</b> mean the foot up to the ankle, and therefore it serves to <b>exclude people with artificial legs?</b>
<b>But with regard to the ritual by which the <i>yavam</i> frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>], it is written:</b> “Then his brother’s wife shall approach…and loose his shoe from upon <b>his foot [<i>raglo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>and the Sages taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 101a): In the case of a <i>yavam</i> who was missing part of his leg, if the <i>yevama</i> <b>performed the <i>ḥalitza</i></b> on any part of the leg <b>from the knee and below her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid.</b> This indicates that the term <i>regel</i> in the Torah means the leg from the foot up to the knee.
The Gemara answers: The term <i>regel</i> in the Torah actually is referring to the foot, below the ankle, and it <b>is different there,</b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as the verse states: From upon his foot [<i>raglo</i>],</b> instead of simply stating: From his foot. This indicates that the area that is upon, i.e., above, the foot is also valid for the performance of <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then if the <i>yevama</i> performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>above the knee</b> it should <b>also</b> be valid. The Gemara answers that it is written: <b>From upon,</b> to include only the section directly above the foot, i.e., until the knee, <b>and</b> the area above the knee is considered <b>from upon that</b> area <b>that is from upon</b> the foot.
<b>Rav Pappa said: Conclude from</b> this discussion that <b>the ankle</b> bone <b>[<i>istaveira</i>] descends to the ground</b> and is not separated from the foot. The reason is <b>that if it enters your mind</b> to say it is <b>separated, then the ankle</b> bone is the section of the leg referred to by the phrase: <b>From upon</b> his foot, and the lower <b>leg,</b> i.e., the section of the leg from the ankle up to the knee, is the section of the leg that is called: <b>From upon</b> that <b>which</b> is <b>from upon</b> the foot, and would therefore be invalid for the performance of <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>Rav Ashi says: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> the ankle is <b>separated</b> from the foot it would still not be referred to as the section that is upon the foot, as <b>anything that is adjacent to the foot is considered like the foot,</b> i.e., it is part of the same section of the leg as the foot.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one vows: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>assessment of my forearm,</b> the court <b>appraises him</b> to determine <b>how much he is worth with a forearm and</b> how much he is worth <b>without a forearm,</b> and he pays the difference. <b>This is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that is more <b>stringent with regard to vows</b> of assessment <b>than with regard to valuations,</b> as one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the valuation of my forearm, is exempt from paying.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>How do we assess him? Rava said:</b> The court <b>assesses him</b> by means of the same process of <b>assessment</b> used with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of damages.</b> If one’s hand was severed, the court considers the injured party as though he is a slave being sold in the slave market and appraises how much he was worth before the injury and how much he is worth after the injury. The difference between these two sums is the amount that the guilty party must pay for damages.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Are these</b> two assessments <b>comparable? There,</b> with regard to damages, <b>the person has depreciated</b> in value because his hand was severed, and therefore the decline in the assessment is greater for someone with a severed hand than for someone who merely lacks the utility of his hand. <b>Here,</b> with regard to one who vowed to donate the assessment of his forearm, <b>the person</b> himself <b>has good</b> value, as his hand is intact, and if the assessment used with regard to damages is applied to him he would be obligated to pay more than that which he vowed.
Rather, <b>Abaye said: One assesses how much</b> less <b>a person is willing to pay for a slave who works with one hand than for</b> a slave <b>who works with two hands.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the case of a slave who works with <b>one hand?</b> Isn’t this a situation where <b>the other</b> hand <b>is severed?</b> If so, then <b>this</b> assessment is identical to <b>that</b> which Rava proposed. <b>Rather,</b> one assesses how much more a person is willing to pay for a slave who belongs exclusively to him than for a case where it is <b>written</b> in his bill of sale <b>that</b> his <b>first owner</b> reserves ownership of one <b>hand</b> of the slave.
§ The mishna in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 2a states that the valuation of a person for the purpose of a vow must be performed by nine judges and one priest. By contrast, the valuation of someone for the purpose of damages is performed by three judges. With this in mind <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one was damaged by another and the court <b>assesses him</b> by the <b>assessment of damages,</b> i.e., with three judges, <b>and</b> then <b>he says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does</b> one <b>say</b> that as his assessment was already <b>assessed one time</b> for damages, this is the amount he must donate? <b>Or perhaps an assessment</b> performed <b>by ten is different from an assessment</b> performed <b>by three,</b> and therefore it is necessary to repeat the assessment with ten judges.
<b>If you say an assessment</b> performed <b>by ten is different from an assessment</b> performed <b>by three,</b> then in a case where one <b>says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me, and</b> the court <b>assessed him, and</b> then <b>he again says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>here he was certainly assessed by ten</b> and there is no need for another assessment, <b>or perhaps</b> there is a concern that <b>in the interim</b> there might have been <b>an enhancement</b> in his assessment?
Furthermore, if you say in that case there is a concern that in the interim his assessment might have increased and it is therefore necessary to assess him a second time, then with regard to one who <b>says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me, and</b> the court <b>did not</b> yet <b>assess him, and</b> then before the court assesses him <b>he again says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>here certainly</b>

Daf 20a

<b>we assess him once</b> and he donates twice the value of that single assessment, <b>or perhaps since he vowed sequentially we assess him twice?</b>
<b>And if you say</b> in that case that <b>since he vowed sequentially we assess him twice,</b> if <b>he says at the same time: My assessment</b> is <b>twice</b> incumbent <b>upon me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>here certainly he vowed at the same time,</b> and therefore <b>we assess him once, or perhaps since he says</b> the word: <b>Twice, it is</b> considered <b>as though</b> he vowed <b>sequentially</b> and therefore he must be assessed twice?
Finally, <b>if you say</b> that <b>since he says</b> the word: <b>Twice, it is</b> considered <b>as though</b> he vowed <b>sequentially</b> and he must be assessed twice, if a court of ten <b>assessed him on its own,</b>i.e., not for the purpose of assessing a vow, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say that</b> he has already been <b>assessed on his own and</b> now <b>stands</b> before us, and therefore there is no need for another assessment, <b>or perhaps we require an assessment</b> to be performed <b>with intent</b> for the sake of consecration to the Temple treasury.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna below: In the case of one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my assessment, and</b> then <b>dies,</b> his <b>heirs</b> need <b>not give</b> his assessment to the Temple treasury, <b>as there is no monetary</b> value <b>for the dead,</b> and his assessment at the time of his vow is unknown.
The Gemara explains the resolution: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that in a case where a court of ten <b>assessed him on its own it is</b> a valid <b>assessment</b> with regard to his vow, why does the mishna state that his heirs do not have to donate to the Temple treasury? <b>Isn’t he</b> considered as <b>standing assessed</b> from the outset, as <b>is there a person who is not worth</b> at least <b>four <i>zuz</i>?</b> This proves that an assessment is required to be performed with intent for the sake of consecration to the Temple treasury.
The Gemara rejects this resolution: In a case where a court of ten <b>assessed him on its own</b> before he took his vow, <b>he has entered into an assessment,</b> i.e., an assessment has actually been performed. By contrast, in the case of one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my assessment,</b> and then dies, <b>he has not entered into an assessment,</b> i.e., no actual assessment has been conducted at all.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> that are more <b>stringent with regard to valuations than with regard to vows</b> of assessment. <b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation, and</b> then <b>dies,</b> his <b>heirs must give</b> his valuation to the Temple treasury. But one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my assessment, and</b> then <b>dies,</b> his <b>heirs</b> need <b>not give</b> his assessment to the Temple treasury, <b>as there is no monetary</b> value <b>for the dead.</b>
One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the valuation of my forearm, or: The valuation of my leg, has not said anything,</b> as there are valuations in the Torah only for a complete person. But if one says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the valuation of my head, or: The valuation of my liver, he gives the valuation of his entire</b> self. <b>This is the principle:</b> One who valuates <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent,</b> i.e., without which one will die, <b>gives the valuation of his entire</b> self.
One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my valuation, gives half of his valuation.</b> But one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the valuation of half of me, gives the valuation of his entire</b> self. Likewise, one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my assessment, gives half of his assessment;</b> one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the assessment of half of me, gives the assessment of his entire</b> self. <b>This is the principle:</b> One who takes a vow with regard to <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent gives the assessment of his entire</b> self.
With regard to <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the valuation of so-and-so,</b> and both <b>the one who vowed and the object of the vow die,</b> the <b>heirs</b> of the one who vowed <b>must give</b> the valuation of the object of the vow to the Temple treasury. With regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the assessment of so-and-so, and the one who vowed dies,</b> his <b>heirs must give</b> his assessment to the Temple treasury. If <b>the object of the vow dies,</b> the <b>heirs</b> of the one who vowed need <b>not give</b> his assessment to the Temple treasury, <b>as there is no monetary</b> value <b>for the dead.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are <i>halakhot</i> that are more <b>stringent with regard to vows</b> of assessment <b>than with regard to valuations, as vows</b> of assessment <b>take effect with regard to a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, and a bird.</b> If one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the assessment of this bird, he must donate that assessment. This is not the case with regard to valuations, as they do not take effect with regard to animals and birds. <b>And</b> another <i>halakha</i> that is more stringent with regard to vows of assessment than with regard to valuations is that the destitute who take vows of assessment <b>are not assessed based on affordability. This is not the case with regard to valuations,</b> which are assessed based on whether the one who vows can afford to pay what they vowed.
There is a <i>halakha</i> that is more <b>stringent with regard to valuations than with regard to vows</b> of assessment. <b>How so?</b> In the case of one who <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation, and dies,</b> his <b>heirs must give</b> his valuation to the Temple treasury. But one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my assessment, and dies,</b> his <b>heirs</b> need <b>not give</b> his assessment to the Temple treasury, <b>as there is no monetary</b> value <b>for the dead.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> taught with regard to a person who <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation, and dies,</b> that his <b>heirs must give</b> his valuation to the Temple treasury. The Gemara suggests one can <b>conclude from</b> this ruling that <b>one collects a loan by oral agreement from the heirs,</b> as no promissory note was written with regard to this obligation. The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>Here</b> the heirs’ obligation to pay the valuation of the deceased <b>is different,</b> i.e., it is not the same as a loan by oral agreement, <b>as</b> a valuation <b>is</b> considered <b>a loan,</b> i.e., debt, <b>written in the Torah,</b> in accordance with the deceased’s age and sex at the time of the vow.
The Gemara objects: If so, can one <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>a loan that is written in the Torah,</b> i.e., any financial obligation that applies by Torah law, <b>is considered</b> as though <b>it were written in a document?</b> The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he stood in judgment</b> before he died, and the court obligated him to donate his valuation. The court’s ruling is considered like a financial obligation written in a document, and therefore the heirs are required to pay his valuation.
The Gemara asks: If so, then <b>in the corresponding</b> situation, <b>with regard to</b> one who said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my assessment,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must also be referring to one <b>who stood in judgment.</b> But in that case, <b>why don’t the heirs have to donate</b> his assessment? The Gemara answers that in the case of one who said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my assessment,</b> even if he stood in judgment and the court obligated him to pay, <b>the assessment</b> of the precise amount he must pay is still <b>lacking,</b> as that amount is determined only through the assessment of a court. By contrast, with regard to one who said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation,</b> if he stood in judgment and the court obligated him to pay, <b>nothing is lacking,</b> as the amount he pays is fixed by the Torah.
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the valuation of my forearm, or of my leg,</b> has not said anything, as there are valuations in the Torah only for a complete person. <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: And</b> although he is exempt from donating the valuation, <b>he must give the assessment</b> of the forearm or leg.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna that <b>he has not said anything?</b> The Gemara answers: The ruling of the mishna that <b>he has not said anything</b> applies <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, but he must give the assessment according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Rabbi Meir maintains that a person does not utter a statement for naught, and therefore he must have intended to vow to donate the assessment of the limb, as there is no valuation for limbs.
The Gemara asks: But <b>didn’t</b> Rav Giddel already <b>say it once, as Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the valuation of this vessel,</b> although he is exempt from donating the valuation of the vessel, according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir <b>he must give the assessment</b> of the vessel.
The Gemara answers: It was necessary for Rav Giddel to repeat that <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who vowed the valuation of his forearm or leg, <b>lest you say</b> this ruling <b>is</b> applicable only <b>there,</b> with regard to a vessel, <b>as a person knows that there is no valuation for a vessel, and he</b> therefore <b>intended and said</b> his vow <b>for the sake of assessments. But here,</b> with regard to his forearm or leg, <b>he erred, as he thought that just as there is</b> an obligation to donate the valuation in a case where one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>the valuation of my head, or: The valuation of my liver, so too, there is</b> an obligation to donate the valuation if one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate the <b>valuation of my forearm or the valuation of my leg. But he did not</b> intend to <b>say</b> a vow of <b>assessments.</b> Therefore, Rav Giddel <b>teaches us</b> that even in the case of one who vowed to donate the valuation of his forearm or leg, he did not speak in error but intended to donate the assessment.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the <b>valuation of my head, or: The valuation of my liver, he gives the valuation of his entire</b> self. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “A valuation of <b>living people”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), which indicates that in the case of one who valuates an item upon which the soul is dependent and without which one will die, he must give the valuation of his entire self.
The mishna further teaches that <b>this is the principle:</b> One who valuates <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent</b> and without which one will die gives the valuation of his entire self. The Gemara explains that the phrase: This is the principle, serves <b>to include</b> one who vowed to donate the valuation of his leg <b>from the knee and above.</b> Since one would die if his leg were severed above the knee, this is considered an item upon which the soul is dependent, and therefore he gives the valuation of his entire self.
The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my valuation, gives</b> half of his valuation. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:3): One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my valuation, gives half of his valuation. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: He is flogged and must give</b> his <b>full valuation.</b>
The Gemara asks: Since he did not commit a sin, <b>why is he flogged? Rav Pappa said</b> in response: <b>He is flogged,</b> i.e., punished, <b>in</b> that he must donate his <b>full valuation. What is the reason</b> he needs to give his full valuation? A rabbinic <b>decree</b> was issued that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>half of my valuation,</b> must give the value of his entire self, <b>due to</b> a concern that this case might become confused with the similar one of a person who vows to donate <b>the valuation of half of himself. And</b> the <i>halakha</i> in such a case is that he must give the value of his entire self, as <b>the valuation of half of him is an item upon which the soul is dependent.</b>
The mishna further teaches that one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my assessment, gives</b> half of his assessment. But one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the assessment of half of me, gives the assessment of his entire</b> self, as one who takes a vow of assessment with regard to an item upon which the soul depends must give the assessment of his entire self. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> After all, it is only with regard to valuations that the Torah states: “A valuation of living people” (Leviticus 27:2), indicating that one who valuates an item upon which the soul depends must give the valuation of his entire self; but this is not stated with regard to assessments.
The Gemara answers that <b>it is written:</b> “When a man shall clearly utter <b>a vow [<i>neder</i>] with regard to a valuation [<i>be’erkekha</i>] of living people”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). The verse juxtaposes vows of assessment [<i>neder</i>] and valuations [<i>erekh</i>], thereby teaching that just as one who takes a vow of valuation with regard to an item upon which the soul depends must give the valuation of his entire self, so too, one who takes a vow of assessment with regard to an item upon which the soul is dependent must give the assessment of his entire self.
The mishna further teaches that <b>this is the principle:</b> One who takes a vow of assessment with regard to <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent</b> gives the assessment of his entire self. The Gemara explains that the phrase: This is the principle, serves <b>to include</b> one who vowed to donate the assessment of his leg <b>from the knee and above.</b> Since one would die if his leg were severed above the knee, this is an item upon which the soul depends, and therefore he gives the assessment of his entire self.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who valuates</b> in order to donate <b>half the valuation of a vessel, Rabbi Meir says: He gives</b> half <b>the assessment of</b> the vessel, <b>and the Rabbis say: He has not said anything.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rava became sick,</b> and <b>Abaye and</b> other <b>Sages came to</b> visit <b>him.</b> As <b>they were sitting and</b> talking, <b>they said: Granted</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>a person does not utter a statement for naught,</b> and therefore there <b>is no difference</b> whether one vowed to donate the <b>entire</b> valuation <b>of</b> a vessel, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether one vowed to donate <b>half its</b> valuation; in either case he must have intended to donate the assessment, as there is no valuation with regard to vessels.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>what do they hold? If</b> they maintain that <b>a person utters a statement for naught,</b> then <b>even</b> if one vowed to donate the <b>entire</b> valuation <b>of</b> a vessel, he should be exempt and the Rabbis should disagree with regard to that case. <b>And if</b> the Rabbis maintain that <b>a person does not utter a statement for naught,</b> then <b>even</b> one who vowed to donate <b>half</b> the valuation of a vessel should be obligated to give half of the assessment.
<b>Rava and Abaye said to</b> the Sages in response: <b>The Rabbis here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, but they</b> also <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Rava and Abaye elaborated: <b>They hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a person does not utter a statement for naught,</b> and therefore one who vows to donate the valuation of a vessel must give its assessment.
<b>And they</b> also <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> with regard to one who consecrated an item for a purpose for which it was unsuited, e.g., if one sought to bring a barley meal offering even though meal offerings may be brought only from wheat (see <i>Menaḥot</i> 103a). Rabbi Shimon <b>says</b> he is exempt from any obligation, <b>as</b> this person <b>did not donate in the manner</b> typical <b>of donors.</b> So too, with regard to one who vows to donate the valuation of a vessel, it is the typical <b>manner</b> for one <b>to donate an entire</b> vessel, and therefore one who does so is obligated to donate the assessment of the vessel. But it is <b>not</b> the typical <b>manner</b> for one <b>to donate half</b> a vessel, and therefore one who vows in this manner has not said anything and is exempt.
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>the valuation of so-and-so, and</b> both <b>the one who vowed</b> and the object of the vow <b>die,</b> the heirs of the one who vowed must give his valuation to the Temple treasury. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the specific case to which the mishna is referring? It must be referring to a case <b>where he stood in judgment,</b> and the court obligated him to donate his valuation before he died. The court’s ruling is considered like a financial obligation written in a document, and therefore the heirs of the one who vowed are required to pay his valuation.
If so, <b>this</b> clause in the mishna is identical to <b>that</b> previous clause in the mishna, which states that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate my valuation, and he dies, his heirs must give his valuation to the Temple treasury. Since it was explained that the earlier clause is also dealing with a case where he stood in judgment, for what purpose was this <i>halakha</i> repeated in the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to repeat this <i>halakha</i> in order to teach <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: With regard to one who says it is incumbent <b>upon him</b> to donate <b>the assessment of so-and-so, and the one who vowed dies,</b> his <b>heirs must give</b> his assessment to the Temple treasury.

Daf 20b

This is necessary <b>lest you say:</b> Although the one who took the vow stood in judgment before he died and the court obligated him, <b>since</b> the object of his vow <b>was not assessed</b> before he died, <b>the property of</b> the one who vowed <b>is not liened</b> to the debt, and consequently the heirs are not obligated to pay. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>the property of</b> the one who took the vow <b>was liened, since he stood in judgment</b> while he was still alive, and <b>the assessment</b> of the object of the vow <b>is</b> considered to be <b>a mere disclosure of the matter,</b> which can be performed after the death of the one who vowed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of one who says: <b>This bull</b> is consecrated as <b>a burnt offering, or: This house</b> is consecrated as <b>an offering, and the bull died or the house collapsed,</b> he <b>is exempt from paying</b> his commitment. But in the case of one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>this bull as a burnt offering, or:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>this house</b> as <b>an offering,</b> if <b>the bull died or the house collapsed,</b> he is <b>obligated to pay</b> its value.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> in the mishna <b>only that</b> one who <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>the monetary value of this bull</b> as <b>a burnt offering,</b> is obligated to pay its value if it dies. <b>But</b> if <b>he said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>this bull</b> as <b>a burnt offering, since he said: This,</b> thereby referring specifically to that animal, <b>and</b> then the bull <b>died, he does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss. And as for his statement: It is incumbent upon me, he did not intend to accept financial responsibility for the loss of the bull. Rather, he meant to <b>say:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me to bring</b> this bull as an offering to the Temple.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:11): With regard to one who says: <b>This bull is</b> consecrated as <b>a burnt offering, the bull is consecrated property and</b> one who benefits <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. If the bull <b>dies or is stolen, he does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss. If one says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>this bull</b> as <b>a burnt offering, the bull is consecrated property, and</b> one who benefits <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. If the bull <b>dies or is stolen, he bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss, despite the fact that he did not vow to give the monetary value of the bull.
The Gemara answers: <b>Is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>stronger than the mishna,</b> with regard to which <b>we established that</b> it is referring to a case where <b>he says: The monetary value of</b> the bull? <b>Here too,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>he says:</b> It is incumbent upon me to give <b>the monetary value of</b> this bull as a burnt offering.
The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he says: Monetary value of,</b> it may be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he does not say monetary value. As it teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:12): With regard to one who said: It is incumbent upon me to give <b>the monetary value of</b> this <b>bull</b> as <b>a burnt offering, the bull is non-sacred</b> property <b>and</b> one who benefits <b>from it</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. If the bull <b>dies or is stolen, he does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss. <b>But</b> if he sold the bull and received money for the sale, <b>he does bear</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> for that money, since he accepted financial responsibility <b>for the monetary value of</b> the bull in his vow.
The Gemara explains: <b>The first clause and the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> are both referring to one <b>who says: Monetary value of,</b> in his vow. The difference between them is that <b>the first clause</b> is dealing with <b>one who says: Let the bull be consecrated for its monetary value,</b> and therefore the bull is consecrated and he bears financial responsibility for its value. <b>But the latter clause</b> is referring to <b>one who says: When</b> this bull shall be sold, <b>the money received</b> from the sale <b>shall be consecrated</b> for use as a burnt offering.
The Gemara asks: Can this possibly be the case of the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>But a person cannot consecrate an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world,</b> and therefore one cannot consecrate the money he will receive in the future from the sale of the bull. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can consecrate an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b>
<b>Some say</b> a slightly different version of this discussion, that <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye, and some say Rami bar Ḥama</b> said <b>to Rav Ḥisda: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a person can consecrate an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world?</b> Abaye <b>said to him: Rather, in accordance with who</b> else’s opinion could this <i>baraita</i> be? Certainly it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
<b>And some teach</b> this discussion <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 8:30): In the case of <b>one who rents a house to another and</b> the house <b>became ritually impure with leprosy, even though a priest confirmed</b> the house as impure, condemning it to be dismantled, as long as the house is still standing its owner may <b>say to</b> the renter: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> and the owner is not required to compensate the renter. Nevertheless, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a house afflicted with leprosy, once the priest has <b>dismantled</b> the house the owner is <b>obligated to provide</b> a new <b>house for</b> the renter.

Daf 21a

If <b>the one living in it,</b> i.e., the renter, <b>consecrates</b> the house, <b>he pays the rent to the Temple</b> treasury. The Gemara express surprise at this last statement of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the one living in</b> the house <b>consecrates</b> it? <b>How can</b> the renter <b>consecrate it? The Merciful One states: “When a man shall sanctify his house to be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived that <b>just as one’s house is in his possession, so too, anything</b> that one consecrates must be <b>in his possession.</b> If so, the renter cannot consecrate the house, as he is not its owner. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>the one renting out the house consecrates it, the one living in it pays the rent to the Temple</b> treasury.
The Gemara asks: If <b>the one renting out the house consecrates it, how</b> is it possible for the renter to <b>live in it?</b> Since the house is consecrated property <b>he is standing</b> liable <b>for</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property</b> by living there. <b>And furthermore,</b> why must <b>he pay the rent to the Temple</b> treasury? <b>Since he misused consecrated property the payment</b> of the rent immediately <b>leaves</b> the state of consecration and becomes <b>non-sacred.</b>
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the one renting out the house <b>says: When the payment</b> of the rent <b>will come</b> to me, the money <b>shall be consecrated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how is it possible for the one renting out the house to consecrate money he will receive in the future? After all, <b>a person cannot consecrate an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can consecrate an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world. Some say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Mari bar Ḥama</b> said <b>to Rav Ḥisda: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a person can consecrate an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world? He said to him: Rather, in accordance with who</b> else’s opinion could this <i>baraita</i> be? Certainly it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to those <b>obligated</b> to pay <b>valuations,</b> the court <b>repossesses their</b> property to pay their debt to the Temple treasury. With regard to those <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>sin offerings and guilt offerings,</b> the court <b>does not repossess their</b> property; since one is obligated to bring them for atonement he would not delay bringing them. But with regard to those <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>burnt offerings and peace offerings,</b> the court <b>repossesses their</b> property;since these offerings are not obligatory for atonement, one might delay bringing them.
<b>Although</b> one obligated to bring burnt offerings and peace offerings <b>does not achieve atonement until he</b> brings the offering <b>of his own volition, as it is stated:</b> “He shall bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting <b>of his volition”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), nevertheless the court <b>coerces him until he says: I want</b> to do so. <b>And likewise, you say</b> the same <b>with regard to women’s bills of divorce.</b> Although one divorces his wife only of his own volition, in any case where the Sages obligated a husband to divorce his wife the court <b>coerces him until he says: I want</b> to do so.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Pappa says: Sometimes</b> with regard to <b>those obligated</b> to bring <b>sin offerings</b> the court <b>does repossess their</b> property, and likewise there are occasions involving those <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>burnt offerings</b> where the court <b>does not repossess their</b> property.
Rav Pappa elaborates: With regard to those <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>sin offerings,</b> the court <b>repossesses their</b> property <b>in</b> the case of <b>the sin offering of a nazirite, since the Master says</b> (<i>Nazir</i> 45a): <b>If</b> a nazirite <b>shaved</b> after the sacrifice <b>of one of the three</b> nazirite offerings, either the burnt offering, the peace offering, or the sin offering, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation of shaving. <b>And if the blood of one</b> of these offerings <b>was sprinkled on his behalf, the nazirite is permitted to drink wine and to become ritually impure from a corpse.</b> Therefore, there is a concern that a nazirite who has already sacrificed his burnt offering or peace offering might be <b>negligent with regard to</b> his sin offering <b>and not bring</b> it, and therefore the court repossesses his property in this particular case.
With regard to those <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>burnt offerings,</b> the court <b>does not repossess their</b> property <b>in</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering of a woman after childbirth.</b> There is no concern that she might delay bringing her burnt offering, as she is required to bring this offering before partaking of sacrificial food.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason for the ruling that a woman after childbirth is required to bring her burnt offering before she can sacrifice her sin offering? Is it <b>that the verse</b> mentions her burnt offering <b>before</b> it mentions her sin offering, as it is written: “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled…she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:6)? <b>But doesn’t Rava say: The verse</b> mentions her burnt offering <b>before</b> her sin offering only with regard <b>to</b> the <b>reading</b> of the verse, but not with regard to the order of the offerings? If so, there should be a concern that she might first sacrifice her sin offering and delay bringing her burnt offering.
<b>Rather,</b> the court does not repossess the property of those obligated to bring burnt offerings <b>in</b> the case of the <b>burnt offering of a leper, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beroka, says: Just as</b> failure to sacrifice <b>his sin offering and his guilt offering prevents</b> the leper from achieving full ritual purity, <b>so too,</b> failure to sacrifice <b>his burnt offering</b> has the same effect and <b>prevents him</b> from achieving full ritual purity. Therefore, the court does not repossess his property, as there is no concern he might delay bringing his burnt offering.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Although</b> one obligated to bring burnt offerings and peace offerings <b>does not achieve atonement until he</b> brings the offering <b>of his own volition,</b> as it is stated: “He shall bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting of his volition” (Leviticus 1:3), nevertheless, one coerces him until he says: I want to do so. Similarly, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to a burnt offering: <b>“He shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), which <b>teaches that one coerces him</b> to bring his burnt offering. One <b>might</b> have thought he brings the offering <b>against his will;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of his volition”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The court <b>coerces him until he says: I want to</b> do so.
<b>Shmuel says: A burnt offering requires</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one receiving atonement, <b>as it is stated: “Of his volition.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Shmuel <b>teaching us?</b> Didn’t <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Although he does not achieve atonement until he</b> brings the offering <b>of his own volition, as it is stated:</b> “He shall bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting <b>of his volition”?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the statement of Shmuel is <b>necessary</b> with regard to a case <b>where another</b> person <b>separated,</b> i.e., designated, a burnt offering <b>on his behalf. Lest you say: When we require</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one receiving atonement, that is only in a case where an animal <b>from his</b> property is separated as his burnt offering, e.g., the court repossesses his property for the sake of his burnt offering. <b>But</b> we do <b>not</b> need his consent if an animal <b>from</b> the property <b>of another</b> is separated as his burnt offering. Therefore, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that the consent of the one receiving atonement is required even in a case where an animal from the property of another was separated as an offering. The reason is that <b>sometimes he is not amenable to achieving atonement with an item that does not belong to him,</b> and in such a case he will not achieve atonement.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>the sin offering or the guilt offering of so-and-so,</b>

Daf 21b

if he does so <b>with</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one obligated to bring the offering <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, but if he does so <b>without</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one obligated to bring the offering <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
With regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>the burnt offering or the peace offering of so-and-so, whether</b> he does so <b>with</b> the latter’s <b>consent</b> or <b>without</b> his <b>consent,</b> the one obligated to bring the offering <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation. This apparently contradicts the statement of Shmuel, who said the bringing of a burnt offering requires the consent of the one obligated to bring the offering.
<b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> and states that one fulfills his obligation for his burnt offering without his consent, it is referring <b>to the time of atonement,</b> i.e., the sacrifice. At that stage, his consent is not necessary, <b>as he</b> already <b>consented at the time of separating</b> the animal as an offering. <b>When I said</b> the consent of the one receiving atonement is required, I was speaking <b>of the time of separating</b> the animal as an offering.
<b>And</b> Shmuel <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla says:</b> The Sages <b>distinguish between</b> the consent required for <b>a sin offering</b> or a guilt offering <b>and</b> the consent required for <b>a burnt offering</b> or a peace offering <b>only</b> in <b>that a sin offering</b> and a guilt offering <b>require</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one obligated to bring the offering <b>at the time</b> the other person <b>separates</b> the animal for an offering on his behalf, <b>and a burnt offering</b> and a peace offering <b>do not require</b> his <b>consent at the time of separating</b> the animal. <b>But</b> with regard to both <b>this</b> pair of offerings <b>and that</b> pair of offerings <b>at the time of atonement,</b> the requisite consent is the same for all offerings: If the offering was sacrificed <b>with</b> his <b>consent he has fulfilled</b> his obligation; if it was <b>not</b> sacrificed <b>with</b> his <b>consent he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinions of both Shmuel and Ulla from a <i>baraita</i>: One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>the sin offering or the guilt offering</b> or <b>the burnt offering or the peace offering of so-and-so,</b> if he does this <b>with</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one who is obligated to bring the offering, then that individual <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation. If he does so <b>without</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one who is obligated to bring the offering, that person <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. This <i>baraita</i> is difficult for the opinion of Shmuel, who holds that one who brings a burnt offering on behalf of another does not require consent at the time of atonement, and it is also difficult according to the opinion of Ulla, who maintains that one who brings a burnt offering on behalf of another does not need consent when the animal is set aside as an offering.
The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel establishes</b> the <i>baraita</i>, which requires consent, as referring <b>to the time of separating</b> the animal, and <b>Ulla establishes</b> the <i>baraita</i> as dealing <b>with</b> the required consent at <b>the time of atonement. Rav Pappa says,</b> in summary: <b>The <i>baraitot</i> are not difficult,</b> as they do not contradict <b>each other. This</b> one is referring to consent at <b>the time of atonement,</b> and <b>that</b> one is referring to consent at <b>the time of separating</b> the animal.
<b>And</b> Rav Pappa adds that the <i>baraitot</i> <b>also</b> are <b>not difficult</b> for the opinions of <b>the <i>amora’im</i>. Shmuel establishes the first</b> <i>baraita</i>, which does not require consent for a burnt offering and a peace offering, as referring <b>to the time of atonement,</b> and <b>the last</b> <i>baraita</i>, which requires consent for those offerings, as speaking <b>of the time of separating</b> the animal. <b>Ulla establishes</b> the <i>baraitot</i> in the <b>reverse</b> manner: The first <i>baraita</i>, which does not require consent for a burnt offering and a peace offering, is dealing with the time of separating the animal, whereas the second <i>baraita</i> is referring to the time of atonement. But <b>the <i>amora’im</i></b> themselves, Shmuel and Ulla, <b>certainly disagree</b> with each other. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this summary of the opinions of Shmuel and Ulla <b>obvious?</b>
The Gemara answers: Rav Pappa’s summary is necessary, <b>lest you say: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>Shmuel says,</b> that the consent of the one obligated to bring the offering is required at <b>the time of separating</b> the animal? Shmuel means that consent is required not only at the stage of atonement but <b>even at the time of separating</b> the animal. <b>And even though</b> according to this interpretation <b>the first</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that consent is not required for a burnt offering and for a peace offering, would be <b>a refutation</b> of the opinion of Shmuel, that difficulty would not deter him from holding such an opinion. Therefore, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict the opinions of Shmuel and Ulla, which indicates that Shmuel holds that consent is required only when the animal is separated, but not at the time of atonement.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And likewise, you say</b> the same <b>with regard to women’s bills of divorce.</b> Although one can divorce his wife only of his own volition, in any case where the Sages obligated a husband to divorce his wife, the court <b>coerces</b> him until he says: I want to do so. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> Concerning <b>one who delivered a declaration</b> preemptively invalidating <b>a bill of divorce</b> by announcing before giving the bill of divorce that he is not doing so of his own free will, <b>his declaration is</b> a valid <b>declaration</b> that cancels the bill of divorce. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the statement of Rav Sheshet is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where they coerced him</b> to give a bill of divorce and he declared that he was not giving it of his own free will, <b>but</b> later <b>he agreed</b> to give the bill of divorce of his own volition without explicitly retracting his original declaration that he was coerced. <b>Lest you say:</b> Merely by giving the bill of divorce <b>he has canceled</b> his earlier declaration that he was coerced, Rav Sheshet therefore <b>teaches us</b> that his original declaration that he was coerced is still in effect and the bill of divorce is canceled.
The Gemara explains how Rav Sheshet derives his conclusion from the mishna. The reason is <b>that if it were so,</b> i.e., if his original declaration is canceled even without an explicit retraction, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> The court coerces him <b>until he gives</b> the bill of divorce of his own volition. <b>What</b> is the significance of the clause: The court coerces him <b>until he says:</b> I want to do so? This indicates that the court coerces him <b>until he</b> explicitly <b>cancels his</b> original <b>declaration.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One proclaims, i.e., publicly announces, <b>the appraisal of the</b> property inherited by minor <b>orphans,</b> which is being sold to repay their father’s debt, for <b>thirty days,</b> in order to receive the maximal price. <b>And</b> one proclaims <b>the appraisal of consecrated</b> property that is being sold by the Temple treasury for <b>sixty days, and one proclaims</b> it <b>in the morning and in the evening.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about those times that one proclaims the appraisal of the property specifically <b>in the morning and in the evening? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One proclaims <b>during the time</b> that <b>workers leave</b> to work in the fields <b>and during the time</b> that <b>workers enter</b> the city after completing their workday. Rav Yehuda elaborates: One proclaims <b>during the time</b> that <b>workers leave</b> to work in the fields, so <b>that</b> if <b>there is</b> a person <b>who is amenable to purchasing</b> the property, he may <b>say to</b> the <b>workers: Go</b> and <b>examine</b> the property <b>for me.</b> And one proclaims <b>during the time</b> that <b>workers enter</b> the city so <b>that</b> that individual <b>will be reminded that he said to</b> the workers that they should inspect the property, and he will <b>go</b> and <b>ask them</b> for their opinion of it.
The Gemara notes: <b>That</b> explanation <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One proclaims <b>the appraisal of the</b> property inherited by minor <b>orphans</b> for <b>thirty days, and</b> one proclaims <b>the appraisal of consecrated</b> property for <b>sixty days. And one proclaims</b> it <b>in the morning and in the evening, during the time</b> that <b>workers leave</b> to work in the fields <b>and during the time</b> that <b>workers enter</b> the city after completing their workday.
The <i>baraita</i> adds that the one who proclaims <b>states:</b> The <b>field</b> of <b>so-and-so</b> that is identifiable <b>by its markers and by its borders, such is its quality,</b> i.e., it produces such-and-such quantities of grain annually, <b>and such is</b> its <b>appraisal; anyone who wishes to purchase</b> the field let <b>him come and purchase</b> it. He adds that the field is being sold <b>in order to give</b> the proceeds <b>to a wife</b> as payment <b>of her marriage contract, or</b> in order <b>to</b> give <b>a creditor</b> payment <b>of</b> a deceased man’s <b>debt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the one making the proclamation <b>to say</b> that the field is being sold <b>in order to give</b> the proceeds <b>to a wife</b> as payment of <b>her marriage contract or</b> in order <b>to</b> give <b>a creditor</b> payment of <b>his debt?</b> The Gemara responds: This declaration is necessary <b>as there are</b> individuals <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to do business <b>with a creditor, as he is lenient with dinars</b> and will accept even damaged coins, <b>and there are</b> others <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to deal <b>with a wife, as she takes</b> her money <b>bit by bit,</b> i.e., in incremental payments.

Daf 22a

With regard to the duration of time for the proclamation, <b>the Sages taught:</b> One proclaims <b>the appraisal of the</b> property inherited by minor <b>orphans</b> for <b>thirty days, and</b> one proclaims <b>the appraisal of consecrated</b> property for <b>sixty days.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One proclaims <b>the appraisal of the</b> property of <b>orphans</b> for <b>sixty days, and</b> one proclaims <b>the appraisal of consecrated</b> property for <b>ninety days. And the Rabbis say: Both this and that</b> are proclaimed for <b>sixty days. Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one proclaims <b>the appraisal of the</b> property of <b>orphans</b> for <b>sixty days.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> stated by Rav Ḥisda in the name of Avimi. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: Did you say</b> that the proclamation is for <b>sixty</b> days <b>or did you say</b> that it is for <b>thirty</b> days? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him:</b> It is for <b>sixty</b> days. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak continued: Is this the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the property <b>of orphans or</b> with regard <b>to consecrated</b> property? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him:</b> It applies to the property <b>of orphans.</b>
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak persisted: Do you rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him:</b> I rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raised a difficulty: <b>But Rabbi Meir says</b> that the appraisal of the property of orphans is proclaimed for <b>thirty</b> days.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said like this: I absorbed many blows [<i>kulfei</i>] from Avimi due to that <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., Avimi would disparage me when I questioned his statement that according to Rabbi Meir one proclaims the appraisal of the property of orphans for sixty days, which is contradicted by the <i>baraita</i>. Avimi explained to Rav Ḥisda that if the court <b>comes to proclaim</b> the sale on <b>consecutive</b> days, then it is proclaimed for <b>thirty</b> days, in accordance with the <i>baraita</i>.
But if it is proclaimed only <b>on Monday and on Thursday,</b> when the markets are open, villagers gather in the city, and the courts sit in judgment, then it is proclaimed over the course of <b>sixty</b> days. <b>And even though if Master counts the</b> number <b>of days</b> on which there is actually <b>a proclamation, there are only eighteen days,</b> far fewer than the thirty of the consecutive days, <b>since the matter extends</b> over the course of sixty days, <b>people</b> will <b>hear</b> about the sale.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The court <b>attends to the property of</b> minor <b>orphans,</b>to sell it in order to pay a debt, <b>only</b> if the debt <b>was</b> accruing <b>interest</b> that <b>consumes</b> the property of the orphans, since if they delay payment of the debt, it will grow dramatically. In other cases the court delays payment until the orphans reach majority. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The court attends to their property <b>either to</b> pay a debt recorded in a promissory <b>note that contains interest or to</b> pay <b>a wife’s marriage contract, due to</b> the standing obligation of the orphans to provide <b>sustenance</b> for their father’s widow from his estate as long as she has not received payment of her marriage contract. It is therefore beneficial to the orphans that she should collect her marriage contract immediately.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Asi, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not state</b> that the court attends to their property <b>for</b> the purpose of paying the <b>marriage contract of a wife?</b> The Gemara responds: There is no financial loss to the orphans in such a case, <b>because the Sages established for</b> the late husband that as long as she receives sustenance from his estate, the orphans are entitled to <b>her earnings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the other,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, in light of this fact why does he rule that the court attends to their property? The Gemara responds: <b>Sometimes</b> her earnings <b>do not</b> provide <b>enough</b> to reimburse the money spent on her sustenance.
The Gemara continues: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that one proclaims <b>the appraisal of the</b> property inherited by <b>orphans</b> for <b>thirty days and the appraisal of consecrated</b> property for <b>sixty days, and one proclaims</b> it <b>in the morning and in the evening.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> case <b>are we dealing with</b> in the mishna? <b>If we say</b> that we are dealing <b>with a gentile creditor, will he comply</b> with the ruling of the Jewish court that payment be delayed for thirty days? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that we are dealing <b>with a Jewish creditor.</b> Now, <b>if</b> the mishna is dealing with a situation <b>where the interest consumes</b> the orphans’ property, <b>do we leave</b> a Jew to collect interest? <b>But rather,</b> it must be referring to a case <b>where the interest does not consume</b> the orphans’ property, <b>and</b> nevertheless the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the court <b>attends</b> to the property of orphans even when no interest accrues on the loan. This apparently contradicts the opinions of Rav Asi and Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> the mishna is not difficult, as he can <b>establish</b> it as referring <b>to</b> payment of the <b>marriage contract of a wife. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi,</b> that the court does not attend to the property of orphans in such a case, the mishna poses <b>a difficulty.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Asi</b> could <b>say to you: And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, does it work out well</b> that the mishna requires thirty days of proclamation before the sale of the property? <b>Do we leave</b> aside the <b>sustenance that</b> the orphans <b>certainly lose</b> to the wife for the duration of the thirty days <b>and take,</b> i.e., implement, the <b>proclamation,</b> with regard to <b>which we do not know if</b> they <b>will gain</b> from it or <b>if</b> they <b>will not gain,</b> as it is uncertain that an offer matching the appraisal of the court will be made?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan can explain that the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a widow who <b>claims her marriage contract in court.</b> And this is <b>in accordance with</b> a ruling <b>that Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> A widow <b>who claims</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract in court no</b> longer receives <b>sustenance</b> from the estate of her husband.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>we</b> should <b>not attend to her</b> request to collect payment of her marriage contract at all. Rather, the court should delay payment until the orphans reach majority, as they incur no loss by delaying the payment. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: That is not appropriate; <b>rather, since we attend to her initially,</b> when she claims the payment of her marriage contract in court, <b>we attend to her in the end</b> as well, in order to collect payment from the orphans, despite the fact that the orphans will not lose money if they do not pay immediately.
The Gemara returns to its initial question: <b>In any case,</b> the mishna poses <b>a difficulty for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi,</b> who maintains that the court attends to the property of orphans only in order to collect the payment of a loan that accrues interest, not for the payment of a marriage contract. If the mishna is dealing with a gentile creditor, he will not wait thirty days to collect payment, and if it is referring to a Jewish creditor, he is prohibited from charging interest in the first place. The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a gentile creditor,</b> in the specific case of one <b>who accepted upon himself to adjudicate</b> in accordance <b>with Jewish law.</b> He therefore agrees to delay collection for thirty days.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let him also not take interest,</b> as it is prohibited to do so according to Jewish law. The Gemara responds: The mishna is dealing with a case <b>where he accepted</b> Jewish law <b>upon himself for this</b> matter, to delay collection for thirty days, <b>but he did not accept</b> it <b>upon himself for that</b> matter, not to collect interest.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a difficulty for the opinions of Rav Asi and Rav Yoḥanan from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 48b): A court <b>can collect</b> a father’s debt <b>from the property of orphans only from</b> land of <b>the lowest quality.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with</b> in this mishna? <b>If we say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a gentile creditor, will he comply</b> and accept inferior-quality land as payment? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that we are dealing <b>with a Jewish creditor.</b> Now, <b>if</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where the interest consumes</b> the orphans’ property, <b>do we leave him</b> to collect interest? <b>Rather,</b> it must be dealing with a case <b>where the interest does not consume</b> the orphans’ property, <b>and</b> yet it <b>is taught</b> in the mishna that the court <b>attends</b> to the property of orphans even when no interest accrues on the loan.
Once again, the Gemara states: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna is not difficult <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as he can <b>establish</b> it as referring <b>to</b> payment of the <b>marriage contract of a wife. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi,</b> that the court does not attend to the property of orphans in such a case, the mishna poses <b>a difficulty.</b> The Gemara responds that <b>Rav Asi</b> could <b>say to you: And</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, does</b> the mishna <b>work out well? If</b> the mishna is referring to payment of a wife’s <b>marriage contract, why</b> does it discuss <b>specifically</b> a collection <b>from orphans? Even</b> in a case of a divorced woman who collects payment <b>from</b> the husband <b>himself,</b> she <b>also</b> receives only <b>inferior-quality</b> land.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan would reply that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A marriage contract of a wife</b> is generally paid <b>with intermediate</b>-<b>quality land, and</b> if payment is collected <b>from orphans,</b> the marriage contract is paid <b>with inferior-quality</b> land.
The Gemara asks: <b>In any case,</b> the mishna poses <b>a difficulty for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a gentile creditor who accepted upon himself to adjudicate</b> in accordance <b>with Jewish law.</b> He therefore agrees to accept payment from inferior-quality land. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let him also not take interest,</b> which is prohibited according to Jewish law. The Gemara responds: The mishna is dealing with a case <b>where he accepted</b> Jewish law <b>upon himself for this</b> matter, to delay collection for thirty days, <b>but he did not accept</b> it <b>upon himself for that</b> matter, not to collect interest. The court therefore attends to the property of the orphans in order to minimize the interest owed to the creditor.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a difficulty from a <i>baraita</i>: When one proclaims the appraisal of the property of orphans, he announces that the property is being sold <b>in order to give</b> the proceeds <b>to a wife</b> as payment of <b>her marriage contract or</b> in order <b>to</b> give <b>a creditor</b> payment of <b>his debt.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Granted,</b> there is no difficulty in the ruling that one proclaims that the property is being sold in order to give <b>a creditor</b> payment of a debt, as <b>whether</b> according to this <b>Sage or whether</b> according to that <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rav Asi or Rabbi Yoḥanan, the mishna is <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>we taught</b> above, that it is dealing with a gentile creditor who collects interest but agrees to delay payment.
<b>But</b> with regard to the proclamation that the property is being sold in order to pay the wife’s <b>marriage contract, granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who maintains that the court attends to the property of orphans in such a case, the <i>baraita</i> <b>works out well. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi,</b> that the court does not attend to their property in order to pay a marriage contract, the <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where the</b> one who is <b>obligated</b> to pay <b>admits</b> that he has not yet paid, i.e., the father admitted before his death that he has not yet paid the obligation stated in the marriage contract. The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> response, it is no longer necessary to establish that the previous cases are referring to a gentile creditor. Rather, <b>all of them</b> are <b>also</b> dealing with Jewish creditors, as they are referring to situations <b>where the</b> one who is <b>obligated</b> to pay <b>admits</b> that he has not yet paid. In such cases, the court collects payment from the property of the orphans without delay.
§ With regard to the dispute between Rav Asi and Rabbi Yoḥanan, the Gemara relates that <b>Mareimar collected</b> the payment of <b>a marriage contract for a divorced woman from the property of</b> minor <b>orphans. Ravina said to Ameimar: But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav Asi says</b> that the court <b>does not attend to the property of</b> minor <b>orphans unless interest was consuming it,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the court attends to their property <b>either to</b> pay a debt recorded in a promissory <b>note that contains interest or to</b> pay <b>a wife’s marriage contract, due to</b> the obligation of the orphans to provide her <b>sustenance.</b>
Ravina added: <b>And even Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that they attend to the property of minor orphans <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a widow, as she causes loss</b> to their property due to the <b>sustenance</b> she receives until she collects payment of her marriage contract. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a divorced woman,</b> who does not receive sustenance from their property, Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees that the court does <b>not</b> collect payment of her marriage contract until the orphans reach majority.
Ameimar <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>We learned</b> that <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that the court attends to the property of minor orphans in order to collect the payment of a marriage contract, is <b>for the sake of favor,</b> i.e., the court collects payment of a wife’s marriage contract not due to the sustenance that consumes the property of the orphans, but in order that the wife will find favor in the eyes of men so that they will marry her. This reason is equally applicable in the cases of a widow and a divorced woman.
With regard to attending to the property of orphans, <b>Rav Naḥman says: At first, I would not attend to the property of orphans</b> in order to collect payment of a standard debt. <b>Once I heard that</b> which <b>Rav Huna, our friend,</b> said <b>in the name of Rav: Orphans who consume that which is not theirs, let them follow their deceased</b> parent to the graveyard, <b>from that</b> point <b>forward I would attend</b> to their property.
The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset, what is the reason</b> that Rav Naḥman would <b>not</b> collect payment from minor orphans? <b>Rav Pappa says: The repayment of a creditor</b> is <b>a mitzva, and</b> minor <b>orphans are not obligated in performing</b> that <b>mitzva. Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> The reason is that we <b>say</b> there is a concern that the father might have <b>transferred bundles</b> of coins to the creditor before his death as collateral and we are unaware of such a payment. Therefore, the court delays payment until the orphans reach majority in order to allow them time to clarify whether such payment was in fact made.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara responds: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where the</b> one who is <b>obligated</b> to pay <b>admits</b> that he still owes the money, <b>or</b> in a case where the court <b>excommunicated</b> the father in order to force him to pay <b>and he died</b> in a state of <b>excommunication.</b> In such instances, there is no doubt that the debt must be paid. According to Rav Pappa, even in such cases the court does not collect payment from minor orphans, as they are not obligated in the performance of the mitzva, whereas Rav Huna would rule that the court collects payment even before they reach majority, as there is no doubt that the debt is unpaid.
The Gemara relates that <b>they sent from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael, a communication that all these cases cited above, in which the court collects payment of a debt from the property of minor orphans, are referring to situations <b>where</b> the court <b>excommunicated</b> the father <b>and he died while</b> under <b>excommunication. And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.</b>

Daf 22b

The Gemara attempts to determine the correct reason why the court does not attend to the property of minor orphans: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that one proclaims <b>the appraisal of the</b> property of minor <b>orphans</b> that is being sold for <b>thirty days, and</b> one proclaims <b>the appraisal of consecrated</b> property for <b>sixty days, and one proclaims</b> it <b>in the morning and in the evening.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with</b> here? <b>If we say</b> that the mishna is dealing <b>with a gentile creditor</b> who is unwilling to wait until the orphans reach majority, <b>will he comply</b> with the court’s directive that the appraisal of the property be proclaimed for thirty days before it is sold? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the mishna is dealing <b>with a Jewish creditor.</b>
The Gemara concludes its proof: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who says that the court does not attend to the property of minor orphans due to a concern that their father might have left bundles of coins with the creditor, he can <b>establish</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the one <b>obligated</b> to pay, i.e., the father, <b>admits</b> before his death that he has not paid. In such a case, the court does not wait to collect payment until the orphans reach majority. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa,</b> that the court does not attend to the property of minor orphans because they are not obligated in the mitzva to repay a loan, the mishna poses <b>a difficulty.</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>Rav Pappa</b> could <b>say to you: If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the court sells the property of the orphans in order to collect payment for <b>a marriage contract,</b> which the court does <b>for the sake of favor,</b> i.e., in order that the wife will own property and be desirable for marriage. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna is dealing <b>with a gentile creditor who accepted upon himself to adjudicate</b> in accordance <b>with Jewish law.</b> He therefore agrees to delay collection for thirty days.
The Gemara objects: <b>If he accepted</b> Jewish law <b>upon himself,</b> then <b>let him wait for</b> the orphans <b>until they reach majority</b> before demanding payment of the loan. The Gemara explains: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he accepted</b> Jewish law <b>upon himself for this</b> matter, to delay collection for thirty days, <b>but he did not accept</b> it <b>upon himself for that</b> matter, to wait until they reach majority.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: When one proclaims the appraisal of the property of orphans, he announces that the property is being sold <b>in order to give</b> the proceeds <b>to a wife</b> as payment of <b>her marriage contract, or</b> in order <b>to</b> give <b>a creditor</b> payment of <b>his debt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a gentile creditor</b> who is unwilling to wait until the orphans reach majority, <b>will he comply</b> with the court’s directive that the appraisal of the property is proclaimed for thirty days before it is sold? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a Jewish creditor.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> he can <b>establish</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the one <b>obligated</b> to pay <b>admits</b> before his death that he has not paid. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa, granted,</b> the court collects payment of <b>a marriage contract for the sake of favor; but</b> the fact that they sell the property in order to pay <b>a creditor</b> poses a <b>difficulty.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a gentile creditor, and</b> is it referring to a case <b>where he accepted upon himself to adjudicate</b> in accordance <b>with Jewish law.</b> He therefore agrees to delay collection for thirty days. The Gemara objects: <b>If he accepted</b> Jewish law <b>upon himself,</b> then <b>let him wait for</b> the orphans <b>until they reach majority</b> before demanding payment of the loan. The Gemara again explains: The <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where he accepted</b> Jewish law <b>upon himself for this</b> matter, to delay collection for thirty days, <b>but he did not accept</b> it <b>upon himself for that</b> matter, to wait until they reach majority.
<b>Rava says:</b> The court does not collect payment from the property of minor orphans <b>due to</b> the concern that there might be <b>a receipt,</b> i.e., perhaps their father repaid the loan and received a receipt attesting to his payment and the orphans are unaware of its existence. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: But are we concerned for</b> the existence of <b>a receipt? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 87a): A woman <b>who collects</b> the payment of her marriage contract from the property of her husband <b>when not in his presence,</b> e.g., if her husband is overseas, <b>may collect only by</b> means of <b>an oath</b> that she has not yet received payment.
<b>And Rabbi Aḥa Sar HaBira says: An incident came before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa in Antioch, and he issued a ruling and said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that she may collect the payment of her marriage contract in her husband’s absence, <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the wife’s marriage contract, for the sake of favor. But a creditor</b> does <b>not</b> have the right to collect the debt that is owed to him in the debtor’s absence. <b>And Rabba</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says: Even a creditor</b> may collect a payment by means of an oath in the debtor’s absence.
Rav Huna explains the difficulty: <b>And if you are concerned for</b> the existence of <b>a receipt,</b> then in that case <b>there as well,</b> where the obligated party is overseas, <b>let us be concerned</b> that he has in fact paid the debt and received a receipt. Rava <b>said to him:</b> In that case <b>there,</b> one is not concerned about the existence of a receipt, in accordance <b>with the reason that we say:</b> It is in order <b>that</b> there should <b>not</b> be a situation where <b>every person will take the money of another and go and reside in a country overseas,</b> to prevent the creditor from collecting the money from his property.
§ <b>Rava says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that the court <b>does not attend to the property of</b> minor <b>orphans</b> in order to pay the debts owed by their father. <b>But if</b> their father <b>said</b> before his death: <b>Give</b> so-and-so the payment of my debt, the court <b>attends</b> to their property. Specifically, if the father said: Give <b>this field</b> to so-and-so, <b>or:</b> Give <b>this one hundred</b> dinars to so-and-so, then the court <b>attends</b> to their property to collect payment, <b>and</b> the court <b>does not install a steward [<i>apotropos</i>]</b> to negotiate with the creditor on their behalf. If he said: Give <b>a field</b> to so-and-so, i.e., <b>an unspecified</b> field, or: Give <b>one hundred</b> dinars to so-and-so, i.e., <b>unspecified</b> dinars, then the court <b>attends</b> to the property of the orphans <b>and</b> they <b>install a steward</b> to act on their behalf, to ensure that the best fields remain in their possession.
By contrast, the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: In all of</b> these cases where the father told his children before his death to give an item, the court <b>attends</b> to the property of the orphans <b>and</b> they <b>install a steward</b> to act on their behalf, <b>except for</b> a situation <b>where a field is found</b> in their possession with regard to which witnesses have testified <b>that</b> it <b>is not</b> their father’s, but is in fact stolen. In such a case, the stolen field is seized and returned to its owner without recourse to a steward, <b>as we do not presume</b> that <b>witnesses are liars.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi says: Therefore, we do not attend</b> to the property of minor orphans in order to repay a standard loan, <b>as Rava says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that the court <b>does not attend</b> to their property. <b>And if we attend</b> to their property, e.g., in a case where the father told his children to repay the debt, <b>we install a steward</b> to act on behalf of the orphans, <b>as</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: In all of</b> the cases, the court <b>attends</b> to the property of minor orphans <b>and installs a steward, except for</b> a situation <b>where a field is found</b> in their possession <b>that is not</b> the father’s, <b>as we do not presume</b> that <b>witnesses are liars.</b>

Daf 23a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who consecrates his property and there was</b> the outstanding debt <b>of the marriage contract of</b> his <b>wife,</b> for whose repayment one’s property is liened, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: When he divorces her, he shall vow</b> that <b>benefit</b> from her is forbidden to him. This is to prevent collusion, by which he divorces her, she collects payment from the consecrated property, and he then remarries her. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: He need not</b> do so. <b>On a similar note, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Even</b> in the case of <b>the guarantor of a woman for her marriage contract, and her husband was divorcing her</b> and could not pay the debt, the husband <b>shall vow</b> that <b>benefit</b> from her is forbidden to him, <b>lest he</b> and his wife <b>engage in collusion [<i>kinunya</i>]</b> and collect payment from the property of <b>that</b> guarantor, <b>and</b> then the husband <b>will remarry his wife.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that there is a dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua with regard to a case where one consecrates his property and then divorces his wife. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>a person</b> would <b>engage in collusion against</b> even the <b>Temple</b> treasury, and for this reason he divorces his wife. The required vow serves to prevent such a possibility. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that <b>a person</b> would <b>not engage in collusion against</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, consider <b>that which Rav Huna says:</b> If <b>a person on his deathbed consecrated all of his property and said: So-and-so has one hundred</b> dinars that I owe him <b>in my possession,</b> his statement is <b>deemed credible,</b> as there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not engage in collusion against</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury. <b>Let us say</b> that Rav Huna <b>stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to a matter that is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>disagree</b> whether or not one colludes against the Temple treasury <b>only with regard to a healthy</b> person. <b>But with regard to a person on his deathbed, everyone agrees</b> that such <b>a person does not engage in collusion against</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury. <b>What is the reason?</b> Since he will soon die, he does not stand to gain anything from his statement, and <b>a person sins only for his own</b> benefit, not for the benefit of others.
<b>Some say</b> that <b>in</b> the case of <b>a healthy</b> person, <b>everyone agrees on</b> the question of whether or <b>not a person</b> would <b>engage in collusion against</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury, i.e., they agree that one must be concerned that a person may engage in collusion. <b>And here, they disagree with regard to a vow administered in public,</b> e.g., a vow administered by the court. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>holds</b> that such a vow <b>has</b> the option of <b>nullification.</b> Consequently, there is no use in requiring the husband to take a vow even in public, as a halakhic authority can later dissolve it. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that such a vow <b>does not have</b> the option of <b>nullification.</b> Therefore, the court administers a vow in public to prevent collusion.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that <b>a vow administered in public has</b> the option of <b>nullification. And here, they disagree with regard to a vow administered</b> based <b>on the consent of the public,</b> i.e., when the court says to the husband: You are taking a vow that benefit from your wife is forbidden to you based on our consent. According to Rabbi Eliezer, there is no option of nullification for such a vow, and therefore it is effective in preventing collusion, whereas Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that even such a vow can be nullified and is therefore ineffective in preventing collusion.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, consider <b>that which Ameimar says: A vow that was taken in public has</b> the option of <b>nullification;</b> if it was taken based <b>on the consent of the public</b> it <b>does not have</b> the option of <b>nullification. Let us say</b> that Ameimar <b>stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to a matter that is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. And furthermore, Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> in the mishna that the husband <b>need not</b> take a vow. If his reason is that such a vow is ineffective, <b>he should have</b> stated: <b>It is ineffective.</b>
<b>Rather, here they disagree with regard to</b> one’s ability to <b>request</b> the dissolution <b>of</b> a vow involving <b>consecrated</b> property. Rabbi Eliezer holds that one may not request the dissolution of a vow involving consecrated property. Accordingly, there is a concern that the husband might collude with his wife by divorcing her in order to extract the consecrated property from the Temple treasury, as he has no other means of releasing the property. In contrast, Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that such a vow may be dissolved and therefore there is no reason for the husband to collude with his wife.
The Gemara adds: <b>And it is</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who consecrates his property and there was</b> the outstanding debt <b>of the marriage contract of</b> his <b>wife upon it, Rabbi Eliezer says: When he divorces her, he shall vow</b> that <b>benefit</b> from her is forbidden to him, to prevent collusion. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: He need not</b> do so. <b>And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said: This</b> statement of Rabbi Eliezer is <b>the same</b> as <b>the statement of Beit Shammai, and this</b> statement of Rabbi Yehoshua is <b>the same</b> as <b>the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>
<b>As Beit Shammai say: Consecration</b> that one performed <b>in error is</b> effective as <b>consecration.</b> Consequently, one cannot request the dissolution of his consecration due to circumstances that unfolded on the grounds that he did not mean to make a vow. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Consecration</b> that one performed <b>in error</b> is <b>not consecration,</b> and one may therefore request the dissolution of his consecration.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>On a similar note, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said</b> that even in the case of a guarantor for a woman for her marriage contract, he vows that benefit from her is forbidden to him, lest he and his wife engage in collusion. The Gemara relates that <b>Moshe bar Atzrei was the guarantor</b> for the marriage contract <b>of his daughter-in-law, and Rav Huna, his son, was a Torah scholar and was hard-pressed</b> for money. <b>Abaye said: Is there no</b> one <b>who will advise Rav Huna that he should divorce his wife, and she should claim her marriage contract from his father,</b> the guarantor of the marriage contract, <b>and</b> that <b>he should</b> then <b>return</b> and remarry <b>her,</b> and in this manner they will obtain money?
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>But we learned</b> in the mishna that in such a case <b>he shall vow</b> that benefit from her is forbidden to him. If so, Rav Huna cannot remarry her. <b>And</b> the Gemara explains that <b>Abaye</b> would argue: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>anyone who divorces, divorces in court?</b> Let Rav Huna divorce his wife outside the court, so that he will not be forced to take a vow and he will therefore be allowed to remarry her. The Gemara relates that <b>ultimately it was revealed that</b> Rav Huna <b>was a priest,</b> which means that if he had divorced his wife he would have been prohibited from remarrying her. <b>Abaye said</b> of this revelation: This is an example of the saying that <b>poverty follows the poor,</b> i.e., it is difficult to remove a poor person from a state of poverty.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Abaye</b> actually <b>say this? Doesn’t Abaye say: Who is a wily, wicked person? This</b> is <b>one who advises</b> another <b>to sell property</b> that he received from someone who stipulated that the property should pass to a second beneficiary upon the death of the first. And this is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>Rabban</b> Shimon ben <b>Gamliel,</b> who maintains that the sale is valid and the second beneficiary may not remove the property from the possession of the buyer. If Abaye considers this individual as wicked for advising one to act against the intentions of a benefactor, how could he suggest that Rav Huna should extract money from the guarantor in the above case?
The Gemara answers: When one is a guarantor for <b>his son</b> it <b>is different,</b> as he would forgive his son for acting in this manner, as the son will in any case inherit his property. <b>And</b> furthermore, when this is performed for the benefit of <b>a Torah scholar</b> it <b>is different,</b> as it is proper to assist him so that he may continue studying Torah.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> Abaye <b>deduce</b> that such a course of action is ineffective, <b>as a guarantor of a marriage contract is not</b> legally <b>responsible</b> to pay the marriage contract.

Daf 23b

The Gemara responds: Moshe bar Atzrei <b>was a guarantor who accepted</b> unconditional responsibility <b>[<i>kablan</i>]</b> for the payment of the marriage contract. The Gemara objects: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that with regard to <b>a <i>kablan</i>, even though the debtor has no property</b> at the time of the loan, nevertheless the <i>kablan</i> is <b>responsible</b> for payment. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that if the debtor <b>has</b> property then the <i>kablan</i> is <b>responsible,</b> but if <b>he does not</b> have property then the <i>kablan</i> <b>does not</b> agree to become <b>responsible</b> for the payment, <b>what can be said?</b> Since Rav Huna owned no property, how could payment of the marriage contract be collected from Moshe bar Atzrei?
The Gemara responds: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>Rav Huna had</b> property at the time that his father accepted upon himself to be a guarantor, <b>and it became blighted. And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>a father, with regard to his son, accepts responsibility upon himself</b> even if his son owns no property.
The Gemara cites the aforementioned dispute in detail. <b>As it was stated: Everyone agrees</b> that an ordinary <b>guarantor of a marriage contract does not</b> resolve to become <b>responsible</b> for paying the marriage contract. <b>Everyone</b> also <b>agrees</b> that <b>a <i>kablan</i> for a creditor is responsible</b> for paying the debtor’s debt. By contrast, with regard to an ordinary <b>guarantor</b> of a debt owed <b>to a creditor and a <i>kablan</i></b> for the payment <b>of a marriage contract,</b> the Sages <b>disagree. There is one</b> Sage <b>who says:</b> If the <b>debtor</b> or the husband <b>has</b> property then the guarantor becomes <b>responsible,</b> but <b>if he does not have</b> property then <b>he does not become responsible. And there is</b> another Sage <b>who says: Even though</b> the debtor or the husband <b>does not have</b> property, the guarantor <b>becomes responsible</b> for payment of the obligation.
<b>And the <i>halakha</i> in all of</b> these cases is: <b>Even though</b> the principal <b>does not have</b> property of his own, the guarantor <b>still becomes responsible</b> for paying the obligation, <b>except for</b> the case of an ordinary <b>guarantor of a marriage contract,</b> with regard to <b>which, even though</b> the husband <b>has</b> property of his own when he draws up the marriage contract, the guarantor <b>does not</b> resolve to <b>become responsible. What is the reason? He performs a mitzva,</b> i.e., he agrees to be a guarantor only so that the woman will consent to the marriage but he does not actually resolve to become responsible. <b>And</b> furthermore, the woman <b>did not lose anything</b> in exchange for which the guarantor would have accepted responsibility, as the husband did not borrow money from her.
§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain man who sold his property and</b> later when he <b>divorced his wife</b> he had no property with which to pay the marriage contract. The wife therefore sought to collect payment from the buyers. <b>Rav Yosef, son of Rava, sent</b> the case <b>before Rav Pappa:</b> When a wife’s marriage contract is paid by <b>a guarantor, we learned</b> in the mishna that the husband vows that benefit from her is forbidden to him. Similarly, when she collects her marriage contract from <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that the husband takes such a vow. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> when she collects payment from <b>a buyer?</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: Should the <i>tanna</i> have continued reckoning</b> cases <b>like a peddler,</b> who announces all his wares? Obviously, the <i>halakha</i> is the same in the case of a buyer, as the identical reasoning applies despite the fact that the <i>tanna</i> neglected to mention this case.
The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: That</b> which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna <b>we learned,</b> and <b>that</b> which <b>we did not learn</b> in the mishna <b>we did not learn,</b> i.e., the husband does not need to make the vow when the payment of the marriage contract is collected from buyers. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: What is the reasoning of</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a? Granted,</b> when the payment of the marriage contract is collected from <b>consecrated</b> property the husband must make the vow <b>due to</b> the importance of maintaining the <b>profit of the Temple</b> treasury. In the case of <b>a guarantor as well,</b> the husband must make the vow, as the guarantor <b>performed a mitzva and</b> the woman <b>did not lose anything,</b> i.e., the guarantor received nothing from the wife, and he nevertheless accepted responsibility for the payment of the marriage contract. The husband therefore vows in order that others should not be discouraged from performing this mitzva.
<b>But</b> in the case of <b>a buyer, since he knows that each and every</b> married man <b>has upon him</b> the potential obligation to pay <b>a marriage contract, why should he go and purchase</b> a field from the husband when there is a lien on it due to the marriage contract? Since <b>it is he who caused himself to lose</b> out, it is unreasonable to prevent the husband from remarrying his wife merely for the benefit of the buyer.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who consecrates his property and there was</b> an outstanding debt of <b>the marriage contract of</b> his <b>wife and</b> of <b>a creditor, the woman may not collect</b> the payment of <b>her marriage contract from the Temple</b> treasury, <b>nor may the creditor</b> collect <b>his debt. Rather, the one who redeems</b> the property <b>redeems</b> it for a cheap price <b>in order to give the woman her marriage contract</b> payment <b>and the creditor his debt.</b> For example, if <b>one consecrated</b> property worth <b>nine thousand dinars and his debt was ten thousand dinars,</b> leaving no property for redemption, the creditor lends <b>an additional dinar</b> to the debtor <b>and</b> the debtor <b>redeems the property</b> with that dinar, <b>in order to give the woman her marriage contract</b> payment <b>and the creditor his debt.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to state</b> that <b>the one who redeems, redeems,</b> i.e., why isn’t the property given directly to the creditor without redemption? The Gemara answers: This is <b>due to</b> the explanation <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The property is redeemed <b>so that</b> people <b>will not say</b> that <b>consecrated</b> property <b>exits</b> to non-sacred status <b>without redemption.</b>
The mishna teaches that if one consecrated property worth nine thousand dinars and his debt was ten thousand dinars, the creditor lends an additional dinar to the debtor for him to redeem the property. The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If his debt corresponded</b> to the value of <b>his consecrated</b> property, then the debtor <b>redeems</b> the property in the manner prescribed in the mishna.
<b>But if</b> the value of the consecrated property is <b>not</b> enough to cover the debt, <b>he does not redeem</b> the property in this manner. Instead, it must be redeemed in accordance with its value. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, up to what amount</b> may the property be redeemed in the manner described in the mishna? <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> The consecrated property must be worth <b>at</b> least <b>half</b> of the debt. If the property is worth less, it may be redeemed only in accordance with its monetary value.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> (21a): With regard to those <b>obligated</b> to pay <b>valuations,</b> the court <b>repossesses their</b> property to pay their debt to the Temple treasury; nevertheless, the treasurer <b>gives him</b> permission to keep <b>food</b> sufficient for <b>thirty days, and garments</b> sufficient for <b>twelve months,</b> and <b>a bed made</b> with linens, <b>and his sandals, and his phylacteries.</b> The treasurer leaves these items <b>for him, but</b> he does <b>not</b> leave items <b>for his wife or for his children.</b>
<b>If</b> the one obligated to pay <b>was a craftsman,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him</b> permission to keep <b>two tools of</b> his <b>craft of each and every type,</b> e.g., for <b>a carpenter,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him</b> permission to keep <b>two adzes [<i>matzadin</i>] and two saws. Rabbi Eliezer says: If he was a farmer,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him</b> permission to keep <b>his pair</b> of oxen with which he plows the field. If he was <b>a donkey driver,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him</b> permission to keep <b>his donkey.</b>
If <b>one had many</b> tools of <b>one type and few</b> tools of <b>one</b> other <b>type,</b> e.g., three adzes and one saw, <b>he</b> may <b>not say</b> to the treasurer <b>to sell</b> one tool <b>of the</b> type of which he has <b>many and to purchase</b> for him one tool <b>of the</b> type of which he has <b>few. Rather,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him two</b> tools <b>of the type</b> of which he has <b>many and</b> he retains <b>whatever he has of the</b> type of which he has <b>few.</b> In contrast to one whose property is repossessed to pay valuations, from <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his property,</b> the treasurer <b>takes his phylacteries,</b> as they are included in the category of all his property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the treasurer leaves him with all of the tools mentioned in the mishna? The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>that</b> the <b>verse states:</b>

Daf 24a

<b>“But if he be too poor for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). The word “he” [<i>hu</i>] is interpreted as a variation of <i>havaya</i>, existence or sustenance. In this manner the verse can be read as an instruction to the treasurer: <b>Sustain him from</b> that which he is obligated to pay for <b>your valuation.</b>
The mishna teaches that food and garments are left for him, <b>but not for his wife or his children.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The verse states: “If <b>he be</b> too poor <b>for your valuation,”</b> which indicates that <b>he</b> must be sustained <b>from your valuation, but his wife and his children are not</b> sustained <b>from your valuation.</b>
The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>if he was a farmer,</b> the treasurer <b>gives him his pair</b> of oxen; if he was a donkey driver, the treasurer gives him his donkey. The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> why do they rule that these animals are repossessed? The Gemara responds: According to the Rabbis, <b>these</b> animals <b>are not tools of</b> his <b>craft; rather, they are</b> his <b>property.</b>
The mishna teaches that if <b>one had</b> many tools of <b>one type</b> that he was allowed to keep and few tools of one other type, e.g., three adzes and one saw, the treasurer does not sell tools of the type of which there are many in order to purchase for him tools of the type of which he has few. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious? Just as</b> it was <b>sufficient for him until now</b> to work with one saw, <b>now too</b> a single saw should be <b>sufficient for him.</b>
The Gemara explains that the ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>until now, when he was</b> capable of <b>lending</b> one of his many adzes, if he required an additional saw someone <b>would lend</b> one <b>to him,</b> whereas <b>now that</b> his property has been repossessed <b>there is no</b> one <b>who will lend</b> such a tool <b>to him,</b> when he has nothing to offer in exchange. Consequently, the treasurer should <b>not</b> leave him with only one saw, but he should sell some of his adzes in order to purchase an additional saw. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that there is no concern that he might not be able to borrow a tool.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his property,</b> the treasurer <b>takes his phylacteries.</b> The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain man who sold his property. He came before Rav Yeimar,</b> who <b>said to</b> the members of the court: <b>Remove his phylacteries</b> from his head and his arm and give them to the buyer, as they are included in his property. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this incident <b>teaching us? It is</b> an explicit ruling of the <b>mishna:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his property,</b> the treasurer <b>takes his phylacteries.</b>
The Gemara explains: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that it is only <b>there,</b> when one consecrates his property, that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> that his phylacteries are taken, <b>as he thinks</b> to himself: <b>I am performing a mitzva,</b> and therefore he intended for his phylacteries to be included. <b>But with regard to a sale, a person</b> would <b>not sell</b> an item used for <b>a mitzva that</b> he performs with <b>his body</b> without explicitly stating so. The Gemara therefore <b>teaches us</b> by means of the above incident that phylacteries are included in the property of such a sale.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Both</b> in the case of <b>one who consecrates his property and</b> the case of <b>one who valuates himself,</b> when the Temple treasurer repossesses his property he <b>has</b> the right to repossess <b>neither the garment of his wife nor the garment of his children, nor the dyed</b> garments <b>that he dyed for their sake,</b> even if they have yet to wear them, <b>nor the new sandals that he purchased for their sake.</b>
<b>Although</b> the merchants <b>said: Slaves are sold in their garments for profit, as if</b> a fine <b>garment</b> worth <b>thirty dinars would be purchased for him,</b> his sale price <b>appreciates by one hundred dinars; and likewise</b> with regard to <b>a cow, if one waits</b> to sell <b>it until the market [<i>la’itlis</i>]</b> day, when demand is high, <b>its</b> sale price <b>appreciates; and likewise</b> with regard to <b>a pearl, if one brings it to</b> sell it in <b>the city,</b> where demand is high, <b>its</b> sale price <b>appreciates;</b> nevertheless, one does not make such a calculation in this case. Rather, <b>the Temple treasury has</b> the right to collect the item based <b>only</b> on <b>its</b> current <b>location and its</b> price at the present <b>time.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that the Temple treasury has the right to collect the item based only on its current location and its present time, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, with regard to the redemption of a consecrated item: <b>“And he shall give your valuation as of that day”</b> (Leviticus 27:23). The phrase “as of that day” indicates <b>that he should not delay</b> the sale of <b>a pearl for the light</b> ones, i.e., for poor people, in order that they should take it to the city to sell it. Rather, it is appraised according to its present location. The verse continues: <b>“As a holy thing unto the Lord,”</b> which teaches that <b>unspecified</b> vows of <b>consecration,</b> e.g., when one states: My property is consecrated, are given <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> rather than to the priests.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may neither consecrate</b> an ancestral field, i.e., a field that he inherited, <b>less than two years before the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>nor may one redeem</b> such a field <b>less than one year after the Jubilee</b> Year. When redeeming an ancestral field that has been consecrated, the sum paid to redeem the field is calculated based on the number of years remaining until the Jubilee Year. When performing this calculation, <b>one does not count months</b> of a partial year in order to lower the price to be paid <b>to the Temple</b> treasury; rather, he pays for the entire year. <b>But the Temple</b> treasury may <b>count months</b> in order to raise the price of redemption, as will be explained.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one may not consecrate an ancestral field less than two years before the Jubilee Year. <b>And</b> with regard to this, the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may consecrate</b> an ancestral field <b>both before the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and after the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>But during the Jubilee Year itself, one may not consecrate</b> it, <b>and if he</b> nevertheless did <b>consecrate</b> it, <b>it is not consecrated.</b> Although consecration of an ancestral field is ineffective during the Jubilee Year, it is clear that such a field may be consecrated at any time prior to the start of the year.
In response, <b>Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> The mishna means that <b>one may not consecrate</b> an ancestral field for it <b>to be redeemed with a deduction,</b> i.e., such that the redemption price will be reduced to reflect the number of years remaining until the Jubilee Year, <b>less than two years</b> before the Jubilee Year. If such a field is consecrated less than two years before the Jubilee, it is redeemed according to its full valuation, as though it had been consecrated and redeemed immediately after the Jubilee. <b>And since one may not consecrate</b> an ancestral field for it <b>to be redeemed with a deduction less than two years</b> before the Jubilee, the mishna teaches that <b>a person should be concerned about his property, and should</b> therefore <b>not consecrate</b> an ancestral field <b>less than two years</b> before the Jubilee.
§ It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates his field during the Jubilee Year itself, Rav says:</b> It <b>is consecrated, and</b> if he wishes to redeem it he <b>gives</b> the full valuation of <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>, i.e., fifty silver biblical shekels, per unit of area required for sowing one <i>kor</i> of seed [<i>beit kor</i>], <b>and Shmuel says:</b> It <b>is not consecrated at all,</b> and therefore it is not redeemed for any sum.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this: Granted, with regard to</b> the <b>sale</b> of an ancestral field during the Jubilee Year, it is logical <b>that Shmuel disagrees with Rav</b> and maintains that such a sale is invalid, as one <b>can say</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> a field that was <b>already sold</b> before the Jubilee Year <b>leaves</b> the possession of the buyer and returns to the original owner <b>now</b> in the Jubilee Year, then with regard to a field <b>that has not been sold, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that it cannot</b> be <b>sold</b> during the Jubilee Year?
<b>But here,</b> with regard to the consecration of a field during the Jubilee Year, <b>can</b> one <b>say</b> such an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (25b): If one consecrated his ancestral field and the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived and it was not redeemed</b> by the owner, the <b>priests enter into</b> the field <b>and give its</b> redemption <b>payment</b> to the Temple treasury; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Since a field that was consecrated before the Jubilee Year does not return to its original owner without redemption, one cannot infer that if one consecrates his field during the Jubilee Year itself, it returns to him without redemption.
The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that the priests <b>enter</b> into the field, <b>but they do not give</b> its redemption value to the Temple treasury. According to this opinion, a field consecrated before the Jubilee Year leaves the possession of the Temple treasury without redemption during the Jubilee Year, and therefore by <i>a fortiori</i> inference, if it was consecrated during the Jubilee Year, it does not require redemption.

Daf 24b

<b>And Rav holds:</b> Even in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, no <i>a fortiori</i> inference may be drawn, as <b>ultimately, does</b> the field <b>return to the owner</b> during the Jubilee Year? It does not, but rather it <b>leaves</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and is given <b>to the priests.</b> Therefore, there is no basis for an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as a field consecrated before the Jubilee Year does not return to the owner during the Jubilee Year, <b>and the priests receive</b> their portion <b>from the table of the Most High.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav</b> that consecration of a field during the Jubilee Year is effective and that the field must be redeemed for the full price of fifty <i>sela</i> per <i>beit kor</i>? <b>As the verse states: “If</b> he sanctifies his field <b>from the Jubilee Year,</b> according to your valuation it shall stand” (Leviticus 27:17). The verse indicates that a field is redeemed according to the valuation mentioned in the preceding verse, i.e., fifty <i>sela</i> per <i>beit kor</i>, <b>and the Jubilee Year</b> itself <b>is included</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, as the verse describes a period that begins “from the Jubilee Year,” which can be understood as including the Jubilee Year itself.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Shmuel</b> refute this claim? The Gemara explains that Shmuel would respond: <b>Is it written</b> in the verse: <b>If</b> he sanctifies his field <b>during the Jubilee Year?</b> No, instead: <b>“From the Jubilee Year,” is written,</b> indicating that the verse is referring to consecration beginning <b>from the year that is after the Jubilee</b> Year.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rav, this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in the verse: <b>“If</b> he sanctifies his field <b>from the Jubilee Year,</b> according to your valuation it shall stand. <b>But if</b> he sanctifies his field <b>after the Jubilee,</b> then the priest shall reckon for him the money according to the years that remain until the Jubilee Year, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:17–18). According to Rav’s interpretation, the second verse is referring to the year immediately following the Jubilee Year. <b>But according to Shmuel,</b> who maintains that the first verse is dealing with the year following the Jubilee Year, to <b>what</b> is the verse referring when it speaks of the year <b>“after the Jubilee”?</b> The Gemara responds: It is referring to the year <b>after</b> the year <b>after</b> the Jubilee Year.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may consecrate</b> an ancestral field <b>both before the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and after the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>But during the Jubilee Year itself, one may not consecrate</b> it, <b>and if he</b> nevertheless did <b>consecrate</b> it, that field <b>is not consecrated.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rav</b> could <b>say to you:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means that <b>it is not consecrated</b> in order to be redeemed <b>with a deduction. But</b> nevertheless it is <b>consecrated, and</b> one <b>gives</b> the full price of <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i> per <i>beit kor</i> for its redemption.
The Gemara objects: One can conclude <b>by inference</b> from this response <b>that</b> according to Rav, when the <i>baraita</i> states that a field may be consecrated <b>before the Jubilee</b> Year, it means that it is <b>consecrated to be redeemed with a deduction. But</b> wasn’t it stated that <b>Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that <b>one may not consecrate</b> an ancestral field <b>to be redeemed with a deduction less than two years</b> before the Jubilee Year, but rather it is redeemed according to the total valuation of the field? If so, Rav could not have responded as suggested above.
Rather, <b>Rav</b> could <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that whenever the verse employs an expression such as: From the first day, the first day itself is not included. Accordingly, when the verse states: “If he sanctifies his field from the Jubilee Year,” the Jubilee Year is not included. <b>But I stated</b> my ruling that a field may be consecrated during the Jubilee Year <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says:</b> The verse states: “Whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel” (Exodus 12:15). It states: “From the <b>first</b> day,” <b>and</b> the <b>first</b> day <b>is included,</b> and it continues: “Until the <b>seventh</b> day,” <b>and</b> the <b>seventh</b> day is also <b>included. Here too,</b> the verse states: “If he sanctifies his field <b>from</b> the Jubilee <b>Year,” and the Jubilee Year is included.</b>
The mishna (25a) teaches that when one redeems an ancestral field, he gives a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i>, which is equivalent to one forty-eighth of a <i>sela</i>, per <i>beit kor</i> for each year remaining until the Jubilee Year. This amount is close to one forty-ninth of the total valuation of fifty <i>sela</i>, and there are no tannaitic disputes with regard to this mishna. The Gemara therefore asks: <b>If</b> Rav holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, that one may consecrate an ancestral field during the Jubilee Year, <b>what is the purpose of</b> the additional <b><i>pundeyon</i></b> that one gives for each remaining year until the Jubilee? If the Jubilee Year itself is included in the calculation, the total price of fifty <i>sela</i> should be divided evenly, i.e., one <i>sela</i> should be paid for each remaining year of the fifty years.
<b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not</b> require the addition of a <i>pundeyon</i> for each remaining year, that is difficult: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>consecrated</b> the field <b>two or three years before the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>he gives a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i></b> per year? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that the <b>fiftieth year is counted</b> both <b>for this</b> cycle <b>and for that</b> one, i.e., he maintains that the Jubilee Year is also considered the first year of the next cycle. Accordingly, there are actually only forty-nine years in a Jubilee cycle, and the total valuation of a field is therefore divided into forty-nine parts, which comes out to a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i> for each year.
The Gemara objects: <b>According to Shmuel,</b> who maintains that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi concedes that an ancestral field may not be consecrated during the Jubilee Year, <b>let him say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda and hold that the fiftieth year is not counted as the first year of the following cycle. <b>Because if</b> he holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then he <b>should require</b> one to pay <b>a <i>sela</i> and two <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> i.e., one forty-eighth of the total valuation of a field, per year, as there are only forty-eight years during which one may consecrate a field. The Gemara explains: This is indeed the case. <b>Perforce, according to Shmuel, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Shmuel from the mishna: <b>Nor may one redeem</b> an ancestral field that was consecrated <b>less than one year after the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>Granted, according to Shmuel,</b> who says that one may not consecrate an ancestral field during the Jubilee Year itself, and therefore if a field was consecrated during the Jubilee Year it requires no redemption at all, the mishna is teaching that <b>one may not redeem</b> a field <b>less than one year after</b> the <b>Jubilee,</b> i.e., until the year after the Jubilee, as it cannot be consecrated until then. <b>But according to Rav,</b> who maintains that a field may be consecrated and redeemed during the Jubilee Year itself, <b>what</b> does the mishna mean when it states that one may not redeem a field less than one <b>year after</b> the <b>Jubilee?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Do you maintain</b> that the mishna is referring to the <b>actual</b> year <b>after</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year? This is not the case; rather, to <b>what</b> is the phrase: <b>After</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year, actually referring?

Daf 25a

It is referring to any year <b>in the middle of</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> cycle. The mishna’s statement should be read as follows: After the Jubilee Year, one may not redeem a field for less than the price of a year, meaning <b>that as long as a year has not been completed, he does not deduct it</b> from the price of redemption. For example, if there are five and a half years remaining until the Jubilee Year, he must give six <i>sela</i> and six <i>pundeyon</i> for its redemption, not five and a half of each of a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching us?</b> Is he saying <b>that one does not count months</b> in order to lower the price to be paid <b>to the Temple</b> treasury? Such an interpretation is untenable, as <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught explicitly</b> in the following line of the mishna: <b>One does not count months</b> in order to lower the price to be paid <b>to the Temple</b> treasury. The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> is not attempting to teach a separate <i>halakha</i> here. Rather, he <b>employs</b> the style known as: <b>What is the reason,</b> and the mishna is to be read as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>one may not redeem</b> a field <b>after</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year with <b>less than</b> the price of a complete <b>year?</b> It is <b>because one does not count months</b> in order to lower the price to be paid <b>to the Temple</b> treasury.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One does not count months</b> in order to lower the price to be paid to the Temple treasury, but the Temple treasury may count months in order to raise the price of redemption. With regard to this statement, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not count months</b> in order to lower the price to be paid <b>to the Temple</b> treasury? <b>The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the money according to the years that remain</b> until the Jubilee Year, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18). This teaches that <b>you</b> are to <b>calculate years, but you</b> are <b>not</b> to <b>count months.</b>
Furthermore, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that if you,</b> i.e., the priest representing the Temple treasury, <b>want to consider months as a year</b> so that it will be considered as though a complete year has passed, you may <b>do</b> so? And <b>what are the circumstances</b> in which the priest would want to do this? <b>For example,</b> in a case <b>where one consecrated</b> the field <b>in the middle of</b> the <b>forty-eighth</b> year and wishes to redeem it. In such a case, if the months that have passed are calculated as a complete year, then the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the redemption of a field in the year preceding the Jubilee Year is in effect, and the field must be redeemed according to its full valuation of fifty <i>sela</i> per <i>beit kor</i>, rather than the redemption price of two <i>sela</i> and two <i>pundeyon</i> per <i>beit kor</i> that would apply if the calculation were based on two years remaining until the Jubilee.
From where is this <i>halakha</i> derived? <b>The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him,”</b> which indicates that the priest reckons for him <b>in any case,</b> i.e., the calculation is to be performed according to his discretion.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who consecrates</b> his ancestral <b>field during a period</b> when <b>the Jubilee</b> Year is observed and wishes to redeem it, <b>he gives</b> the Temple treasury <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>, a talmudic measure referred to in the Bible as <b>silver shekels, for</b> an area required for <b>sowing a <i>ḥomer</i>,</b> a measure known in talmudic terminology as one <i>kor</i>, of <b>barley seed</b> (see Leviticus 27:16). If <b>there were crevices [<i>neka’im</i>] ten handbreadths deep</b> in the field, <b>or</b> if there were <b>boulders ten handbreadths high,</b> then when calculating the redemption price those areas <b>are not measured with</b> the rest of the field. But if the depth of the crevices, or the height of the boulders, was <b>less than that</b> amount, <b>they are measured with</b> the rest of the field.
If <b>he consecrated</b> the field <b>two or three years before the Jubilee</b> Year and wishes to redeem it, <b>he gives</b> the Temple treasury <b>a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> a pundeyon being one forty-eighth of a <i>sela</i>, <b>per year</b> remaining until the Jubilee Year. <b>And if he said: I will give</b> the payment <b>for each year during</b> that <b>year, one does not listen to him; rather, he</b> must <b>give</b> the <b>entire</b> sum <b>in one</b> payment. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>both</b> with regard to a case where <b>the owner</b> redeems the field <b>and</b> a case where <b>any</b> other <b>person</b> redeems the field. <b>What</b> then <b>is</b> the difference <b>between</b> redemption by <b>the owner and</b> redemption by <b>any</b> other <b>person?</b> It is <b>only that the owner gives</b> an extra <b>one-fifth</b> in addition to the payment, <b>and any</b> other <b>person</b> who redeems the field <b>does not give</b> the additional <b>one-fifth.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase: “The sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:16), is referring to an area required for sowing one <b><i>kor</i>,</b> thirty <i>se’a</i>, of barley <b>seed, and not</b> an area that yields one <b><i>kor</i></b> of barley <b>crop,</b> which is significantly smaller. This area is measured according to a field <b>sowed by hand and not sowed by oxen.</b> Since oxen sow the field by pulling a planter, which spreads the seeds at a higher density, the area containing one <i>kor</i> sown by oxen is smaller than the area of one <i>kor</i> sown by hand. <b>Levi taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The area is <b>not</b> measured according to the sowing of a particularly <b>dense</b> layer of seeds, <b>nor</b> a <b>sparse</b> layer, <b>but</b> rather in accordance with <b>an average</b> amount of seeds.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>there were crevices</b> ten handbreadths <b>deep</b> in the field, they are not measured with the rest of the field. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let them be consecrated by themselves,</b> as they are fit for sowing, and therefore they should require redemption at the same rate as the rest of the field. Accordingly, one could simply measure the field together with the crevices, and the measurement will be equal to the sum total of the sizes of the field and any crevices.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna is referring to crevices that together take up only a small area, and <b>since they do not</b> measure <b>a <i>beit kor</i> they are not consecrated,</b> that cannot be correct: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man shall sanctify for the Lord part of his ancestral field” (Leviticus 27:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Field”? Since it is stated</b> in the same verse: “Your valuation shall be according to its sowing; <b>the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver,”</b> one might say: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> when <b>he consecrated</b> a field <b>like this,</b> i.e., one measuring at least a <i>beit kor</i>. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> fields that are fit for sowing only <b>a half<i>-kor</i>  or half of a half-<i>kor</i>, a <i>se’a</i> or a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>vetarkav</i>], or</b> even <b>half of a half-<i>se’a</i>? The verse states: “Field,”</b> indicating that one may consecrate a field <b>in any case,</b> regardless of size.
<b>Mar Ukva bar Ḥama said: Here,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to crevices</b> that are <b>full</b> of <b>water, which are not fit for sowing.</b> Accordingly, they are not measured with the field, as the verse states that the valuation is in accordance with the areas fit for sowing barley seeds. The language <b>is also precise, as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to crevices <b>similar</b> to the way he teaches that <b>of boulders,</b> which are also not fit for sowing, as it states: If there were crevices ten handbreadths deep or boulders ten handbreadths high. <b>Conclude from</b> this that the mishna is referring to crevices unfit for sowing.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then when the difference in height between the field and the crevices or boulders is <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, they should <b>also</b> not be measured with the field. Why does the mishna indicate that they are measured with the field in this case? The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> crevices less than ten handbreadths deep <b>are called cracks of the ground,</b> and these boulders less than ten handbreadths tall <b>are called spines of the ground.</b> As there is no great disparity in surface level between them and the field itself, they are deemed part of the field and are therefore measured with it, despite the fact that they are unfit for sowing.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>he consecrated</b> the field <b>two or three years</b> before the Jubilee Year and wishes to redeem it, he gives the Temple treasury a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i> per year. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the verse: “But if he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon for him the money according to the years that remain until the Jubilee Year, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18).
The <i>baraita</i> states that the apparently superfluous phrase <b>“And a deduction shall be made from your valuation”</b> teaches that <b>even</b> the years that passed <b>from the consecration</b> of the field are deducted, and not only the years that passed before it was consecrated. <b>That</b> is, <b>if the Temple</b> treasury <b>benefited</b> from the field’s produce for <b>a year or two, or</b> if the Temple treasury <b>did not benefit</b> from it <b>but</b> the field nevertheless <b>remained before it,</b> i.e., in the possession of the Temple treasury, <b>he gives a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i> for</b> each remaining <b>year</b> until the Jubilee Year.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if he said: I will give</b> the payment for each year during that year, one does not listen to him; rather, he must give the entire sum in one payment. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if the owner said: I will give</b> the payment <b>for each year during</b> that <b>year, that one does not listen to him? The verse states: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the money”</b> (Leviticus 27:18). The term “the money” indicates that the priest does not reckon the price for him <b>unless all of</b> the <b>money will be</b> paid together <b>as one</b> sum. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>both the owner and any</b> other <b>person. What</b> then <b>is</b> the difference <b>between</b> redemption by <b>the owner and</b> redemption by <b>any</b> other <b>person?</b> It is <b>that the owner gives</b> an extra <b>one-fifth</b> in addition to the payment, <b>and any</b> other <b>person does not give</b> the additional <b>one-fifth.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one consecrated</b> his ancestral field <b>and</b> then <b>redeemed it</b> himself, <b>it is not removed from his possession</b> to be divided among the priests <b>during the Jubilee</b> Year. If <b>his son redeemed it,</b> the field <b>is removed</b> from the son’s possession and returns <b>to his father during the Jubilee</b> Year. But if <b>another</b> person <b>or one of his</b> other <b>relatives redeemed</b> the field <b>and</b> the owner subsequently <b>redeemed it from his possession,</b> the field is <b>removed</b> from the owner’s possession and given <b>to the priests during the Jubilee</b> Year.
If <b>one of the priests redeemed</b> the field <b>and</b> when the Jubilee arrived <b>it</b> was <b>in his possession, he may not say: Since it is removed</b> from the possession of the one who redeemed it and given <b>to the priests during the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> since <b>it is</b> already <b>in my possession, it is mine. Rather,</b> the field <b>is removed from his possession and is divided among all his brethren, the priests.</b>

Daf 25b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one consecrated his ancestral field and his son redeemed it from the Temple treasury, the field returns to the original owner when the Jubilee arrives. By contrast, if another person redeemed it, the field is transferred to the priests during the Jubilee Year. With regard to this matter, <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> analyzing the verse: “And if he will not redeem the field, or if he sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy for the Lord, as a dedicated field; his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:20–21).
The phrase “and <b>if he will not redeem the field”</b> is referring to a case where the <b>owner</b> did not redeem it and it remained in the possession of the Temple treasury, and the phrase <b>“or if he sold the field”</b> is referring to a situation where the Temple <b>treasurer</b> sold it to another person. The verse indicates that in both of these instances, possession of the field goes to the priests.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“To another man,”</b> indicates that the field is transferred to the priests during the Jubilee Year only if it had been sold <b>to another, and not to</b> the <b>son</b> of the one who consecrated it. The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse is referring <b>to another and not to</b> his <b>son? Or</b> perhaps the verse means <b>only</b> that it was sold <b>to another and not to</b> his <b>brother?</b> The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>When it says: “Man,”</b> the <b>brother is stated,</b> i.e., he is included in the category of a man. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“Another</b> man”? It must mean: Another, <b>but not</b> his <b>son.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see to include the son</b> in the same category as the father, <b>and to exclude the brother?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include the son, as he stands in place of his father with regard to designating</b> a Hebrew maidservant as a wife for himself, in a case where the father purchased the Hebrew maidservant and designates her as a wife for his son, which he cannot do for his brother. <b>And</b> he also stands in place of his father <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave,</b> as when one inherits a Hebrew slave from his father, the slave is obligated to serve the son and does not go free, whereas if the deceased’s brother inherits the servant, he goes free.
The <i>baraita</i> objects: <b>On the contrary, I</b> should <b>include the brother, as he stands in his brother’s place with regard to levirate marriage,</b> which a son does not. The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>Is there ever a case of levirate marriage other than a case where there is no son? In a case where there is a son there is no levirate marriage.</b> This indicates that with regard to levirate marriage as well, a son stands in place of the deceased more than a brother of the deceased.
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to answer the question in this way? Let one <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the son stands in place of the father, and the brother does not, from the simple fact <b>that here,</b> in support of extending the father’s status to the son, there are <b>two</b> justifications, i.e., the <i>halakha</i> of designation of the Hebrew maidservant and the <i>halakha</i> of the Hebrew slave, <b>and there,</b> in support of extending it to the brother, there is only <b>one</b> justification, i.e., the <i>halakha</i> of levirate marriage?
The Gemara responds: That answer is invalid <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a son, but not a brother, stands in place of his father with regard to <b>a Hebrew slave</b> is not written explicitly in the Torah, but the <i>tanna</i> <b>also derives it from this</b> same <b>refutation,</b> namely: <b>Is there ever a case of levirate marriage other than a case where there is no son.</b> Without this refutation there would not be more justifications in support of extending the father’s status to the son rather than to the brother. Accordingly, this last refutation is the basis for the conclusion.
§ <b>Rabba bar Avuh raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>a daughter</b> redeemed the ancestral field that her father consecrated, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does <b>she</b> thereby <b>preserve</b> possession of the <b>field for her father</b> at the Jubilee Year, like a son? Rabba bar Avuh explains the two sides of the dilemma: Perhaps the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>since with regard to levirate marriage, a son and a daughter</b> are <b>like one another,</b> as both <b>exempt</b> their father’s widow from the obligation of levirate marriage, the daughter <b>preserves</b> possession of the field for her father. <b>Or perhaps</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>since with regard to inheritance, when</b> there is <b>a son, a daughter is considered like another</b> person, as she does not inherit a share of her father’s estate, she <b>does not preserve</b> possession of the field for her father.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> <b>that the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anyone who is</b> considered like <b>another</b> person <b>when</b> there is <b>a son</b> does not preserve possession of the field for the owner. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this,</b> i.e., a daughter, <b>as well, when</b> there is <b>a son,</b> she is <b>considered like another</b> person.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>a woman</b> consecrated her ancestral field, <b>which</b> of her heirs can redeem the field and thereby <b>preserve</b> possession of the <b>field for her</b> during the Jubilee Year? Can her <b>husband preserve</b> it <b>for her, as</b> he <b>inherits</b> from <b>her</b> if she dies during his lifetime? <b>Or perhaps</b> her <b>son</b> can <b>preserve</b> if <b>for her, as</b> if the son inherits from his mother, when she was not married at the time of her death, he <b>takes</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> to her <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed?</b> There is a <i>halakha</i> that if someone dies and his heir is a woman who is already deceased, her son inherits that property, not her late husband. No resolution is offered, and therefore the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma</b> before <b>Rav Ḥisda:</b> If one <b>consecrated</b> his ancestral field <b>less than two years before the Jubilee</b> Year and did not redeem it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether or not <b>it is</b> to be <b>removed</b> from his possession during the Jubilee and given <b>to the priests?</b>
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: What is your reasoning?</b> Is it that since the verse states: <b>“And a deduction shall be made from your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:18), which indicates that the field is redeemed with a deduction according to the years remaining until the Jubilee Year, and the verse also states: <b>“But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee,</b> shall be holy for the Lord…his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), this indicates <b>that</b> if the field <b>is fit for deduction,</b> then <b>yes,</b> when it is not redeemed by the owner it is given to the priests at the Jubilee Year, but with regard to a field <b>that is not fit for deduction,</b> i.e., one consecrated less than two years before the Jubilee Year, which must be redeemed according to its full valuation (24a), <b>no,</b> it is not given to the priests but rather is returned to the owner?
Rav Ḥisda responds: <b>On the contrary,</b> the verse states: “And <b>if he will not redeem the field,</b> or if he sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. <b>But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee,</b> shall be holy for the Lord…his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:20–21). This indicates that any field that could have been redeemed but was not redeemed becomes the possession of the priests. <b>And this</b> field, which was consecrated less than two years before the Jubilee Year, <b>is also fit for redemption.</b> Therefore, if it was not redeemed it is given to the priests.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one of the priests redeemed</b> the field and when the Jubilee Year arrived it was in his possession, he may not say: Since it is removed from the possession of the one who redeemed it and given to the priests during the Jubilee Year, and since it is already in my possession, it is mine. Rather, the field is removed from his possession and is divided among all of his brethren, the priests. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state:</b> “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy for the Lord…<b>his ancestral possession shall be for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21)?
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From where</b> is it derived, <b>with regard to a field that</b> was consecrated and not redeemed by the owner, and therefore <b>was</b> to have been <b>removed</b> from the possession of the owner and given <b>to the priests during the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and one of the priests redeemed it</b> before the Jubilee, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that he may not say: Since it is removed</b> from the possession of the owner and given <b>to the priest</b> at the Jubilee, <b>and</b> since it is already <b>in my possession,</b> it <b>should</b> therefore <b>be mine? And this</b> claim is supported by <b>a logical inference:</b> Since in the Jubilee Year <b>I obtain</b> fields <b>of others</b> that I did not previously redeem, is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear <b>that</b> I should retain <b>my own</b> field that I redeemed from the Temple treasury myself?
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His ancestral possession,”</b> which can be interpreted to mean that only <b>his ancestral</b> field, i.e., one that the priest inherited from his own ancestors, is automatically his, <b>but this</b> field <b>is not his. How so,</b> i.e., how is this field treated? <b>It is removed from his possession and is divided among</b> all of <b>his brethren, the priests.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one consecrated his ancestral field and the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived and it was not redeemed</b> by the owner or anyone else, <b>the priests enter into</b> the field <b>and give its</b> redemption <b>payment</b> to the Temple treasury; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: They enter</b> into the field, <b>but they do not give</b> its redemption payment to the Temple treasury.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The priests <b>do not enter</b> into the field, <b>and</b> they also <b>do not give</b> its redemption payment to the Temple treasury. <b>Rather,</b> the field remains in the possession of the Temple treasury, and <b>it is called: An abandoned field, until the second Jubilee</b> Year. If <b>the second Jubilee arrived and it was</b> still <b>not redeemed, it is called: An abandoned</b> field from among the <b>abandoned</b> fields, meaning one that was abandoned twice, <b>until the third Jubilee.</b> In any case, <b>the priests never enter into</b> a consecrated field during the Jubilee Year <b>until another</b> person <b>redeems it</b> first.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion that the priests who enter into an unredeemed consecrated field during the Jubilee Year must give its redemption payment to the Temple treasury? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> from a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“holy”</b> stated in reference to an ancestral field, and the word <b>“holy”</b> that appears with regard to one who <b>consecrates a house.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to one who consecrates a house, where the verse states: “And when a man shall consecrate his house to be holy for the Lord” (Leviticus 27:14), it can be redeemed from the Temple treasury only <b>by</b> payment of <b>money,</b> as the verse concludes: “As the priest shall value it, so shall it stand,” <b>so too here,</b> where the verse states with regard to the priests entering into an ancestral field: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy for the Lord…his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), the priests can enter the field only <b>by</b> payment of <b>money.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the source for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that the priests are not required to give the redemption payment to the Temple treasury? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the word <b>“holy”</b> used with regard to an ancestral field, and the word <b>“holy”</b> used with regard to the communal peace offering of two <b>lambs</b> that accompanies the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>. Just as there,</b> with regard to the offering of two lambs, where the verse states: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest” (Leviticus 23:20), the lambs are given to the priests <b>for free,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all offerings to which members of the priesthood are entitled, <b>so too here,</b> the consecrated and unredeemed ancestral field is given to the priests <b>for free.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda, let him also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> by a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the two <b>lambs</b> brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i>.</b> Why does he disagree with Rabbi Shimon? The Gemara answers: <b>One derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to items <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance,</b> such as an ancestral field,

Daf 26a

<b>from</b> that of other items <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance,</b> e.g., a consecrated house, <b>but one does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to items <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance from</b> items that are <b>consecrated</b> for the <b>altar,</b> such as the two lambs brought on <i>Shavuot</i>.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let Rabbi Shimon also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> one who <b>consecrates a house.</b> Why does he disagree with Rabbi Yehuda? The Gemara explains: <b>One derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an <b>item that</b> is <b>a gift to the priests,</b> such as an ancestral field that is given to the priests during the Jubilee Year, <b>from</b> that of another <b>item that is a gift to the priests,</b> i.e., the two lambs brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>but one does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an <b>item that is a gift to the priests from</b> that of an <b>item that is not a gift to the priests,</b> i.e., a consecrated house.
§ The mishna teaches that if one consecrates his ancestral field and it is not redeemed before the Jubilee, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The priests <b>do not enter</b> into the field, <b>and</b> they also <b>do not give</b> its redemption payment to the Temple treasury. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the priests do not obtain possession of a consecrated field during the Jubilee Year unless another person redeemed it first.
<b>Rabba said: What is the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion? It is because the <b>verse states:</b> “And if he will not redeem the field, or if he sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy for the Lord, as a dedicated field; his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:20–21). According to Rabba, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that these verses teach two separate <i>halakhot</i>, and should be read as follows: <b>“And if he will not redeem the field…it shall not be redeemed anymore,”</b> as an ancestral field, and: <b>“Or if he sold the field…But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee…</b>his ancestral possession shall be for the priest.” Accordingly, if the field has not yet been sold to another man, it is not transferred to the priests during the Jubilee.
<b>Abaye said:</b> Does <b>a sharp knife cut</b> through the <b>verses,</b> that they may be interpreted by reading the words out of order? <b>Rather, Abaye said: The reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Since the verse states: “And if he will not redeem the field, or if he sold the field to another man, <b>it shall not be redeemed,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this means <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> at all by its owner, even <b>for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field,</b> which remains in his possession until the Jubilee. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Anymore,”</b> indicating that <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> in order for it <b>to</b> return to <b>the way it was,</b> i.e., to regain the status of an ancestral field, <b>but it</b> may be <b>redeemed for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field.</b>
Abaye continues: According to this <i>baraita</i>, of <b>when,</b> i.e., about which time period, is the verse speaking? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a redemption occurring <b>during the first Jubilee</b> cycle in which the field was consecrated, then <b>why may it not be redeemed</b> in order for it to return to the way it was? At that point, <b>it is even</b> redeemable as <b>an ancestral field,</b> because if the owner redeems it then, it is not removed from his possession during the Jubilee Year. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> interprets the verse as referring to a redemption occurring <b>during the second Jubilee</b> cycle.
<b>And according to whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>according to</b> either <b>Rabbi Yehuda or Rabbi Shimon,</b> this cannot be correct, as according to them, the field <b>leaves</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and is given <b>to the priests</b> during the first Jubilee Year, after which it may no longer be redeemed. <b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who maintains that the field remains in the possession of the Temple treasury until it is redeemed, even during a subsequent Jubilee cycle? <b>And</b> consequently, <b>conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion is <b>from here,</b> i.e., from the superfluous term “anymore.”
The Gemara asks: <b>And can you understand</b> the <i>baraita</i> this way? If so, then <b>what do Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon derive from this</b> term: <b>“Anymore”? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be understood in accordance with their opinions as well, and <b>what are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> an ancestral <b>field</b> whose owner consecrated it and did not redeem it, <b>which left</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and was given <b>to the priests</b> during the first Jubilee Year; <b>and</b> the <b>priest</b> who received the field then <b>consecrated it, and</b> then the original <b>owner came to redeem it</b> from the Temple treasury.
It might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> Since the owner failed to redeem this field during the first Jubilee cycle, <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> by him at all, even <b>for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Anymore,”</b> indicating that <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> in order for it <b>to</b> return to <b>the way it was,</b> i.e., an ancestral field, <b>but it</b> may be <b>redeemed for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field,</b> which remains in his possession only until the Jubilee Year.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who consecrated a purchased field and redeemed it, since the verse states: <b>“In the Jubilee Year the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought”</b> (Leviticus 27:24), one <b>might</b> have thought that the field <b>shall return to the</b> Temple <b>treasurer, from whom he bought it</b> when he redeemed it. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> immediately afterward: <b>“To the one to whom the possession of the land belongs,”</b> i.e., it goes to the ancestral owner who initially sold the field to the one who consecrated it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If so, <b>let</b> the verse simply <b>state: “To the one to whom the possession of the land belongs.” Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> first: <b>“To the one from whom it was bought”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: The verse is referring to an ancestral <b>field</b> whose owner consecrated it and did not redeem it, <b>which left</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and was given <b>to the priests</b> during the Jubilee Year, <b>and</b> the <b>priest</b> who received the field then <b>sold it</b> to another, <b>and</b> the <b>buyer</b> then <b>consecrated it, and another</b> person <b>redeemed it</b> from the Temple treasury. One <b>might</b> have thought that when the next Jubilee arrives, <b>it shall return to the original owner.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “In the Jubilee Year the field shall return <b>to the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought,”</b> indicating that the field is returned to the priest who sold the field.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it <b>was necessary</b> for the Torah to write: <b>“It shall not be redeemed,” and</b> it <b>was</b> also <b>necessary</b> for it <b>to write: “To the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought,”</b> despite the fact both phrases apparently teach the same <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that after a consecrated ancestral field is left unredeemed and given to the priests during the Jubilee Year, it never returns to the original owner.
The Gemara explains: <b>Because if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“It shall not be redeemed,”</b> one might have thought that the field does not return to the original owner only in a case where the priest consecrates the field and the original owner redeems it, <b>as</b> an ancestral field that is consecrated by its owner and redeemed by another <b>does not return at all,</b> but is divided among the priests. <b>But here,</b> where the priest sold the field that he received and the field was consecrated by the buyer as a purchased field and subsequently redeemed by another, <b>as</b> the field <b>does return</b> to its owner in the Jubilee Year, perhaps <b>it should return to its original owner,</b> and not the priest. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “To the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought,”</b> indicating that it returns to the priest.
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“To the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought,”</b> one might have thought that the field does not return to its original owner during the Jubilee Year only in a case where the priest sold it and the buyer consecrated it, <b>as the owner did not give</b> any <b>payment for</b> the field to the Temple treasury. <b>But here,</b> where the priest consecrated the field and its original owner redeemed it, <b>as he gives payment for</b> the field to the Temple treasury, perhaps <b>it should remain in his hands</b> as his ancestral field. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “It shall not be redeemed.”</b>
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“It shall not be redeemed,” and did not write: “Anymore,” I would say</b> that <b>it shall not be redeemed at all,</b> as its original owner failed to redeem it during the first Jubilee cycle. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Anymore,”</b> to indicate that <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> in order for it <b>to</b> return to <b>the way it was,</b> i.e., an ancestral field, <b>but it</b> may be <b>redeemed for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it?</b> In other words, now that both suggestions have been rejected, what is the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that a consecrated ancestral field that has not been redeemed by the Jubilee Year is not given to the priests? <b>Rava said</b> that the <b>verse states: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee,</b> shall be holy for the Lord, as a dedicated field; his ancestral possession shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). The term “when it goes out” indicates that it is given to the priests only <b>when it goes out</b> during the Jubilee Year <b>from the possession of another</b> person, who redeemed it from the Temple treasury.

Daf 26b

§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: According to Rabbi Eliezer, if the <b>owner</b> consecrated his ancestral field and failed to redeem it before the first Jubilee Year, but he redeemed it <b>during the second Jubilee</b> cycle, is he <b>considered like another</b> person who redeemed the field, in which case it is given to the priests at the following Jubilee Year, <b>or not,</b> i.e., as the one who ultimately redeemed the field first was the owner, does it remain in his possession as it would have if he had redeemed it during the first Jubilee cycle?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from the following <i>baraita</i>: Since the verse states: “And if he will not redeem the field, or if he sold the field to another man, <b>it shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:20), one <b>might</b> have thought that this means <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> at all by its owner, even <b>for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Anymore,”</b> indicating that <b>it shall not be redeemed</b> in order for it <b>to</b> return to <b>the way it was,</b> i.e., an ancestral field, <b>but it</b> may be <b>redeemed for it to be</b> treated <b>for him like a purchased field.</b>
The Gemara continues: According to this <i>baraita</i>, of <b>when,</b> i.e., about which time period, is the verse speaking? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a redemption that occurs <b>during the first Jubilee</b> cycle, in which the field was consecrated, <b>why may it not be redeemed</b> in order for it to return to the way it was?

The Gemara asks: <b>And can you understand</b> the <i>baraita</i> this way? If so, <b>what do Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon derive from this</b> term: <b>“Anymore”? Rather, what are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> an ancestral <b>field</b> whose owner consecrated it and did not redeem it, <b>which left</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and was given <b>to the priests</b> at the first Jubilee Year; <b>and</b> the <b>priest</b> who received the field subsequently <b>consecrated it, and</b> then the original <b>owner came to redeem it</b> from the Temple treasury.

<b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who consecrated a purchased field and redeemed it, since the verse states: “In the Jubilee Year <b>the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought”</b> (Leviticus 27:24), one <b>might</b> have thought that the field <b>shall return to the</b> Temple <b>treasurer, from whom he bought it</b> when he redeemed it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the one to whom the possession of the land belongs,”</b> i.e., the ancestral owner.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If so, <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state: “To the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: The verse is referring to an ancestral <b>field that</b> was consecrated and not redeemed, and which therefore <b>left</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and was given <b>to the priests</b> at the Jubilee Year, <b>and</b> the <b>priest</b> who received the field then <b>sold it</b> to another, <b>and</b> the <b>buyer</b> then <b>consecrated it, and another</b> person <b>redeemed it</b> from the Temple treasury.

The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it <b>was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write: “It shall not be redeemed,” and</b> it <b>was</b> also <b>necessary</b> for it <b>to write: “To the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought,” because if the Merciful One had written</b> merely: <b>“It shall not be redeemed,”</b> one might have thought that the field does not return to the original owner only in a case where the priest consecrates the field and the original owner redeems it, <b>as</b> an ancestral field that is consecrated by its owner and redeemed by another <b>does not return at all.</b> But in a case where the priest sold the field to another and the buyer consecrated it, perhaps it should return to its original owner. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “To the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought,”</b> indicating that it returns to the priest.
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> merely: <b>“To the one</b> from whom <b>it was bought,”</b> one might think that the field does not return to its original owner at the Jubilee Year only in a case where the priest sold it and the buyer consecrated it, <b>as the owner did not give</b> any <b>payment for</b> the field to the Temple treasury. <b>But here,</b> where the priest consecrated the field and its original owner redeemed it, <b>as the owner gives payment for</b> the field to the Temple treasury, one might have thought <b>that it should remain in his hands,</b> as his ancestral field.

The Gemara asks: Since it has been established that the term “anymore” is necessary according to all opinions, <b>what</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> the original dilemma with regard to whether the owner is considered like another person during the second Jubilee cycle? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If the <b>owner redeemed it during the second Jubilee</b> cycle, it <b>leaves</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and is given <b>to the priests during the Jubilee</b> Year.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: But we did not learn this</b> interpretation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion in the mishna. Instead, the mishna states that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The priests</b> never <b>enter into</b> a consecrated field during the Jubilee Year <b>until another</b> person <b>redeems it</b> first. This indicates that if the owner, rather than any other person, is the one who ultimately redeems the field, it remains in his possession even if he did so during the second Jubilee cycle. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>During the second Jubilee</b> cycle, the <b>owner</b> is <b>considered like another</b> person.
<b>Some say</b> a different version of the <i>baraita</i> and ensuing discussion: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If the owner <b>redeemed it during the second Jubilee</b> cycle, it <b>does not leave</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and is not given <b>to the priests during the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> Why must a proof be brought from this <i>baraita</i>? <b>We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The priests</b> never <b>enter into</b> a consecrated field during the Jubilee Year <b>until another</b> person <b>redeems it</b> first. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If</b> a proof is learned <b>from the mishna</b> alone <b>I would say</b> that <b>during the second Jubilee</b> cycle the <b>owner</b> is <b>considered like another</b> person. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that according to Rabbi Eliezer the owner is not considered like another person, and the field returns to him as an ancestral possession.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who purchases</b> an ancestral <b>field from his father, and his father</b> subsequently <b>died and afterward</b> the son <b>consecrated it, its</b> halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>an ancestral field,</b> as he inherited his father’s ancestral rights prior to the consecration. Consequently, the field’s redemption price is calculated on the basis of fifty <i>sela</i> per <i>beit kor</i>, and if another redeems it instead of the son, it is given to the priests during the Jubilee Year. But if the son <b>consecrated</b> the field <b>and afterward his father died, its</b> halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a purchased field,</b> whose redemption price is based on its monetary value, and which will return to the ancestral owner, i.e., the son, at the Jubilee; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> Even in a case where the son consecrated the field before his father died, <b>its</b> halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>an ancestral field, as it is stated</b> with regard to a purchased field: “And <b>if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to <b>a field that is not due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> field, <b>which</b> at the time of consecration <b>is due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field</b> in the future, when his father dies.
The mishna continues: <b>A purchased field</b> that was consecrated <b>is not removed</b> from the possession of the Temple treasury and given <b>to the priests during the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>as</b> the purchase of the land was valid only until the Jubilee, at which point fields return to their ancestral owners, and <b>a person cannot consecrate an item that is not his. The priests and the Levites may always consecrate</b> their ancestral fields <b>and may always redeem</b> their ancestral fields, <b>both before the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and after the Jubilee</b> Year.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who purchases</b> an ancestral <b>field from his father and consecrated it, and afterward his father died, from where</b> is it derived <b>that it shall be</b> treated <b>for him like an ancestral field? The verse states: “And if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to <b>a field that is not due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> field that he purchased from his father, <b>which</b> at the time of consecration <b>is due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says: From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>one who purchases</b> an ancestral <b>field from his father, and his father died and afterward he consecrated</b> the field, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that it shall be</b> treated <b>for him like an ancestral field? The verse states: “And if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral field.”</b> This teaches that <b>a field that is not an ancestral field</b> at the time of consecration is deemed a purchased field, thereby <b>excluding this</b> field, <b>which is</b> at this point <b>an ancestral field.</b> But according to Rabbi Meir, a field that at the time of consecration is merely due to become an ancestral field in the future is deemed a purchased field.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this: That Rabbi Meir,</b> who requires a derivation from the verse to teach the <i>halakha</i> that if the son consecrates the field after his father’s death it is not treated as a purchased field, <b>holds</b> that <b>acquisition</b> of an item for <b>its produce is tantamount</b> to <b>acquisition of the item itself.</b> Accordingly, as the son owned the plot as a purchased field prior to his father’s death, his ownership remained unchanged when his father died. Therefore, the verse is required to teach that upon the father’s death the field’s status changes to that of an ancestral field.
In contrast, let us say that <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that <b>acquisition</b> of an item for <b>its produce is not tantamount</b> to <b>acquisition of the item itself.</b> Accordingly, his ownership of the field became absolute only upon his father’s death. Consequently, there is no need for a derivation from the verse for such a case, and the derivation is therefore applied to the case where the son consecrated the field before his father’s death.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: In general, according to Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda, acquisition</b> of an item for <b>its produce is tantamount</b> to <b>acquisition of the item itself.</b> Consequently, they also require the derivation from the verse to teach that if the father died before the son consecrated the field, it is treated as an ancestral field and not as a purchased field.

Daf 27a

<b>But here,</b> with regard to their opinion that even if the son consecrated the field before his father’s death it is considered an ancestral field, this is because they <b>found</b> another allusion in the <b>verse and interpreted</b> it as follows: If the verse meant to indicate only the <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Meir derives from it, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> And <b>if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not his ancestral field, or: Which is not an ancestral field. What</b> is the meaning of the extra word “of” in the phrase: “Which is not <b>of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22)? It teaches that only <b>a field that is not due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field</b> is treated like a purchased field, thereby <b>excluding this</b> field, <b>which is due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The priests and the Levites may always consecrate</b> their ancestral fields and may always redeem their ancestral fields, both before the Jubilee Year and after the Jubilee Year. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna’s statement that they <b>may</b> always <b>redeem</b> their ancestral fields <b>was necessary,</b> in order <b>to exclude</b> them <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to the ancestral field <b>of an Israelite, which may be redeemed only until</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year, and if not redeemed by then, it is given to the priests. In contrast, the mishna <b>teaches us that priests and Levites may always redeem</b> their fields. <b>But</b> with regard to the statement that they <b>may</b> always <b>consecrate</b> their fields, <b>why</b> does the mishna <b>specifically</b> mention <b>priests and Levites? Even an Israelite</b> may always consecrate his field, both before and after the Jubilee Year.
The Gemara continues: <b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna means that priests and Levites may consecrate their fields <b>during the Jubilee Year itself,</b> whereas an Israelite may not, <b>this works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says</b> (24a) that if an Israelite consecrated his field <b>during the Jubilee Year itself it is not consecrated.</b> Accordingly, the mishna <b>teaches us that priests and Levites may always consecrate</b> their fields, even in the Jubilee Year itself. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, why</b> does the mishna <b>specifically</b> mention <b>priests and Levites? Even an Israelite</b> may consecrate his field during the Jubilee.
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> one may similarly ask: <b>Why do I</b> need the statement that priests and Levites may consecrate their fields <b>both before the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and after the Jubilee</b> Year? Doesn’t the mishna already state that they may always consecrate their fields? <b>Rather, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in the <b>first</b> mishna in this chapter (24a) that Israelites may not consecrate their fields less than two years <b>before the Jubilee and</b> they may not redeem them less than one year <b>after the Jubilee,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> in the <b>latter</b> mishna that priests and Levites may consecrate their fields <b>both after the Jubilee and before the Jubilee,</b> despite the fact that there is no novelty in this statement.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in the <b>first</b> mishna that Israelites <b>may neither consecrate</b> their fields less than two years before the Jubilee <b>nor redeem</b> them less than one year after the Jubilee, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> in the <b>latter</b> mishna that priests and Levites <b>may</b> always <b>consecrate and redeem</b> their fields, despite the fact that there is no novelty with regard to consecrating in this statement either, as Israelites may also consecrate their fields both after the Jubilee and before the Jubilee.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who consecrates his</b> ancestral <b>field during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is not</b> observed, and therefore the field is not redeemed according to a fixed rate of fifty shekels per <i>beit kor</i> but according to its value, when the treasurer announces the sale of the field <b>he says to</b> the owner: <b>You open</b> the bidding <b>first;</b> how much do you offer for its redemption? This method is advantageous for the Temple treasury, <b>as the owner gives</b> an additional payment of <b>one-fifth</b> of the value of the field, <b>and every</b> other <b>person does not give</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment.
There was <b>an incident involving one who consecrated his field due to its inferior quality.</b> The treasurers <b>said to him: You open</b> the bidding <b>first. He said:</b> It is <b>hereby mine for an <i>issar</i>,</b> a small sum. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: That</b> person <b>did not say</b> he would purchase it <b>for an <i>issar</i>; rather,</b> he said he would purchase it <b>for an egg, as consecrated</b> items <b>may be redeemed with money or with the equivalent</b> value of <b>money.</b> The treasurer <b>said to him:</b> The field <b>has come into your</b> possession based on your bid. As <b>a result, he loses an <i>issar</i> and his field</b> remains <b>before him</b> in his possession.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that with regard to <b>one who consecrates his</b> ancestral <b>field during a period</b> when the Jubilee Year is not observed, the treasurer says to him: You open the bidding first. The Gemara asks: Why does the treasurer merely <b>say</b> this to him? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the treasurer <b>forces</b> him to open the bidding? The Gemara responds: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: The treasurer <b>says</b> to him? It means that the treasurer <b>forces</b> him to open the bidding. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>initially</b> the treasurer <b>says</b> to him that he should open the bidding; <b>if he complies, he complies; and if not,</b> the treasurer <b>forces</b> him to comply.
The mishna teaches that the one who consecrated the field opens the bidding, <b>as the owner gives</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment whereas others do not give an additional one-fifth payment. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna state that the reason he opens the bidding is <b>specifically</b> because <b>the owner gives</b> an additional <b>one-fifth? Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive</b> it from the reason <b>that since</b> the field <b>is dear to</b> the owner <b>he</b> would <b>increase</b> his bid <b>and redeem it</b> for a higher price. <b>And furthermore,</b> doesn’t the <b>mitzva of redemption</b> begin <b>with the owner</b> of the field by Torah law?
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> there are <b>another</b> two reasons: <b>One</b> reason is <b>that since it is dear to him he</b> would <b>increase</b> his bid <b>and redeem it</b> for a higher price; <b>another</b> reason is that the <b>mitzva of redemption</b> begins <b>with the owner; and another</b> reason is that <b>the owner gives</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment and every other person does not give an additional one-fifth payment.
§ The mishna teaches: There was <b>an incident involving one who consecrated his field,</b> which was causing him a loss due to its low quality. The treasurers said to him: You open the bidding first. He said: It is hereby mine for an <i>issar</i>. Rabbi Yosei says: That person did not say he would purchase it for an <i>issar</i>; rather, he said he would purchase it for an egg, as consecrated items may be redeemed with money or with the equivalent value of money. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say they disagree about this, that Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the <b>equivalent</b> value of <b>money</b> is the same <b>as money, and the Rabbis hold</b> that the <b>equivalent</b> value of <b>money</b> is <b>not</b> the same <b>as money.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we maintain</b> as an accepted principle <b>that</b> the <b>equivalent</b> value of <b>money</b> is the same <b>as money?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that the <b>equivalent</b> value of <b>money</b> is the same <b>as money, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>one may redeem with an item one-fifth of whose</b> value is <b>not worth one <i>peruta</i>. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>one may redeem</b> with <b>an <i>issar</i>,</b> which is worth eight <i>perutot</i>, <b>as one-fifth of its</b> value is greater than <b>the value of one <i>peruta</i>, and Rabbi Yosei</b> holds that <b>one may even redeem</b> with an item <b>such as an egg,</b> despite the fact that one-fifth of its value is not worth one <i>peruta</i>.
The mishna relates that after the owner made his bid the treasurer <b>said to him:</b> The field <b>has come into your</b> possession based on your bid. As <b>a result, he loses an <i>issar</i> and his field</b> remains <b>before him</b> in his possession. The Gemara notes: This statement, whose source is <b>unspecified,</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that in the incident in the mishna, the man redeemed the field with an <i>issar</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one said:</b> The field is <b>hereby mine for ten <i>sela</i>, and one</b> other person <b>said:</b> It is mine <b>for twenty, and one said for thirty, and one said for forty, and one said for fifty;</b> and then the one who bid <b>fifty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i> and the field is redeemed by the one who bid forty. This ensures that the Temple treasury does not lose. If the one who bid <b>forty</b> <i>sela</i> subsequently <b>reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i> and the field is redeemed by the one who bid thirty.
If the one who bid <b>thirty</b> subsequently <b>reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i> and the field is redeemed by the one who bid twenty. If the one who bid <b>twenty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i> and it is redeemed by the one who bid ten. If the one who bid <b>ten reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>sells</b> the field <b>at its value and collects the remainder from</b> the property <b>of the one</b> who bid <b>ten,</b> to complete the sum of ten <i>sela</i>.
If <b>the owner says</b> he will pay <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and any</b> other <b>person says</b> he will pay <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, the offer of <b>the owner takes precedence, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> he <b>adds one-fifth.</b> If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one</b> other person <b>said:</b> The field <b>is hereby mine for</b> a payment of <b>twenty-one</b> <i>sela</i>,

Daf 27b

<b>the owner gives twenty-six</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field. He pays the twenty that he initially offered; plus five <i>sela</i>, which is one-fifth of the total future sum, i.e., one-quarter of his initial offer. In addition, he adds one <i>sela</i>, the difference between his initial offer and that of the other person, so that the Temple treasury will not receive less than the twenty-one <i>sela</i> offer proposed by the other person. If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another person said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-two</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives twenty-seven</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field.
If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-three</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives twenty-eight</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field. If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-four</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives twenty-nine</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field. If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-five</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>as</b> the owner adds one-fifth only to the amount that he bid, and <b>does not add one-fifth to the addition of that</b> other person.
If the owner said he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one</b> other person <b>said:</b> The field is <b>hereby mine</b> for a payment <b>of twenty-six</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>if the owner wished to pay thirty-one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and a dinar the owner takes precedence; and if not,</b> the treasurer <b>says to the other person:</b> The field <b>has come into your</b> possession based on your bid, as it is more than the Temple treasury can compel the owner to pay.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one said: The field is mine for ten <i>sela</i>, and another said for twenty, and another said thirty, and another said forty, and yet another said fifty; and then the one who bid fifty reneged on his offer, the treasurer repossesses from his property up to ten <i>sela</i>, and it is redeemed by the one who bid forty. In this manner, the Temple treasury does not lose. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the treasurer repossesses ten <i>sela</i> from the one who initially offered fifty <i>sela</i> <b>only when the one who</b> offered <b>forty stands in his place</b> and intends to purchase the field, as the Temple treasury would have lost only ten <i>sela</i>.
<b>But</b> if <b>the one who</b> offered <b>forty does not stand in his place,</b> i.e., he too reneged on his offer, then the additional amount they had offered is <b>divided between</b> the one who initially offered fifty and the one who offered forty, as follows: The one who offered fifty pays all ten of the difference between fifty and forty, but he must also pay half of the extra ten that is the difference between the offer of forty and the previous offer of thirty. The reason is that the one who bid fifty agreed to that extra ten that raised the price from thirty to forty. In sum, the one who offered fifty pays fifteen, and the one who said forty pays five.
The Gemara raises an objection to the statement of Rav Ḥisda from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If the one who bid <b>forty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>. The Gemara explains the objection: According to Rav Ḥisda, there is a difficulty: <b>Why</b> does the mishna rule that his property is repossessed by ten <i>sela</i>? <b>Let the one who</b> offered <b>fifty give together with him,</b> and therefore the one who offered forty should give only five. The Gemara responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there is no one who</b> offered <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara further objects: The mishna also teaches that if the one who bid <b>thirty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>. But according to Rav Ḥisda, <b>why</b> is only his property repossessed? <b>Let</b> the one <b>who</b> offered <b>forty give together with him.</b> The Gemara again responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there is no one who</b> offered <b>forty</b> <i>sela</i>. The Gemara persists: The mishna states that if the one who bid <b>twenty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>. According to Rav Ḥisda, <b>why</b> is only his property repossessed? <b>Let</b> the one <b>who</b> offered <b>thirty give together with him.</b> Once again, the Gemara responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there is no one who</b> offered <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If the one who bid <b>ten reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>sells</b> the field <b>at its value and collects the remainder from</b> the property <b>of the one</b> who bid <b>ten,</b> to complete the sum of ten <i>sela</i>. Why is payment collected only from the one who offered ten? <b>Let the one who</b> offered <b>twenty give together with him. And if you would say that here too, there is no one who</b> offered <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, then <b>if so,</b> why does the mishna state: And <b>collects from</b> the one who bid <b>ten?</b> The mishna <b>should have</b> stated simply: And <b>collects from him,</b> as there is no one else who submitted an offer.
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when the potential loss incurred by the Temple treasury is divided, they reneged on their offers <b>simultaneously;</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the mishna, where only one individual must cover the loss, two individuals reneged <b>one after the other.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>all of them reneged at once they divide</b> the potential loss incurred by the Temple treasury <b>between them.</b> Now <b>didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>, without any mention of a division? <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that when two individuals renege on their offers simultaneously they divide the loss between them? The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is the case.
The Gemara notes that <b>there are</b> those <b>who raise</b> this <i>baraita</i> as a contradiction: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if the one <b>who</b> bid <b>ten reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>sells</b> the field <b>at its value and collects the remainder from</b> the property <b>of the one</b> who bid <b>ten. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>they divide</b> the potential loss to the Temple treasury <b>between them? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> they reneged on their offers <b>simultaneously,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the mishna, two individuals reneged <b>one after the other.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>the owner says</b> he will pay <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and any</b> other <b>person says</b> he will pay <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, the owner’s offer takes precedence because he adds one-fifth. The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> an offer of the owner, which perforce includes an additional <b>one-fifth,</b> is <b>preferable</b> to a higher offer for the principal submitted by another? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:3): If one is unable to transport his second-tithe produce to Jerusalem to consume it there, the produce is redeemed and the redemption money is spent on food in Jerusalem. If <b>the owner</b> of second tithe <b>says</b> he will redeem it <b>for one <i>sela</i> and one</b> other <b>says</b> he will redeem it <b>for one <i>sela</i> and one <i>issar</i>,</b> the offer <b>of one <i>sela</i> and one <i>issar</i> takes precedence, because he adds to the principal.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Here, where the</b> additional <b>one-fifth is a gain of the Temple</b> treasury, a calculation that includes the <b>one-fifth</b> is <b>preferable.</b> By contrast, <b>there, where the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> belongs to <b>the owner,</b> i.e., the Temple treasury gains nothing from it, as the redemption money for second-tithe produce belongs to the owner and must be taken to Jerusalem for him to spend it there, <b>let the principal be redeemed</b> for <b>a proper</b> sum, and <b>we do not care</b> about the additional <b>one-fifth.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one</b> other person <b>said:</b> The field <b>is hereby mine for</b> a payment of <b>twenty-five</b> <i>sela</i>, the owner <b>gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let the owner say: A man has come in my place [<i>baḥarikin</i>]</b> to redeem the field, as even when accounting for the one-fifth that I must add, my offer stands at twenty-five <i>sela</i>, identical to this man’s offer. Why, then, am I forced to redeem the field for a greater sum? The Gemara responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where the owner</b> initially <b>said</b> he would pay twenty <i>sela</i> and an additional <b>dinar,</b> one-quarter of one <i>sela</i>. When the additional one-fifth is taken into account, the owner’s offer is greater than twenty-five <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> explicitly that he offered an additional <b>dinar.</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>tanna</i> was <b>not meticulous</b> with regard to the mention of small sums of money such as one dinar. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> was the <i>tanna</i> <b>not</b> meticulous? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna that in a case where one said: The field is hereby mine for a payment of twenty-six <i>sela</i>, <b>if the owner wished to pay thirty-one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and a dinar the owner takes precedence? Rather, Rava said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where the owner said</b> he would redeem it for twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one <i>peruta</i>, and</b> the <i>tanna</i> was <b>not meticulous</b> with regard to mentioning such a tiny sum.
§ The mishna teaches that even when the owner must give the amount offered by the second person for the field, he adds one-fifth only to the amount that he himself bid, <b>as he does not add one-fifth to the addition</b> of the other person. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the owner does not add one-fifth to the addition of the other person <b>only when</b> the <b>consecrated</b> property <b>was not appraised by three</b> people. <b>But</b> if the <b>consecrated</b> property <b>was appraised by three</b> people, and the field was found to be worth the amount offered by the other person, the owner <b>does add</b> one-fifth to the addition of the other person.
The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> the owner <b>adds</b> one-fifth to the addition of the other person <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> the owner <b>does not add</b> that one-fifth. The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is discussing a case where the field was <b>not appraised</b> by three people, then <b>what is the reasoning of Beit Shammai</b> for their ruling that the owner must add one-fifth to the addition of the other person? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>appraised</b> by three people and the appraisal matched the offer of the other person. The owner must therefore add one-fifth to the addition of that other person.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say that Rav Ḥisda says</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> This is difficult, as there is a principle that the <i>halakha</i> is ruled in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel. The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>not appraised</b> by three people, <b>and Beit Shammai are stringent</b> and rule that the owner must nevertheless add one-fifth to the addition of the other person. Rav Ḥisda rules in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel that the owner adds one-fifth to the addition of the other person only when the field was appraised by three people.
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>appraised</b> by three people and the appraisal matched the offer of the other person; <b>and</b> one should <b>reverse</b> the opinions, i.e., <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that even in such a case the owner <b>does not add</b> one-fifth to the addition of the other person. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, <b>let</b> the dispute <b>be taught alongside</b> the other rare instances of <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel</b> (see tractate <i>Eduyyot</i>, chapters 4 and 5). Yet, this dispute does not appear there. <b>Rather,</b> one must accept the previous answer, that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>actually</b> discussing a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>not appraised</b> by three people, <b>and Beit Shammai are stringent.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that in a case where the owner offers to pay twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one</b> other person <b>said:</b> The field is <b>hereby mine for twenty-six</b> <i>sela</i>, if the owner wished to pay thirty-one <i>sela</i> and a dinar, the owner takes precedence. The Gemara elaborates: If the owner <b>wished</b> to pay the additional sum, then <b>yes,</b> he redeems the field, but if the owner <b>did not wish</b> to do so, <b>no,</b> he is not forced to redeem it.
The Gemara explains that the reason is that the owner can <b>say: A man has come in my place</b> to redeem the field for a higher sum, since even when accounting for the additional one-fifth that I must give, my offer amounts to a total of only twenty-five <i>sela</i>, whereas this other person has offered to pay twenty-six. Nevertheless, if the owner chooses to redeem the field, he gives the other person’s offer, twenty-six <i>sela</i>, plus an additional one-fifth of his initial offer, for a total of thirty-one <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> the additional <b>dinar</b> that the owner gives, <b>what is its purpose? Rav Sheshet said this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: If the owner wished from the outset to give</b> based on <b>a calculation that reaches thirty-one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and</b> one <b>dinar,</b> the owner takes precedence.

Daf 28a

<b>What are the circumstances</b> of such an offer? It is in a case <b>where</b> the owner initially <b>said</b> he would purchase the field <b>for twenty-one</b> <i>sela</i>. In such an instance, the additional one-fifth amounts to five <i>sela</i> and one dinar, which means that the total payment of the owner is twenty-six <i>sela</i> and one dinar, greater than the offer of the other person. Accordingly, <b>the owner takes precedence,</b> and when the one-fifth is added to the twenty-six <i>sela</i> offer of the other person, the total price paid by the owner is equal to thirty-one <i>sela</i> and one dinar. <b>And if</b> the payment of the owner does <b>not</b> exceed the offer of the other person even when accounting for the additional one-fifth, then the treasurer <b>says to</b> the other person: The field <b>has come into your</b> possession.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>dedicate,</b> for sacred or priestly use, some <b>of his flock and</b> some <b>of his cattle, and</b> some <b>of his Canaanite slaves and maidservants, and some of his ancestral field. But if he dedicated all</b> that he has <b>of</b> any type of property, <b>they are not dedicated,</b> i.e., the dedication does not take effect; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: If for the Most High a person may not dedicate all his property,</b> it is <b>all the more so</b> the case <b>that a person should spare his property</b> and not give all of it to others.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> stated in the mishna, derived? The Gemara explains that this is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: “Notwithstanding, no dedicated thing that a man may dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of his ancestral field” (Leviticus 27:28). The verse indicates that one may dedicate <b>“of all that he has” but not all that he has;</b> likewise <b>“of man” but not every man,</b> i.e., not every slave of his; “of man <b>or animal” but not every animal</b> of his; and finally one may dedicate <b>“of</b> his <b>ancestral field” but not all of</b> his <b>ancestral field.</b>
It <b>might</b> have been thought that <b>one may not dedicate</b> all his properties <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if he did dedicate</b> all of them, <b>they should be dedicated.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: “Notwithstanding,”</b> to teach that they are not dedicated. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: If for the Most High a person may not dedicate all his property,</b> it is <b>all the more so</b> the case <b>that a person should spare his property</b> and not give it all to others.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> with regard to all the categories in the verse. <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Of all that he has,” I would say</b> that <b>one may not dedicate all that he has, but let him dedicate all of one type</b> of property. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes “of man,”</b> to teach that he may <b>not</b> dedicate <b>every man.</b>
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“of man,”</b> one might say that he may not dedicate all of his slaves, <b>as it is not possible for him</b> to be <b>without</b> a slave to perform his <b>work; but</b> with regard to <b>a field, it is possible for him</b> to maintain a livelihood <b>by sharecropping [<i>distoran</i>]. And if</b> the Torah <b>had taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to only <b>these two</b> types, i.e., ancestral fields and slaves, one might say these may not be dedicated in their entirety <b>because here</b> there is <b>livelihood and here</b> there is also <b>livelihood. But</b> in the case of <b>movable property,</b> on which maintaining a livelihood does not depend, <b>let him dedicate all of them.</b> Therefore, all of these derivations <b>are necessary.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need for the verse to state “or <b>animal”?</b> The Gemara explains it is necessary <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>a person can dedicate his son or his daughter, his Hebrew slave or maidservant, or his purchased field.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “animal”</b> to teach that <b>just as an animal</b> is an item <b>that he has permission to sell, so too,</b> one can dedicate <b>any</b> item <b>that he has permission to sell.</b> He cannot dedicate an item that he does not have the ability to sell.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>his minor daughter, he has permission to sell her</b> as a Hebrew maidservant. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>he may dedicate her.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “animal,”</b> indicating that <b>just as an animal</b> is an item <b>that he always has permission to sell, so too,</b> one can dedicate <b>any</b> item <b>that he always has permission to sell,</b> whereas one may not sell his daughter once she reaches majority. A field as well can be sold only until the Jubilee Year.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: If for the Most High a person</b> may <b>not</b> dedicate all his property, it is all the more so the case that one should spare his property and not give it all to others. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer, who prohibits the dedication of all one’s property.
The Gemara responds: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the statement <b>of Rabbi Ila, as Rabbi Ila said: In Usha</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> that <b>one who dispenses</b> his money to charity <b>should not dispense more than a fifth.</b> Rabbi Eliezer, who did not state that one should spare his property, rules that one may give all his money to charity, provided he keeps a small portion for himself, whereas Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya maintains that one should not give more than a fifth.
The Gemara relates that there was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> individual <b>who sought to dispense more than a fifth</b> of his property as charity, <b>and his friend did not let him</b> act upon his wishes. <b>And who</b> was this friend? It was <b>Rabbi Yeshevav. And some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yeshevav</b> who wanted to give too much charity, <b>and his friend did not let him</b> do so. <b>And who was</b> the friend? It was <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who dedicates his son or his daughter, or his Hebrew slave or maidservant, or his purchased field,</b> those items <b>are not</b> considered <b>dedicated, as a person</b> may <b>not dedicate an item that is not his. Priests and Levites may not dedicate</b> their property; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: Priests may not dedicate</b> their property, <b>as</b> all <b>dedicated</b> property <b>is theirs;</b> it is one of the priestly gifts, as the verse states: “Everything dedicated in Israel shall be yours” (Numbers 18:14). <b>But Levites may dedicate</b> their property, <b>as dedicated</b> property <b>is not theirs.</b>
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard to land, as it is stated</b> about the land of the Levites: “But the fields of the open land surrounding their cities may not be sold, <b>as that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34), and they cannot renounce that land. <b>And the statement of Rabbi Shimon appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard to movable property,</b> which the Levites may dedicate, <b>as dedicated</b> property <b>is not theirs.</b> It is a gift for the priests, not the Levites.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> what is his reasoning? <b>Granted, priests may not dedicate</b> property, <b>as dedicated</b> property <b>is theirs;</b> it is one of the gifts of the priesthood. <b>But</b> why are <b>Levites</b> unable to dedicate their property? <b>Granted,</b> they may <b>not dedicate land, as it is written: “As that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34). <b>But let them dedicate movable property.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding, no dedicated thing, that a man may dedicate to the Lord <b>of all that he has,</b> whether of man or animal, <b>or of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the dedication of <b>movable property to</b> that of <b>land.</b> Accordingly, as Levites cannot dedicate land, they cannot dedicate movable property either.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> what is his reasoning? <b>Granted, priests</b> may not dedicate their property, <b>as we stated</b> above, because dedicated property is theirs. <b>But</b> why may <b>Levites</b> dedicate their property? <b>Granted, let them dedicate movable property, as</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>does not juxtapose</b> movable property to land. <b>But why</b> may Levites dedicate <b>land? Isn’t it written: That is their perpetual possession?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Shimon mean <b>when he says</b> Levites may dedicate property? He means they may dedicate only <b>movable property.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said the statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard to land, and the statement of Rabbi Shimon</b> appears to be correct <b>with regard to movable property; by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that Rabbi Shimon also says</b> Levites can dedicate their <b>land.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> that <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct even <b>to Rabbi Shimon with regard to land</b> belonging to Levites, <b>as even Rabbi Shimon disagrees</b> with Rabbi Yehuda about the ability of Levites to dedicate property <b>only with regard to movable property. But with regard to land,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>concedes to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that the Levites cannot dedicate it.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says:</b> One who <b>dedicated movable property may give it to any priest that he wishes, as it is stated: “Everything dedicated in Israel</b>

Daf 28b

<b>shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:14), i.e., for Aaron and any of his descendants. But if one <b>dedicated his fields, he gives them to a priest of that</b> priestly <b>watch</b> which is currently serving in the Temple, <b>as it is stated: “As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21). <b>And one derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“to the priest”</b> here and <b>“to the priest” from</b> a verse (Numbers 5:8) discussing property <b>robbed</b> from <b>a convert.</b> The <i>halakha</i> in that case is that if one took an oath that he did not rob a convert, and then after the convert died and left no descendants he admitted to taking a false oath, he must give the stolen property to the priests of the priestly watch currently serving in the Temple.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> in the case of property robbed from a convert, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it is given to the priests of the current priestly watch? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse: “But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, to the priest” (Numbers 5:8), the phrase: <b>“Shall be the Lord’s, to the priest,”</b> indicates that <b>God</b> has <b>acquired</b> the restitution for the guilt <b>and</b> has <b>given it to the priest of that</b> priestly <b>watch.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>Do you say</b> the restitution is given <b>to the priest of that</b> priestly <b>watch; or</b> perhaps <b>is it</b> necessary <b>only</b> for it to be given <b>to any priest to</b> whom the robber <b>wishes</b> to give it. The Gemara explains that <b>when</b> the same verse <b>says: “Besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him,”</b> this indicates that <b>the verse speaks of a priest of that priestly watch,</b> i.e., the watch that is currently involved in sacrificing offerings.
§ Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin states another <i>halakha</i> involving property that is given to the priests. With regard to <b>a field</b> that was consecrated by its owner and was not redeemed by him, <b>which goes out</b> of his possession and passes <b>to</b> the possession of <b>the priests at the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>one gives it to the</b> members of the priestly <b>watch</b> serving <b>when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>occurred,</b> i.e., the watch serving at the beginning of the Jubilee Year. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the beginning of the Jubilee Year <b>occurred on Shabbat,</b> which is the day on which the priestly watches rotate, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Which priestly watch receives the property? <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ami says in the name of Ḥulfana: One gives it to the watch that leaves</b> the service of the Temple on that Shabbat.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in accordance with these statements: <b>You are found</b> to <b>say</b> that <b>both the Jubilee</b> Year, when fields that were sold are returned to their owners, <b>and the Sabbatical</b> Year, when debts are canceled, <b>abrogate at once,</b> i.e., at the same time, <b>except that the Jubilee</b> Year abrogates <b>at its beginning and the Sabbatical</b> Year abrogates <b>at its end.</b> In other words, the evening of Rosh HaShana at the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year, which is the forty-ninth year of the Jubilee cycle, is also the beginning of the Jubilee Year, which is the fiftieth year. At this time, all debts and land purchases are abrogated, and consecrated fields that were not redeemed become the property of the priests. Accordingly, if Rosh HaShana occurs on a Shabbat, the priestly watch that ends their service receives the fields, as the priestly watches rotate only in the morning.
The Gemara questions the terminology of the <i>baraita</i>: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state: Except that? This statement indicates that the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee Year abrogate simultaneously despite the fact that the Jubilee Year abrogates at its beginning. <b>On the contrary,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is due to that</b> very reason, i.e., they abrogate simultaneously because the Jubilee Year abrogates at its beginning and the Sabbatical Year at its end. The Gemara explains that in fact one should <b>say</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: They abrogate at the same time, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the Jubilee</b> Year abrogates at its beginning and the Sabbatical Year at its end.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is clear that the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year abrogates <b>at its end, as it is written: “At the end of every seven years you shall make a release”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:1). <b>But</b> does the <b>Jubilee</b> Year abrogate <b>at its</b> very <b>beginning? It</b> abrogates only ten days later, <b>on Yom Kippur, as it is written: “On Yom Kippur shall you make proclamation with the shofar throughout all your land</b>…and you shall return every man to his possession” (Leviticus 25:9–10). The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who says: It is from Rosh HaShana that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>takes effect.</b>
The Gemara returns to the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin that one who dedicates his movable property may give it to a priest of his choosing, whereas one who dedicates his land gives it to members of the current priestly watch. The Gemara relates that <b>Ḥizkiyya bar Biluto heard this</b> statement <b>and went</b> and <b>said</b> the following difficulty <b>before Rabbi Abbahu: But let one juxtapose movable property to land,</b> as the verse states: “That a man may dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of his ancestral field” (Leviticus 27:28). If so, movable property must also be given to members of the current priestly watch.
Rabbi Abbahu responded: <b>Is it not</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As there are</b> those <b>who juxtapose and there are</b> those <b>who do not juxtapose,</b> in accordance with the earlier explanation of the Gemara that this is the basis for the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon with regard to whether or not Levites may dedicate movable property. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says we do not juxtapose</b> movable property and land.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Dedications</b> of property for <b>priests,</b> unlike consecrations of property for Temple maintenance, <b>have no redemption; rather, one gives</b> it <b>to the priests,</b> and it is their property in every sense, <b>like <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: Dedications</b> dedicated <b>without specification</b> of their purpose are designated <b>for Temple maintenance, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:28).
<b>And the Rabbis say: Dedications</b> dedicated <b>without specification</b> of their purpose are designated <b>for priests, as it is stated</b> with regard to one who consecrated a field and did not redeem it: <b>“As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21), indicating that a non-specific dedication belongs to the priest. <b>If so, why is it stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord”?</b> This comes to teach <b>that</b> dedication <b>takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity.</b> If one consecrated an animal for sacrifice and then dedicated it, the dedication takes effect. Nevertheless, it does not take effect on the body of the animal; rather, it applies to the owner’s financial stake in the offering.
As the Sages delineated: <b>A person may dedicate his sacrificial animals, both offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity. If</b> the offering he dedicated was the object of <b>a vow,</b> e.g., if he said: It is incumbent upon me to sacrifice a burnt offering, since he is obligated to replace such offerings they are considered his property, and therefore <b>he gives their value</b> to the priests.
<b>And if</b> the offering he dedicated was <b>a gift offering,</b> e.g., if he said: This animal is a burnt offering, in which case he is not obligated to replace the animal, <b>he gives</b> the monetary <b>benefit</b> that he has in <b>them.</b> For example, if he said: <b>This bull is a burnt offering, one estimates how much</b> money <b>a person</b> would be <b>willing to give</b> in order to <b>sacrifice</b> the animal as a voluntary <b>burnt offering, even though he is not permitted</b> to do so.
With regard to <b>a firstborn</b> animal, <b>whether</b> it is <b>unblemished</b> or <b>whether</b> it is <b>blemished,</b> its owner <b>may dedicate it. And how does one</b> assess the payment required to <b>redeem it? One estimates how much</b> an Israelite <b>person</b> would <b>be willing to give in</b> exchange for <b>that firstborn</b> in order <b>to give it to</b> a priest who is <b>his daughter’s son or to</b> a priest who is <b>his sister’s son.</b>

Daf 29a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: Dedications</b> of property for <b>priests have no redemption, and one gives</b> the property <b>to the priest.</b> With regard to these <b>dedications, as long as they</b> remain <b>in the house of the owner they are</b> considered <b>like consecrated</b> property <b>in every sense, as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:28). Once the owner <b>has given them to the priest they are in every sense like non-sacred</b> property, <b>as it is stated: “Everything dedicated in Israel shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:14), i.e., it shall be like all other regular property belonging to a priest, which is non-sacred.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says dedications</b> donated <b>without specification</b> are designated <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> as it is stated: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28). And the Rabbis say they are designated for priests, as it is stated: “As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), whereas the verse cited by Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira teaches that dedication takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> is clear, <b>as they explain their reason and the reason of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira,</b> i.e., they interpret the verse he cited as his proof. <b>But</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, this</b> verse: <b>“As a field dedicated;</b> its possession shall be to the priest,” <b>what does he do with it,</b> i.e., what does he derive from it?
The Gemara responds: The verse <b>is necessary for him for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the case of one who consecrated his ancestral field and failed to redeem it. This field becomes the possession of the priests at the Jubilee Year. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> at its end: <b>“As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a priest who consecrated his dedicated field,</b> i.e., a field that was dedicated by an Israelite and was given to him and he then consecrated it, and then the Jubilee Year arrived, <b>that he may not say: Since</b> a field that was consecrated by its owners and was not redeemed <b>goes out</b> of the owner’s possession and passes <b>to</b> the possession of <b>the priests at the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> this field that I consecrated <b>is</b> already <b>in my possession, it is</b> therefore <b>mine.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> this claim of the priest <b>is</b> based on <b>logical inference:</b> If <b>I acquire</b> the fields <b>of others</b> that were consecrated and not redeemed at the Jubilee Year, then with regard to <b>my own</b> property, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that I should acquire it? Therefore, <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to an ancestral field that one consecrated: <b>“As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest,”</b> which teaches that this priest does not acquire the field.
The <i>baraita</i> explains the derivation: <b>But what</b> have <b>we now learned</b> about a consecrated ancestral field <b>from a dedicated field?</b> In other words, the verse, which is dealing with an ancestral field, says an ancestral field is like a dedicated field, but it does not explicitly state the <i>halakha</i> of dedicated fields. Rather, <b>this</b> case of a dedicated field <b>comes to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> about an ancestral field <b>but is found to derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from that case, i.e., the verse <b>juxtaposes a dedicated field</b> of a priest <b>to the ancestral field of an Israelite.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> clarifies how the <i>halakha</i> is derived from the juxtaposition: <b>Just as the ancestral field of an Israelite,</b> which was redeemed by a priest from the Temple treasury, <b>goes out</b> of <b>his possession</b> at the arrival of the Jubilee Year <b>and is divided among</b> all <b>the priests</b> of the watch serving at the beginning of the Jubilee Year (see 25b), <b>so too, the dedicated field</b> of a priest that remained in his possession <b>goes out</b> of <b>his possession and is divided among his brothers, the priests</b> of the watch serving at the beginning of the Jubilee Year.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the other,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, from where do they derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: They derive it <b>from</b> a superfluous term in the verse, as it could have stated merely: <b>Dedicated [<i>ḥerem</i>],</b> from which one would have derived that unspecified dedications are designated for the priests. Yet the verse actually states: <b>“<i>Haḥerem</i>,”</b> with the definite article, and therefore both <i>halakhot</i> are derived from this verse. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other,</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, <b>he does not learn</b> anything from the difference between <b><i>ḥerem</i></b> and <b><i>haḥerem</i>.</b> Accordingly, he derives from here only that if a priest consecrated his dedicated field it is removed from his possession.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, from where does he</b> derive <b>that</b> a dedication <b>takes effect on offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> which, according to the Rabbis, is learned from the verse: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28)? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who derives this <i>halakha</i> from another source, as explained in the mishna below.
§ <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> that unspecified dedications of property are designated for Temple maintenance. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> would <b>Rav leave</b> aside the majority opinion of <b>the Rabbis and act in accordance with</b> the individual opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira?</b> The Gemara answers: This dispute <b>is taught</b> in <b>a <i>baraita</i></b> in the <b>opposite</b> manner, i.e., it is the Rabbis who hold that unspecified dedications are designated for Temple maintenance. The Gemara further asks: Would Rav <b>leave</b> aside <b>a mishna and act in accordance with a <i>baraita</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Rav teaches the mishna as well</b> in the <b>opposite</b> manner, in accordance with the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see that you</b> chose <b>to reverse</b> the opinions in <b>the mishna due to the <i>baraita</i>? Let us reverse</b> the opinions in <b>the <i>baraita</i> due to the mishna.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav learned by tradition</b> from his teachers that the opinions cited in the mishna should be reversed. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does Rav state that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira?</b> He <b>should have</b> said it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rav <b>is saying: In accordance</b> with the manner in <b>which you reversed</b> the opinions <b>and taught</b> them in the mishna, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b>
§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain man who dedicated his property in Pumbedita. He came before Rav Yehuda</b> to ask him what to do. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Take four dinars and desacralize</b> the dedicated property by transferring its sanctity <b>onto them. And</b> then <b>throw</b> the dinars <b>into the river,</b> because one may not derive benefit from them. <b>And</b> then the property <b>will be permitted to you,</b> as it will have been redeemed. The Gemara notes: <b>Evidently,</b> Rav Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>unspecified dedications</b> of property are designated <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> which is why the man could redeem his property. Had the property been designated for the priests there could be no redemption, as taught in the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion does Rav Yehuda hold, when he told the man to desacralize the dedicated property by transferring its sanctity onto money worth less than the dedicated property? The Gemara responds: He holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who said: Consecrated</b> property <b>worth one hundred</b> dinars <b>that one desacralized onto</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i> is desacralized.</b> The Gemara asks: One can <b>say that Shmuel said</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> only in a case <b>where</b> one already <b>desacralized</b> the property, i.e., after the fact. <b>Did he say</b> one may do so <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>This matter,</b> that one must desacralize consecrated property onto an item worth the value of the property <i>ab initio</i>, applies only <b>during a period when the Temple is standing, as there is a loss</b> caused to the Temple treasury by desacralizing its property onto an item worth less than its value. <b>But in the present</b> time, when the Temple is not standing and there is no Temple treasury, one may desacralize with an item worth less than the consecrated property <b>even <i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then one may <b>even</b> desacralize with <b>one <i>peruta</i> as well.</b> Why, then, did Rav Yehuda require the man to use four dinars? The Gemara responds: He required four dinars in order to <b>publicize the matter,</b> so that the community will know the property is permitted for use only because it was redeemed.
<b>Ulla says: If I had been there</b> when this man asked what to do, <b>I would have given all of</b> the property <b>to the priests.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Evidently, Ulla holds</b> that <b>unspecified dedications</b> of property are designated <b>for the priests,</b> and therefore they cannot be redeemed.
It can be inferred from the previous discussion that the <i>halakhot</i> of dedications are in effect even today. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: The sale of <b>a Hebrew slave is practiced only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated:</b> “And if your brother be waxen poor with you, and sell himself to you…<b>he shall serve with you until the year of Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:39–40).
<b>And</b> likewise the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a dedicated,</b> i.e., ancestral, <b>field apply only during a period that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated:</b> “Then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought…<b>and in the Jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:28). Finally, the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>houses of walled cities apply only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations; <b>it shall not go out in the Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:30).
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a dedicated field apply only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed, as it is stated: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be sacred to the Lord, as a field dedicated;</b> its possession shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>] apply only during a period when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is observed.</b>
<b>Rav Beivai said: What is the reason?</b> It is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between <b>“well”</b> and <b>“well.”</b> It is <b>written here,</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave, who can be sold only when the Jubilee Year is observed: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). <b>And</b> it is <b>written there,</b> with regard to a <i>ger toshav</i>: <b>“Where it is well for him; you shall not wrong him”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:17). The Gemara’s objection is that it is evident from the <i>baraita</i> that the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to dedicated fields apply only when the Jubilee Year is observed.
The Gemara explains that it is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is discussing the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to land,</b> whereas <b>that</b> incident, in Pumbedita, in which a dedication was effected, occurred <b>with movable property.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But that incident</b> that occurred <b>in Pumbedita involved land as well,</b> and Rav Yehuda nevertheless required the man to redeem them. The Gemara responds: <b>Land outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is considered like movable property in Eretz Yisrael.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One verse states:</b> “All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock <b>you shall consecrate</b> to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19), <b>and one verse states:</b> “However, the firstborn among animals that is born first to the Lord, a man <b>shall not consecrate</b> it” (Leviticus 27:26). It is <b>impossible to say: “You shall consecrate,” as it is already stated:</b> “A man <b>shall not consecrate.”</b> It is likewise <b>impossible to say:</b> “A man <b>shall not consecrate,” as it is already stated: “You shall consecrate.”</b>
<b>How,</b> then, can <b>these</b> verses be reconciled? <b>You can consecrate</b> the firstborn animal by <b>a consecration of value,</b> i.e., an individual can donate to the Temple treasury the amount he would be willing to pay for the right to give the firstborn to a specific priest; <b>and you cannot consecrate it</b> by <b>a consecration for the altar,</b> as a firstborn may not be sacrificed for the sake of any other offering.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who derive the <i>halakha</i> that a dedication takes effect on all offerings of sanctity from the verse: “Every dedicated item is most sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28), would explain that the verse “A man <b>shall not consecrate” is necessary to</b> teach that there is a Torah <b>prohibition</b> against consecrating a firstborn animal for the sake of another offering. As for the other verse discussed in the mishna: <b>“You shall consecrate,”</b> it <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a firstborn</b> animal that <b>was born in</b> one’s <b>flock that</b> it is <b>a mitzva to consecrate it</b> verbally as a firstborn? <b>As it is stated: “The</b> firstborn <b>males</b> that are born of your herd and of your flock <b>you shall consecrate.”</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who maintains there is no such mitzva, would argue: <b>If one does not consecrate it</b> verbally, is the animal <b>not consecrated?</b> It certainly is consecrated, as <b>its sanctity is from the womb. And since when one does not consecrate it</b> the animal is nevertheless <b>sanctified</b> automatically, <b>he does not need to consecrate it</b> verbally.

Daf 29b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells his field during a period</b> when <b>the Jubilee</b> Year is in effect <b>is not permitted to redeem it less than two years</b> after the sale, <b>as it is stated: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form “years” indicates a minimum of two years.
If one of those years <b>was a year of blight or mildew, or</b> if it was the <b>Sabbatical Year,</b> when the buyer is unable to derive benefit from the field, that year <b>does not count</b> as part <b>of the tally,</b> and the owner must wait an additional year before redeeming the field. If the buyer <b>plowed</b> the field but did not sow it, <b>or</b> if <b>he left it fallow,</b> that year <b>counts</b> as part <b>of his tally,</b> as it was fit to produce a crop. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If the owner of the field <b>sold it to</b> the buyer <b>before Rosh HaShana and</b> the field <b>was full of produce,</b> and the owner redeems the field after two years, <b>that</b> buyer <b>consumes from</b> the field’s produce <b>three crops in two years.</b> Although he received the field with its crop, he is not required to return it in the same state.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that <b>one who sells his field during a period</b> when <b>the Jubilee</b> Year is in effect is not permitted to redeem it less than two years after the sale. The Gemara notes: The mishna <b>does not teach</b> that <b>one cannot redeem</b> his field before two years have elapsed; <b>rather,</b> the mishna teaches that <b>one is not permitted to redeem</b> it. <b>Evidently,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that <b>there is also a prohibition</b> involved in the matter, such <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited even</b> to <b>rattle dinars</b> before the buyer in order to persuade him to sell back the field.
The Gemara continues: <b>And it is not necessary</b> to state this with regard to the <b>seller, as he stands in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva, as it is written: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), and the plural form “years” indicates a minimum of two years. <b>Rather, even</b> the <b>buyer stands in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva, as we require</b> the fulfillment of another mitzva from the same verse: “According to the number of <b>years</b> after the Jubilee Year <b>you shall buy</b> from your neighbor,” <b>and</b> if the buyer returns the field before the two years elapse, the mitzva <b>is not</b> fulfilled.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells his field during the Jubilee Year itself, Rav says:</b> The field <b>is sold</b> in principle, but <b>it leaves</b> the buyer’s possession immediately, and his money is not refunded. <b>And Shmuel says: It is not sold at all.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reasoning of Shmuel?</b> Shmuel derives his opinion via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>And what,</b> if a field that was <b>already sold</b> before the Jubilee Year <b>leaves</b> the possession of the buyer in the Jubilee Year, <b>is it not logical that</b> a field <b>that was not</b> yet <b>sold is not sold</b> at all during the Jubilee Year?
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to Rav, do we not say</b> that one may derive <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>in this way? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person may sell his daughter</b> as a maidservant <b>when she is a young woman. You</b> can <b>say</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference to reject such a possibility: <b>And what,</b> if a daughter who was <b>already sold, now leaves</b> her master upon becoming a young woman, <b>is it not logical that</b> a daughter <b>who was not sold is not</b> capable of being <b>sold</b> once she becomes a young woman? Evidently, one may derive this type of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. Why, then, does Rav disagree with Shmuel?
The Gemara answers that the cases are not comparable. <b>There,</b> with regard to a maidservant, once she becomes a young woman <b>she is not</b> ever <b>sold again. Here,</b> the field that is returned to the seller in the Jubilee Year <b>may</b> later <b>be sold again.</b> Rav therefore maintains that one may not derive the aforementioned <i>a fortiori</i> inference.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “According to the number of <b>years after the Jubilee you shall buy</b> from your neighbor” (Leviticus 25:15). The term: After the Jubilee, <b>teaches that</b> a field <b>may be sold</b> in the year <b>adjacent to the Jubilee</b> Year. <b>From where</b> is it derived that a field may be sold in a year that is <b>separated from the Jubilee</b> Year? <b>The verse states: “According to the multitude of the years</b> you shall increase the price thereof, <b>and according to the fewness of the years</b> you shall diminish the price of it” (Leviticus 25:16). The verse teaches that one may sell a field even after several years have elapsed since the last Jubilee Year.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And in the Jubilee Year itself one may not sell</b> his field, <b>and if one sold</b> it, <b>it is not sold.</b> This <i>baraita</i> clearly seems to contradict the opinion of Rav. The Gemara responds: <b>Rav</b> could <b>say to you:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means that the field <b>is not sold for the number of years of the crops,</b> i.e., it does not remain in the buyer’s possession for a minimum of two years, <b>rather it is sold</b> in principle, <b>and</b> then immediately <b>leaves</b> the buyer’s possession.
The Gemara objects: <b>But if</b> the field <b>is indeed sold, let it stand in</b> the buyer’s <b>possession until after</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and after</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>let him consume</b> the field’s produce for two <b>years of crops, and</b> only then <b>return</b> the field. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the buyer <b>consumed</b> the field’s produce for <b>one year before the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>he completes another year after the Jubilee</b> Year? The Gemara explains: The cases are not comparable. <b>There,</b> the buyer already <b>entered</b> the field in order <b>to consume</b> the produce, and therefore he completes the minimum of two years. <b>Here,</b> the buyer <b>did not enter</b> the field <b>to consume</b> the produce at all, as ownership of the field immediately reverts to the seller.
§ <b>Rav Anan says: I learned two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from Master Shmuel. One</b> was <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that if one sells his field during the Jubilee Year the sale is ineffective. <b>And the other</b> <i>halakha</i> concerned <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave to gentiles, or to</b> a Jew who resides <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, that the slave <b>is emancipated.</b> A Canaanite slave is partially obligated in the fulfillment of mitzvot. By selling him to a gentile, one prevents him from fulfilling the mitzvot, and by selling him to one who dwells outside of Eretz Yisrael, one prevents him from fulfilling the mitzva of dwelling in Eretz Yisrael. The Sages therefore decreed that the Jewish master must write the slave a bill of manumission after the sale, so that if he runs away from his gentile master, he would not reenter servitude under the Jewish master.
Rav Anan continues: With regard to <b>one</b> of these <i>halakhot</i>, Shmuel said that <b>the sale is retracted</b> and the money is refunded, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>one</b> of them, he said that <b>the sale is not retracted</b> and the buyer loses his money. <b>But I do not know</b> in <b>which of</b> the cases the sale is retracted and in which case it is not.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Let us see</b> if it is possible to resolve Rav Anan’s dilemma. It may be resolved <b>from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells his slave to</b> a Jew <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, the slave <b>is emancipated but</b> nevertheless <b>requires a bill of manumission from his second master. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>Since</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>calls the second</b> owner the slave’s <b>master,</b> and requires him to emancipate the slave, <b>evidently the sale is not retracted,</b> and the buyer loses his money. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when Shmuel says here</b> that the field <b>is not sold</b> during the Jubilee Year, he means that the sale does not take effect <b>and the money is returned</b> to the buyer.

Daf 30a

The Gemara explains: <b>And Rav Anan</b> did not resolve his dilemma from the <i>baraita</i>, as <b>he did not learn</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>. And</b> he could not resolve it from the statement <b>of Shmuel</b> itself, that the sale of a field during the Jubilee Year is ineffective, as the meaning of Shmuel’s statement is unclear. <b>From where</b> can one infer <b>that</b> Shmuel means that the field <b>is not sold and</b> the <b>money is returned? Perhaps</b> he means that the field <b>is not sold and</b> the <b>money is</b> considered <b>a gift, just as it is</b> considered a gift in his opinion <b>in</b> the case of <b>one who betroths his sister. As it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths his sister,</b> a betrothal that is invalid, <b>Rav says</b> that <b>the money</b> with which the brother betrothed his sister <b>is returned,</b> as he knew that the betrothal was invalid and merely intended to deposit the money with her for safekeeping. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that it is assumed that he wished to give her the <b>money</b> as <b>a gift.</b>
The Gemara earlier (29a) cited a <i>baraita</i> that teaches that if one sells his slave to a Jew outside of Eretz Yisrael, the buyer must free the slave. Nevertheless, his money is not refunded. With regard to this, <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What did you see</b> to say, <b>that we penalize the buyer</b> and he loses his money? <b>Let us penalize the seller</b> and require him to refund the money he received, so that he loses both the money and the slave.
Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: It is <b>not the mouse</b> that <b>steals; rather,</b> it is <b>the hole</b> that <b>steals,</b> as a mouse cannot steal any item unless he has a hole in which to hide it. In other words, the seller could not have sold his slave outside of Eretz Yisrael had the buyer been unwilling to purchase the slave. Abaye replied: The opposite is also true, namely that <b>if not</b> for <b>the mouse, from where</b> would <b>the hole</b> obtain the stolen item? Had the seller refused to sell his slave, the buyer could not have purchased him and taken him out of Eretz Yisrael. Rav Yosef replied to Abaye: Although both parties are at fault, <b>it stands to reason</b> that <b>we apply the penalty wherever the</b> subject of <b>the prohibition is</b> currently located. Since the buyer is now in possession of the slave, he is the one who is penalized.
§ The mishna teaches: If one of the two years after the sale <b>was a year of blight,</b> the buyer is entitled to an additional year’s crops. If the buyer plowed the field but did not sow it, or if he left it fallow, that year counts as part of his tally, as it was fit to produce a crop. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that it was taught that if the buyer <b>left</b> his field <b>fallow</b> that year <b>counts</b> as part of <b>his</b> tally, even though he did not cultivate the field at all, <b>is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that the year counts as part of his tally if <b>he plowed</b> the field but did not sow it?
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach the case of a buyer who <b>plowed</b> the field but did not sow it, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>we say to</b> the seller: <b>Give the monetary</b> value <b>of</b> the enhancement of the field <b>to</b> the buyer, <b>and</b> then <b>he will leave</b> the field. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the seller does not have to pay him that amount.
§ The mishna states that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If the owner of the field <b>sold it to</b> the buyer before Rosh HaShana and the field was full of produce, and the owner redeems the field after two years, the buyer consumes three crops of the field’s produce in two years. With regard to this <i>halakha</i> <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the owner of the field <b>sold it to</b> the buyer <b>before Rosh HaShana full of produce, that</b> the seller <b>should not say to</b> the buyer when he redeems the field after two years: <b>Leave</b> the field <b>for me</b> full of produce <b>in the manner that I left</b> it <b>for you? The verse states: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), indicating that the payment is calculated according to the number of years, not according to the number of crops. Consequently, <b>sometimes a person consumes three crops in two years.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When the Jubilee Year is in effect, one may sell a field only until the Jubilee Year, at which point the field returns to its original owner. If the owner redeems the field before the Jubilee Year, the payment per annum is calculated by dividing the sale price by the number of years from the sale until the Jubilee Year. The owner returns the per annum payment multiplied by the number of years remaining until the Jubilee Year. If the owner of a field <b>sold it to the first</b> buyer <b>for one hundred</b> dinars <b>and the first</b> buyer then <b>sold</b> it <b>to the second</b> buyer <b>for two hundred</b> dinars, when the original owner redeems the field <b>he calculates</b> the payment <b>only</b> according to the price that he set <b>with the first</b> buyer, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And he calculates the years of its sale, and he returns the remainder to the man <b>to whom he sold it”</b> (Leviticus 25:27).
If the owner of a field <b>sold it to the first</b> buyer <b>for two hundred</b> dinars <b>and the first</b> buyer then <b>sold</b> it <b>to the second</b> buyer <b>for one hundred</b> dinars, when the original owner redeems the field, <b>he calculates</b> the payment <b>only</b> according to the price that was paid <b>by the last</b> buyer, <b>as it is stated: “And he calculates the years of its sale, and he returns the remainder to the man to whom he sold it.”</b> The superfluous term “to the man” indicates that the verse is referring <b>to the man who is</b> currently <b>in</b> possession of the field.
One <b>may not sell</b> his ancestral field that is located <b>in a distant</b> area <b>and redeem</b> with the proceeds a field that he sold <b>in a nearby</b> area. Likewise, he may not sell <b>a low-quality</b> field <b>and redeem with</b> the proceeds <b>a high-quality</b> field. <b>And he may not borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field, <b>nor may he redeem</b> the field incrementally, <b>half</b> now and half at a later date. <b>But with regard to</b> redeeming a field from <b>the Temple</b> treasury, it is <b>permitted</b> to redeem the field <b>in any of these</b> ways. <b>This is</b> a <i>halakha</i> where greater <b>stringency</b> applies <b>with regard to</b> redeeming a field from <b>an ordinary</b> individual <b>than with regard to</b> redeeming it from <b>the Temple</b> treasury.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> Consider the case where the owner of a field <b>sold it to the first</b> buyer <b>for one hundred</b> dinars <b>and the first</b> buyer then <b>sold it to the second</b> buyer <b>for two hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when the original owner redeems the field, <b>he calculates</b> the payment <b>only</b> according to the price that he set <b>with the first</b> buyer? <b>The verse states:</b> “And he calculates the years of its sale, and he returns the remainder to the man <b>to whom he sold it”</b> (Leviticus 25:27).
Now consider the case where the owner of a field <b>sold it to the first</b> buyer <b>for two hundred</b> dinars <b>and the first</b> buyer then <b>sold</b> it <b>to the second</b> buyer <b>for one hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when the original owner redeems the field, the payment <b>is calculated only</b> according to the price that was paid <b>by the second</b> buyer? <b>The verse states:</b> “And he returns the remainder <b>to the man</b> to whom he sold it.” The superfluous term <b>“to the man”</b> indicates that the verse is referring to the man <b>who is</b> currently <b>in</b> possession of the field. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says</b> that the verse should be interpreted differently: Consider the case where the owner of a field <b>sold it to</b> the buyer <b>for one hundred</b> dinars, <b>and</b> the field <b>appreciated</b> in value while in the buyer’s possession <b>and</b> its value <b>stood at two hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when the seller redeems the field <b>he calculates</b> the payment <b>only</b> according <b>to</b> the <b>one hundred</b> dinars he originally received for the field?<b>As it is stated: “And he returns the remainder</b> to the man to whom he sold it,” that is, the seller returns only <b>the remainder</b> of the original payment <b>that is in his possession.</b>
Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda continues: Consider the case where the owner of a field <b>sold it to</b> the buyer <b>for two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and</b> the field <b>depreciated</b> in value while in the buyer’s possession <b>and</b> its value <b>stood at one hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when the seller redeems the field, the payment <b>is calculated only</b> according <b>to</b> the <b>one hundred</b> dinars the field is currently worth? <b>As it is stated: “And he returns the remainder</b> to the man to whom he sold it,” i.e., he returns <b>that which</b> now <b>remains of the</b> value of the <b>land.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda? The Gemara responds: The practical difference between them is in a case <b>where</b> the field’s value <b>was high</b> at the time of the first sale, e.g., it was worth two hundred dinars, <b>and</b> when the field was sold a second time it had <b>depreciated</b> in value and was worth only one hundred dinars. <b>And</b> when the original owner came to redeem it, it again <b>appreciated</b> in value until it was worth two hundred dinars. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the redemption payment is calculated according to the one hundred dinars paid by the second buyer for the field. According to Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda, it is calculated either according to the remainder of the original payment or according to that which now remains of the value of the land. Either way, it is calculated according to the remainder of two hundred dinars.
The aforementioned practical difference aside, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda agree that the verses are interpreted in a manner that benefits the original owner. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the verses should be interpreted <b>as a leniency</b> for the seller? <b>Perhaps</b> they should be interpreted <b>as a stringency</b> for the seller.
The Gemara responds: Such a possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as it is learned</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“redemption”</b> written in this context and <b>“redemption” from</b> the passage discussing <b>a Hebrew slave</b> that the Torah is lenient with regard to the redeemer. The verse states with regard to the redemption of a field: “And he prospers and finds sufficient means to redeem it” (Leviticus 25:26), and with regard to the redemption of a slave who was sold to a gentile, the verse states: “After he is sold he shall attain redemption” (Leviticus 25:48). Accordingly, just as the Torah is lenient with regard to the redemption of a Hebrew slave, so too the Torah is lenient with regard to redeeming a field.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> in the case of a Hebrew slave, <b>from where do we</b> derive that the Torah is lenient with regard to his redemption? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Consider the case of a Hebrew slave who <b>was sold for one hundred</b> dinars, <b>and he appreciated</b> in value during his term of servitude <b>and</b> his value <b>stood at two hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if he redeems himself, the sum he pays for the remaining years of his service <b>is calculated only</b> according <b>to</b> the <b>one hundred</b> dinars for which he was originally sold? <b>As it is stated:</b> “If there are yet many years, according to them he shall return the price of his redemption <b>from the money of his purchase”</b> (Leviticus 25:51).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Consider the case of a Hebrew slave who <b>was sold for two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and he depreciated</b> in value during his term <b>and</b> his value <b>stood at one hundred</b> dinars. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if he redeems himself, the sum he pays for the remaining years of his service <b>is calculated only</b> according <b>to</b> the <b>one hundred</b> dinars he is currently worth? <b>As it is stated: “According to his years</b> he shall return the price of his redemption” (Leviticus 25:52). The verse indicates that the sum is calculated according to the value of his remaining years of service.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a Hebrew slave who was sold to a gentile, that he is redeemed and</b> that <b>he has the advantage,</b> as the price of his redemption is always calculated according to the lesser value. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also applies in the case of a Hebrew slave who was <b>sold to a Jew? The verse states: “Hired worker,” “hired worker,”</b> in order <b>to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy,</b> indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies both to a slave sold to a gentile and to one sold to a Jew. The verse states with regard to a slave sold to a gentile: “According to the time of a hired worker shall he be with him” (Leviticus 25:50), and with regard to a slave sold to a Jew, the verse states: “For double the hire of a hired worker he served you six years” (Deuteronomy 15:18).
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye said:</b>

Daf 30b

<b>I am</b> ready to answer any questions put to me <b>like</b> those of the intellectually sharp <b>ben Azzai,</b> who would regularly expound <b>in the markets of Tiberias. One of the Sages said to Abaye:</b> The verses discussing the redemption of a Hebrew slave <b>can be interpreted as a leniency</b> for the slave, <b>and they can</b> also <b>be interpreted as a stringency</b> for him. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the verses should be interpreted <b>as a leniency</b> for the slave? <b>Say</b> that they should be interpreted <b>as a stringency</b> for him.
Abaye explained: Such a possibility should <b>not enter your mind, due to</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One was</b> explicitly <b>lenient with regard to</b> a slave. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a Hebrew slave: “And it shall be, if he says to you I will not leave <b>you…because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). The term “with you” indicates that the slave must be <b>with you,</b> i.e., treated as your equal, <b>with regard to food,</b> and <b>with you with regard to drink.</b> This means <b>that you should not be eating fine bread</b> while <b>he eats inferior bread [<i>kibbar</i>],</b> bread from coarse flour mixed with bran. Likewise, <b>you</b> should not <b>drink old wine</b> while <b>he drinks</b> inferior <b>new wine. You</b> should not <b>sleep on</b> bedding made from <b>soft sheets</b> while <b>he sleeps on the ground. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: One who acquires a Hebrew slave</b> is considered <b>like one who acquires a master for himself,</b> as he must ensure that the slave’s living conditions are equal to his own.
That Sage raised an objection to Abaye: <b>On the contrary, let us impose a stringency upon</b> the slave, <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. As Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> in explanation of the juxtaposition of several passages in the Torah (Leviticus, chapter 25): <b>Come and see how severe</b> is even <b>the hint of</b> violation of the prohibition of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, as the prohibition against engaging in commerce with produce of the Sabbatical Year is not one of the primary prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year, and yet its punishment is harsh.
Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, continues: If <b>a person has commercial dealings with produce</b> of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year or of the Jubilee Year, <b>ultimately</b> he will become so poor that <b>he will</b> be compelled to <b>sell his movable property, as it is stated: “In this Jubilee Year you shall return every man to his possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:13), <b>and it is written</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“And if you sell something to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand,”</b> which is referring to <b>an item acquired</b> by passing it <b>from hand to hand.</b> The juxtaposition of the two verses indicates that if one violates the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year or the Sabbatical Year, he will eventually have to sell his movable property.
If <b>he does not feel</b> remorse and he does not repent, <b>ultimately he will</b> be compelled to <b>sell his fields, as it is stated</b> in an adjacent verse: <b>“If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25).
If consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him, ultimately he will</b> be compelled to <b>sell his house, as it is stated: “And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there,</b> in the previous clause, <b>where</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>says</b> that the sinner <b>does not sense</b> remorse, <b>and what is different here, where he says</b> that consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him?</b> The Gemara responds: This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: Once a person commits a transgression and repeats it, it is permitted to him.</b>
The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>it is</b> actually <b>permitted to him</b> because he has transgressed twice? <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>it becomes as</b> though it were <b>permitted to him,</b> that is, after transgressing the prohibition twice he becomes accustomed to this behavior and no longer feels that it is a sin. If one transgresses the prohibition only once, he is apt to feel remorse. Once he repeats his transgression, he loses this sensibility concerning his sins and will no longer feel any remorse.
Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, continues: If consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him, ultimately he</b> will be compelled to <b>borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother becomes poor</b> and his means fail with you, then you shall uphold him” (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and it is written</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“You shall take no interest or increase from him.”</b>
One <b>does not come to</b> borrow with interest <b>until he</b> has already been compelled to <b>sell his daughter, as it is stated: “And when a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). The Gemara explains: <b>And even though his daughter is not</b> mentioned <b>in that context</b> in Leviticus, nevertheless, <b>a person prefers to sell his daughter and not to borrow</b> money <b>with interest.</b> This is <b>because there,</b> when one sells his daughter, the sum required in order to redeem her <b>continuously decreases, while here,</b> where one borrows with interest, his debt <b>continuously increases.</b> One may therefore assume that if one borrows with interest, he has already sold his daughter.
If consciousness of his sins <b>does not come to him, ultimately he will</b> be compelled <b>to sell himself, as it is stated: “And when your brother becomes poor with you and sells himself to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39). <b>Not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew; <b>rather,</b> he will even be sold <b>to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). <b>And not</b> only <b>to</b> a stranger who is <b>a convert, but</b> even <b>to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>], as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a <i>ger toshav</i></b> with you” (Leviticus 25:47).
When the verse further states: “Or to the offshoot of <b>a stranger’s family,” this is</b> referring to <b>the gentile</b> relatives of a <i>ger toshav</i>, who are idolaters. <b>When it says: “Or to the offshoot [<i>le’eker</i>] of a stranger’s family,” this is</b> referring to <b>one who is sold and becomes a servant to idol worship itself,</b> i.e., he is put to work in a temple dedicated to idolatry. In any event, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that it is only due to an individual’s sins that he reaches such a low point that he must sell himself as a slave. If so, the verses dealing with a Hebrew slave should be interpreted in a stringent manner, so that the slave cannot easily be redeemed.
Abaye <b>said to</b> that Sage: <b>But the verse</b> subsequently <b>restores him,</b> i.e., it requires that one strive to redeem him from slavery. As the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since he went and sold himself to</b> a temple dedicated to <b>idol worship, should I throw a stone after the fallen?</b> In other words, perhaps he should be left to his own devices? <b>The verse states: He shall have a perpetual right of redemption, and he shall leave in the Jubilee</b> (see Leviticus 25:31, 48). The Gemara objects: Even so, you can <b>say</b> that <b>he shall have a redemption</b> so <b>that he will not be assimilated among the gentiles, but actually, with regard to his redemption we will be stringent,</b> as it is due only to his sins that he is enslaved.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Two verses are written with regard to redeeming someone who was sold to a gentile. <b>It is written: “If there are yet many in the years,</b> according to them he shall return the price of his redemption from the money that he was bought for” (Leviticus 25:51). <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: “And <b>if there remain but few in the years</b> until the Jubilee Year, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years he shall return the price of his redemption.”
Now, <b>are there years with much</b> time <b>and years with little</b> time? Every year is the same length. <b>Rather,</b> this means that if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>appreciated</b> during the years of his service, he is redeemed according to <b>“the money that he was bought for,”</b> which is the lower sum. And if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>depreciated</b> over time, one determines his value <b>“according to his years,”</b> i.e., according to his current value rather than according to his previous worth. The verse indicates that one acts leniently when calculating the redemption payment of a Hebrew slave.
The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> that the verses should be interpreted as follows: “If there are yet many in the years,” is referring to a case <b>where he served</b> for <b>two</b> years, <b>and four</b> years of servitude <b>remain.</b> In this situation <b>let him return to</b> his master the value of <b>four</b> years of his servitude according to <b>“the money that he was bought for.” And</b> the phrase “if there remain but few in the years” is referring to a case <b>where he served</b> for <b>four</b> years <b>and two</b> years of servitude <b>remain.</b> In this situation <b>let him return to</b> his master the value of <b>two</b> years of his servitude <b>“according to his years.”</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>write: If there are yet many years. What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“in the years”?</b> Rather, this indicates that if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>appreciated in the years</b> of his service, he is redeemed according to <b>“the money that he was bought for,”</b> which is the lower sum. If <b>his monetary</b> value <b>depreciated in the years,</b> one determines his value <b>“according to his years,”</b> i.e., according to his current value. Upon hearing this explanation, <b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Naḥman</b> bar Yitzḥak <b>interpreted these verses as</b> truly as if the interpretation had been transmitted to Moses from <b>Sinai.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: One <b>may not sell</b> his ancestral field that is located <b>in a distant</b> area and redeem with that money a field that he sold in a nearby area. Likewise, he may not sell a low-quality field and redeem with that money a high-quality field. And he may not borrow money and redeem the field, nor may he redeem the field incrementally, half now and half at a later date. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And he prospers and finds sufficient means to redeem it” (Leviticus 25:26), the phrase <b>“and he prospers”</b> teaches that the money he uses to redeem the field must be <b>his own possession,</b> meaning <b>that he may not borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“And finds</b> sufficient means”; this <b>excludes</b> the usage of means <b>that were</b> previously <b>available,</b> meaning <b>that</b> one may not sell property that he owned at the time of the sale in order to redeem his field, e.g., <b>he may not sell</b> a field that is located <b>in a distant</b> area <b>and redeem</b> a field that is located <b>in a nearby</b> area, nor may he sell <b>a low-quality</b> field <b>and redeem a high-quality</b> field. <b>“Sufficient means to redeem it”;</b> this indicates that one <b>may redeem</b> his field if he possesses <b>sufficient means to redeem</b> the entire field, <b>but he may not partially redeem</b> his field.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the term <b>“finds” indicates</b> that the means were found <b>now</b> and were not previously available? <b>But</b> you can <b>raise a contradiction</b> to this premise from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to an unintentional killer: “And one who goes into the forest with another to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the blade slips off the wood, and finds another person, and he dies, he shall flee to one of these cities and live” (Deuteronomy 19:5). The term <b>“and finds” excludes one who introduces himself</b> into the area of danger. <b>From here Rabbi Eliezer said: If, after the stone departed from</b> one’s <b>hand, the other</b> person <b>stuck his head out and received</b> a blow from <b>it</b> and died, the killer <b>is exempt</b> from exile. <b>Evidently,</b> the term <b>“finds” indicates an item that is</b> there <b>from the outset.</b>
<b>Rava said: Here,</b> “finds” is interpreted according <b>to the context of the verse, and here</b> it is likewise interpreted according <b>to the context of the verse. Here,</b> with regard to redeeming a field, one interprets “finds” in a manner <b>similar to</b> the phrase <b>“he prospers.” Just as “he prospers”</b> is referring to funds <b>that</b> he acquires only <b>now, so too “finds”</b> indicates property <b>that</b> he finds only <b>now,</b> and not property that he owned from the outset. <b>And here,</b> with regard to an unintentional killer, one interprets “finds” in a manner <b>similar to</b> the term <b>“forest.” Just as a forest is something that is</b> there <b>from the outset, so too, “finds”</b> indicates <b>something,</b> i.e., an individual, <b>that is</b> there <b>from the outset.</b> This excludes an individual who was not in the vicinity when the ax slipped.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But with regard to</b> redeeming a field from <b>the Temple</b> treasury, it is permitted to redeem the field in any of these ways. This is a <i>halakha</i> where greater stringency applies with regard to redeeming a field from an ordinary individual than with regard to redeeming it from the Temple treasury. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse dealing with one who consecrates his field: <b>“And if</b> the one who consecrates the field <b>will indeed redeem it”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). The phrase “will indeed redeem” <b>teaches that</b> one <b>may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> his field, <b>and</b> one <b>may partially redeem</b> his field, despite the fact that one may not do so when redeeming a field from an ordinary individual.
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> for this leniency in the case of consecrated fields? It is <b>because we find with regard to one who sells his ancestral field, that</b> the Torah <b>enhanced his power,</b> in <b>that if the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived and</b> the field <b>was not redeemed, it returns to</b> its original <b>owners in the Jubilee</b> Year. Therefore, <b>his power was diminished</b> with regard to the manner of redemption, in <b>that he cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field, <b>and he cannot partially redeem</b> it.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> his <b>ancestral field, since his power was diminished,</b> in <b>that if</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived and</b> the field <b>was not redeemed,</b> the field <b>leaves</b> the possession of the Temple treasury and passes <b>to</b> the possession of <b>the priests</b> and does not return to the original owner, the Torah therefore <b>enhanced his power,</b> in <b>that he may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> his field, <b>and he may partially redeem</b> it.

Daf 31a

The Gemara raises a contradiction between two <i>baraitot</i> with regard to redeeming a field from the Temple treasury: <b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: One <b>may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> a field, <b>and</b> one <b>may partially redeem</b> it. <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: One <b>may not borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> a field, <b>nor may</b> one <b>partially redeem</b> it. The Gemara explains: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one may not borrow money and redeem his field, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis; and that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that one may borrow money and redeem his field, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who is lenient with regard to redeeming a field from the Temple treasury.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells a house</b> from <b>among the houses of walled cities may redeem</b> the house <b>immediately,</b> even without the consent of the buyer, <b>and he may redeem</b> the house during <b>the entire twelve months</b> following the sale, but not after that. When he redeems the house within the twelve-month period, he returns the sale price to the buyer, and <b>this is</b> ostensibly <b>like a form of interest,</b> as the buyer has effectively resided in the house for free in exchange for the fact that the buyer’s money was in the possession of the seller. <b>It is not</b> considered <b>interest,</b> because the buyer owned the house during the period in which he resided in it.
If <b>the seller died, his son may redeem</b> the house from the buyer. If <b>the buyer died,</b> the seller <b>may redeem</b> it <b>from the possession of</b> the buyer’s <b>son.</b> If the buyer sold the house to another, <b>one calculates</b> the <b>year only from the time that</b> the owner <b>sold</b> the house to the first buyer, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if it is not redeemed <b>until the passage of</b> a full <b>year for him,</b> then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it in perpetuity” (Leviticus 25:30). The term “for him” indicates that the year is calculated from when the initial owner sold the house.
<b>When it says: “A full</b> year,” this serves <b>to include the intercalated month</b> in the year calculated from the sale, if it was a leap year. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The word “full” serves <b>to give</b> the seller <b>a year and its addition,</b> i.e., the year during which the house may be redeemed is not the 354-day lunar year, but the 365-day solar year. If the final <b>day of the twelve-month</b> period <b>arrived and</b> the house <b>was not redeemed,</b> the house has <b>become</b> the property <b>of</b> the buyer <b>in perpetuity.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to both <b>one who buys</b> a house in a walled city <b>and one to whom it is given as a gift, as it is stated:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it <b>in perpetuity”</b> (Leviticus 25:30).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who sells a house in a walled city may redeem it immediately. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The Torah states: “And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the completion of the year after it is sold; for <b>days</b> he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). The word <b>“days”</b> means <b>no fewer than two</b> days, i.e., the house cannot be redeemed during the first two days after the sale.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> word <b>“days”?</b> The Gemara answers: The Rabbis <b>require it</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> that the year does not conclude with the arrival of Rosh HaShana, at the end of the calendar year; rather, it is calculated <b>from day to day,</b> that is, until the arrival of the date of the sale in the subsequent year. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>from where does he</b> derive that the year is calculated <b>from day to day?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase: <b>“Until the completion of the year after it is sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:29).
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> what do they do with this phrase? The Gemara responds: Actually, <b>they require that</b> phrase to teach that the calculated year is <b>a year from his sale and not the year of the counting of the world,</b> i.e., not the calendar year. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>require</b> the word <b>“days”</b> to teach that the year is calculated not only from day to day, but also <b>from hour to hour,</b> i.e., the year is completed only when the hour of the sale arrives in the subsequent year. <b>As if</b> one sought to derive this <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“until the completion of the year after it is sold,” I would say</b> that with regard to calculating the year <b>from day to day, yes,</b> it is calculated in this manner, but with regard to calculating the year <b>from hour to hour, no,</b> it is not calculated in this manner. Rather, once the beginning of the day arrives the seller can no longer redeem the house. <b>The Merciful One</b> therefore <b>wrote</b> the word <b>“days”</b> to teach that the year is calculated from hour to hour.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>from where does he</b> derive that the year is calculated <b>from hour to hour?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from</b> the term <b>“a full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30). The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> what do they derive from the term “a full year”? The Gemara responds: The Rabbis <b>require that</b> term <b>to</b> teach that <b>the intercalated month</b> of a leap year is included in the year of sale.
The Gemara objects: <b>But Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also requires that</b> term <b>to</b> teach that <b>the intercalated month</b> of a leap year is included in the year of sale. The Gemara explains: <b>Indeed,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi derives the inclusion of the intercalated month from the term “a full year.” Rather, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the fact that the year is calculated <b>from day to day and from hour to hour</b> constitutes one <i>halakha</i>, which is <b>derived from</b> the phrase <b>“until the completion of the year after it is sold.”</b>
§ The mishna teaches: When one redeems a house among those of a walled city, <b>this is</b> ostensibly <b>like a form of interest,</b> as the seller returns the original sale price to the buyer and he does not subtract from it in exchange for the period during which the buyer resided in the house. This is not considered interest because the buyer owned the house during that period. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is fully</b> considered <b>interest, but</b> in this case <b>the Torah permitted it?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Consider the case of one <b>who had a debt of one hundred</b> dinars <b>against another, and</b> the borrower <b>made</b> a conditional <b>sale of his field to</b> the lender, stipulating that if he does not repay the loan on time then the sale shall take effect retroactively from the present moment. <b>As long as the seller,</b> i.e., the borrower, <b>consumes the produce</b> of that field until the time the loan comes due, this arrangement <b>is permitted.</b> But if the <b>buyer,</b> i.e., the lender, <b>consumes the produce</b> during this time, the arrangement <b>is prohibited,</b> as it constitutes interest. The reason is that if the loan is repaid on time, the sale is nullified, which means that the produce consumed by the lender will have been consumed as payment for allowing the loan to remain in the borrower’s possession.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even when the buyer consumes the produce,</b> such an arrangement is permitted. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> in support of his opinion: There was <b>an incident involving Baitos ben Zunin, who made</b> a conditional <b>sale of his field</b> by a similar arrangement <b>under the direction of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, and</b> in this case the <b>buyer was consuming the produce.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Do you seek to bring <b>proof from there?</b> Actually, it was the <b>seller</b> who <b>was consuming the produce, and not</b> the <b>buyer.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the basis for the dispute <b>between</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis? The Gemara responds: The dispute <b>between them</b> concerns the permissibility of an agreement involving <b>an uncertain interest,</b> i.e., an agreement that will involve interest only under certain circumstances. This is the case here, since if the loan is repaid the produce consumed by the lender constitutes interest, but if the loan is not repaid then the field is acquired retroactively by the lender and no interest is involved. The Gemara elaborates: <b>The first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>uncertain interest is prohibited, and Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>uncertain interest is permitted.</b>

Daf 31b

<b>Rava said: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>uncertain interest is prohibited; and here,</b> the dispute <b>between</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis concerns the permissibility <b>of interest</b> given <b>on the condition that it will be returned.</b> That is, in addition to the arrangement described in the <i>baraita</i>, the parties agreed that the buyer will consume the produce, and if the sale will later be nullified, then the buyer will reimburse the seller for the value of the produce. One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that although the interest is subsequently refunded, this practice is <b>prohibited, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that this is permitted.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities, if <b>the seller died, his son may redeem</b> the house from the buyer. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> as a son inherits his father’s property. The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that when <b>the Merciful One states: “And if a man sells a dwelling house</b> in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the completion of the year after it is sold” (Leviticus 25:29), this indicates that the man who redeems the house must be the same man who sold it, <b>and this</b> son did <b>not sell;</b> therefore, the same verse <b>teaches us: “And he shall have the right of redemption,”</b> indicating that the right of redemption applies <b>in any case,</b> either to the seller or his son.
The mishna further teaches: If <b>the buyer died,</b> the seller <b>may redeem</b> the house <b>from the possession of</b> the buyer’s <b>son.</b> The Gemara asks: This, too, is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession <b>of the one who bought it</b> in perpetuity” (Leviticus 25:30), <b>and</b> as <b>this</b> son did <b>not buy</b> the house, the buyer cannot redeem it from him; therefore, the previous verse <b>teaches us: “He shall have the right of redemption,”</b> indicating that this right applies <b>in any case,</b> even from the buyer’s son.
§ The mishna teaches that if the buyer sold the house to another, <b>one calculates</b> the <b>year only from the time that</b> the owner <b>sold</b> the house to the first buyer, as it is stated: “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him” (Leviticus 25:30). <b>The Sages taught:</b> When the verse states <b>“year,” I do not know if</b> one counts the <b>year</b> from when the owner sold it <b>to the first</b> buyer, or <b>if</b> one counts the <b>year</b> from when the first buyer sold it <b>to</b> the <b>second. When</b> the verse <b>states: “Until the passage of a full year for him,” you must</b> say that it is <b>a year</b> from when the owner sold it <b>to the first</b> buyer.
The Gemara asks: In such a case, if the owner did not redeem the house within one year of the first sale, <b>to whom</b> does it belong <b>in perpetuity? Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It belongs <b>in perpetuity to</b> the <b>first</b> buyer. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It belongs <b>in perpetuity to</b> the <b>second</b> buyer. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> it is understandable why the house belongs to the first buyer, <b>as one calculates</b> the year <b>according to his</b> acquisition. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> that the house belongs to the second buyer after the conclusion of one year from the acquisition of the first buyer? <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel says: What did</b> the <b>first</b> buyer <b>sell to the second</b> buyer? He sold him <b>any right</b> to the field <b>that will come into his possession.</b> This includes the fact that the house will belong to him in perpetuity after the conclusion of one year from the first purchase.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel says:</b> If one <b>sold two houses of walled cities, one on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first</b> month of <b>Adar</b> in a leap year, <b>and</b> the other <b>one on the first</b> day <b>of the second Adar,</b> then the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: With regard to <b>this</b> house <b>that he sold to him</b> on the first day <b>of the second Adar, once the first day of Adar of the next year arrives, it is counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed. With regard to <b>this</b> house <b>that he sold to him on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first Adar, it is not counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed <b>until the fifteenth</b> day <b>of Adar of the next year.</b>
<b>Ravina objects to this: But let</b> the first buyer <b>say</b> to the second: <b>I preceded</b> you and <b>kindled a fire before you,</b> i.e., I bought my house before you acquired yours. How, then, can you gain possession in perpetuity before me? The Gemara responds: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the second buyer can <b>say to him: You descended to</b> the house during the <b>intercalated</b> month, i.e., the first Adar, and as it is taught in the mishna, the seller has the right to redeem the house for an entire year, including the intercalated month.
<b>And Rabbi Abba bar Memel says:</b> If <b>two lambs were born to</b> a single owner, <b>one on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first Adar, and</b> the other <b>one on the first</b> day <b>of the second Adar,</b> then the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: With regard to <b>this</b> lamb <b>that was born</b> on the first day <b>of the second Adar, once the first day of Adar of the next year arrives, it is counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed, and if it was a firstborn it should be sacrificed before that time arrives <i>ab initio</i>. With regard to <b>this</b> lamb <b>that was born to him on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first Adar, it is not counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed <b>until the fifteenth</b> day <b>of Adar of the next year.</b>
<b>Ravina</b> again <b>objects to this: But let</b> the lamb that was born first <b>say</b> to the other lamb: <b>I preceded</b> you and <b>ate vegetables before you,</b> i.e., I was born first. The Gemara responds: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the second lamb can <b>say to</b> the first: <b>You descended to</b> the world during the <b>intercalated</b> month, which is added to the year, whereas <b>I did not descend to</b> the world during the <b>intercalated</b> month.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this</b> second <i>halakha</i>? <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the lambs is identical to <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> concerning the houses. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>there,</b> with regard to houses of walled cities, <b>where it is written: “A full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30), this is indeed the <i>halakha</i>, but <b>here,</b> with regard to lambs, <b>where it is not written: A full</b> year, perhaps this is <b>not</b> the case; Rabbi Abba bar Memel therefore <b>teaches us that</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the words <b>“year”</b> and <b>“year”</b> the two cases <b>derive</b> their <i>halakhot</i> <b>from each other.</b> With regard to houses of walled cities, it is written: “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him” (Leviticus 25:30), and it is written with regard to lambs: “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year” (Exodus 12:5).
§ The mishna teaches: <b>When it states: “A full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30), this serves to include the intercalated month in the year calculated from the sale. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This serves <b>to give</b> the seller <b>a year</b> and <b>its addition.</b> With regard to this matter, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“A full year”; Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This means that one <b>counts 365 days, in accordance with the number</b> of <b>days</b> in <b>a solar</b> year, which are eleven more than in a lunar year. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One <b>counts twelve months from day to day, and if</b> an additional month <b>was intercalated</b> into the year, then the month <b>was intercalated to</b> the benefit of the seller, i.e., he has thirteen months to redeem his house.
§ The mishna teaches: If the final <b>day of the twelve-month</b> period <b>arrived and</b> the house <b>was not redeemed,</b> it becomes the property of the buyer in perpetuity. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who buys a house in a walled city and one to whom it is given as a gift, as it is stated: “In perpetuity [<i>latzemitut</i>]” (Leviticus 25:30). With regard to this matter, <b>the Sages taught: “<i>Latzemitut</i>”</b> means <b>in perpetuity;</b> that is, the seller can no longer redeem the house against the buyer’s will, nor does it return to his possession in the Jubilee Year. <b>Another matter</b> derived from this verse is that <b>“<i>latzemitut</i>”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a house given as <b>a gift. What is the reason,</b> i.e., how is this derived from “<i>latzemitut</i>”? The verse could have stated <b><i>tzemit</i>,</b> but instead it states <b><i>tzemitut</i>.</b> The expanded term serves to include a house given as a gift.
<b>The Sages said</b> the above <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Pappa,</b> and then asked: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? Ostensibly, it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, doesn’t he say</b> with regard to the return of an ancestral field in the Jubilee Year that <b>a gift is not like a sale,</b> i.e., an ancestral field given as a gift does not return to the original owner in the Jubilee Year? Likewise, a house in a walled city given as a gift should not become the perpetual property of the buyer after twelve months. <b>Rav Pappa said: You may even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and it <b>is different here, as the Merciful One includes</b> a house given as a gift through the term <b>“<i>latzemitut</i>.”</b>
<b>The Sages said to Rav Pappa, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> said <b>to Rav Pappa: But</b> consider the case <b>of the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>as it is written:</b> “In this year of Jubilee <b>you shall return</b> every man unto his possession” (Leviticus 25:13), and the Sages teach that this verse serves <b>to include the gift, and</b> yet <b>Rabbi Meir does not include</b> a gift. <b>Rather, this</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>certainly not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates a house among the houses of walled cities, this</b> individual <b>may redeem</b> it from the Temple treasury, <b>and he may always redeem</b> it, even after the first year, unlike a sale. If <b>another redeemed</b> the house <b>from the possession of the Temple</b> treasury, and <b>the</b> final <b>day of</b> the <b>twelve-month</b> period from its redemption <b>arrived and</b> the house <b>was not redeemed</b> by its owner, the house <b>has</b> become the property of the other individual <b>in perpetuity.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel says: As the verse states:</b> “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him, then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it in perpetuity, throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:30). The verse indicates that the house belongs in perpetuity to <b>“the one who bought it,” even</b> if he purchased it <b>from the possession of the Temple</b> treasury. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is the consecrator always capable of redeeming the house from the possession of the Temple treasury? <b>Let it</b> belong to the <b>Temple</b> treasury <b>in perpetuity</b> if it is not redeemed within one year. The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Throughout his generations.” Excluded,</b> therefore, is the <b>Temple</b> treasury, <b>as</b> it is not a person and it <b>does not have generations.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the phrase in the above verse: <b>“It shall not go out in the Jubilee”?</b> After all, it already stated: “In perpetuity.” <b>Rav Safra said:</b> This phrase <b>is necessary only for</b> the case of <b>one who sells a house among the houses of walled cities and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived during the year</b> of the sale. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the house <b>should leave</b> the possession of the buyer to enter the possession of its owner <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us: “It shall not go out in the Jubilee,”</b> to teach that this is not the case.
<strong>MISHNA</strong> <b>At first,</b> the buyer <b>would conceal himself</b> on the final <b>day of the twelve-month</b> period, <b>in order to</b> ensure <b>that it would become his in perpetuity. Hillel instituted that</b> the seller <b>would place [<i>ḥolesh</i>] his money in the chamber</b> of the court <b>and</b> that <b>he will break the door and enter</b> the house, and <b>when the other</b> individual, i.e., the buyer, <b>will wish</b> to do so, <b>he may come</b> to the chamber <b>and take his money.</b>
<strong>GEMARA</strong> <b>Rava says:</b> It may be inferred <b>from the ordinance of Hillel</b> in the mishna that if one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars, and she gave</b> the money to <b>him with his consent,</b> then she is <b>divorced.</b> But if she gave it to him <b>against his will, she is not divorced.</b>

Daf 32a

The Gemara elaborates: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> it <b>was necessary for Hillel to institute</b> that <b>giving against the will</b> of the receiver <b>is</b> considered <b>giving,</b> in the case of houses of walled cities, one may infer <b>that in general, giving against the will</b> of the recipient <b>is not</b> considered <b>giving.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Ashi</b> who objected: <b>But perhaps when it was necessary for Hillel to institute</b> this ordinance, it was specifically for a case <b>where</b> the seller gives the money <b>not in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the buyer; <b>but</b> if he repays the buyer <b>in his presence,</b> then <b>whether</b> the buyer was repaid <b>with his consent or whether</b> it was <b>against his will, it is</b> considered a valid act of <b>giving.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> an opposite version of this discussion, i.e., that <b>Rava says:</b> One may infer <b>from the ordinance of Hillel</b> that if one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars, and she gave</b> it <b>to him, whether</b> it was <b>with his consent or whether</b> it was <b>against his will, it is</b> a valid act of <b>giving. And</b> this is because <b>when it was necessary for Hillel to institute</b> this ordinance, it was specifically for a case <b>where</b> the seller gives the money <b>not in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the buyer. <b>But</b> if the seller repays him <b>in his presence, whether</b> the buyer was repaid <b>with his consent or whether</b> it was <b>against his will, it is</b> considered a valid act of <b>giving.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi</b> who objected: <b>But perhaps, whether</b> she gives him the money <b>in his presence or not in his presence,</b> if she gives it <b>with his consent, yes,</b> it is valid, but if she gives it <b>against his will,</b> it is <b>not</b> considered a valid act of giving. <b>And Hillel instituted what was necessary,</b> to remedy the practical occurrence that buyers would hide themselves at the end of the year. But even if the seller finds the buyer and the buyer refuses to accept payment, it would be necessary for Hillel to institute an ordinance.
<strong>MISHNA</strong> The halakhic status of <b>any</b> area <b>that is</b> located <b>within the</b> city <b>wall is like</b> that <b>of the houses of walled cities</b> in terms of its redemption, <b>except for the fields</b> located therein. <b>Rabbi Meir says: Even the fields</b> are included in this category. With regard to <b>a house that is built in the wall</b> itself, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Its halakhic status <b>is not like</b> that <b>of the houses of walled cities. Rabbi Shimon says: The outer wall</b> of the house <b>is</b> considered the city <b>wall,</b> and therefore it has the status of a house in a walled city.
<strong>GEMARA</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “Then the <b>house</b> that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it in perpetuity” (Leviticus 25:30). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a house; from where</b> is it derived <b>to include olive presses, bathhouses, towers, dovecotes, pits, ditches, and caves? The verse states: “That is in the</b> walled <b>city,”</b> indicating that anything situated within the city is included. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the fields</b> that are inside the city. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “House,”</b> which excludes a field; it does not resemble a house in any way, since it does not contain any items. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The verse states: <b>“House.” I have</b> derived <b>only a house; from where</b> is it derived <b>to include olive presses, bathhouses, towers, dovecotes, pits, ditches, and caves, and even fields? The verse states: “That is in the</b> walled <b>city,”</b> to include anything inside the city.
The Gemara questions the statement of Rabbi Meir: <b>But isn’t it written: “House”?</b> If Rabbi Meir includes even a field, what is excluded by the word “house”? <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Ketina said:</b> Actually, everyone agrees that the term “house” serves to exclude a field. The difference of opinion <b>between</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is with regard to <b>a quarry and a sand bed.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, such areas are considered similar to houses and are therefore included in the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara adds: <b>And it is</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a quarry and a sand bed</b> inside the walls of a city, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> They are considered <b>like houses,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> They are considered <b>like fields.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a house that is built in the wall</b> itself, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Its halakhic status <b>is not like</b> that <b>of the houses of walled cities,</b> and Rabbi Shimon says: The outer wall of the house is considered the city wall. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And both of them derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse: “Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the side of the wall; and she dwelt upon the wall”</b> (Joshua 2:15). <b>Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the last phrase should be understood <b>in accordance with the simple meaning of the verse,</b> that her house was attached to the outer wall and it was considered inside the walled city; <b>and Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>“she dwelt upon the wall”</b> means she was a resident of the wall itself, <b>but not</b> a resident <b>of the city</b> enclosed within the <b>wall.</b>
<strong>MISHNA</strong> The halakhic status of a house in <b>a city whose</b> houses are attached and their <b>rooftops</b> constitute the top of <b>its wall, and</b> likewise, the status of a house in a city <b>that is not surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun,</b> even if a surrounding wall was constructed during a later period, <b>is not like</b> that <b>of the houses of walled cities. And these are the houses of walled cities:</b> Any city in which there are at least <b>three courtyards,</b> each containing <b>two houses,</b> and which is <b>surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun, e.g., the ancient fort [<i>katzra</i>] of Tzippori, and the fortress [<i>ḥakra</i>] of Gush Ḥalav, and ancient Yodfat, and Gamla, and Gedod, and Ḥadid, and Ono, and Jerusalem, and likewise</b> other <b>similar</b> cities.
<strong>GEMARA</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that the halakhic status of a house in a city whose rooftops constitute the top of its wall is not like that of the houses of walled cities, <b>the Sages taught:</b> When the verse states: “The house that is in the city that has <b>a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), this is referring specifically to a city that has an actual wall <b>and not</b> merely <b>a wall of roofs.</b> When the next verse states: “But the houses of the villages that have no wall <b>round</b> about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country,” this serves to <b>exclude Tiberias</b> from being considered a walled city, <b>as the sea is its wall</b> on one side and it is not fully encircled by a physical wall.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Yosei says:</b> Since the verse states: <b>“Which has [</b><i>lo</i><b>] a wall,”</b> with <i>lo</i> written with an <i>alef</i>, according to which the verse may also be taken to mean: Which does not have a wall, this indicates that <b>even if</b> a city <b>does not have</b> a wall <b>now, but it had</b> a wall <b>before,</b> in the era of Joshua, son of Nun, it retains its status as a walled city.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And these are the houses of walled cities:</b> The ancient fort of Tzippori, and the fortress of Gush Ḥalav, and ancient Yodfat, and Gamla, and Gedod, and Ḥadid, and Ono, and Jerusalem, and likewise other similar cities. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Gamla</b> is <b>in the Galilee, and Gedod</b> is <b>in Transjordan, and Ḥadid and Ono and Jerusalem</b> are <b>in Judea.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>saying?</b> Are these the only walled cities in the Galilee, Transjordan, and Judea?

Daf 32b

<b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Until Gamla in the Galilee,</b> i.e., all towns in the Galilee from Gamla southward were surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun; <b>and</b> likewise, all towns <b>until Gedod in Transjordan,</b> which is the easternmost city, were surrounded by a wall; <b>and Ḥadid and Ono and Jerusalem in Judea</b> were surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun.
<b>Rava said</b> a different explanation: The <i>baraita</i> is elucidating the mishna, which mentions these cities. The <i>baraita</i> is teaching that the <b>Gamla</b> referred to in the mishna is the one <b>in the Galilee, to the exclusion of</b> any <b>Gamla</b> found <b>in other lands,</b> i.e., Judea and Transjordan. Likewise, <b>Gedod</b> is the one <b>in Transjordan, to the exclusion of Gedod in other lands,</b> Judea and the Galilee. In the same vein, Ḥadid, Ono, and Jerusalem are specifically the cities in Judea known by those names. With regard to <b>those other</b> cities mentioned in the mishna, e.g., Yodfat, <b>since there are no</b> cities in other lands <b>with similar</b> names, <b>it was not necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> to state them.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is ownership of a house in <b>Jerusalem</b> transferred in <b>perpetuity</b> to the buyer after one year, in the manner of houses of walled cities? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ten matters were stated with regard to Jerusalem,</b> one of which is that ownership of <b>a house</b> situated in Jerusalem is <b>not</b> transferred in <b>perpetuity</b> one year after its sale?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> means that ownership of a house may be transferred in perpetuity in any city that is <b>like Jerusalem,</b> i.e., <b>which is surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun, but</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to such a city is <b>not like Jerusalem</b> itself, <b>since while</b> with regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> ownership of <b>a house</b> inside it is <b>not</b> transferred in <b>perpetuity, here,</b> with regard to cities similar to Jerusalem, <b>a house in them</b> may be transferred in <b>perpetuity</b> to the buyer. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different answer: <b>Didn’t Rav Yosef say</b> in resolution of another difficulty: <b>There were two</b> places called <b>Kadesh? Here, too,</b> one can say that <b>there were two</b> places called <b>Jerusalem</b> in Judea, and the mishna is referring to the one where ownership of houses transfers in perpetuity.
§ With regard to the cities listed in the mishna, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> says: <b>Why did the Sages count</b> specifically <b>these</b> cities as those walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun? They counted them <b>because when the exiles ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia, <b>they discovered these</b> cities <b>and sanctified them; but</b> the sanctity of the <b>first</b> walled cities <b>was nullified when the sanctity of the land was nullified</b> and the Jewish people were exiled. The Gemara notes: Apparently, Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that the <b>initial consecration</b> of Eretz Yisrael in the days of Joshua <b>consecrated</b> it <b>for its time,</b> until the exile, <b>but did not consecrate</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>forever.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: And were these</b> cities enumerated in the mishna the <b>only</b> walled cities from the days of Joshua? <b>But isn’t it already stated:</b> “There was not a city that we took not from them; <b>sixty cities, all the region of Argob…all these cities were fortified with high walls,</b> gates, and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:4–5)? <b>Rather, why did the Sages</b> specifically <b>count these</b> cities? They counted them <b>because when the exiles ascended</b> from Babylonia <b>they discovered these and sanctified them.</b> The Gemara interjects: Can the <i>baraita</i> really mean that they <b>sanctified them? But we say</b> later in the same <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is not necessary to sanctify</b> them. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>they</b> found these cities and <b>counted them</b> in the mishna.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And not only these; rather,</b> with regard to <b>any</b> city for <b>which you receive a tradition from your ancestors that it is surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun, all these mitzvot</b> of walled cities <b>are observed in it, due to</b> the fact that the <b>initial consecration</b> of Eretz Yisrael <b>consecrated</b> it <b>for its time and consecrated</b> it <b>forever.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, holds that the initial consecration of Eretz Yisrael is eternal.
The Gemara responds: <b>If you wish, say</b> that this is a dispute between <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> son of Rabbi Yosei. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>one</b> of the <i>baraitot</i>, specifically the second one, was actually <b>said</b> by <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei says:</b> Since the verse states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall,”</b> with <i>lo</i> written with an <i>alef</i>, according to which the verse may also be taken to mean: Which does not have a wall, this indicates that <b>even if</b> a city <b>does not have</b> a wall <b>now, but it had</b> a wall <b>before,</b> in the era of Joshua, son of Nun, it retains its status as a walled city.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that the <b>initial consecration</b> of Eretz Yisrael <b>consecrated</b> it <b>for its time, but did not consecrate</b> it <b>forever? As</b> it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is written</b> with regard to the return from Babylonia: <b>“And all the congregation of those that were coming back out of the captivity made <i>sukkot</i>, and dwelt in <i>sukkot</i>, for since the days of Joshua, son of Nun,</b> unto that day <b>the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great joy”</b> (Nehemiah 8:17). Now, is it <b>possible</b> that King <b>David came and</b> the Jews in his time and all subsequent generations <b>did not make <i>sukkot</i>, until Ezra came?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> when the verse states: “For since the days of Joshua,” it means to <b>compare their arrival</b> in Eretz Yisrael <b>in the days of Ezra to their arrival in the days of Joshua: Just as</b> with regard to <b>their arrival in the days of Joshua, they counted Sabbatical</b> Years <b>and Jubilee</b> Years <b>and they sanctified walled cities, so too,</b> with regard to <b>their arrival in the days of Ezra, they counted Sabbatical</b> Years <b>and Jubilee</b> Years <b>and they sanctified walled cities.</b>
<b>And</b> so it <b>says</b> with regard to the return of the Jews from exile: <b>“And the Lord your God will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:5). The verse <b>compares your possession to the possession of your fathers: Just as the possession of your fathers</b> came <b>with the renewal of all these matters,</b> i.e., the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee Year, and <i>terumot</i> and tithes, <b>so too your possession</b> comes <b>with the renewal of all these matters,</b> as the initial consecration was nullified.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who maintains <b>the other</b> opinion, that the initial consecration of Eretz Yisrael is eternal, how does he interpret the verse in Nehemiah? The Gemara answers that when the verse states: “For since the days of Joshua,” this is not referring to actual <i>sukkot</i>; rather, the verse means <b>that</b> Ezra <b>prayed for mercy with regard to</b> the evil <b>inclination of idol worship and nullified it, and the merit</b> of his prayer <b>protected them like a <i>sukka</i>.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And this is</b> the reason <b>that the verse criticizes Joshua</b> for not praying for the removal of this inclination himself. How is this criticism indicated in the verse? <b>As in every</b> other <b>place</b> in the Bible, his name <b>is written</b> as: <b>Yehoshua, and here it is written: Yeshua.</b> The Gemara explains why the verse singles out Joshua for criticism: <b>Granted, Moses,</b> the first leader of the Jewish people, <b>did not pray for mercy</b> that this inclination should be removed, <b>as</b> at the time <b>there was no merit of Eretz Yisrael; but Joshua, who had the merit of Eretz Yisrael, why didn’t he pray for mercy</b> that this inclination should be nullified?
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to the opinion that the initial consecration was not nullified, <b>isn’t it written: “Which your fathers possessed and you shall possess it”?</b> This verse apparently indicates that it was necessary to sanctify Eretz Yisrael a second time. The Gemara answers: According to this opinion, <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: Since your fathers possessed</b> the land, <b>you</b> too <b>possess</b> it, and there is no need to sanctify it again.
The <i>baraita</i> cited earlier teaches that the Jews began counting the Jubilee Year upon their return from exile. The Gemara asks: <b>But did they count Sabbatical</b> Years <b>and Jubilee</b> Years in the days of Ezra? <b>Now,</b> if <b>from</b> the time <b>that the tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled</b> (see I Chronicles 5:26) the counting of <b>Jubilee</b> Years was <b>nullified,</b> despite the fact that a majority of Jews lived in Eretz Yisrael, then in the time of <b>Ezra,</b> about <b>which it is written: “The whole congregation together was 42,360”</b> (Ezra 2:64), <b>would</b> they have <b>counted</b> Jubilee Years?
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the time <b>that the tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled,</b> the counting of <b>Jubilee</b> Years was <b>nullified, as it is stated: “And you shall proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants;</b> it shall be a Jubilee for you” (Leviticus 25:10), indicating that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year apply only <b>when all its inhabitants are in</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>and not when some of them have been exiled.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that if all the Jews <b>were</b> living <b>in</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>but they are intermingled,</b> e.g., <b>the tribe of Benjamin</b> is living <b>in</b> the portion of the tribe of <b>Judah, and the tribe of Judah in</b> the portion of the tribe of <b>Benjamin,</b> that the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>should be in effect.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To all its inhabitants,”</b> which teaches that the Jubilee Year applies only <b>when its inhabitants</b> are living <b>according to their</b> proper <b>arrangment, and not when they are intermingled.</b> How, then, could those who returned from exile have counted the Jubilee Years?
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: They counted Jubilee</b> Years in order <b>to sanctify Sabbatical</b> Years. That is, at the end of every seven cycles of the Sabbatical Year they would count the fiftieth year as a Jubilee Year, so that the next Sabbatical cycle would begin in its proper time, in the fifty-first year. Nevertheless, the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year were not in effect.

Daf 33a

The Gemara objects: <b>This works out well according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that the <b>fiftieth year is not</b> included <b>in the counting</b> of the cycle of Sabbatical Years. It was therefore necessary to count the Jubilee Year. <b>But according to Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that the <b>fiftieth year is counted for here and for there,</b> i.e., it is both the fiftieth year of the previous cycle and the first year of the subsequent cycle, <b>why do I</b> need for them to count the Jubilee Years? If the Jubilee Year is not in effect, then it is <b>enough to</b> count the <b>Sabbatical</b> Years. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is certainly not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And did they not count Sabbatical</b> Years <b>and Jubilee</b> Years once the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled? <b>But isn’t it written</b> that Jeremiah, who lived many years later, said: <b>“At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that has been sold unto you,</b> and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you; but your fathers did not listen unto Me, nor inclined their ear” (Jeremiah 34:14)?
The Gemara continues: <b>And we discussed this</b> verse: Why does it state: <b>“At the end of seven years</b> you shall let go every man”? <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And has served you six years”? And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The verse is referring to two separate individuals. The phrase “and has served you <b>six</b> years” is referring <b>to</b> a typical Hebrew slave who <b>was sold,</b> who goes free after six years (see Exodus 21:2), <b>and</b> the phrase “at the end of <b>seven</b> years” is referring <b>to</b> a slave whose ear <b>was pierced</b> with an awl to extend his tenure. Such an individual remains a slave until the Jubilee Year, even if that is the following year, i.e., the end of the seventh year. If so, the verse indicates that the Jubilee Year was in effect in the times of Jeremiah, even though the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled.
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse was not stated by Jeremiah in the form of a command; rather, it <b>is written in</b> the form of <b>reproof.</b> That is, the <b>prophet</b> Jeremiah is <b>saying</b> to the Jewish people: <b>Did you send</b> free the pierced slaves when the Jubilee Year was observed? The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> there: <b>“And they listened and let them go”</b> (Jeremiah 34:10)? Evidently, the entire passage is referring to matters occurring in the present.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Indeed, the Jubilee Year was not in effect once the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled. But <b>Jeremiah brought back</b> all the exiled tribes, <b>and Josiah, son of Amon, ruled over them. And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Jeremiah <b>brought them back? As it is written: “For the seller shall not return to that which he has sold”</b> (Ezekiel 7:13). Ezekiel prophesied that there will come a time when fields will not be returned to the owners in the Jubilee Year. Now, is it <b>possible</b> that the <b>Jubilee</b> Year had already been <b>nullified and</b> yet <b>the prophet is prophesying that it will be annulled</b> in the future? <b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that Jeremiah brought back</b> the exiled tribes.
<b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>Josiah ruled over</b> all <b>the</b> ten tribes exiled by Assyria? <b>As it is written:</b> “And as Josiah turned himself, then he spied the sepulchres…<b>then he said: What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him: It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed</b> these <b>things</b> that you have done <b>against the altar of Bethel”</b> (II Kings 23:16–17).
<b>Now, what connection does Josiah,</b> king of Judah, <b>have with the altar at Bethel,</b> a city in the kingdom of Israel? <b>Rather,</b> this indicates that <b>when Jeremiah brought back</b> the ten tribes, <b>Josiah ruled over them. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The fact that the tribes returned may be derived <b>from here: “Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I would return the captivity of My people”</b> (Hosea 6:11). That is, when the ten tribes will return from their captivity, a king of Judah will rule over them.
<strong>MISHNA</strong> With regard to the <b>houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards</b> mentioned in the Torah (see Leviticus 25:31), i.e., houses in villages that are not surrounded by walls, <b>one accords them the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to houses of walled cities and the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to fields.</b> Therefore, <b>they are redeemed immediately and</b> for <b>the entire twelve months</b> following the sale, <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> sale of <b>houses</b> of walled cities, and not like fields, which may be redeemed only after two years. <b>And they leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>during the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with</b> a per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price, <b>like the</b> sale of <b>fields.</b> By contrast, houses of walled cities become the possession of the buyer in perpetuity after one year, and if they are redeemed within the year, one pays the full sale price.
<strong>GEMARA</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “But the houses of the courtyards that have no wall round about them <b>shall be reckoned with the fields of the country;</b> they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:31). <b>The verse juxtaposed</b> houses of unwalled courtyards <b>to an ancestral field: Just as an ancestral field leaves</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with</b> a per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price, <b>so too, houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with the</b> per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> one derives the <i>halakha</i> from an ancestral field, then <b>just as an ancestral field may not be redeemed less than two years</b> after its sale, <b>so too, houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards may not be redeemed less than two years</b> after their sale. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “They may be redeemed,”</b> indicating that they may be redeemed <b>immediately.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Since you have accorded</b> houses of the unwalled courtyards <b>the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to fields and the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to the houses</b> of walled cities, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they do not leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And they shall go out in the Jubilee.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying</b> in the last clause, i.e., why might one think that such houses do not leave the possession of the buyer in the Jubilee Year? After all, ancestral fields leave the possession of the buyer in the Jubilee Year, and the <i>tanna</i> teaches that the exceptional provisions of an ancestral field apply to houses in unwalled courtyards. <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The verse <b>is necessary only for</b> the case of <b>one who consecrates a house among the houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards, and another redeemed it from the possession of</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury, <b>and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived in</b> the <b>second year</b> after its redemption.
Rav Huna elaborates: <b>To what will you compare</b> this case? <b>If you compare</b> this house <b>to houses of walled cities</b> that were consecrated and redeemed by another, then the house belongs <b>to the buyer in perpetuity</b> by the end of the first year (see 31b). <b>If you compare</b> it <b>to an ancestral field</b> that was consecrated and redeemed by another, <b>it leaves to</b> the possession of <b>the priests</b> in the Jubilee Year (see 25a). <b>For this</b> reason it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“And they shall go out in the Jubilee,”</b> to teach that houses in unwalled courtyards which were consecrated and redeemed by another are returned to their owners in the Jubilee Year.
<b>Rav Zeira objects to this: Why</b> is it necessary to interpret this verse as referring <b>specifically</b> to a case where <b>another redeemed</b> the house from the Temple treasury? <b>Even</b> if another <b>did not redeem it,</b> the house should <b>also</b> be returned to its owner in the Jubilee Year, as the verse states simply: “And they shall go out in the Jubilee.” <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Zeira: An unredeemed house is not returned to its owners in the Jubilee Year, so <b>that</b> people <b>will not say</b> that <b>consecrated</b> property can <b>leave</b> the possession of the Temple treasury <b>without redemption.</b>
The Gemara adds: And <b>from where do we</b> derive that consecrated property does not leave the possession of the Temple treasury without redemption? We derive it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a Levite:</b> And <b>what,</b> if with regard to <b>a Levite, whose power is enhanced with regard to his sale,</b> as a Levite may always redeem a field or house that he sold (see mishna in 33b), <b>his power is diminished with regard to his consecration,</b> as a field that he consecrated does not leave the possession of the Temple treasury until he redeems it; then with regard to <b>an Israelite, whose power is diminished with regard to his sale,</b> since if he sells an ancestral field he may not redeem it for the first two years, and he may redeem a house of a walled city only within one year of the sale, <b>is it not logical that his power is diminished with regard to his consecration</b> and that if he consecrated a house of an unwalled courtyard he must redeem it from the Temple treasury before it enters his possession?
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to a Levite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that his consecrated property does not leave the possession of the Temple treasury without redemption? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if a man purchases from the Levites, the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out during the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:33). From the phrase <b>“that was sold…shall go out” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that any item sold by a Levite returns to him in the Jubilee Year, <b>even his slaves, movable property, and promissory notes.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “House…in the city of his possession,”</b> which teaches that these items do not return to the Levite without redemption.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “That was sold”?</b> The verse teaches that a house or field <b>that was sold</b> by a Levite <b>leaves</b> the possession of the buyer and enters the Levite’s possession <b>for free in the Jubilee Year, but the consecration</b> of a Levite <b>does not leave for free in the Jubilee Year; rather,</b> it leaves only <b>with redemption.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> Rav Huna, who says that a house in an unwalled courtyard that was consecrated and subsequently redeemed by another returns to the original owner in the Jubilee Year, <b>disagrees with Rabbi Oshaya. As Rabbi Oshaya says: All</b> items <b>were included in</b> the command: <b>And he will give the money and it will be assured to him</b> (see Leviticus 27:19), i.e., one who redeems an item from the Temple treasury becomes its owner in all regards.
<b>When the verse specified with regard to an ancestral field: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord,</b> as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), one derives that <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a field that</b> one can <b>redeem it and</b> yet <b>it leaves</b> the possession of the Temple treasury to enter the possession of <b>the priests</b> in the Jubilee Year. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>these</b> houses in unwalled courtyards that were consecrated and redeemed by another, <b>they remain in their current state,</b> i.e., in the possession of the one who redeemed them.
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Oshaya, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“and they shall go out in the Jubilee”? Rav Pappa said: It is necessary only for</b> the case of <b>one who sells a house among the houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived in</b> the <b>second year.</b> The verse indicates that the house is nevertheless returned to the seller.
Rav Pappa elaborates: <b>To what will you compare</b> this case? <b>If you compare</b> this case <b>to</b> one of the <b>houses of walled cities</b> that was sold, then the house belongs <b>to the buyer in perpetuity</b> at the end of the first year. And <b>if you compare it to</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field</b> that was sold, then <b>it requires completion</b> of another year after the Jubilee Year, as taught in a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier (29b): If the buyer consumed an ancestral field’s produce for one year before the Jubilee Year, he completes another year after the Jubilee Year. <b>For this</b> reason <b>it was necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“And they shall go out in the Jubilee,”</b> to teach that in such a case the house of an unwalled courtyard returns to the possession of the original owner.
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna, and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates a house among the houses of</b> unwalled <b>courtyards, this</b> individual <b>may redeem</b> the house <b>immediately and he may redeem it always.</b> If <b>another</b> individual <b>redeemed it from the possession of the Temple</b> treasury, and the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived and it was not redeemed</b> by the original owner, the house <b>returns to the owner in the Jubilee</b> Year.

Daf 33b

<strong>MISHNA</strong> <b>And these are the houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards</b> whose <i>halakha</i> was taught in the previous mishna: Any city in which there are <b>two courtyards</b> each containing <b>two houses, although it is surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun, their</b> halakhic status <b>is like that of the houses of</b> the unwalled <b>courtyards.</b>
<strong>GEMARA</strong> <b> The Sages taught: By inference from</b> that <b>which is stated: “The houses of the courtyards”</b> (Leviticus 25:31), <b>do I not know that they have no wall</b> around them? If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Which have no wall”?</b> It means that there are certain places that <b>even though they have a wall,</b> they are considered <b>like</b> places <b>that do not have a wall. And how many,</b> i.e., what is considered such a place? The term <b>“houses”</b> indicates a minimum of <b>two,</b> and the term <b>“courtyards”</b> likewise indicates a minimum of <b>two.</b> Therefore, if a city has only <b>two courtyards</b> each containing <b>two houses,</b> its houses are considered like the houses of the unwalled courtyards.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that the phrase: Houses of the courtyards, means one <b>house and</b> one <b>courtyard,</b> i.e., one house in each courtyard. Consequently, if each courtyard contains two houses, the city should be considered like a walled city. The Gemara explains: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write: “Courtyards,”</b> without mentioning houses, as a courtyard must contain at least one house. <b>And if you would say: If the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Courtyards,”</b> then one might mistakenly have concluded that the verse <b>indicates a courtyard without a house</b> and that if the courtyard contains a house then the city is considered walled, one could not have arrived at that conclusion, since <b>such</b> an area <b>is called an enclosure [<i>karpef</i> ],</b> not a courtyard.
<strong>MISHNA</strong> <b>An Israelite who inherited</b> a house in a walled city from <b>his mother’s father</b> who was <b>a Levite does not redeem</b> the house <b>in accordance with this procedure</b> delineated in the previous <i>mishnayot</i>; rather, if he sold the inherited house, he may redeem it always, like a Levite. <b>And likewise, a Levite who inherited</b> a house in a walled city from <b>his mother’s father</b> who was <b>an Israelite does not redeem</b> the house <b>in accordance with this procedure</b> delineated in the previous <i>mishnayot</i>.
The mishna provides the source for these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>As it is stated:</b> “And if a man purchases from the Levites, the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out during the Jubilee Year; <b>as the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession</b> among the children of Israel” (Leviticus 25:33). The verse indicates that the ability to always redeem the house of a Levite does not apply <b>unless</b> the one selling the house <b>will be a Levite and</b> the house is located in <b>the cities of the Levites.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: These matters are stated only</b> with regard to a house <b>in the cities of the Levites,</b> even if the owner was not a Levite.
<strong>GEMARA</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, if an Israelite sold a house in a walled city that he inherited from his mother’s father who was a Levite, he does not redeem it in accordance with the procedure delineated in the previous <i>mishnayot</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, like whom</b> does he redeem it? He redeems it <b>like a Levite. But</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>then teaches</b> that the ability to always redeem the house of a Levite does not apply <b>unless</b> the one selling the house <b>will be a Levite and</b> the house is located in <b>the cities of the Levites.</b> If so, an Israelite who inherited a house in a walled city from his mother’s father who is a Levite should redeem it in the manner of an Israelite.
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the mishna means that an Israelite who inherited a house in a walled city from his mother’s father who was a Levite <b>redeems</b> that house <b>only in accordance with this procedure</b> delineated in the previous <i>mishnayot</i>, i.e., he has only one year to redeem it, after which the house becomes the possession of the buyer in perpetuity. And this is always the <i>halakha</i> <b>unless</b> the one selling the house <b>will be a Levite and</b> the house is located <b>in the cities of the Levites,</b> in which case he can always redeem it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the house must be from <b>the cities of the Levites, as it is written: “As the houses of the cities of the Levites</b> are their possession” (Leviticus 25:33). <b>But from where do we</b> derive that the one selling the house must also be <b>a Levite</b> for these <i>halakhot</i> to apply? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And if a man purchases from the Levites</b>…shall go out during the Jubilee Year.” The verse is referring specifically to a Levite who sells his house.
The Gemara adds that <b>it is</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Given that the verse already states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:32), why does the next verse state: <b>“And if a man purchases from the Levites</b>…shall go out during the Jubilee Year”?It is because one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>A Levite may</b> always <b>redeem from an Israelite</b> the house that he sold, <b>as this</b> Levite’s <b>power was enhanced,</b> in that he can redeem always, <b>and that</b> Israelite’s <b>power was diminished,</b> as he may redeem only within one year. <b>But a Levite may not</b> always redeem <b>from</b> another <b>Levite, as this</b> one’s <b>power was enhanced and that</b> one’s <b>power was</b> equally <b>enhanced.</b> Rather, the Levite may redeem only within one year of the sale. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man purchases <b>from the Levites,”</b> which literally means: And if a man redeems from the Levites, which teaches that even a Levite who redeems a house purchased by another Levite can always redeem the house.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: When the verse states: <b>“From the Levites,”</b> this teaches that some Levites may always redeem their houses, <b>but not all the Levites. Excluded is a Levite</b> who is <b>a son born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzer</i>], or a Gibeonite,</b> i.e., his mother is from the Gibeonites, as these are disqualified from entering the congregation of the Jewish people (see <i>Yevamot</i> 78a). If such a Levite inherited from his father and sold a house from the cities of the Levites, he does not redeem it as a Levite.
The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say: These matters are stated only</b> with regard to a house <b>in the cities of the Levites,</b> even if the owner was not a Levite. The Gemara explains: <b>But</b> according to the Rabbis, <b>we do not say</b> that the ability to always redeem the house of a Levite does not apply <b>unless</b> the one selling the house <b>will be a Levite.</b> Rather, the Rabbis hold that anyone who inherits a portion in a Levite city may redeem that portion as a Levite, even if he himself is not a Levite.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Levites received two thousand cubits surrounding their cities, one thousand cubits of empty lots and one thousand cubits for fields and vineyards. <b>One may neither render a field</b> an empty <b>lot nor</b> an empty <b>lot a field.</b> Similarly, one may neither incorporate an empty <b>lot</b> into <b>a city nor</b> render part of <b>a city</b> an empty <b>lot.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It applies <b>in the cities of the Levites. But in the cities of the Israelites one may render a field</b> an empty <b>lot but not</b> an empty <b>lot a field,</b> and one may incorporate an empty <b>lot</b> into <b>a city but not</b> render part of <b>a city</b> an empty <b>lot,</b> in order to ensure <b>that they will not</b> thereby <b>destroy the cities of Israel. The priests and the Levites may sell</b> their fields and houses <b>always and may redeem</b> them <b>always, as it is stated: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32). Priests are also members of the tribe of Levi.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>in the cities of the Levites. But in the cities of the Israelites</b> one may render a field an empty lot but not an empty lot a field, and one may incorporate an empty lot into a city but not render part of a city an empty lot, in order to ensure that they will not thereby destroy the cities of Israel. The Gemara asks: <b>In any event, everyone</b> agrees that <b>in</b> the cities <b>of the Levites one may not change</b> a field into an empty lot or an empty lot into a city. <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: As the verse states: “But the fields of the open land about their cities may not be sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:34). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“may not be sold”? If we say</b> it means that such fields <b>may not be sold at all,</b> that cannot be correct, as <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32), one learns <b>by inference that</b> their fields <b>may be sold. Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“may not be sold”?</b> It means that a field, an empty lot, or a city <b>may not be changed</b> from its current status.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The priests and the Levites may sell</b> their fields and houses <b>always and may redeem</b> them <b>always.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32)? <b>Since it is stated</b> with regard to the ancestral field of an Israelite: <b>“According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15), from which it is derived that one cannot redeem an ancestral field less than two years after its sale, one <b>might</b> have thought that this should <b>also</b> be <b>so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> Levite who sold his field. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption,”</b> which teaches that a Levite may redeem his field immediately.
Furthermore, <b>since it is stated: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord,</b> as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), one <b>might</b> have thought that this should <b>also</b> be <b>so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> Levite who consecrated his field. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption,”</b> which teaches that the field of a Levite is not transferred to the possession of the priests in the Jubilee Year; rather, the Levite may always redeem it from the Temple treasury.
Additionally, <b>since it is stated:</b> “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him, <b>then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession</b> of the one who bought it <b>in perpetuity”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), one <b>might</b> have thought that this should <b>also</b> be <b>so</b> with regard to <b>this</b> Levite who sold his house in a walled city. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption,”</b> indicating that the Levite may always redeem his house.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>these</b> first <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, which deal with the field of a Levite, <b>it is well. But</b> with regard to the last <i>halakha</i>, why is it necessary for the verse to exclude the houses of Levites? <b>Do Levites have houses of walled cities? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>these cities</b> given to the Levites, <b>one does not establish them, neither</b> in <b>small villages nor</b> in <b>large cities; rather,</b> they must be <b>intermediate towns,</b> which are not surrounded by walls.
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that the cities of the Levites were not surrounded by walls is referring to a city <b>that was</b> initially <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and was ultimately settled. There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that Levites do have houses of walled cities is referring to an intermediate town <b>that was</b> first <b>settled</b> by the Levites <b>and was ultimately surrounded</b> by a wall in the times of Joshua.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>a case like this,</b> where the city was first settled and only then surrounded by a wall, <b>is it</b> considered <b>a wall</b> to the extent that the houses inside the city are considered in a walled city? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). This is referring to a city <b>that was</b> initially <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and was ultimately settled, and not</b> to a city <b>that was</b> first <b>settled and was ultimately surrounded</b> by a wall.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that it is considered a walled city <b>even</b> if <b>Jews surrounded it</b> with a wall and only then built houses inside it. Therefore, <b>it is stated here:</b> “And if a man sells a dwelling house in <b>a walled</b> city,” <b>and it is stated below,</b> with regard to the conquest of the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan: “All these were fortified cities, with high <b>walls,</b> gates, and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:5). <b>Just as below,</b> the verse is referring to cities whose surrounding walls were constructed by <b>gentiles, so too here,</b> the verse is referring only to cities whose walls were constructed by <b>gentiles.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>gentiles surrounded</b> the city with a wall <b>after</b> the conquest of Eretz Yisrael, it should be considered a walled city. Therefore, <b>it is stated below,</b> with regard to the conquest of the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, <b>“walls,”</b> and <b>it is stated here “walled.” Just as below,</b> the surrounding walls of the cities were constructed by <b>gentiles before</b> the Jews conquered the land, <b>so too here,</b> the verse is referring to cities whose walls were constructed by <b>gentiles before</b> the conquest of Eretz Yisrael. This <i>baraita</i> apparently contradicts the resolution suggested by Rav Kahana, as a city that was first settled and only then surrounded by a wall is not included in the <i>halakhot</i> of houses in walled cities.
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Sala Ḥasida, interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Pappa:</b> Actually, the first <i>baraita</i> is referring to a city that was initially surrounded by a wall and then settled by Levites. And as for the <i>baraita</i> that teaches that Levite cities may not be surrounded by a wall, it is nevertheless possible that a Levite city was initially surrounded by a wall in a case <b>where,</b> when Eretz Yisrael was divided among the tribes of Israel, walled cities <b>fell</b> by lottery <b>to</b> the Levites,

Daf 34a

both <b>they and their</b> empty <b>lots.</b> The Gemara objects: But <b>they and their lots stand to be dismantled,</b> as a city of the Levites may not be surrounded by a wall. How, then, can such a city be considered surrounded by a wall? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Nevertheless, it <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach that if a Levite sells a house in such a city he may always redeem it, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: When</b> the walls <b>are dismantled,</b> then they are <b>dismantled,</b> but as long as they remain standing, <b>if</b> houses in the city <b>are sold</b> and are not redeemed within one year, <b>let them</b> belong to the buyer <b>in perpetuity,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of houses of walled cities. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states, with regard to one who consecrated his ancestral field but failed to redeem it before the Jubilee Year: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, <b>as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “As a field dedicated”? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a priest who consecrated his dedicated field,</b> i.e., a field that was dedicated to the priests by an Israelite, and the Jubilee Year arrived, <b>that he may not say: Since</b> a field that was consecrated by its owners and was not redeemed <b>leaves to</b> the possession of <b>the priests</b> in the Jubilee Year, <b>and this</b> field that I consecrated <b>is</b> already <b>in my possession, it is</b> therefore <b>mine.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> despite the fact that the claim of the priest <b>is</b> based on <b>logical inference:</b> If <b>I acquire</b> the fields <b>of others</b> that were consecrated and not redeemed before the Jubilee Year, then with regard to <b>my own</b> property, should I <b>not all the more so</b> acquire it? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “As a field dedicated, his ancestral field shall be for the priest,”</b> which teaches that this is not the case.
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>But what</b> have <b>we learned</b> about a consecrated ancestral field <b>from a dedicated field from now?</b> The Torah does not explicitly state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to dedicated fields. Rather, <b>this</b> case of a dedicated field <b>came to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to an ancestral field, <b>and it turns out</b> that in addition <b>it derives</b> a <i>halakha</i> from that case, i.e., the verse <b>juxtaposes the dedicated field</b> of a priest <b>to the ancestral field of an Israelite: Just as the ancestral field of an Israelite</b> that was redeemed by a priest from the Temple treasury <b>leaves from his possession</b> at the arrival of the Jubilee Year <b>and is divided among</b> all <b>the priests</b> (see 25a), <b>so too, the dedicated field</b> of a priest that he consecrated <b>leaves from his possession and is divided among his brothers, the priests,</b> at the beginning of the Jubilee Year.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> And this claim of the priest is based on logical inference: If <b>I acquire</b> the fields <b>of others</b> that were consecrated, then with regard to my own property, should I not acquire it all the more so? The Gemara asks: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable? There,</b> with regard to an ancestral field that was consecrated and leaves to the possession of the priests, he <b>merely acquires</b> it as one of the priests, whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to a dedicated field that he consecrated, <b>he</b> seeks to <b>take</b> the entire field for himself. If so, there is no need for the verse to teach that the priest may not do so.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> Nevertheless, the verse <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his”</b> (Numbers 5:10), from which it is derived that a priest who brings an offering may sacrifice it and take for himself those portions intended for the priests and he is not required to give them to the members of the current priestly watch, perhaps <b>this too,</b> i.e., his dedicated field that he consecrated, <b>is considered like his hallowed things,</b> and he may take it for himself. Therefore, the verse serves to indicate that this is not the case.
The Gemara asks: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable? His hallowed things,</b> i.e., offerings brought by the priest, <b>are not in his possession;</b> rather, the priest receives the priestly portions from the table of the Most High, in exchange for performing the sacrificial rites. <b>Here,</b> the priest seeks to return the field to <b>his possession.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> The verse <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written</b> with regard to the fields of Levites and priests: <b>“For that is their perpetual possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:34), from which it is derived that if a priest consecrated his ancestral field he may always redeem it, so too <b>this</b> dedicated field received by the priest <b>is also</b> considered <b>his ancestral</b> field, and if he consecrated it he may always redeem it. The juxtaposition of the dedicated field of a priest to the ancestral field of an Israelite <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>, as the verse states: <b>“His ancestral field</b> shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:31). The verse teaches that with regard to the <b>ancestral field</b> of a priest that he inherited from his father, <b>yes,</b> it remains in the possession of that priest in perpetuity, but with regard to <b>his dedicated</b> field, it does <b>not</b> remain in his possession in perpetuity; rather, it is divided among the members of the priestly watch serving at the beginning of the Jubilee Year.
We will return to you, “One who sold his field”...
